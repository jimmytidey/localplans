NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: INTRODUCTIONThis document is 
the first draft of our new Local Plan for Newham. It is another important milestone in the development of Newham’s new Local Plan which will address the new challenges we face 
as well as helping us deliver the ambitious Building a Fairer Newham vision that we have for our borough as a place: 
• 
 Deliv
ering genuinely affordable housing our people 
can afford, including pushing private developers to 
offer more housing our people actually need; 
 
• 
 T
ackling the Climate Emergency to meet our 2030 
carbon neutral and 2045 carbon zero plans;
 •
 
 Impr
oving the quality of the air that our children 
and residents breathe;  
 •
 
 Enabling mor
e and more sustainable transport 
options so that our streets are people friendly for our children and young people, women and girls, parents / carers who are needing to push prams, 
 our el
derly and those with special educational 
  
 needs or visua
l impairments or who use wheelchairs 
 
 t
o get around; MAYOR’S FOREWORD
Rokhsana Fiaz OBE Mayor of Newham
 @rokhsanafiaz •  Buil ding an inclusive economy to tackle poverty 
and inequality, and increase inward investment that leads to sustainable jobs; 
 •
 
 Ensuring our bor
ough supports the potential of our 
young people, enabling them to thrive and succeed; 
 •
 
 Cr
eating 15-minute neighbourhoods that are well 
designed and safe; with more green spaces across the borough to promote health and wellbeing; 
 •
  Respec
ting the diversity of our people and the 
richness of Newham as an inclusive community which respects all the ethnicities, cultures and faiths; 
 •
 
 A bor
ough that is confident about its future and its 
people, future-proofing Newham for the impact data and technology will have on our lives.
This new Local Plan process started in December 2018, when I announced that the borough would commence an early review of its current Local Plan. Following the adoption of the new London Plan in early 2021, we were able to then accelerate the process and in October last year, Cabinet endorsed the Issues and Options document as the basis for detailed dialogue and engagement with residents and local stakeholder partners. Through that process we heard from many Newham residents about their hopes and aspirations for the future of Newham and what they want to see embedded in a new Local Plan.  These ideas and ambitions, together with detailed evidence base documents – which have also had extensive resident input – have fed into the development of this Draft Local Plan. This document contains the vision, objectives, spatial strategy and planning policy framework which we consider will best address the challenges and make the most of opportunities which face Newham now, and in the future. 
However it is still a work in progress and the Plan 
will continue to evolve after, and as a result of, this next stage of consultation. To ensure it delivers for Newham and in keeping with my manifesto commitment to create a people powered Newham and widening participation in everything the Council does, I urge residents and stakeholders to input into this important document which will shape the future of Newham over the next 15 years.6
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: INTRODUCTIONALL ABOUT THE LOCAL PLAN 
What is a Local Plan?
i.1 The Local Plan is the key planning document 
which we will use to shape, plan and manage growth, regeneration and development across the borough over a 15-year period from 2023 - 2038. 
i.2 The new Local Plan sets out a vision, objectives, 
spatial strategy and planning policy framework. We will use it to assess planning applications and guide our decisions on: 
• 
 the l
ocation, amount and type of development 
in the borough
• 
 the st
andards that development should meet
• 
 wha
t it should look like 
• 
 wha
t services and infrastructure are needed and 
where
• 
 ho
w all residents will benefit from the growth 
and development
i.3 However, there are limitations on what can be controlled through the Local Plan. For example, some forms of development do not require planning permission, such as some changes to the use of a building or some alterations to a house. The planning system cannot specify who or which business occupies a development. Planning also operates alongside other types of regulation, such as licencing and environmental health legislation. What is this document?
i.4 This document is the first draft of our new Local Plan for Newham. It contains the vision, objectives, spatial strategy and planning policy framework which we consider will best address the challenges and make the most of opportunities which face Newham now, and in the future. 
i.5 The draft Local Plan has been informed by the 
responses we received on our Issues and Options document, during the consultation at the end of 2021. It has also been informed by evidence base documents which have been researching specific aspects of the Plan and emerging council and regional strategies and area specific guidance – including for Stratford and the Royal Docks. 
i.6 This document looks and reads like a new Local 
Plan but it is still a work in progress. We welcome your comments and ideas on how it can be improved to best create a happy, healthy and well Newham for all. 
How to be part of the discussion
Comments are welcome on this document, following its publication after the formal Cabinet decision is made in December 2022. 
The formal consultation will commence on the 9th 
January 2023 and end on the 20th February 2023.Why do we need a Local Plan? Why refresh it? 
i.7 Over the last years we have all experienced disruption and uncertainty and many residents are currently facing increased hardships as a result of the cost of living crisis.  We need a new Local Plan to ensure that our planning policies reflect our current needs, for homes, workspaces and community facilities and addresses challenges, including those exposed by the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Newham, as well as making the most of our opportunities. These include the land owned by the Council and the Mayor of London, being home to London’s only Enterprise Zone, the new transport infrastructure in the borough and the youth and dynamism of our population and economy. All of which we can used to build a fairer Newham for all.    
i.8 Finally, part of Newham currently falls within 
the boundary of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) Planning Authority. In this part of the borough the LLDC develops planning policy and makes decision on planning applications. The LLDC’s planning powers are due to be handed back to Host Boroughs by the end of 2024. We are working with the LLDC, Mayor of London and other Host Boroughs to plan proactively in advance of this transition, so that a Plan which covers the whole borough is ready at the point of transition. This draft Local Plan therefore covers the entirety of Newham.  7
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: INTRODUCTIONWhat is its relationship 
to other plans? 
i.9 The Local Plan must take into account the policies set out by national government in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the policies set out by London’s regional government in the London Plan (2021). This means we are required to follow their policy directions unless we have sufficient local evidence to demonstrate a different approach is required.
i.10 Newham currently has no designated 
Neighbourhood Forums or Areas, but if they were to be established in the future, any Neighbourhood Plan they were to create would have to be in accordance with policies in Newham’s Local Plan and the London Plan (2021).
i.11 The Mayor of London is developing the Royal 
Docks and Beckton Opportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF) and it will soon be published as London Plan Guidance. This means it provides additional guidance on how the London Plan (2021) should be interpreted and delivered in this part of the borough. We have also used the OAPF to help inform parts of the draft Local Plan.
i.12 In May 2022, the Government published the 
Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill which is the Government’s implementation of the ‘Planning for the Future’ White Paper published in 2020. The Bill includes noteworthy changes to the planning system, including national development management policies, 
National Planning 
Policy Framework
London Plan
Newham Local Plan
Neighbourhood Plans Newham 
StratagiesRoyal Docks and Beckton 
Opportunity Area 
Planning Frameworka change in how infrastructure and affordable housing are secured, increased protection for heritage assets and a greater role for design codes.  Further detail is still required to provide the implementation guidance and timeframes for the changes it contains and it is also unclear if the new Government intends to proceed with the proposed changes, so the Council is continuing to develop our Local Plan in accordance with the current guidance on Local Plans. However, we will also be developing the evidence base we need to progress to the different style of, and elements in a, Local Plan proposed by the Bill.i.13 At the heart of the Local Plan refresh are the delivery of the Council’s core strategies. These include:
• 
    
Building a Fairer Newham: Corporate Plan 
  2022-2026 • Building Newham’s Creative Future • 
 T
owards a Better Newham: COVID-19 Recovery 
and Reorientation Strategy
• Climate Emergency Action Plan• 
 T
ackling Racism, Inequality and 
Disproportionality
• 50 steps to a Healthier Newham8
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: INTRODUCTIONWhat other information has 
informed the Local Plan?
Engagementi.14 There are four consultations on the Local Plan, of which this is the second. At each stage residents, businesses and other stakeholders will be able to tell us what they think the Plan should include, whether we have got the priorities right, whether the Plan is clear enough and if anything is missing. However, the role and focus of the consultation changes at each stage.
i.15 Responses at this stage should focus on whether 
the spatial strategy, site allocations and policies in the draft Plan meet Newham’s needs and objectives.The responses we received on the first consultation and how the draft Plan has responded to these comments is included in the Engagement Report, published alongside this document.
i.16 The responses you provide on this document will 
be analysed and fed into the next version of the Plan and a further engagement report will be produced so you can see how we have responded to each bit of feedback. 
Evidence basei.17 To make sure we have an as good as possible understanding of what we need to build and protect, what we already have in the borough and what the market trends are, we have commissioned and developed a series of evidence base documents. These documents use and analyse quantitative and qualitative data, site visits and expert input to provide us with this information.
i.18 During the production of the draft Local Plan, 
some of 2021 Census demographic data has been released but this data was not available when the evidence base documents were being developed. The Local Plan team will continue to analyse the data released from the 2021 Census to inform the Local Plan as it develops. Growth projections in the draft Local Plan and supporting evidence base documents have been informed by the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) Housing-led population projections which is informed by the London Plan (2021) housing target. 
i.19 The following evidence base documents have 
been or are being produced. Those which have been completed are published alongside this Local Plan. Evidence base documents which are still being developed will be published alongside the next draft Local Plan. 
i.20 We would also very much welcome your 
comments on these documents.  9

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: INTRODUCTIONAppraisals
i.21 As we develop the Local Plan, we are continuously 
assessing it to check how it, and possible alternative options, may impact existing social, economic and environmental factors within Newham. The Plan should be reducing and mitigating any potential negative effects in relation to these factors and seeking ways to deliver improvements and benefits. This assessment is contained within the Sustainability Appraisal. 
i.22 During the last consultation we also sought 
comments on the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report which outlines what we consider to be the main social, economic and environmental factors within Newham and the appraisal framework we will use to assess the Plan.  Comments received have been considered and updates have been made to the appraisal framework. Alongside the Sustainability Appraisal an Equalities Impact Assessment, a Health Impact Assessment and a Habitats Regulation Assessment have also been produced and published. 
i.23 An Equalities Impact Assessment (EQIA) is a 
way of measuring the potential impact (positive or negative) that the Local Plan may have on different groups protected by equalities legislation so that any such impact can be addressed and mitigated.
i.24 A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a systematic 
approach to predicting the potential health and wellbeing impacts of the Local Plan. An HIA identifies actions that can enhance positive effects on health, Milestone Indicative date

comments on these documents too. 
Viability
i.27 National legislation requires us to assess the likely financial cost of delivering the policies and requirements in the Plan to make sure they are not so expensive that they prevent needed development from occurring. This is called a viability assessment. A viability assessment has been undertaken on this draft Local Plan and concludes that the policies, obligation and site requirements are viable and will not prevent development from occurring. 
i.28 This assessment is published and comments can 
be provided on this document too.12

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  ALL ABOUT NEWHAMNEWHAM
LOCAL PLANALL ABOUT NEWHAM14
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: ALL ABOUT NEWHAMALL ABOUT NEWHAM 
Introduction
1.1 Newham is an inner London borough, which 
sits between three rivers: the Lea to the West, 
Thames to the South and Roding to the East. It has historically been a borough of two halves: residential neighbourhoods in the centre and north of the borough built around and along the historic routes which connected central London to Essex and the area of the borough along its three rivers, home to mainly industrial uses and large scale infrastructure. 
1.2 Since the closure of the Royal Docks these 
former industrial areas are undergoing a significant transformation. Newham now plays an important role within London as one of the key focal points for regeneration with investment in homes, modern workspaces, education, cultural and retail facilities occurring at a greater scale here than anywhere else in London. 
1.3 Newham is situated at the meeting point of 
the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough Corridor, centred on enterprise and innovation within emerging sectors such as digital media, life science, telecommunications and advanced manufacturing and the Thames Estuary Creative and Cultural Industries Corridor. It contains three Opportunity Areas: the Olympic Legacy (which also includes parts of the other Host Boroughs) Poplar Riverside (which crosses the boundary with Tower Hamlets) and Royal Docks and Beckton, which is also the home of London’s only Enterprise Zone and Europe’s largest regeneration area.  1.4 Our borough is well served by public transport 
and now benefits from 5 new accessible Elizabeth Line stations at Stratford, Manor Park, Forest Gate, Maryland and at Custom House. Of the 28 Transport for London stations in Newham, only 4 stations lack step free access.
Our People
1.5 Newham has a young, diverse and rapidly rising population. Newham’s population is the 3rd biggest population of all London Boroughs and its projected population in 2030 is anticipated to be 465,435. Newham has grown rapidly over the last ten years with a 14 percent increase in population between 2011 and 2021. Newham is London’s second most ethnically diverse borough with seven in ten residents from a non-white background and over 200 languages and dialects spoken here. The average age of a Newham resident is 32.7 and a third of the population is under 25 years old. The 2021 Census confirmed that 20 percent of the population is under 15. However, the number of older residents is growing and by 2050, Newham is predicted to have the most residents aged over 50 in all north east London boroughs.
1.6 One of the key challenges for Newham is the 
level of poverty and inequality. While significant improvements have been made over the last five to ten years, over a quarter of Newham’s wards are in the 20 per cent most deprived wards in the country, 49 per cent of Newham households are classified as living in poverty and 52 per cent of children grow up in low income households. These challenges were acerbated by COVID-19, with the biggest increase in claimant rates and highest number of people furloughed in London.
1.7 Although life expectancy at birth in Newham is like 
the rest of England, healthy life expectancy is lower, 
through a susceptibility to long term illnesses, risk factors and exposures to harmful agents, like smoking or alcohol. In addition, Newham residents’ rate of life satisfaction and sense that things they do in their lives are worthwhile are lower than their London and England counterparts. However, there are also positive signs to build on, with levels of happiness higher and anxiety lower in Newham than many other places within the city and country.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  ALL ABOUT NEWHAMOur Economy 
1.8 Newham contains around 12,875 registered 
businesses with 94 per cent of businesses employing less than nine people. The rate of business growth is at a significantly higher rate than London and the UK however business closures are also slightly higher. Job numbers in the borough have risen rapidly over the decade averaging around 10,000 additional jobs each two-year period, achieving a 55 per cent increase in those ten years.  
1.9 Public sector jobs remain large proportion of the 
overall total (around 30 per cent), and the dramatic 
job increase has generally been in sectors such as retail and business support.
1.10 While the level of growth and entrepreneurism in 
the borough is to be celebrated, significant challenges remain. Productivity remains low and is substantially below the UK average. Average earnings are £6,000 below the London average, with over a quarter of our residents paid below the London Living wage and this rises to over 50 per cent of ethnically diverse residents. Our residents are the most over-indebted in London. The borough has lower employment rates for women and higher numbers of young people who are not in employment, education and/or training than the London averages. 
Our Homes
1.11 Newham has built over 8,300 new homes in five years to April 2020 and is delivering 2,000 council homes at social rent. 
1.12 Despite this significant increase in housing 
numbers, the median house price in Newham stands at £415,000 as of December 2020 and average private rents have increased by around 40 per cent between 2014 and 2019. Our average rents now represent 65 per cent of average wages compared to 30 per cent across the UK, a contributing factor to why 49 per cent of Newham residents are in poverty after housing costs are taken into account. In 2019, Newham had the second highest rough sleeping population in London and this remains a significant challenge. 
Our Neighbourhoods 
1.13 Newham has six Town Centres, 13 Local Centres, and 12 Shopping Parades, all of which play an important role in the economic and community life of the borough. In 2018, Newham’s high streets hosted 52 per cent of retail jobs, 61 per cent of jobs in accommodation and food services, and 38 per cent of jobs in other service industries. Positively, 88 per cent of residents rate shopping facilities as good. 
1.14 Most of our high streets serve a local service 
and amenity function, with the exception of Green Street’s visitor economy of South Asian fashion and jewellery, which has international networks that expand beyond London and the UK and Stratford Metropolitan Centre, which has the potential to become an International Centre on a par with London’s central centres. 
1.15 Newham has a significant number of community 
facilities, including four leisure centres, ten libraries, five youth zones, numerous places of worship and community centres. However, these spaces are unevenly distributed, with far higher concentrations in some areas than others. These concentrations do not reflect higher population densities. 16
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: ALL ABOUT NEWHAMOur Environment  
1.16 There are 25 public parks in Newham and 
numerous green spaces totalling around 254 hectares of publicly accessible green space. The Council manages 22 public parks and around 50 green spaces and amenity areas. Other public parks are managed by the City of London (West Ham Park), Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park managed by London Legacy Development Corporation and Thames Barrier Park managed by the Greater London Authority.
1.17 In addition to the green space in the borough, the 
Royal Docks were once the largest enclosed docks in the world and is a 250-acre expanse of water with significant possibilities for leisure, nature, sports and spectacular outlooks.
1.18 Despite these important natural facilities, green space covers only 18 per cent of Newham (27 percent including water spaces), compared with 39 per cent for London as a whole and the borough has 15 percent tree cover which is the second lowest in London.
1.19 Newham’s location in London, with a significant 
number of strategic roads passing through the borough means that Newham residents are exposed to higher particulate pollution than in any other London borough. Newham has the highest death rate attributable to air pollution in England.
1.20 To tackle this challenge, as well as to play 
our part in contributing to global environmental sustainability, Newham declared a Climate Emergency in September 2019, recognising the need for proactive action to change behaviours and to encourage new ways of working, living, and moving around.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: VISION AND OBJECTIVESVISION AND OBJECTIVES
Vision 
No other borough is being transformed at the 
pace and scale that Newham is experiencing, both currently and over the next 15 years. Our vision is for this transformation to build a fairer, healthier and happier borough where creativity, diversity, an inclusive economy and community spirit can flourish and where residents feel proud of where they live. 
In some of our 16 neighbourhoods change will be 
radical: As City Hall makes its new home in Royal Victoria, the area around it and the wider docks, which were once isolated industrial sites, will become new connected, lively areas of our borough. They will be home to existing and future Newham residents as well as businesses engaged in the new green, digital and creative industries. These new communities will be matched in scale and ambition by a new Town Centre, connected by a DLR extension, at Beckton Riverside/Gallions Reach. Here, a new city district will provide homes, community facilities, modern industrial jobs and access to nature and the Thames.
Along the River Lea, through Canning Town and 
Manor Road and Three Mills new bridges and walkways will link residents to natural spaces, stations and neighbouring boroughs. At Canning Town and Custom House, the Elizabeth Line will serve newly regenerated and restored estates built around community facilities and local shops. In Stratford improved connectivity and targeted development will ensure the global ambitions of the Olympic legacy delivers lasting benefits for all of Newham. 
In many more neighbourhoods, changes will be smaller but no less important. These changes, such as at Forest Gate and Queen’s Market, will cherish and enhance our shared built and cultural heritage. Our Town Centres and Local High Streets will be cherished spaces to meet, shop locally and explore.  
Developments across our neighbourhoods will 
create new, green, well designed, affordable homes.  New spaces where businesses can grow, including in the East Beckton Town Centre, Parcelforce and Thameside West site allocations will create high quality and well-paying local jobs – ensuring wealth created in our community stays in our community. 
New development, including at Custom House, 
Plaistow North and Pudding Mill Lane, will provide opportunities to complete our network of 15-minute neighbourhoods, delivering the shops, community facilities and parks which bring our neighbourhoods to life and provide spaces for us to meet. 
This will be complemented by interventions which 
make Newham a safe and enjoyable place to move around. Walking, cycling and public transport will be prioritised on clean, safe, green and attractive streets where all feel welcome. 
This growth will not compromise our commitment to 
tackling the Climate Emergency. New development will be zero carbon and retrofitting existing buildings will be supported and accelerated. Our network of parks, open spaces, docks and riversides will grow and flourish. Climate resilient and nature filled neighbourhoods will help residents and local wildlife live safely and healthily in a changing environment.
Instrumental in delivering this vision will be 
collaboration to bring together residents, local organisations, the council and developers to build trust and understanding about what is needed and achievable in each of Newham’s 16 neighbourhoods. Young people in particular will be welcomed and planned for, ensuring they retain an enduring stake in their future and the borough’s.19
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  VISION AND OBJECTIVESObjectives
2.1   In or der to achieve our vision, the Local Plan is shaped around the

3.1 The Newham Local Plan sets out the spatial 
strategy for Newham for a 15-year period between 2023 and 2038. The spatial strategy identifies the location, scale and uses of development that will come forward in Newham and demonstrates how the needs of Newham’s current and future population will be met. This includes the need, set by the London Plan (2021), to deliver at least 47, 600 homes in Newham over the period 2019/20 to 2028/29. The Newham Local Plan also seeks to meet Newham’s needs for: 
•
  a r
equirement for 335,000 sqm of industrial 
floorspace 
•
  a minimum r
equirement for 90,000 sqm of 
 offic
e floorspace 
•
 25,
973 sqm of retail floorspace  
3.2 This level of change and development creates a unique opportunity and it is crucial that the delivery of this growth is undertaken in a way which is fair and supports Good Growth principles and the delivery of the aspirations set out in the Vision and Objectives: creating a healthier Newham and aging well, delivering an inclusive economy, creating people-friendly neighbourhoods, making a safer Newham, building homes for residents, supporting young people to have the best start in life and reach their potential and creating a people powered Newham. 
3.3 The policies in this section seek to ensure 
that new development makes the most of every opportunity to deliver these objectives.This section contains the following policies:•

7.
   Pr
otecting the borough’s strategic and utilities 
infrastructure while mitigating any negative impacts.26
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification 
3.4 This policy identifies where development and change 
will occur across the borough to deliver the Plan’s vision and objectives. Newham is home to three Opportunity Areas: Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside and the Poplar Riverside and Olympic Legacy cross boundary Opportunity Areas. Opportunity Areas are designated in the London Plan (2021) as key locations with potential for new homes, jobs and infrastructure of all types. These Opportunity Areas are linked to existing or potential public transport improvements. These areas of the borough will therefore see the majority of growth in Newham. However, growth and development will also occur in other neighbourhoods, where land is available for development and/or intensification and where the Characterisation Study (2022) has identified it as being suitable for growth and change. Growth in these neighbourhoods will provide locations for homes and employment as well as providing much needed social infrastructure, such as health centres and community facilities.  
3.5 The key objective underpinning this spatial strategy 
is the delivery of 15-minute neighbourhoods: ensuring all residents live within easy walking distance of shops, workplaces, community facilities, parks and civic amenities and that there are sufficient facilities to meet the needs of an increasing population. This policy sets out how we will deliver this objective and in doing so, overcome the borough’s current uneven distribution of many of these key neighbourhood elements that we consider are needed to live happy and healthy lives in Newham.Implementation
BFN1.1 Sites where significant levels of growth are anticipated, or which are required to deliver the 
Neighbourhood visions are designated as Site Allocations (section 4). Development on these sites, must comply with the site specific development and design principles. 
Development on other sites, known as ‘windfall sites’ will also make a significant contribution 
to meeting our housing and employment needs. These will be supported where they meet the policy requirements in the Plan.
BFN1.2 New developments should optimise the use of available sites by responding to the site’s 
context, the design policies and the guidance in the Characterisation Study (2022) to deliver well-designed development of an appropriate scale and size. 
BFN1.3 To deliver Newham’s regional economic role as a key location for industrial land, the Plan 
seeks to consolidate and optimise our remaining industrial sites to deliver modern, intensified, high quality workspaces and ensure they are suitably buffered from residential areas by lighter industrial and workshop uses.
In addition, to deliver our green economy, 15-minute neighbourhood and Community Wealth 
Building objectives we require variety in the types and locations of workspace. This includes promoting the role of the Stratford Metropolitan Town Centre as an important office cluster in the borough and protecting and enabling smaller clusters of workspace which can offer low cost and affordable workspace.
BFN1.4 To ensure that everyone in the borough lives in a 15-minute neighbourhood, while protecting 
and enhancing our Town Centres, we will be supporting the expansion of many of our existing centres and parades and creating new centres and parades. In addition, development in Town Centres will be encouraged to support a diversity of uses to attract more people and, where appropriate, operating at different times in the day and evening.
BFN1.5 To deliver sufficient infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing borough and to make 
it equally easy for residents across the borough to reach them, the Plan requires certain site allocations to deliver new schools, health centres and community facilities; supports the 27
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESdelivery of new and expanded council facilities and enables a wider 
range of locations for the delivery of new community facilities (see Policy CNF1).
The borough’s quantity of publically accessible open space per 
person is low compared to neighbouring boroughs and people living in many parts of the borough do not have easy access to open spaces. Developments, particularly on site allocations, are expected to help address these deficiencies. 
All development is expected to support the delivery of community 
facilities and mechanisms to secure this are outlined in policy BNF4.
BFN1.6 The Council is implementing a transformative series of transport 
and infrastructure schemes to improve local connections and make walking and cycling easier and safer. Developments in close proximity to these transport interventions are expected to ensure their proposal supports the implementation of these schemes and all development is expected to support their wider delivery through the mechanisms outlined in policy BNF4.
BFN1.7 Newham is home to a disproportionate number of strategic 
infrastructure facilities – including Beckton Sewage Treatment Works, transport depots, and pylons. Development in close proximity to these facilities must ensure they do not impact on their long term function and that they are designed to reduce any potential noise, dust, odour, light and other pollution from these existing strategic facilities on the users of new development. The Council will continue to work with utilities providers and other public sector bodies to reduce the impact of these facilities.Monitoring

Justification
3.6 Masterplanning and co-design are two crucial tools to ensure the delivery of Newham’s key objectives. Significant levels of development in Newham are occurring on site allocations, which when complete will form whole new neighbourhoods and parts of the borough. Such sites must be well planned to deliver multiple mutually supporting objectives on the site itself as well as create benefits for the wider area. Of equal importance are the smaller, more incremental changes, in well-established neighbourhoods, where masterplanning is necessary to ensure the best use of land and neighbourliness. 3.7 New development in Newham must meet the needs of Newham’s residents. The policies in this Plan seek to ensure this by ensuring developments deliver on our key objectives - all of which can be influenced by the design, use and management of any scale of new developments. However, each part of the borough is different and the detailed requirements of local communities will change with time. Co-design will therefore complement these policies, giving residents a genuine opportunity to shape the development of their neighbourhoods and applicants a vital resource to help understand the neighbourhood they are building in and create somewhere special and valued. 31
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
BNF2.1 Compliance with this part of the policy will, in part, be 
demonstrated by a successful masterplan which delivers against the 
criteria in parts 2 and 3. Where relevant, sites should be supported by a realistic phasing plan. 
BNF2.2 It is expected that masterplanning should take place in advance of, 
and alongside, pre-application discussions. 
Newham considers that the most effective and inclusive method to 
undertake this engagement is by using a co-design process through which the masterplan can be developed and key aspects of the scheme can be designed. Participants in the process should include landowners, developers, residents in the surrounding area, local community organisations, local businesses and prospective users or managers of any social or community infrastructure provision. An engagement strategy should be submitted outlining how engagement has and will be carried out. This should identify which specific groups will be engaged, including a focus on engaging young people and a range of residents as diverse as the local population, and how they will be engaged. The strategy should be underpinned by the engagement principles contained within Newham’s Statement of Community Involvement and include offline and online activities, the use of existing local events, innovative and fun activities and allow for long term engagement. 
The masterplan must consider and provide a strategy for how the 
required land uses and infrastructure will be delivered across the whole allocation or site, as well as appropriate phasing to ensure infrastructure is provided as it will be needed. It must demonstrate compliance with the relevant neighbourhood and/or site allocation design principles provided in section 4, including appropriate heights, including appropriate heights, key connections and routesand create integrated developments which are outward facing, part of the existing street pattern and create a continuation of the neighbourhood. It should also evidence how the site’s existing natural features, including trees, green spaces and water spaces have been incorporated into the design while appropriate mitigation for environmental factors such as noise, odour, air quality and flood risk have been incorporated, paying particular consideration to those land uses and users most vulnerable to these factors. Finally, the masterplan must demonstrate that the layout will optimise quality of life for residents in the new development, as well as those living alongside it, while protecting the economic function of any new and existing employment uses.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBNF2.3 Delivering opportunities for social interaction can include well-
designed communal amenity spaces and internal circulation space, 
as well as larger interventions such as the provision community facilities or community growing spaces. 
Mixed, balanced and stable communities will be achieved when an 
appropriate mix of tenures and sizes of home are provided (including specialist housing, where appropriate). 
Incorporating active travel, active design and healthy streets 
principles, as well as providing green and tranquil spaces and well-designed homes all benefit physical and mental wellbeing. 
Recent engagement with young people in Newham has highlighted 
that young people often feel unsafe and unwelcome in public spaces in Newham. Masterplans must therefore demonstrate how the needs of children and older young people will be met in and around the development.
Masterplans should consider how a changing climate will be 
managed within their development, such as layouts to reduce overheating, provisions of cool zones, sustainable urban drainage systems and flood prevention measures. 
Newham is the most diverse borough in London, our buildings 
and public spaces must be designed to accommodate variation in family and social lives as well as considering different groups’ feelings of safety and welcome. This could include larger homes for multigenerational living, variation and flexibility in the design of private amenity space and internal home layouts, facilities in the public realm for different types of games or socialising, the use of design features which incorporate global design practices and aesthetics. Finally, the masterplan must demonstrate how the scheme will deliver Community Wealth Benefits, such a creating spaces for local businesses, complementing, not undermining the vitality and viability of local retail and community facilities, and creating opportunities for community ownership and management. Further guidance can be found in the Borough Wide Design Principles chapter of the Characterisation Strategy. 
Specific interventions to deliver these objectives must be 
informed by the co-design process and respond to local needs. The masterplan document should evidence how these objectives have been delivered. 
© Andrew Baker33
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBNF2.4 The Meanwhile Uses Strategy should aim to activate the site, establish 
connections with the wider community and build the identity of new 
developments and neighbourhoods. Appropriate meanwhile uses should be identified through co-design approaches so they reflect local needs, but could include small parklets, community gardens, community facilities, pop up shops or markets, affordable workspace or makerspace. Meanwhile uses should foster long-term social value by building on existing community initiatives and supporting job-creation, skills, and training of the local community. Any temporary structures should be designed for disassembly and reuse to support circular economy principles. Meanwhile uses will be subject to their own planning processes.
BNF2.5 Post occupancy surveys provide an invaluable source of information on 
the occupancy of new developments, as well as the design and function of the development. This will help shape the Council’s service delivery and infrastructure planning as well as to help guide future policy and approaches to design. Surveys should be completed more than 12 months and less than 24 months after full occupancy of the phase. It is expected that the survey should be conducted by an independent third party and have a response rate of at least 40 per cent to ensure sufficient data quality and anonymity. The Council will develop a series of standard questions which can be supplemented should the developer or management company so wish.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBFN3: Social Value and 
Health Impact Assessment - delivering social value, health and wellbeing 
1.  Al l developments in Newham are encouraged 
to maximise social value and to make a positive contribution to the health and wellbeing of our communities.
2.
  Major de
velopment, and proposals where 
potential health or social justice issues are likely to arise must undertake a screening assessment as early as possible in the development process, to determine whether a full Social Value and Health Impact Assessment (SV-HIA) is required.
3.
  Wher
e the Screening Assessment identifies that a 
full SV-HIA is required, then: 
 
 a.
  the s
cope of the SV-HIA must be agreed 
with the Council’s Planning and Public Health departments before it is undertaken by the applicant; and
 
 b.
  applic
ants will be required to prepare a 
proportionate SV-HIA as early as possible in the development process. This is to allow the scheme to deliver the maximum potential social and health gains and to mitigate any potential negative impacts.Justification
3.8 Newham has adopted a number of strategies which seek to put health, happiness and wellbeing at the heart of the work the council does. Newham’s Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2020) sets out 50 steps to improve health and wellbeing over the next three years. The COVID-19 recovery action plan, ‘Towards a Better Newham ’ is focused around 8 
pillars of recovery which set out how the council will focus its attention as it emerges from the pandemic. Pillar 1 places health at the heart of the action plan: ‘Our measures of success will be the health, happiness and wellbeing of our residents, rather than growth, productivity and land value’. The Council’s Community Wealth Building Strategy seeks to tackle the injustices Newham’s residents’ face by focusing on poverty in the borough, as well as addressing the racial and gendered disparities that exists. In addition, it sets out how Community Wealth Building principals will be implemented as a key mechanism for responding to the climate emergency. The Social Integration Strategy introduces how Newham Council will approach issues of equality and how we can help achieved better links between residents to improve quality of life for all. 
3.9 We will encourage all development to maximise 
social value throughout the lifetime of the development. The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 introduced a duty on local authorities to have regard for economic, social and environmental wellbeing in connection with Public Service contracts. Authorities must consider how what is proposed to be procured might improve the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the relevant area, and how, in conducting the process of procurement, it might act with a view to securing such improvement. Social value is the delivery of positive social, economic and environmental impacts, which come from the actions of organisations. In particular this means the effect on the local economy and the health and wellbeing of local residents. It is important to ensure that potential positive benefits are maximised from the development taking place in Newham. This can mean utilising local supply chains so money spent on developments stays in the local economy; and taking steps to recruit local people for the construction of development and in any resulting employment use.
3.10 A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a useful 
tool that helps to ensure that health and wellbeing is being properly considered in proposals. HIAs are designed to consider whether a policy might reinforce health inequalities and inadvertently damage people’s health, or actually have positive health outcomes for the local community. It helps us to develop recommendations to maximise the positive impacts and minimise the negative impacts, while maintaining a focus on addressing health inequalities. Ensuring issues are considered at an early stage in development proposals can lead to improvements in both the physical and mental health of the population.35
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
BFN3:1 The SV-HIA combines: 
•
  Soci
al Value self-assessment: an approach used to judge the potential 
social value which can be added through the delivery of the proposal. 
•
  He
alth Impact Assessment: a practical approach used to judge the 
potential health effects of a policy, programme or project on a 
population, particularly on vulnerable or disadvantaged groups with the view that any recommendations made should aim to maximise the proposal’s health benefits while minimising any negative health effects.
The following developments will be expected to submit a Health and Social Value Impact Screening Assessment: 
i.
 Major de
velopment
ii.
 Lo
ss, gain or reconfiguration of Community Facility floorspace
iii.
  Gain of T
akeaways, water pipe smoking and other kinds of smoking 
leisure activities, gambling premises and payday loan shops
iv.
 Lo
ss, gain or reconfiguration of publicly accessible open space
There may be other types of development, outside of those identified above, which Planning and Public Health officers consider may require a SV-HIA.
Development will need to complete a SV-HIA Screening Assessment. The 
screening assessment will be submitted at pre-application stage. Through this process the need for a more detailed SV-HIA may be identified. The Screening Assessment will be reviewed by Newham’s Public Health and Planning Teams. 
Any changes made as a result of the screening process should be recorded 
and an updated version submitted with any future planning application. BFN3:2 SV-HIAs can be done at any stage in the process of developing 
a planning application, but are best done at the earliest stage possible. The assessment should help to identify the potential positive and negative social value and health impacts of the emerging development.
The scope of any SV-HIA must be agreed with Newham’s 
Public Health and Planning departments. The assessment must be proportionate to the size of the development and must look at issues of social value and health in the round. 
A SV-HIA self-assessment, should be submitted at the planning 
application stage. Applicants are encouraged to complete the SV-HIA template at the earliest possible stage of the development (e.g. at initial design stage or pre-application), so that the consideration of social value and health and wellbeing can meaningfully influence a development. 
Applicants are encouraged to think carefully about how 
their scheme can benefit the community over the lifetime of the development and adopt measures to achieve this. For example, employment generating developments could review their recruitment policies to ensure they are inclusive and/or promote flexible and accessible work placements to help people into work who might otherwise find it difficult for a number of reasons, such as learning difficulties, their ex-offender status or mental health issues. 36

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.11 In order to ensure that the policies of the Local 
Plan are delivered in a way that achieves sustainable development, we will seek contributions from developers to fund affordable housing, improvements to infrastructure and the environment. As outlined in the Plan’s vision, objectives and spatial strategy, building a fairer Newham relies on development which meets Newham’s need and the delivery of infrastructure which can support the level of anticipated growth and ensure current and future residents have access to the facilities they need. 
3.12 We will work collaboratively with our partners 
to deliver the infrastructure necessary to support the growth and development identified within the Local Plan using contributions secured alongside other sources of available funding. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies the types of infrastructure required to support the anticipated growth in the borough. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan will updated in consultation with both internal and external stakeholders, such as other service areas and infrastructure providers.Implementation
BNF4:1 In order to comply with Part 1, contributions must be made in accordance with both the 
borough-wide Community Infrastructure Levy charging schedule, or any subsequent adopted version; and the Mayor of London’s Community Infrastructure Levy charging schedule, or any subsequent adopted version. 
Section 106 planning obligations will be sought for affordable housing and additional 
contributions where they are: 
a. necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms; and b. directly related to the development, and c. fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.
Obligations will vary depending on the nature and scale of a development, its location and impacts. They may be sought financially or ‘in kind’ – where the developer builds or directly delivers the obligation. Policies which require planning obligations are included within the thematic and spatial policies.
39
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBNF4:2 The Local Plan has been viability tested and its policies shown to 
be deliverable. In exceptional cases, a shortfall of contributions 
towards the provision of infrastructure or affordable housing (including, but is not limited to, schemes which do not meet the 35 per cent or 50 per cent affordable housing thresholds) may be justified on viability grounds. In line with Government guidance, the amount paid for land is not considered to be an exceptional reason to justify provision of site-specific viability. 
In such circumstances, applicants will need to provide clear and 
robust evidence, as early as possible in the planning process, through a detailed financial viability appraisal to justify any deviation from the policies set out in this Plan. The Council will work with applicants to consider available phasing and review options to improve the viability of schemes to secure further contributions.
Financial viability appraisals must comply with the Mayor of 
London’s Affordable Housing and Viability London Plan Guidance or subsequent guidance and will need to demonstrate that: •
  the polic
y requirements set out in the Local Plan would render 
the development unviable (due to unforeseen circumstances); and
•
  the wider benefits of the s
cheme would outweigh the loss of 
contributions; and 
•
  the po
tential opportunities to defer, reduce or phase 
contributions have been fully explored. 
The viability appraisal must also be independently tested at the applicant’s expense.BNF4:3 This viability hierarchy is provided to guide applicants and 
decision makers in the exceptional circumstances where viability constraints prevent the delivery of all policy requirements. There may be some site specific exceptions where an alternative prioritisation is considered more appropriate. Where necessary to deliver the provision of infrastructure required as part of a site allocation or considered necessary by internal or regional consultees, and proven via viability evidence, additional sources of funding to enable the delivery of the required infrastructure may be identified by the Council. 
BNF4:4 To demonstrate there is sufficient infrastructure to support 
the needs of the development an Infrastructure Sufficiency Assessment must be undertaken. This should consider all of the following:•
  the c
apacity, availability and accessibility of the existing 
infrastructure provision within the area of the development.
•
  the c
ommitments and anticipated projects outlined in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan, implemented planning permissions, other parts of this Plan and any more up to date infrastructure providers’ service strategies and commitments.
•
  the r
ole of the development’s land uses and financial and in-
kind contributions to support reductions in existing gaps and address needs arising from the development.
•
  the r
ole of phasing to ensure infrastructure is provided 
alongside growth.
The assessment should indicate where any gaps may still exist in delivering key infrastructure and make recommendations on how they can be overcome.  Where additional required infrastructure cannot be delivered, the scale of the development should be reconsidered to reflect the capacity of current or future planned supporting infrastructure. 40
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBNF4:5 The purpose of the Vacant Building Credit is to incentivise 
development on brownfield land. The nature of the land available in 
Newham and the housing market means that it is not considered that such an incentive is required in Newham. Newham has a local need of over 60 per cent affordable housing and as such should be optimising all opportunities to deliver affordable homes. For these reasons, the Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (Greater London Authority, 2017) concludes that the application of Vacant Building Credit is unlikely to be suitable in London. Therefore, significant evidence is required to demonstrate why Vacant Building Credit is needed to bring forward a development. If a scheme qualifies for Vacant Building Credit, it cannot also claim Community Infrastructure Levy relief through the vacancy test.Monitoring

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESDESIGN
3.13 The design process is a key aspect of delivering 
successful places. It considers what buildings and the spaces around them look and feel like, and how usable, accessible and pleasant they are. A well-designed development will be easy to move around, with clearly defined public and private areas and easily identified functions for the different parts of the development; feel safe and welcoming at all times of day and night; and enhance the look, feel and functionality of the wider neighbourhood. In order to deliver on a vision of cohesive, engaged, sustainable, happy and healthy communities the whole process of design must be considered from the development of the brief to post-delivery maintenance. 
3.14 Recent and current planning activity continue 
to significantly shape the borough: on both strategic and smaller sites. Over the last ten years Newham’s population has grown by 30 per cent, and in the next ten years Newham will account for 30 per cent of London’s population growth. It is therefore vital that such significant growth occurs through the delivery of well-designed and high quality buildings and neighbourhoods.  The policies in this chapter have sought to embed best practice approaches, with a thorough re-assessment of the character of Newham and lessons learned from development activity over the past. 
3.15 The design policies have built on, and should be 
read alongside, the Newham Characterisation Study (2022) which has identified what makes Newham special – its physical and social characteristics and aspirations. The Study provides further design guidance to ensure design solutions respond to and integrate with local places.
3.16 While ongoing investment has helped improve 
the overall quality of life in the borough, inequality and disproportionality continue to be significant problems. We are hearing from existing residents that they are not always effectively engaged in shaping schemes, leaving some feeling left out of the opportunities that development activities are bringing into the borough. These considerations are important components of the Council’s Community Wealth Building and social integration agendas. There are two key ways that the design policies aim to tackle inequality and disproportionality. First, through an emphasis on achieving public realm net gain which means developments must look beyond their boundaries and help enhance the quality of the public realm in the neighbourhood. Second, through setting design criteria tackling issues of safety, inclusivity, integrated development that avoids creating perceived or actual gated communities, and living well at high density. 
3.17 Newham also continues its historic trend of 
being welcoming to diverse cultures, with 72.5 per cent of the population being from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background, and over 100 languages being spoken. In spite of all this, development is rarely considered through the lens of cultural needs, particularly in terms of quality and variety of development. We wish to promote implementation of design solutions that support our resident’s cultural needs and enable social integration, particularly focusing on quality, diverse public realm and on residential standards (see Housing chapter).

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  Policy D1: Design standards
1.  Al l developments should have regard to the 
Newham Characterisation Study (2022) and any 
further, relevant Council-led design guidance and/or code and apply the following qualities of good design:
 
 a.
  cr

connect into and appear part of their wider natural and built surroundings. Avoid creating gated communities or isolated and disconnected places that are not easy to move through and around.
 
 b.

form for its site, context and neighbourhood.
 
 c.
  ensur

permeability to help feelings of safety, legibility and wayfinding.
 
 d.
  be of human s
cale, with the relationship 
between streets and buildings supporting a comfortable pedestrian microclimate and a positive, sociable threshold between public realm and private spaces.
 
 e.
  int

elements’ throughout the built environment (see Policy GWS3).
 
 f
.
  pr

that supports the role of the public and communal space(s).
 
 g
.
  pr
ovide natural surveillance for public and 
communal spaces through overlooking and activation.
 
 h.
  design or
derly and varied facades, with a coherent rhythm of vertical elements (entrances, windows, balconies) and variety in materials and detailing. 
 
 i.
  pl
ant should be located below ground. 
Where this is not feasible, it should be satisfactorily integrated into the form and design of the roof.
 
 j.
  us
e high quality detailing and materials which 
are robust, help create a sense of place and ownership, reflects the intended function of the development and complements and enhances local context and character. Ground floors should be designed with a finer level of architectural detailing.
2.
  Al
l developments should be welcoming and 
well integrated socially and physically into their neighbourhoods. They should enhance existing positive elements of local character and carefully consider opportunities to correct less successful urban forms, movement barriers and other local challenges.  
3.
  S
afety and security features of buildings should 
be well integrated into the overall design, and complement and not impede delivery of quality public and communal spaces. Secured by Design standards should be achieved.
4.
  T
emporary buildings that are likely to be used for a 
year or more (including years already in use) should apply the same design quality standards set out above, and should be designed for disassembly and reuse to support circular economy principles. Extension of temporary permission will be resisted where the quality criteria is not met. 5.
  The qua
lity of design will be secured through 
conditions, and for major developments through planning obligations requiring retention of original architect to completion. Major developments fitting the terms of reference of the Newham Design Review Panel should be assessed by the panel and/or Community Panel appointed by the Local Planning Authority.

Justification
3.18 Good quality design, alongside comprehensive 
development and masterplanning, will help achieve successful place-making that delivers new, distinctive, but integrated and well-connected places. Research shows that the cost of good design is minimal compared to the financial and other benefits that can be achieved through its delivery. Importantly, good urban design comprises the delivery of a number of components: not just individual buildings, but also the spaces around them, the relationship with the surrounding area and connections between them, and the mix of uses provided for (which in turn impacts on those spaces). As such, the policy emphasises that all these aspects of design must be addressed, and carried through into credible plans for implementation and management.
3.19 Design should not be ‘off-the-shelf’, but respond 
to an analysis of the local context so that it has the best impact, and is sensitive to the positives and negatives of local character (natural, physical, social and cultural) and addresses the specific constraints and opportunities of the site. It should resolve and not repeat past mistakes. It should accentuate and integrate with high quality elements of the surrounding context without simply replicating it. This process must include consideration of aspects of sensitivity, including historic or heritage value as well as social value, and capacity for change and innovation as set out in Policy D3.
3.20 It will also be important to establish design 
credibility by engaging early and repeatedly with local residents, participating in design review processes, and incorporating technical and financial details as suitable for the type of development and planning application. Value engineering must be avoided, including by considering early on the impacts of building method choices, and through provision for continuity of the project architect.
3.21 The basic principles of good design are applicable 
as much to proposals for ‘meanwhile’ uses, as more permanent ones. This is because temporary developments often prevail, and therefore have a significant impact on local townscapes and the realisation of wider community visions.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
D1.1 The criteria set in this policy is complementary to good place-making 
requirements set under other policies of this Plan that address the need for development to:
•  Be comprehensively developed or masterplanned.
•  Use compact patterns of development. •  
 C
ontribute to greenness in the built environment (see also Policy 
GWS3).
•  Support a mix of uses within the neighbourhood. •  
 Cr
eate public spaces that are attractive, welcoming, comfortable, 
adaptable and well managed and maintained.
•  
 Enc
ourage low levels of vehicular traffic, and provide pedestrian and 
bicycle-friendly design and convenient connection to the public transport network
•  Provide high quality private and communal residential standards.
Developers should explain and justify their response to the 
components of good design set out in this policy within the mandatory Design and Access Statement (or pre-app documentation).
Developments need to be designed in accordance with design guidance 
prepared by the Council, the Greater London Authority or other public sector partners. Currently this includes:
•  
 Ne
wham Characterisation Study (2022) – borough wide design 
principles, neighbourhood principles, and sites recommendations.
•  Conservation Area appraisal and management plans.
•  
  Gr
eater London Authority, emerging Good Quality Homes for 
All Londoners London Plan Guidance – small site design codes, optimising site capacity: a design-led approach, Housing design standards (external design).D1.1 •  National Design Guide (2019)•  National Model Design Code (2021)
Avoiding the creation of gated or segregated communities is imperative. 
This also means paying careful attention to:
•  
 Char
acter of the wider neighbourhood, starting with the detailed 
assessment of the Newham Characterisation Study (2022). 
•  
 The spa
ce between public realm and building frontages, and how 
public-private transition is facilitated. 
•
   
 The l
ocation of non-residential uses and public spaces, to ensure they 
are legible and inviting to the wider neighbourhood.
•  
 The design of l
andscaping features so that visual barriers interfacing the 
public realm are minimised. 
The Design and Access Statement should demonstrate a deep 
understanding of local character: built and natural character, history and culture; and aspirations for the wider neighbourhood. The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) and any other relevant local design code should be a starting point in identifying aspects to address in scheme design. However, more detailed site based analysis, including public engagement, will also be required.
The threshold between public and private space is a key consideration in 
creating successful places. For residential, specialist housing and visitor accommodation development, a landscaped defensible space should be incorporated in between the building line and the pavement to create a transition between private and public spaces. Where lobbies are set-back from the main building line of the street, these should be well-lit and overlooked spaces.45
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD1.2 The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) has identified parts 
of the borough where the built environment is of a lesser quality. 
This means that a more detailed and careful consideration of development in these areas is required, with careful scrutiny of elements of context that should be integrated versus elements of context that should be enhanced (and not exacerbated or ignored).  
Aspects of design that can aid social interaction and integration 
that development should address include: ensuring positive public/private space relationships; and providing well located and designed non-residential uses and communal and public spaces that help facilitate social interaction. The Newham Characterisation Study: Borough-wide Design Principles sets out design guidance for ‘enabling cohesion and celebrating diversity’.
D1.3 In evolving the scheme’s design, careful consideration should be 
given to security features so that they do not onerously impact on opportunities for quality public realm, including seating, shelter and greenery which contribute to the promotion of healthy, active lifestyles and social integration.   Secured by Design accreditation of security features will be a condition of approval.
D1.4 The Design and Access Statement should provide information on 
the lifespan of materials used, including maintenance considerations, accounting for the possibility that the temporary use may persist for longer than one year. This detail will also need to be provided in support of applications to extend temporary permissions, including where the original permission pre-dates this Plan or where cumulatively the development would persist for longer than a year. This is to ensure that the quality of development is suitable for the intended duration. However, temporary buildings should not impact on ability to masterplan or comprehensively deliver sites. D1.1 Each ground floor home should be provided with its own front door located on a primary frontage; and the defensible space should be between 1.5m and 2.5m deep, with exceptions acceptable for mews type development and small sites where it is desirable to retain existing built line. The location and detailing of entrances should ensure that they are easily visible from access route(s), clearly recognisable through materiality and detailing, and protected from the elements. 
Extensions should be subservient to and complement the scale and 
massing of the host building. Key features of façade detailing should be retained and continued.
Plant (excluding solar panels) should be located below ground. Where 
this is not feasible, it should be satisfactorily integrated into the form and design of the roof. It should be enclosed and covered where it would otherwise harm the appearance of the building, the general scene, or views from other buildings. All combustion flues should terminate above the roof height of the tallest building in the development to ensure maximum dispersion of pollutants.
Where the scope of assessment is limited to the principle of 
development – Outline parts of applications, Permission-in-Principle Applications or principle only pre-applications – the basic considerations of design in terms of masterplanning criteria must be addressed and safeguarded through conditions or planning obligations. A developer-led design code may be an appropriate method to fulfil this requirement where it:•  
 Addr
esses the basic design requirements in relation to the proposed 
parameter plans, including being co-designed with local communities in line with Policy BFN2. 
•  Follows the process of the National Model Design Code.•  
  Is in line with the design guidanc
e prepared by the Council, the Greater 
London Authority or other public sector partners 
    (as set out above).46
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD1.4 An end-of-life action plan should be submitted to indicate 
disassembly technique required and potential options for reuse 
of materials or the entire structure (including any partnerships/agreements with other businesses or organisations to support this).  The end-of-life action plan should demonstrate that there is a reasonably good chance for reuse of materials, and assess the carbon impact if this is not achieved. Planning obligations will secure carbon offset contributions in the event that materials are unreasonably lost. 
D1.5 Proposals not supported by adequately detailed drawings, or design 
codes coordinated with parameter plans, will be resisted.  
Conditions or planning obligations will be used to secure 
commitment to maintaining the quality of the development through future phases and detailed delivery. Loss of quality through variations, non-material amendments or approval of detail applications should be strongly resisted, having regard to the imperative importance of good design to place-making.
The Newham Design Review Panel will generally review proposals 
for major new development that meets at least one of the following selection criteria:
•  Development of 0.5 hectares or more.
•  Development involving 50 or more new homes.•  Development of 1,000 m
2 floor space or more. 
•  Significant public realm schemes.•  Major infrastructure schemes such as bridges or tunnels.•  Development with a significant impact on a Town Centre.•  Development in a historically/environmentally sensitive area.• 
 De
velopment with a particular importance to an area or 
communityD1.5 Design review is most effective when it takes place at an early stage 
in the planning process, to identify and challenge strategic design decisions, and before design proposals become too fixed.
As and when a community design review panel is established by 
the Council, all major proposals will also need to be reviewed by this panel before progressing to the Newham Design Review Panel. The Newham Design Review Panel will need to be satisfied that the views of the Community Panel have been reflected in the design presented. 
In order to secure future learning opportunities, post-occupancy 
survey questionnaires will be secured through planning obligations in line with Policy BFN2:5.

Justification
3.22 Public realm is a common resource, but its quality can vary significantly between streets and neighbourhoods. For many people public realm is a key affordable space for social interaction and leisure and is therefore essential for social integration and health and wellbeing.  Given the geographic spread of land available for development and in line with Community Wealth Building aspirations we want public realm investment to go beyond the boundaries of development sites and reach further into established neighbourhoods. By helping improve the public environment more widely, more people should feel comfortable, safe and included, broadening access to what their neighbourhoods have to offer. 
3.23 The public realm has multiple roles. People rightly 
expect to be able to move freely and easily within an 
extended area, and the quality of public routes and public spaces should support a range of movement needs and options.  This is a key issue in the borough, with physical barriers and urban structures designed for vehicle movements and industrial uses contributing to the creation of confusing or threatening environments and harsh ‘edges’. Public spaces and streets should provide logical, clear, pleasant, safe and interesting connections between places for use by pedestrians and cyclists with a range of abilities, to encourage these more active and sociable travel modes. This will also require the relationship of such spaces to vehicle travel to be well managed, ensuring that car parking and road traffic does not dominate.
3.24 Within a sizeable, ethnically diverse and young 
borough such as Newham, it is also reasonable to expect a diverse range of public spaces that people can use in their day-to-day lives. Ease of access for all, features of interest and flexibility of use, including playability, de-cluttering of unnecessary street furniture and provision of seating and shelter will be important design considerations. Well placed and designed green spaces and views of it will also add to sustainability (including flood risk mitigation) and health benefits (see also the chapter Green and Water Spaces). Incidental social and play spaces should also be designed in. Independent mobility is vital for the physical, social and mental development and health of young people. It is also intrinsically connected to equality and the everyday freedoms to access and occupy public space. In Newham, the quality of public realm close to home is even more important when our young people feel excluded due to affordability and distance barriers. Play space and green space are referenced in this policy because qualitative measures of location and design of these spaces can make the difference between spaces being communal or publicly accessible. The qualitative standards for play space and green space form part of Green and Blue Spaces Chapter – Policy GBS5. 
3.25 Safety and security considerations are vitally 
important for local people. Where these are not in place, they can deter people from using the public realm, public transport and particular buildings, as well as affecting how comfortable they feel in their own homes and places of work. Some groups are particularly affected, such as women and girls, and people with a disability. Recent research by London Legacy Development Corporation has shown the value and importance of local community engagement, alongside auditing of the public realm, to identify areas, routes and features that feel less 50
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES
safe so that investment opportunities can be 
better targeted. 
3.26 Art can contribute significantly to the quality 
of the environment, particularly where it enhances a sense of place and local identity and is a form of community infrastructure. Public art includes temporary installations and non-physical works such as soundscapes. Where appropriate, artworks can be incorporated into street furniture or other landscaping features so that a variety of community needs can be met. Artworks may provide shelter from the weather, include sensory elements and provide play opportunities.Implementation
ALL For the purposes of this policy, public realm is defined as: 
•  
 The netw
ork of highways and public rights of way, whether on land that is publicly or privately 
owned, and including planned commitments. For the purposes of quantitative net gain, the carriageway space of highways is excluded. 
•  
 The netw
ork of parks and gardens that are or are committed to be publicly accessible, with or 
without hours of operation restrictions, and whether on land that is publicly or privately owned.
•  
 The netw
ork of open spaces that are or are committed to be publicly accessible, whether on 
land that is publicly or privately owned. This includes: public squares, commercial or community premise forecourts, bus stops, and station concourses. 
•  
   Highw
ays facing frontages and curtilage of listed and locally listed buildings.
A public space is the part of the public realm intended to have more varied functions, beyond the 
primary movement function – e.g. parks, squares, play streets, street markets. 
D2.1 The 25m frontage policy trigger also applies to corner sites. In these cases, site parameter should be measured cumulatively along both sides facing the highway. 
For sites with two or more highway accesses that are unconnected (e.g. a street at the front and 
a public right of way at the rear, but not a full urban block), each frontage should be measured separately, and the policy applies if any one of the highway frontages reaches 25m.  
For major residential development that is located off main highways (i.e. is in backland), the public 
realm network to be considered by the design and access statement as part of the site includes any public right of way that provides access to the site as well as the section of street it links to. 
The main function of public realm is to facilitate the movement of people, and in the context of 
this policy emphasis is placed on pavements and pedestrian movement, and on cyclist movement. Greenery should also be optimised, not only from a climate emergency response perspective (including managing flood risk) but also for the mental health and wellbeing benefits it brings. When public realm is intended to cater to other functions – such as rest, play, outdoor events, public transport access – the scale and design of the space should be optimised to allow for continued ease of movement as well as the legibility and enjoyment of the additional landscaped feature(s). 51
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD2.1 The public realm in various parts of Newham reflects the character 
of the time they were constructed, and interventions should be sensitive to local character while enhancing functionality. The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) provides further guidance on the character of major routes through the borough. 
The arrangement of buildings and other features within a 
development should be organised so that inclusivity and safety are promoted from the onset of the design process. Design can have a significant impact of creating environments that discourage crime and help people to feel safe. Design solutions should be optimised first and foremost before any additional security interventions are considered. Features of good design that promote safety include: permeability and connectivity (choice of routes), clear sight lines along key routes; adequate enclosure and natural surveillance from neighbouring buildings; and good quality environmentally sensitive lighting. 
Engagement with London Borough of Newham Community 
Safety Team and the Metropolitan Police Service in relation to major schemes will identify any need for security infrastructure. These may be secured through a legal agreement or planning obligation. 
Accessibility and inclusivity should be achieved by following 
the Healthy Streets approach, and responding to relevant guidance– see Policy D2.2, ‘Highways design’ theme implementation guidance.

Design, materiality and maintenance.The following set of guidance documents (or their replacements) should be used in the design  of public realm interventions:53
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD2.2 In designing public realm interventions, the following locations should 
be prioritised for each design feature:
•  
  Gr
eening (including through Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems): 
should be optimised everywhere, with new floospace particularly maximised in areas of deficiency – see also the Green and Water Space chapter. 
•  
 Public s
ecure cycle parking: should primarily be directed to Town and 
Local Centres and along key movement corridors. See PolicyT2 and Policy T3. 
•  
 Se
ating and shelter: should be addressed in line with the results of 
the Healthy Streets assessment for the development proposed.
•  
 Ar
t installations (including murals): should be directed to Town and 
Local Centres, along key movement corridors, and in the setting of cultural or physical heritage.
•  
 Pl
ay equipment or features, including play streets: should be 
directed to areas of deficiency in play space, as part of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, and public spaces in Town and Local Centres. 
•  
 Cr
eative public lighting: should be prioritised in Town and Local 
Centres, along key movement corridors, and in the setting of cultural or physical heritage.
Responding to the policy requirement for publicly accessible play space of over five year olds should not lead to a reduction in the quantity or quality of play space required to service the development, including the need for doorstep play for children under fives. Provision of additional public play space to respond to identified deficiency in the area should be optimised, and may be cumulatively negotiated for different developments as part of masterplanning of larger sites.
In designing spaces for children and young people, alongside 
the guidance set out above, Policy GWS5 of this plan should be considered.D2.2 and designed to be welcoming. Design and positioning of gates and 
landscaping features should help invite people in, and avoid creating a feeling that the play space is intended only for the new residents.  
Opportunities for public art in open spaces should be considered at an 
early stage to ensure that it is satisfactorily integrated into the design of development and applicants should work with artists at an early stage of design. Where possible artists should be local to or have a connection to Newham or to east London. These should be designed and positioned so as not to obstruct pedestrian or cycle movements, and to make a positive contribution to the character of the local area, including recognition of local cultural or built heritage assets.  Where works of public art are sited in the public realm, their appropriate maintenance must be secured in perpetuity and their retention will be secured by condition or legal agreement.
D2.3 and D2.4 Interventions which promote active travel will be prioritised, including safety interventions and the creation of a coherent and consistent network of child-friendly routes. Early engagement with London Borough of Newham Highways team should help identify suitable local projects, including where contributions can be used to add value to existing programmes such as:
•  
 Lo
w Traffic Neighbourhoods public realm enhancements. (Low 
Traffic Neighbourhoods include those by-design as well as those 
created through highways interventions) 
•   Chil
d-friendly routes enhancement (including wayfinding) or creation, 
supporting (emerging) London Borough of Newham Highways ‘Healthy Streets’/School Streets programme. The routes should make use of less busy, less polluted streets linking homes to schools and play spaces. 
•  
 Netw
ork safety improvements, including feeling of safety 
enhancements.
•  Bus stop accessibility measures.54
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD2.5 Where new streets are proposed, space should be prioritised for 
active travel in line with Low Traffic Neighbourhood and child-friendly design principles, and should connect to and be a legible part of the wider hierarchy of streets. The carriageway and on-street car parking will not be considered towards public realm quantitative net gain. Pavements should be at least 3m wide and otherwise optimised for pedestrian comfort. 
The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) borough-wide design 
principles section includes further guidance.
D2.6 The maintenance and management requirements for non-adopted public ream must be included in the Public Realm Management Plan, and should follow the guidance set out in the Newham Streetscape Design Guide. 
In relation to public spaces the Public Realm Management Plan should 
follow the principles set out in the Greater London Authority’s Public London Charter, and will be enforced through legal agreement. 
All developments will be required to contribute towards the upkeep 
of the public realm enhancements made for a period of 10 years. The methodology for calculating the cost of upkeep will be in line with Highways processes (typically 10-15 per cent of the implementation cost will cover maintenance over 5-10 years). Monitoring

3.27 Successful place-making and the creation of happy, healthy and integrated communities in Newham requires careful management of development: optimising it in relation to the strengths and opportunities of the site and its neighbourhood, rather than maximising it or pursuing singular agendas. 
3.28 In line with the National Planning Policy 
Framework, this policy supports compact forms of development. A compact form of development is more likely to accommodate enough people to support shops, local facilities and viable public transport, maximise social interaction in a local area, and make it feel a safe, lively and attractive place. In this way, it may help to promote active travel to local facilities and services, so reducing dependence on the private car.
3.29 In line with the London Plan (2021), the Newham 
Characterisation Study (2022) has undertaken an analysis of the historic evolution, functional characters, urban morphology and socio-economic characteristics of the borough. These aspects are interpreted and evaluated to establish the capacity and likelihood for change for each part of the borough. 
3.30 The assessment reflects a granular survey of 
Newham at the level of the urban block, and results in mapping that divides the borough into three categories - conserve, enhance, and transform - 
56
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESwhich provide a framework to establish the intensity 
and type of change expected and adequate for each area. This process is based on an evaluation and assessment of character that is multifaceted and is not a designation or a rigid definition. It instead highlights in each area strengths, weaknesses and opportunities, contributing to establishing neighbourhood specific visions which reinforce, mitigate or address the characteristics highlighted in the large scale assessment.Implementation
D3.1 In reaching the optimum density for the site, the design must follow the process and principles set out in the emerging Greater London Authority, Optimising Site Capacity: A Design-led Approach London Plan Guidance. The Newham Characterisation Study (2022), alongside any other locally relevant guidance (e.g. Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plans) or design code will be used to ground the Greater London Authority principles into the Newham/site context. The Design and Access Statement will demonstrate how the process has been followed and how the principles have been achieved. The preferred density of development on site should be justified including consideration of the mix of uses and mix of housing typologies, and should be presented in a range of density calculation methods as recommended by London Plan (2021) Policy D3, including net Floor to Area Ratio (FAR)  
D3.2 
The Guidance Notes accompanying the draft National Model Design Code (2021) provides useful guidance about compact development (section B.1). 
See housing design standards Policy H11 for further standards to be considered.
D3:3 Outside of Tall Building Zones, in enhance and conserve areas, the height of new developments 
should not be above 21m and should be guided by the sensitivity of the character (to conserve 
or enhance character), and the prevailing height of the context. In conserve areas, the scale and massing of new development should follow the character that should be conserved. In enhance areas, heights should generally follow the prevailing height of the context, where a cohesive urban form has been identified. Further guidance is provided in the Newham Characterisation Study (2022).
D3.4, D3.5 and D3.6Conserve areas are defined as areas that have a high quality and valued character that should be maintained.
Transform areas are defined as areas that have the conditions to establish a new character.Enhance areas are defined as areas of mixed quality where new developments can provide positive 
enhancements to the overall character and moderate uplift in density as part of development. 
57
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD3.4, 
D3.5 and D3.6Newham Characterisation Study (2022) Chapter 7 sets out in more detail the specific characteristics and design considerations for areas to be transformed, which are then presented at neighbourhood level in Chapter 8. The design and access statement should set out how the specific ‘transform’ character of the site has informed the masterplanning and detailed design, having regard to neighbourhood vision and any relevant site allocation requirements. 
The design and access statement 
should address all of the borough-wide design guidance themes relevant to a ‘transform’, ‘enhance’ or ‘conserve’ character of the site, demonstrating how they have been addressed and balanced to contribute towards a successful, well integrated, healthy and functional neighbourhood. 
Where development seeks to alter the 
category that the site is attributed to through the Newham Characterisation Study (2022), this must be negotiated and agreed through pre-application and independent design review processes. Monitoring

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESMap of Newham’s 20 Tall Building Zones
Tall Building Zone reference number TBZXX65
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.31 There are many positive aspects to tall buildings 
which make them an attractive development. In the right context and with excellent architecture, tall buildings can help create distinctive, high quality places; offer the opportunity to build to higher densities, optimising development potential in light of local and strategic needs. They can also help cross subsidise affordable housing, and employment-generating uses or community facilities in an intensely used and vibrant development that activates the surrounding area and makes new infrastructure viable. Finally, they can secure the redevelopment of small sites with high land values, or sites which need to accommodate open space alongside optimising housing delivery.
3.32 Conversely, a poorly designed tall building, 
or a tall building in the wrong place, may create an isolated mono-community with little social interaction within the building and with the wider community in the area. The economics of building a taller building with its higher service charges may not necessarily optimise the housing opportunities available to residents in the borough. There may also be problems of ‘sense of ownership’ and intensity of use of communal areas if not designed appropriately.
3.33 The location, scale and suggested height of 
each Tall Building Zone reflects the findings of the Newham Characterisation Study (2022) across the different parts of the borough and considers the importance of Town and Local Centres as hearts of their neighbourhoods. Tall Building Zones predominantly reflect site allocations, reflecting their status as transform areas of the borough and following a plan led-approach to identifying suitable locations for tall buildings as per the London Plan (2021). 
Implementation
D4.1 Tall buildings definition follows that of the London Plan (2021), as adapted to the Newham context 
– at least seven storeys from the ground to the topmost of the buildings, with all levels considered at 3m each and a further 1m allowance for parapets, equipment or other elements, i.e. 22m height.  
The tall buildings definition covers all buildings of 22m measured from the ground to the very top 
of the building, irrespective of use or internal floor arrangements. 
D4.2 A Tall Building Zone designation does not mean that all development within it can or should be 
delivered as tall buildings. Masterplanning, townscape and skyline analysis, alongside technical performance, will be required to demonstrate added value of new and further tall elements. The height of the context alone cannot be considered justification for new tall buildings, or for new buildings being as tall or taller than the existing and committed development. 
In N18 Stratford and Maryland and N5 Canning Town neighbourhoods tall building clusters are 
considered to be approaching skyline saturation point, due to the scale of recent development. Here, cumulative impact of heights will be assessed going forward. New tall buildings should be below established heights and help address microclimate, skyline and wayfinding considerations of the cluster as a whole. 
Site allocations will provide additional design guidance with respect to each Tall Building Zone and 
the Newham Characterisation Study (2022) borough-wide design guidance includes tall building design considerations more generally. Development of tall buildings outside of the Tall Building Zones will be considered a departure from the plan.  66
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD4.3 London Plan (2021) Policy D9 sets out a comprehensive list of 
criteria for tall buildings to meet which addresses visual, functional, 
environmental and cumulative impacts. All of these should be demonstrated in a tall buildings section of the design and access statement, with sufficient detail to undertake a full assessment under every consideration. For early pre-application discussions, a methodology paper for the technical assessments and a list of design principles should be submitted for negotiation, and followed through to detailed design.
Microclimate considerations, as per the London Plan (2021), include: •  
 Da
ylight and sunlight penetration - assessed for buildings as per 
standard set in Policy D7, and for outdoor spaces assessed for 
seasonal pedestrian comfort in line with guidance set by the Newham Characterisation Study (2022).
•  
 Wind and air qua
lity – as per Policy CE6 and in line with the Newham 
Characterisation Study (2022) guidance for ‘Modelling for Air Quality Improvements’. Developers are encouraged to address wind microclimate issues at an early stage in their plans by appointing experienced consultants, discussing with planning officers and commissioning early-stage studies to quantify the wind microclimate conditions. Wind tunnel or computational fluid dynamics testing may be required where the tall building is: at least twice the height of prevailing surrounding buildings, or sensitive pedestrian activities are intended (e.g. public spaces, transport hubs, etc.), or the project is located on an exposed location (e.g. edge of Thames), or the proposal creates or adds to a cluster of tall buildings.  
•  
 T
emperature and humidity conditions around the building – will be 
assessed for seasonal pedestrian comfort in line with Transport for London guidance for Healthy Streets. 
•  Noise – assessed as per standards set in Policy D7.D4.3 A combined assessment of wind, sunlight, temperature and humidity 
conditions at different times throughout the year is recommended to facilitate an understanding of perceived thermal comfort at pedestrian level. 
Modelling must be undertaken of the full cluster of tall buildings 
proposed, taking account of the existing and emerging context, and where relevant at stages of the phased delivery, together with any temporary measures necessary to mitigate temporary impacts.  
The London Plan (2021) policy also promotes the incorporation of free 
to enter publicly-accessible areas, and particularly viewing platforms at higher levels. In Newham, these would be considered appropriate in town centre locations.  Where roof terraces and gardens are publicly accessible, entrances should not result in safety or security concerns, create congestion or adversely impact on the environmental quality at street level. Security implications should be considered at the design stage of the development, including making provision for security checks within the development, where required. Opening hours may be managed by condition or agreement, particularly where there are residential premises nearby. Roof terraces should not significantly increase noise levels, or result in unacceptable light spillage in areas with residents or other sensitive uses.
The Newham Design Review Panel should assess all tall building 
proposals. All buildings above 32m in height will also need to receive sign-off from the Panel to be considered of the highest quality in line with policy requirements, in line with the London Plan (2021) requirement.67
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD4.3 As and when a Community Design Review Panel (or Youth panel) is 
established by the Council, all tall building proposals will also need 
to be reviewed by this panel(s) before progressing to the Newham Design Review Panel. The Newham Design Review Panel will need to be satisfied that the views of the Community Panel have been reflected in the design presented. 
D4.4 Tall buildings should generally be integrated with lower rise buildings in order to help generate adequate enclosure to spaces. The scale of the base/shoulder building should be directly proportional to the scale of the street, and 1:1 is the most appropriate scale to secure positive micro-climate and a human scale of development. Where a free-standing tall building is proposed, the first two levels should be designed with greater attention to detail and in a way that directly responds to the character of the street.
It is critical that the tall elements are integrated into the context 
providing adequate scale transitions to the surrounding buildings and protecting local micro-climate. 
Microclimate considerations are addressed in Part 3 implementation. Monitoring

3.34 New developments in Newham are often delivered at higher density than the density of the neighbourhoods in which they are located. While high density development is not unique to Newham, the volume of development land available means that there are significant and ongoing transformations taking place in large parts of the borough.  This policy aims to introduce clear quality criteria that must be met in order for high density development to positively respond to Newham’s needs and aspirations, and particularly to ensure neighbourhoods can sustain health and wellbeing of residents throughout their life. 
3.35 The London Plan (2021) promotes ‘higher density’ 
development in areas of opportunity and areas with good public transport accessibility level such as town centres. Higher density is identified as 350 units per ha. However, a review of recent planning applications in Newham has highlighted a need for a locally-specific definition that better accounts for Newham’s character. A density of 250 units/ha is considered appropriate. 
3.36 The network of routes and spaces, the scale, 
form, architectural expression and detailed design of buildings, together with the use of particular building materials, and the contribution of these elements to the composition of street blocks are characteristic of, and combine to produce compact and intricate townscape. This policy is complementary to housing standards set by Policy H11.    Implementation
D5.1 Application of Policy D3 will determine if the proposed high density is acceptable in the location. 
Where the principal of high density 
development (250u/ha) is acceptable, the Design and Access statement should demonstrate how the principles of public realm net gain and the servicing needs of the uses and quantum proposed have been understood and secured in principle from the early stages of brief development to the detailed design stage. 
For mixed use schemes density should 
also be calculated as net FAR, in line with the guidance set in the Newham Characterisation Study (2022). FAR should be used to understand perceived density of development, in addition to housing density. 
The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) 
provides further relevant design guidance under the borough-wide design guidance chapter.
Post-occupancy surveys will be used to 
monitor the successful application of this policy, and results from early phases should be used to inform the design of later stages of development. 69
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD5.2 In designing the site, detailed consideration will be given to how the 
development integrates with the special characteristics of its locality. 
All development proposals are expected to have a high standard of design and architectural detailing. In high density developments, the public realm and communal spaces will need to be multi-functional and should be designed for the higher intensity of use and a range of functions (e.g. play spaces may also be Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems). The perception of high density should be mitigated through:
•  
 Good perme
ability and connectivity, complemented by diversity 
in the public realm. Integration of a range of public spaces will be 
important, some designed for quiet and rest, other designed for higher intensity of activity such as sports, play or local events.   
•  
 P
avements designed for pedestrian comfort in line with expected 
footfall and supported by positive micro-climate. Retaining as far as possible a 1:1 street to prevailing building height scale will help ensure a pedestrian friendly environment with good views of the sky. Microclimate should be further enhanced through landscaping (e.g. street trees) and building massing.  
•  
   High qua
lity private internal and external amenity, as per Policy H11. 
The Newham Design Review Panel should assess all high density proposals. The panel should be satisfied that the principles of good quality design, including residential housing standards, have been well balanced for the intensity of use (density) proposed.  
As and when a cCmmunity Design Review panel (or Youth Panel) is 
established by the Council, all tall building proposals will also need to be reviewed by this panel before progressing to the Newham Design Review Panel. The Newham Design Review Panel will need to be satisfied that the views of the Community Panel have been reflected in the design presented. Monitoring

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  D6: Shopfronts and advertising
1.  Shopfr onts and signage incorporated within 
frontages should be designed in a way that 
maintains active frontages and that:
 
 a.
  r
espects and enhances the character of the 
streetscape through use of proportions, materials and details that seek to integrate and create a consistent pattern; and
 
 b.
  r
espects the architectural proportions and 
elements of the host building as a whole, including restoration of lost features such as stall risers and fascias. Where a business occupies more than one unit, or a mezzanine/upper floors, each frontage should be treated individually, linked visually by a common design and materiality that does not obstruct architectural features of the building; and
 
 c.
  minimis
es signage and clutter, including visual 
impact of security measures, and principally retains visual permeability through the ground floor shopfront; and
 
 d.
  f
acilitates wheelchair access through location 
and size of entrance(s), and forecourt space decluttering. Subdivision of shopfronts will be resisted where it does not allow for this criteria to be met; and
 
 e.
  ins
et entrances on shopfronts are 
transparently glazed and well-lit; and
 
 f
.
  int
egrates louvres and plant into the shopfront 
design so that it is easy to access and maintain. 2.
  Adv
ertisements including hoardings, illumination 
of hoardings, illuminated fascia signs, free-standing display panels and digital displays that require consent must, singularly and cumulatively:
 
 a.
  a
void causing a public safety hazard 
or creating clutter or confusion in the streetscape, or lead to loss of amenity; and
 
 b.
  be s
ensitive to the visual impact on the 
host building or structure and on the street scene. Advertisements integrated into street furniture will not normally be permitted; and
 
 c.
  us
e quality materials and optimise colours 
and patterns to allow the message to be easily read; and
 
 d.
  no
t cause light pollution into nearby 
residential properties and wildlife habitats. Flashing internal or external illumination will not be permitted; and
 
 e.
  the maximum v
alue of luminance anywhere 
on the surface of an advertisement at any time during the night follows Institution of Lighting Professionals recommended limits and should not exceed 1000cd/m2.Justification
3.37 Shopfronts are important elements in the townscape and can contribute significantly to the street scene. The design of a shopfront should recognise this and be appropriate to, or enhance, the building and its location. It should respect the design of the building and not obscure, or result in damage to, existing architectural features. A number of high streets have shopfronts of heritage significance, and these are noted in the Neighbourhoods chapter of the Plan.
3.38 Not all types of advertising require consent 
from the Council – a helpful guide was published by the government (available from publishing.service.gov.uk ).  Advertising should not be of a size 
or sited so that it appears brash, over-dominant or incongruous either on its own or cumulatively. With digital display technology increasingly playing a part in advertising, street scene and amenity impacts from artificial light and use of moving/changing picture displays also needs to be addressed. One sign on its own may have a minimal impact on the street scene however many signs may have a negative impact and create confusing environments, particularly for photosensitive people.
 71
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD6.1 Shopfronts should be engaging and help liven activity on high streets. 
Shop signage should generally be limited to the strip above the main 
shopfront and below the upper floor, plus one projecting sign at the same height. Further signage should be small scale, consolidated and limited to publicly relevant information (hours of operation, safety and hygiene information). 
Required security measures should be internal to limit their visual 
impact on shopfronts. External security shutters are not normally acceptable. Internal shutters should be perforated to enable visibility into the shop and passive surveillance. 
To enliven frontages and enable passive surveillance, all retail frontages 
should provide good visibility and glazing should not be blanked out. The installation of security glass and steel reinforced frontages will be considered in the context of the impact on the appearance and historic significance of the shopfront.
Accessibility of shopfronts/entrances should apply Building Regulations 
Part M for non-residential, which normally only covers new-builds and extensions, but every opportunity should be taken to enhance accessibility of Newham’s high streets. 
Ventilation systems in new build premises for extracting and dispersing 
any emissions and cooking smells must be discharged at roof level and designed, installed, operated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer’s specification in order to prevent smells and emissions adversely affecting neighbours. For changes of use, developers and/or occupiers should investigate the potential to vent emissions to the roof. D6.1 Where it can be demonstrated that venting of such emissions to 
the roof is not practical, venting to an adjacent footway will only be acceptable where the extraction system is of the highest specification for odour abatement and there is no adverse impact on neighbours by virtue of smells or other emissions. Other ventilation louvres should not be sited by adjoining footways.
D6.2 Advertisement applications will be assessed on the basis of accurate drawings or photo montages of the wider street frontage showing location and type of existing shopfronts and advertisements – 25m either direction, and including the frontage adjacent. 
The design of advertising material should respect its locality and 
use appropriate materials of high quality. Advertisements should be appropriate to the frontage served and should not include static or moving projection of images beyond the frontage, such as laser projections and projections on building façades, to protect visual amenity and public safety. Advertisements above ground level are detrimental to the appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and can detract from the character and qualities of individual buildings by obscuring architectural features. 
Hand-painted signs are easily implemented and relatively affordable. 
They provide greatest scope for individuality and are especially suitable where traditional character is important. So too are hanging signs. These can be suspended from the fascia or above. Always seek to retain any original sign of historic merit.
Illumination of advertisements should be discreet and incorporate LEDs 
to reduce the overall bulk and energy use of signage. Particular care will be necessary with advertisements on or in the setting of listed buildings and within conservation areas. Internal illumination of advertisements in such areas will not normally be permitted.Implementation72
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD6.2 Use of flags and banners on building frontages for advertising will 
not normally be permitted. 
The illumination levels of advertisements should be in accordance 
with the guidance set by the Institute of Lighting Engineers PLG05 The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements, and post-delivery assessment should be undertaken and submitted to the Local Planning Authority to discharge condition. Sensitive and biophilic lighting is encouraged.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  D7: Neighbourliness
1.  Al l development is expected to achieve good 
neighbourliness from the outset by avoiding 
negative and maximising positive social and environmental impacts of design on neighbours on and off the site. This is of particular importance in the following contexts:
 
 a.
  ne
w residential developments within 
or adjacent the Evening and Night Time Economy Zones (Policy HS5), which should be carefully located, designed and buffered so as to not impede the development of a successful evening and night time economy, in line with Agent of Change principles. Detailed attention will need to be given in the location and design of sensitive receptors such as care homes and older people housing; and
 
 b.
  ne
w development on or adjacent to 
designated and non-designated employment locations, which should demonstrate neighbourliness in design and layout and to ensure they do not compromise current operational functions of employment uses and the function and viability of any employment designation; and
 
 c.
  ne
w and re-provided community facilities 
outside of Town Centres, which should demonstrate neighbourliness in design and layout.
2.
  Chang
e brought about by development must not 
cause problems for existing lawful neighbours, otherwise known as an ‘Agent of Change’ approach.3.
  P
articular attention should be given to the 
 need to:
  a.  create a safe and secure environment 
by reducing the likelihood of antisocial behaviour, promoting public safety (including road safety), improving security and lessening the fear of crime; and
 
 b.
  a
void unacceptable exposure to light 
pollution (including light spillage), odour, dust, noise, disturbance, vibration, radiation and other amenity or health impacting pollutants; and
 
 c.
  ensur
e integration with the street scene 
including consideration for visual and amenity impact of: advertisements and signage; boundary treatments; parking provision; external storage; plant housing and the quality of materials; and
 
 d.
  pr
otect the locality from adverse 
microclimate effects (such as wind tunnelling and heat island effects); and
 
 e.
  minimis
e interference with broadcasting and 
other telecommunications services.
 
 f
.
  Ensur
e adequate access to daylight and 
sunlight; and

of privacy, overshadowing, and overbearing massing on neighbouring residential properties; and
 
 h.
  Mitig
ate impact of construction and 
industrial operations – dust, mud, noise, vibration, traffic and hours of operation. 
4.
   Al
l developments should seek compliance with 
the standards and technical guidance set out in Table 2 where they are relevant to development proposals. 
5.   A Management Plan should be submitted where 
mechanical solutions are proposed to mitigate identified amenity impacts of intended use. This should set out how the equipment will be maintained to avoid breakdown.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.39 Newham is a mixed use borough, with many 
neighbourhoods comprising already compact forms of development. In parts of the borough, further change is planned, including introduction of residential uses in areas previously focused on more industrial uses. These are positive elements that offer opportunities for economic and social interaction, and are basic requirements of successful 15-minute neighbourhoods  Nevertheless, many of the matters that people are concerned with in respect of new development are ‘neighbour related’ amenity and ‘Agent of Change’ impacts and linked to very specific aspects of design. 
3.40 All scales of development (including domestic 
extensions, or conversions and changes of use), have the potential to impact upon neighbours and the neighbourhood from the start of construction through to the on-going operation of a site. This policy addresses a range of neighbourliness issues and sets out appropriate responses ranging from designing out (mitigation) to designing in (attention to detail), in order for development to contribute positively to neighbourliness.
3.41 The environmental standards and design guidance 
set out in the policy should assist developers in 
the creation of successful, healthy and safe places through the use of recognised quality benchmarks and standards which in turn are used to help assess developments’ neighbourliness.D7.1 The policy intention is that applicants should pay attention to the environmental, social and design based impacts of their proposals on neighbourliness within the site and in the immediate area. Early consideration of these matters will be encouraged through pre-application advice/design review, and as part of masterplanning of large sites where detailed designs are proposed to be addressed at a later stage.
Mixed use, higher density development provides many benefits and is necessary to achieve 
the principles of 15-minute neighbourhoods. However, uses are not always compatible when directly adjacent each other. Neighbourliness problems can be hard to address in established neighbourhoods. And while large scale mixed use developments allow for all interrelationships between uses to be considered through masterplanning, any poorly resolved detail can amplify to significant impact on the success of the new estate.
Increasing housing in town centres can deliver much needed homes in accessible locations and help 
support their vitality and viability. Despite this, it will be important to carefully locate and mitigate the impacts of a growing evening and night time economy. Residential developments in town centres should identify the location of Evenint and Night Time Economy uses (Policy HS5:2) and likely night time footfall routes close to the site that will need to be buffered through application of Agent of Change and neighbourliness principles.
To secure the long term viability of new employment floorspace and compatibility of proposals 
close to designated employment land, the policy requires applicants to demonstrate that proposed uses can successfully co-exist in the context of their site. Attention to context, design and layout of schemes (including as part of a site wide masterplan) will need to be carefully considered. This includes the location/positioning of noise sensitive uses, using buffering opportunities, servicing and yard space arrangements to support operational needs. This policy supports the implementation of the Agent of Change Principle as set out in London Plan Policy (2021) D13.
Proposals incorporating and intensifying industrial or schemes adjacent to industrial uses are 
expected to respond to the principles and design guidance set out in within the Newham Characterisation Study (2022)Implementation75
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD7.2  Agent of Change is defined in line with the London Plan (2021), as 
relating to the operational needs of lawful uses and including their 
amenity impacts of noise, odour/fumes, vibration, dust and other nuisances. Neighbours also include uses on-site that are retained, e.g. a restaurant is a neighbour in the case of a residential upwards extension on the same site.
Noise-generating uses and activities include, but are not limited to, 
schools, places of worship, sporting venues, offices, shops, industrial sites, waste sites, safeguarded wharves, rail and other transport infrastructure. Odour generation uses include, but are not limited to, premises for the preparation of hot food and drink that utilise an extraction flute.
In promoting an Agent of Change approach to new development, it 
is important that consultation takes place with existing operators/occupiers to ensure that new development is deliverable and that the two uses are able to operate alongside each other. It is important that not just the physical neighbours, but also the river, air and highway traffic regulated by the Port of London Authority , Civic Aviation Authority  and Transport for London are also be consulted. 
The Agent of Change approach should not be construed as offering 
a licence to existing operators and occupiers for the unfettered intensification of disturbance- generating activity or other unreasonable behaviour: it is assumed that uses should be operating lawfully and reasonably, and that standards apply to any application for further intensification of the use. 
D7.3 Proposals should be accompanied by statements detailing their response to the components of neighbourly development as relevant to the scheme, and in design and management terms.
 D7.3 Information should be sufficient to make adequate assessment against the required guidance and standards. Where necessary, neighbourliness measures will be secured by condition and/or legal agreement.
Development has the potential to positively or adversely affect the 
level of lighting in the surrounding area, so the lighting scheme should be incorporated into the detailed design process at an early stage. Intensity, colour, scale and glare are all factors to be considered. Sensitively designed lighting schemes should improve accessibility for those with disabilities by reducing glare and excessive contrast. Lighting can support the prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour and improve the perception of personal security, and this should be balanced with the need to avoid light spillage onto urban green spaces to protect biodiversity. Well-designed lighting schemes on commercial properties can help create an attractive night-time townscape and enhance the experience for visitors, whilst avoiding disturbance to residents.
Ventilation systems in new build premises for extracting and dispersing 
any emissions and cooking smells must be discharged at roof level and designed, installed, operated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer’s specification in order to prevent smells and emissions adversely affecting neighbours. For changes of use, developers and/or occupiers should investigate the potential to vent emissions to the roof. Where it can be demonstrated that venting of such emissions to the roof is not practical, venting to an adjacent footway will only be acceptable where the extraction system is of the highest specification for odour abatement and there is no adverse impact on neighbours by virtue of smells or other emissions.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD7.3 Other ventilation louvres should 
not be sited by adjoining footways. Developments should incorporate suitable off-street facilities for smokers wherever possible to avoid the need for smokers to congregate on the pavements.
Expert advice will be taken within the 
Council or relevant partners to support these assessments and to ensure proposals are of the highest quality and address neighbourly development from the outset, and these benchmarks, standards and guidance documents are important to make that assessment. Where a development concerns an existing building (through conversion, extension, change of use) which does not meet such standards, this will be a consideration in itself when assessing its suitability for the proposed change.

Justification
3.42 Newham currently has relatively few Conservation Areas, Listed Parks and Gardens and Listed Buildings, partly due to Newham’s relatively recent urbanisation. The scarcity of both designated and non-designated heritage (when compared to other London boroughs) makes it all the more important that their value and the value of their setting is protected and enhanced, recognising their value in placemaking, cultural and social representation, and more localised way-finding.  
3.43 The National Planning Policy Framework and the 
London Plan (2021) in turn place great importance on preserving and enhancing the significance of Conservation Areas. Alongside greater control of development, research
1 also indicates that there 
are important community wellbeing and economic regeneration benefits from designation including the generation of local employment opportunities, local awareness activities generating community cohesion and increased interest in the local area.  
3.44 This policy seeks to ensure that Newham’s 
important historic townscapes continue to be protected and enhanced.

Areas on Value, London School of Economics; Historic England, Heritage Counts annual reports.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD8.1 Conservation Area is an area of special architectural or historic 
interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable 
to be preserved or enhanced. In Newham there are currently 9 Conservation Areas:
•  Durham Road conservation area, Manor Park, E12 
•  East Ham conservation area, E6 •  Forest Gate Town Centre conservation area, E7 •  Romford Road conservation area, Forest Gate, E7 •

Conservation Area designation introduces additional controls over the way owners/occupiers can alter or develop their properties, including:
•  
 Requir
ement for planning permission for demolition of unlisted 
buildings.
•  
 Restric
tion on the types of development that can be carried out 
without planning permission. 
•  
 De

or appearance of the conservation area.
•  
 Prior no

•  Additional planning controls for advertisements and signs.D8.1 The Council will continue its programme of Conservation Area 
Appraisal which may result in further area designations and updates 
to Appraisals and Management Plans.
Design and Access Statements (and pre-application information 
packs) should respond to the various aspects of character as set out in the Newham Characterisation Study (2022) and relevant Appraisal and Management Plan. 
D8.2 Areas of Townscape Value are parts of Newham’ townscape 
that have a character or appearance that is of local architectural and historic interest, warranting differentiation and from their surrounding area. Some of these areas may have the potential to be designated as new conservation areas in the future, particularly where listed or locally listed buildings form part of the setting.

Priority Areas
1.  Al l major applications on sites at or below 0.5ha 
within designated Archaeological Priority Areas 
Tiers 1 to 3, as mapped on the Policies Map, and all major applications on sites above 0.5ha anywhere in the borough, must submit an archaeological desk based assessment, and if necessary a field evaluation, to accompany a planning application. 
2.
  Minor and hous
eholder applications resulting in 
ground excavation/piling in Tier 1 areas must also submit an archaeological desk based assessment to accompany a planning application.
3.
  Wher
e field evaluation(s) identifies heritage assets 
of archaeological interest, development must:
 
 a.
 document the signific
ance of the asset; and
 
 b.
  s
ecure the protection of the asset, with 
priority given to in-situ display visible from the public realm. Planning Obligations
•  Wher e necessary, secure arrangements for the 
documentation, registration and protection and display of any identified heritage assets of archaeological interest.
Justification
3.45 Local authorities have a duty to conserve the historic environment by ensuring local plan policies are in place to identify what is important and how to manage changes to it. This includes archaeological heritage. The Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service, part of the London office of English Heritage has identified Archaeological Priority Areas in Newham where known heritage assets of archaeological interest are concentrated or where there is clear potential for new discoveries based on the history of the area and previous archaeological investigations. 
3.46 Archaeological Priority Areas are sorted into 4 
tiers and are justified by a statement of significance which indicates the nature of the interest to be considered. Their primary purpose is to help highlight at an early stage where a development proposal may affect a heritage asset of archaeological interest.

Further information on the character of each Archaeological Priority Area 
is included in the Newham Archaeological Priority Areas Appraisal (2014).
The relevant consultation and investigation expectations that accompany 
an Archaeological Priority Area designation (set out by Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service) should be complied with. Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service offer a pre-application service which may provide additional guidance in relation to the specific site.
Local planning authorities are requested to consult Greater London 
Archaeology Advisory Service on:
• 
 Al
l major planning applications over 0.5 hectares whether in an 
Archaeological Priority Area or not.
• 
 Al

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD9.1 It should be noted that archaeological projects have a well-established history of enabling 
successful community engagement and applicants are encouraged to consider how community engagement can occur where heritage assets of archaeological interest have been identified.
D9.2 The relevant consultation and investigation expectations that accompany an Archaeological 
Priority Area designation (set out by Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service) should be complied with. 
Local planning authorities are requested to consult Greater London Archaeology Advisory 
Service on:
• 
 Minor pl
anning applications in any Archaeological Priority Areas 
   tiers 1 to 3.• 
 Domestic bas
ement applications in Archaeological Priority Areas tiers 1 and 2 only. 
• 
 Hous
eholder and equivalent-scale very minor applications in Archaeological Priority Areas 
tier 1 only.
Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service offers a free pre-application service which may provide the relevant support for undertaking a desk-based assessment in the case of minor developments without the need for further research.  
In less sensitive or smaller schemes, a watching brief involving a professional archaeologist 
monitoring development groundworks and recording any remains exposed may be appropriate instead of field evaluation
D9.3 Consideration of significance and any potential harm will be undertaken in line with the tests set out in the National Planning Policy Framework.Publicity and publication of results as well as housing the archive of finds are often also a key part of mitigating the archaeological impact of a development. Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service is often unable to advise that a development has been fully in compliance with a planning condition until these aspects have been secured. Finds and records from archaeological investigations in London are normally deposited with the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre. Evidence base

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD10: Designated and 
non-designated heritage assets, ancient monuments and historic parks and gardens
1.  Al l designated and non-designated heritage assets 
will be conserved and enhanced. Development 
should secure viable, sustainable and appropriate futures for them, particularly where they are ’at Risk’. Any change to them or their setting should not undermine their significance and the contribution of their settings to that significance, seeking to increase their presence and encourage wider appreciation and access to them.
2.
  De
velopment that singularly or cumulatively leads 
to harm or loss of designated heritage assets or their setting will be resisted. Where loss is justified by substantial public benefits arising from the proposal, conditions will be used to secure timely delivery of the public benefits. 
3.
  The c
ouncil will encourage the retention, repair and 
reuse of non-designated heritage assets. Significant harm or loss of non-designated heritage assets should be avoided. Where significant harm or loss is justified, the existing historic fabric should be documented and archived in line with National Planning Policy Framework requirements.  4.
  De
velopments affecting Newham’s Historic Parks 
or their setting should:
 
 a.
  s
eek to protect and enhance key views out 
from the landscape; and 
 
 b.
  no
t detract from its public access, 
functionality and enjoyment, layout, design, or character; and
  c.  not prejudice future restoration; and
 
 d.
  mak
e a positive contribution to the historic 
streetscape of the park. Justification
3.47 The importance of protecting, conserving and enhancing both designated heritage assets and those more informally recognised, together with their setting, is key to effective place-making. The former includes those buildings, monuments, structures, parks, etc., that are subject to national listing/scheduling; the latter includes Locally Listed buildings and buildings that are yet not on the local register but the development management processes uncover their heritage value.
3.48 The significance of a building or feature only 
becomes apparent with further research and physical investigation. Their value includes adding interest and legibility, (as landmarks) to an area; the contribution to community building as a focus for community memory and activity and the economic contribution they make as a visitor attractions either individually or as part of a place for spending time and money in.
3.49 This policy recognises that all these types of 
heritage assets are sensitive to change which may directly or indirectly affect them. Moreover, many of Newham’s heritage assets are underperforming. Either due to a lack of integration with the wider environment, including other assets, which means their settings detract from them or they are in disrepair or they are underused or barriers effect access to them. Therefore, the policy highlights the importance of composition - ensuring coherent and sensitive ensembles of assets and their settings, as well as innovation to sensitively address evolving circumstances, including climate change. 
85
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESD10.1 Proposals to repair, alter or extend designated and non-designated 
heritage assets must be justified and contribute to the protection and 
enhancement of the significance of the asset.
Proposals within the setting of designated assets should seek to create 
positive relationships, particularly where the significance of the setting has been lost. 
Innovation includes appropriate deployment of ‘meanwhile’ uses and 
other suitable measures to activate spaces and structures to help bring them back into people’s day-to-day experience of places, improving safety and access, resilience to climate change and energy efficiency, and enabling immediate community benefit. However, any such change needs to be based on an understanding of the sensitivity to change of the asset affected, ensuring it is appropriately valued and accommodated in order to avoid causing harm to its significance. It is also recognised, that in new places, or places needing to find new purposes and economic and social futures, creating new assets, for example through arts-and-culture-led regeneration will be beneficial.
D10.2 and D10.3Consideration of significance and any potential harm will be undertaken in line with the tests set out in the National Planning Policy Framework.
A Heritage Statement must be submitted outlining the significance of 
the assets and evidence as to why harm is necessary or unavoidable, and all alternatives considered. 
Development which does not respond to local character and design 
quality as required by the wider policies of this Plan and the London Plan (2021), and is considered over-development, cannot be seen to justify harm to heritage assets by reason of the number of homes provided.D10.2 and D10.3Public benefits that could justify harm include:•
  Pr
ovision of affordable housing over and above that required by 
Policy H2. 
•
  Responding t
o the climate emergency (and is demonstrated to be 
the least harmful approach to deliver the required retrofit, in line with Historic England guidance). 
•
  Pr
oviding public access to previously inaccessible heritage assets.
•
  Bringing the as
set into viable use where all other alternatives to 
secure the future of the asset have been exhausted.
However, harm resulting in loss of an assets should be avoided. 
Where demolition or loss of features associated with the significance 
of the asset is proposed, detailed plans and photographic evidence, alongside any relevant objects of significance identified on site, will be submitted to Newham Archives. Planning obligations will secure the costs associated with the storing of the items.  
D10.4 Consideration of significance and any potential harm will be 
undertaken in line with the tests set out in the National Planning Policy Framework.
Proposals should help manage the impact of the historic tall walls 
around the park(s) which are a feature of their character but may also create extensive inactive frontages.
Ancillary uses such as caretaker homes and tree nurseries should also 
be protected where they are considered to be integral to the historic importance of the park.  86

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHIGH STREETS
3.50 Newham has six existing, protected Town 
Centres: Stratford (including Stratford City), East Ham, Green Street, Forest Gate, Canning Town and East Beckton. These large destinations are complemented by a network or smaller Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades which are also protected through policy. Beyond the designated network remain significant sections of historic commercial frontages that provide further choice for residents and a source of affordable floorspace for businesses, though often these frontages can feel less organised and less well maintained.  Within Beckton and Gallions Reach neighbourhoods, retail parks provide large scale retail offering that is mostly accessible by car.  3.51 Newham’s high streets offer a range of functions of vital importance to the daily lives of our communities, and their varied character and size, alongside their transport connectivity, provides choice and helps connect people across neighbourhoods. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of access to a range of local services usually available on our high streets, as well as the importance of quality public realm to help support and attract activity. The pandemic has also accelerated a number of behavioural trends which, alongside recent changes in national planning legislation and policy, pose challenges for our high streets.3.52 The more successful high streets have been those 
that can support a strong independent retail and leisure offer, local cultural events, markets, meanwhile uses and pop-ups, which draw in a more diverse range of people. As we move into new working patterns, with more people working from home for most of the week, this is driving new footfall patterns in Town and Local Centres.
3.53 High street environments also offer 
opportunities for social interaction to help tackle mental health and social isolation, and space to showcase the cultural diversity of the borough. But high levels of traffic, crime and fear of crime, lack of access to health promoting food and services, and inaccessible design can negatively impact on health. It is therefore important for the Local Plan to consider the high streets’ environment holistically, from management of uses, to shopfronts and public realm design.
3.54 The policies in this chapter seek to ensure 
Newham’s high streets and shopping locations can evolve and thrive and continue to meet the shopping, social and civic needs of our growing population. Key to achieving this is ensuing that high streets and shopping areas are at the heart of our 15-minute neighbourhoods. This section contains the following policies:•

2.
  Ne
w development for the provision of main town centre uses within N1.SA1 
Beckton Riverside, must be accompanied, and informed, by masterplanning of the new Town Centre. This will be achieved through:
 
 a.
  Resisting incr
emental change to the composition of existing Gallions Reach 
Shopping Park, which remains an out of centre retail park. 
 
 b.
  The mast
erplanning of a legible new Town Centre environment that meets 
the following principles: 
 
   i.
  The o
verall number, scale and mix of town centre uses should 
reflect the intended District status in the Town Centre Network, and be supported by an Impact Assessment, a Marketing Strategy and a Meanwhile Use Strategy.   
 
   ii.
  The Primary Shopping Ar
ea is established on the part of the site 
with the highest planned PTAL, and a minimum of PTAL 3.
 
   iii.
  C
ommercial frontages within the Primary Shopping Area should be 
continuous, along the key footfall route(s), and supported by quality public realm with good permeability and connectivity.
 
   iv
.
  The phas
ed delivery of the town centre uses ensures coordination 
with the level of need arising from housing delivery in its catchment.  91
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  3.  De velopment within the areas identified to deliver 
new and extended Local Centres, within boundaries 
mapped on the Policies Map, should contribute to the masterplanned delivery of the centres by applying the following principles: 
 
 a.
  The s
cale of the Local Centre will be of at 
least 20 units. The units will be between 80 sqm and 150 sqm GIA each. 
 
 b.
  A medium sized f
ood store of 500-800 sqm 
GIA floorspace may be appropriate, subject to passing the Impact Assessment. 
 
 c.
  The t
otal retail and leisure floorspace will 
respond to local need (400 metre radius) as demonstrated through an Impact Assessment.
 
 d.
  A w
ell-resourced and evidenced Marketing 
Strategy and Meanwhile Use Strategy will be put forward.
 
 e.
  C
ommercial frontages within the intended 
Primary Shopping Area should be continuous, along the key footfall route(s) integrating quality public realm, and supported by good permeability and connectivity.
 
 f
.
  Int
egrating existing buildings in non-
residential (or mixed) use where appropriate.
 
 g
.
  The c
entre has at least one bus stop within 
100 metres of its boundary.
 
 h.
  Any chang
e or expansion of the boundary is 
justified through masterplanning.
4.
  De
velopment within existing Neighbourhood 
Parades and newly delivered small scale frontages should ensure that:
    a.   The o verall parade remains of a 
neighbourhood scale, of between five and ten small units (80 to 150 sqm GIA) in use class E (Commercial, Business and Service). 
 
 b.
  Lo
ss of units, including through the merging 
of units, does not result in the overall number of units falling below five. 
 
 c.
  Any pr
oposal resulting in a retail unit with 
overall floorspace of 300 sqm or more GIA passes an Impact Assessment, and the use is limited through condition. Planning Obligations
•  On mast erplanned multi-phase sites delivering more 
than 5000 sqm of new town centre uses floorspace, a legal agreement will secure timely delivery of the commercial floorspace, proportionate to the scale of the residential phases of the development, and responding to evidence of existing need from the wider catchment where relevant.
Justification
3.55 Newham’s Town Centre network is not static, it is constantly evolving and adapting to market trends and legislative and policy interventions. Within the Plan period to 2038, evidence suggests the need to plan for and deliver new Town and Local Centres alongside continued management of the existing network. In line with National Planning Policy Framework and London Plan (2021) requirements, this policy identifies and protects, and in certain cases creates new, Town and Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades in strategic, accessible locations.
3.56 The Council, as expressed in the Towards a Better 
Newham: COVID-19 Recovery and Reorientation 
Strategy (2020), is committed to delivering 15-minute neighbourhoods. This builds on existing social trends, including the ‘shop local’ drive where residents support their local high streets, and particularly the small independent businesses, through their spending choices. This enables money to stay local for longer and contributes to community wealth building. 
92
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.57 Overall, the main objective of this policy is to 
deliver a network of vibrant Town Centres, Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades which offer unique and complementary experiences and that support choice within 15-minute neighbourhoods living. The Network’s accessibility criteria – the 400 metre radius and the 15 minutes walking distance – supports this objective, and has informed the designation process alongside the recommendations of the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022). New designations will be delivered through site allocations.
3.58 Locational data as well as resident feedback 
shows that there is a significant geographical gap in the range of services within easy reach of residents living south of the A13. Elsewhere, the offer of Local Centres still does not support everyone’s needs, with many residents choosing to travel well beyond 20 minutes for day-to-day activities and services. To help address the geographic imbalance, the policies in this chapter seek to create new clusters of main Town Centre uses in appropriate locations, primarily new Local Centres, but also one new Town Centre. 
3.59 Management of the scale and type of centre 
designation in the Town Centres hierarchy is an important consideration in maintaining a well-balanced network overall. The London Plan classifies the upper ranges of Town Centres where these service a wider than neighbourhood population, in essence District, Major, Metropolitan and International Centres. Newham’s Local Centre designations recognise that these centres are usually of importance primarily to Newham residents living or working within their catchment. However, footfall and spend evidence demonstrates that these centres also attract visitors reinforcing the need for these to receive a similar level of policy attention and protection as the larger Town Centres, in line with the National Planning Policy Framework definition of centres.
HS1.1 The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Plans to identify not only the boundaries of Town Centres, but also their Primary Shopping Areas that identify concentrations of retail provision. 
For new and expanded Town and Local Centres, please also see relevant neighbourhood policies and 
site allocations.
In determining if a proposed new shopping frontage is necessary to service local need, including in 
larger applications where it is proposed to split the provision of retail and leisure uses across parts of the site thereby generating multiple shopping frontages, the applicant should submit a gap analysis to demonstrate:•  
 A 400 metr
e radius around the proposed shopping frontage overlaps by less than 50 per cent with 
any other 400 metre radius of a designated location in the network (existing and new).  
•  
 The pr
oposed shopping frontage location helps achieve the aspiration for two destinations within 
15 minute walking isochrones. 
The Newham Characterisation Study (2022) Borough-wide Design Principles chapter includes further design recommendations (primarily under section 9.2.1 ‘Provide Local Uses That Support 15-Minute Neighbourhoods’) that should be considered when new shopping frontages are proposed.   
HS1.2 As part of the delivery of Beckton Riverside strategic allocation and through a co-designed 
masterplan process the offer of Gallions Reach Shopping Centre should be reconfigured into a modern Town Centre. This is in line with London Plan (2021) Policy SD7, which recognises the potential of retail parks to deliver housing intensification through redevelopment. The Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022) recommended that the retail capacity of the area should be retained and that the centre should target a District level centre. Implementation

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHS1.2 The location, scale, nature and mix of the new Town Centre may 
not reflect the location of the current retail park, and will need 
to be considered through the masterplanning and the planning application process in line with the site allocation. To inform this process, evidence will need to be provided in the form of a Retail and Leisure Impact Assessment, a Marketing Strategy and Meanwhile Use Strategy (as per Policy HS2). The submitted Impact Assessment will follow national planning guidance on scope and methodology. Impact Assessments should demonstrate that large scale development helps fill identified gaps in the network in the Beckton sub-area (as per the Retail and Leisure Assessment 2022) without significantly drawing trade away from established Town Centres, or jeopardising existing retail and leisure commitments (including in Local Centres in the catchment).
In the interim, while key masterplanning decisions are outstanding 
and particularly until commitment to the new DLR station is known, changes to Gallions Reach Shopping Centre will continue to be managed in line with policy requirements for an Out-of-Centre destination. In line with the National Planning Policy Framework and London Plan (2021), this means resisting piecemeal intensification of commercial floorspace.
Changes in composition towards convenience or leisure offer should 
also be resisted, protecting the effectiveness of planning conditions imposed on the site as part of the original allocation that help limit its impact on the Town Centre Network.
HS1.3 The important role of Local Centres across the borough is highlighted 
by the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022), attracting strong levels of convenience goods trade and helping ‘fill the gap’ in easy access to the larger Town Centres, and provide choice. Aside from retail and leisure uses, Local Centres can be crucial in providing a focus for community, cultural and civic life within neighbourhoods.HS1.3 It is important that newly developed Local Centres are of an 
appropriate scale to meet local needs, rather than delivering new ‘destination’ Town Centres that might compete with the wider network of Town Centres.
Floorspace need and commercial demand will be driven by the 
scale of housing and resulting population and expenditure within the local catchment area. This should be carefully considered within a retail and leisure Impact Assessment, considering the geographic context, scale of population, expenditure generated, physical layout, built form, target markets, accessibility, and nearby facilities. The submitted Impact Assessment will follow national planning guidance on scope and methodology.
Frontages should be designed in line with Policy D6.The public realm of the Primary Shopping Area (new or extended) 
should be designed to provide substantial public realm net gains in line with Policy HS2:10 and Policy D2. This includes generous pedestrian route connections, for good permeability and to direct high footfall to the Primary Shopping Area.
HS1.4 Neighbourhood Parades help achieve a fine-grained network of 
destinations within Newham’s Town Centre network. They support access to usually small basket/top-up shopping, day-to-day services, and food and drink leisure uses. While their scale is small, they still need to be of a size able to accommodate adaption and change in response to local needs and wider market trends. In line with the size of existing parades and the recommendations of the Newham Characterisation Study (Borough-wide Design Principles section 9.2.1), the minimum size of a Neighbourhood Parade and any recently delivered small shopping frontage should be five units, and the maximum size should be ten units. 94
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHS1.4 The size of each unit should be small, 
80-150 sqm GIA, so that trade draw 
remains local and does not begin to compete with the larger Local Centres and Town Centres.  
Where development proposes to 
introduce a larger retail unit of more than 300 sqm GIA, either through merging of existing units, extension or new provision, a Retail Impact Assessment will be required. Where the test is passed, conditions will be used to ensure that the unit continues to serve a local function and does not lead to unintended character change to the Neighbourhood Parade. In this regard, the retail floorspace should be limited to convenience goods sale, and should exclude change of use to leisure (Eb). Monitoring

Justification
3.60 This policy aims to secure the vitality and viability of Newham’s Town and Local Centres, by accommodating local needs and managing wider trends as recommended by the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022) and in line with the National Planning Framework and the London Plan (2021). 
3.61 The policy seeks to accommodate an increasing 
range of uses within the network of Town Centres, including community space, leisure facilities and housing, to help improve the sustainability and adaptability of Town Centres in the long term. However, this is balanced against the need to focus Commercial, Business and Services (Class E) within Primary Shopping Areas, and retain the core retail and leisure functions of Primary Shopping Areas, and particularly within the Primary Shopping Frontages, as recommended by the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022). 
© Andrew Baker97
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.64 The Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022) has 
identified a strong trend for affordability being a key factor in shopping destination choice, with discount stores performing strongly, and market stalls also being a key driver of footfall in the centres where they are established. Alongside this, there is a need to support small businesses to adapt to changing market trends. The policy responds by promoting an overall good supply of smaller sized units at affordable rents (80-150 sqm GIA) and the protection of the quality of existing units.    3.65 Against the backdrop of evolving retail and leisure trends, wider regeneration and land intensification forms a key part of the challenge in servicing existing and new communities. Vacancies and blank frontages, particularly when clustered together, can have a negative impact on the perception of place (including safety), reduce footfall, and long term may lead to antisocial behaviour along these frontages. The policy therefore introduces new tools in the form of a Market Strategy and a Meanwhile Use Strategy requirement to help manage longer term uncertainties in the market and secure the vitality of viability of both existing and future centres.
3.66 The policy also promotes the improved quality 
and activation of the public realm as a key part in expanding the offer of centres, in line with Policy D2, as well as making best use of refurbishment and redevelopment opportunities to deliver an enhanced Town Centre offer as well as increased footfall through new residential development.  HS2.1 Applicants should demonstrate as part of their Planning Statement, and where relevant as part of the Marketing Strategy (Part 8), how the proposed development and its scale responds to the character and function of the centre it is located in (or helps deliver). The function of centres within Newham’s network hierarchy, including aspirations, is set out in Policy HS1:1. On sites located in centres intended to primarily service a local catchment (District and Local Centres), the scale of development should respond to needs arising from the resident, tourist and worker population base within the catchment. Larger scale developments, including for leisure, tourism and culture main town centre uses, that are likely to generate trips from a much wider area should be directed to the centres that function at Major level or above - currently Stratford and East Ham, or be justified in a lower tier centre through an Impact Assessment demonstrating how the overall network of centres will be positively balanced. 
Development must also refer to the 
relevant Neighbourhood, Employment or Community Facilities policies and the strategies and reports listed below, as  Implementation3.62 Evidence suggests only 15 per cent of online shoppers buy all of their fashion items online, with most people using both online and physical stores. The trend of click and collect services supplementing in-store sales has been growing for many years and continues to have a strong forecast.  Alongside the shift to multi-channel sales in retail markets, there is a growing demand for commercial leisure and cultural offers.  These trends primarily highlight the importance of having a joined-up Town Centre experience to attract visitors to the high street and to extend the time they spend there through a range of retail and leisure attractions, as well as improvements in accessibility, inclusivity and perception of safety. Property owners and business along high streets are also responding to market trends by transforming bricks and mortar shops into multi-use spaces, and there is generally less need for large scale retail floorspace. This policy seeks to support this trend for innovative formats of co-location and multi-use within buildings which can enhance the attractiveness of centres when well-designed and managed.
3.63 A further factor affecting Town and Local 
Centres is the flexibility offered by the recent changes to use class legislation and permitted development rights. This means some changes will now be outside planning control and will need to be monitored. However the policy continues to protect the vitality and viability of the Town Centres by protecting against the loss of yard space or other ancillary floorspace where this would lead to the continued commercial operation being adversely affected. 98

Shopfronts and signage/advertisements should be designed in line with Policy D6. 
Developments should also respond to opportunities to enhance 
public realm, having regard to Part 9 and 10 of this policy and to Policy D2.
Developments should help manage and maintain the vitality and 
viability of the centre they are part of. This will be achieved through a range of means, including:•  Marketing and Meanwhile Use strategy as per Part 6.
•  
 Mana
gement Plan for any programmed events as part of the offer 
of the site – see also Part 3.•   Evidenc e of partnership arrangements for the overall management of

•  A Public Ream Management Plan as per Policy D2•  Details of the quality of design and materials lifespan.  
The Council will monitor the impact of permitted development rights allowing conversion of Class E uses into residential on the vitality and viability of Town and Local Centres and their ability to function at the intended level in the network. Where justified, the Council will seek to adopt Article 4 Directions limiting this right. 
HS2.2 Composition of uses in the Primary Shopping Area will be monitored 
every two years and should remain in line with national trends (currently 50 per cent retail and 25 per cent leisure composition). Proposals for new centres as allocated by this Plan should also achieve a good balance and concentration of retail and leisure uses alongside other Commercial, Business and Service uses within the Primary Shopping Areas.
Given flexibilities within Class E, it is likely that most applications 
resulting in loss of retail or leisure floorspace will be towards non-Class E uses, or through partial re-provision/retention as part of redevelopment. Where this is the case, applicants should demonstrate through an Impact Assessment that the loss of ground floor retail (Ea) or leisure (Eb) frontage within the defined Primary Shopping Areas is justified. The assessment should follow the criteria of national planning guidance to identify any impact of the loss on the vitality and viability or the centre and its current and aspirational role in the network (as identified in Policy HS1 and through the Retail and Leisure Assessment 2022). Impact will be balanced against the potential benefits of the proposed new use and how it is designed to minimise visual impact on the Primary Shopping Area (e.g. to not significantly break up the frontages, and to ensure alternative activation of frontages and of public realm).99
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESWhere loss of floorspace is due to consolidation of retail or leisure 
floorspace rather than full loss of units, the retained floorspace should remain functional, as evidenced through submission of independent advice from a commercial real estate agent with local market knowledge. The shopfront and internal shop floor layout should continue to meet wheelchair accessibility standards in line with building regulations and requirement of Policy HS7.   
HS2.3 This policy will apply to new or change of use development proposing the shared space or building by multiple uses/businesses (e.g. cafe with community space), including shopping mall formats, food courts, and internal markets. While the mix of uses itself may not require planning permission (e.g. all would fall under E uses class), it will be important to demonstrate good design and consideration of the functional needs of the particular specific uses proposed on the site.
The internal layout should help optimise the operational needs of all 
businesses on site, including servicing, while retaining a high quality shopfront. Visitors to the buildings should find it easy to find their way around to the business/event/activity they intend to visit.  
HS2.4 Retail units should generally not be less than 80 sqm GIA floorspace 
(as recommended by the Retail and Leisure Assessment), to allow for flexibility and adaptability long term, including the potential of managing on-line delivery orders on site without impacting the operation of the sales floorspace.
Medium and larger convenience stores (usually at least 300 sqm 
GIA) should be particularly protected for their key role as anchors of centres. While there is no minimum floorspace threshold for these, any proposal for reduction in their floorspace should be supported by layout plans and a statement from the operator (or an independent retail consultant) demonstrating functionality is safeguarded.Loss of floorspace may be justified by:• 
 Evidenc
e of poor turnover performance of the space compared to 
company benchmark (indicating over-provision of floorspace); or 
• 
 In the c
ase of vacancies longer than 12 months, demonstrated low 
market demand for the type and scale of the floorspace; or
• 
 Securing a
lternative arrangements for the management of storage 
and servicing needs (e.g. managed shared storage arrangements between multiple businesses). 
HS2.5 Redevelopment of Town Centre sites should help optimise the site 
for Town/Local Centre uses as well as residential uses, in line with Policy D3 and the aspirations for the centre. Adequate and full consideration of neighbourliness principle (Policy D7) will be important in ensuring both the vitality and viability of the centre and the comfort and safety of future residents. 
HS2.6 In line with Policy HS1 (and the Retail and Leisure Assessment 2022), a 
small unit is 80 – 150 sqm GIA. 
The 1000 sqm GIA threshold should allow for the provision of new 
small units while also enabling delivery of larger stores, particularly food stores (of 500 to 800 sqm GIA), where there is an identified need, in line with Neighbourhoods policies. Nevertheless, in Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades, the expectation is that the majority of units will be of this small scale. Where the overall number of small units surpasses 20 per cent of the total Commercial, Business and Service (Class E) floorspace, it may be reasonable that the surplus is not provided at affordable rents upon completion, but should nevertheless be covered by the Meanwhile Use Strategy (see Part 7) in case of longer term vacancy. 100
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHS2.7 With small units generally being 80-150 sqm GIA, the 800 sqm 
benchmark can equate to a 10-unit frontage of typically 50 metres 
overall length, the look and feel of which can have a significant impact on the vitality of the centre. It is therefore important that vacancies over more extensive frontages are carefully managed.
Meanwhile uses should generally be for the benefit of the local 
community, for example; meeting spaces, informal training and learning spaces, temporary rehearsal spaces, pop-up shops and exhibitions, and so on. They can offer space to test innovative ideas and empower the local community, lasting just a few days or several years. 
The Meanwhile Use Strategy should outline how units remaining or 
falling vacant for longer than 3 consecutive months will be:
•  
 Mark
eted for short term lease arrangement, discounted or 
turnover based rent, and support packages for fit out (including 
support with utilities).
•  
 Mark
eted to Newham businesses, e.g. through partnership with 
local business incubator or start-up programmes, and local community groups and voluntary organisations. 
The Meanwhile Use Strategy should be secured through planning obligations. For phased developments, the Meanwhile Use Strategy will be reviewed, and revised as needed, with each reserved matter application, and will include monitoring of the implementation of earlier delivered phases. A review mechanism at 5 years post-completion will also be secured through the obligation. HS2.8 The Marketing Strategy will provide:
•  
 Evidenc
e demonstrating an understanding of the demographic 
profile of the population in the catchment and resulting likely formats that may be successful; or statistically sound surveying within the catchment identifying households’ preferences and needs, e.g. as part of a co-design process. 
•  
 Evidenc
e demonstrating understanding of local footfall patterns 
and trip generation patterns and how these inform shopfront location, making them more likely to be desirable locations for businesses.  
•  
 Busines
s demand information for the specific uses proposed, 
including operational and fit-out needs, and demonstration of how the proposed development and subsequent management would respond to the evidence. 
For outline and future phases of hybrid applications, a site-wide Marketing Strategy should be prepared to help justify the wider masterplan. An updated Marketing Strategy should be submitted for each reserved matters application, informed by monitoring of the success of commercial floorspace in earlier delivered phase(s). 
For pre-application discussions, an outline/early scoping of the 
Marketing Strategy should be submitted with the initial information pack and its content agreed as part of the process.  
HS2.9 Publicly accessible also means provision within buildings. In these 
cases, signage integrated in the shopfront should signal their availability to non-customers, and hours of operation.  Signage should be designed in line with Policy D6.101
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHS2.10 The principles and objectives of 
public realm net gain are set out in 
Policy D2. For high streets, pavements should be generous and designed to comfortably and safely manage high footfall levels, and include enlarged pavement for ‘spill-out’ space in front of clusters of commercial leisure uses, or community facilities such as libraries. Small local square(s) is(are) encouraged along busy routes, providing meeting points, areas of respite or play, and potential for outdoor meanwhile uses such as markets or local cultural events. The Newham Characterisation Study Borough-wide Design Principles chapter includes further design recommendations (primarily under section 9.2.1 Provide local uses that support 15-minute neighbourhoods). 
Early engagement with the Council’s 
Highways, Public Realm Management and Newham High Streets teams should occur to help identify opportunities where correlating designs or pooling resources would add value to planned public sector investment in the public realm of the respective centre.  Evidence base

3.67 The National Planning Policy Framework defines the ‘Town Centre first’ approach which directs ‘main town centre uses’ to within the boundaries of centres identified in Local Plans. 
3.68 Redevelopment of sites in Edge-of-Centre and 
Out-of-Centre locations towards residential will benefit nearby Town and Local Centre(s) by helping concentrate commercial investment in centres, where clustering will provide additional benefits and an increase in footfall from new residential development.  
3.69 Nevertheless, in certain cases it may be 
appropriate to retain main town centre uses outside of designated areas. While many sections of historic high streets are now designated as part of the Town Centre Network, substantial sections remain unprotected. Research by the Greater London Authority as part of the London Plan (2021) demonstrates that these historic high streets provide a supply of affordable commercial floorspace for Newham’s small businesses or voluntary groups, and opportunities for social interaction within neighbourhoods. However, these sections of commercial development need to be managed in a way that respects the Town Centre first principles by ensuring a clearly differentiated character to that of designated centres and parades – this means less focus on retail and leisure and more focus on business, including financial and business services. Policies CF1 and J1 provide further criteria under which 103
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESmain town centre uses may be reasonable outside 
of a designated section of Newham’s Town Centres Network. 
3.70 In parts of the borough, historic residential 
terraced estates have traditionally included corner shops, and these can continue to play an important role in widening access to day-to-day groceries shopping in neighbourhoods where residents live further from the Newham Town Centre Network.  It will also be important to protect and enhance the significance of heritage assets, particularly where part of their significance comes from an original non-residential use. In such cases, a commercial, cultural or community use can help ensure a viable future for the asset as well as an increased level of public access to that asset. HS3.1 In line with the Town Centre first principles of the National Planning Policy Framework, loss of retail (Ea), restaurants and cafes (Eb) and service (Ec) uses in undesignated areas will be supported, and should lead to improved residential amenity in the locality alongside potential to optimise residential development for the site (in line with Policy D3). 
HS3.2 Planning applications for the development of retail (Ea), restaurants and cafes (Eb) and financial 
and business services (Ec) will need to demonstrate compliance with the sequential test of the National Planning Policy Framework and London Plan (2021) Policy D7.
Information should be submitted through a sequential test at validation or pre-application stage.  
The information should follow the content and methodology guidance set out in the national planning guidance. The ‘area of search’ should be based on operational business requirements (which can include the need to service a particular catchment), but should not be based on distance from the location of the proposed site.  
On sites where an exception is deemed to be met, the Planning Statement should include:
•  
 In the c
ase of a listed or non-listed building, a historical significance assessment demonstrating 
the building was originally designed for non-residential use, and why significance would be lost through conversion to residential only (e.g. loss of internal features or a high quality historic shopfront); and a viability statement demonstrating the viability of the proposed use for the site; OR
•  
 In the c
ase of a (food) grocery store, evidence that the use has operated at the site for longer 
than a year.
In all cases where an exemption is sought and planning permission is proposed to be granted, planning conditions will be used to limit flexibilities within use class E (Commercial, Business and Service), in line with Part 4. With regards to corner grocery shops where an exemption criteria is passed, conditions will also be imposed to limit the sale of goods to primarily (at least 65 per cent of shop floor) convenience goods. This will support the objective of creating accessible healthy food environments within Newham’s neighbourhoods, while recognising the limited growth in comparison shopping required over the Plan period and the need to consolidate this type of provision within Town and Local Centres. Implementation
104
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHS3.3 Planning applications for the 
development of 300 sqm or more of retail (Ea) and restaurants and cafes (Eb) uses which are not within a defined centre, including new Local Centres, will need to demonstrate compliance with the impact assessment set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and London Plan (2021) Policy SD7.
The impact assessment threshold for 
retail (Ea), restaurants and cafes (Eb) remains at 300 sqm GIA, in line with the recommendation of the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022), in order to help protect the smaller Local Centre destinations that are essential to good quality of life within many of Newham’s neighbourhoods. 
HS3.4 The condition should focus only on 
restricting sub-categories of Use Class E (Commercial, Business and Service) where there is a demonstrable different impact on Town Centres, transport network or amenity which cannot be mitigated through other types of conditions. 
The requirements for a Meanwhile 
use Strategy and Marketing Strategy, including thresholds, are addressed under policies HS2:7 and HS2:8.Policy Links

•   A Mana gement Plan covering a period of 5 years 
post-delivery of any market or pop-up/events space will be secured through developer legal agreement and will address amenity, safety and transport impacts mitigation, as well as how the use will be marketed and managed . Where relevant, this will include requirements of a Public Realm Management Plan in line with Policy D2. 
Justification
3.71 Newham’s markets actively contribute to supporting community wealth building, through providing opportunities for existing and new traders, as places for social integration and interaction, as well as vibrant spaces for commerce that positively support the offer and vitality of the high streets they are located in. The Town Centre health checks and Town Centre analysis of the Retail and Leisure Assessment (2022) demonstrates they are key attractors to Town Centres that are highly valued by local customers and those from further afield – Queens Market in Green Street in particular. The Council is currently developing an overarching strategy to support Newham’s existing markets and create opportunities for new ones. This strategy will work alongside this policy to deliver high quality markets.
3.72 In addition to markets, the policy continues 
to support temporary and ongoing pop-up/idea incubator spaces offering short-licence, affordable and flexible premises (or outdoor spaces) for local entrepreneurs, to enable ongoing innovation in the offer of Town and Local Centres.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
HS4.1  Servicing facilities should include adequate access to parking and 
unloading space, and utilities, including suitable voltage electricity 
supply where hot food service is part of the market offer.  Any redevelopment will be used as an opportunity to rectify any existing poorly functioning aspects of the market.
Public realm enhancements should be considered as per Policy 
D2 and Policy HS2:9-10. The Newham Characterisation Study Borough-wide Design Principles chapter includes further design recommendations (primarily under section 9.2.1 ‘Provide Local Uses That Support 15-Minute Neighbourhoods’). 
See implementation of part 3 for Management Plan detailed 
considerations.
HS4.2 Many temporary activities can be achieved through a Temporary Event Notice (TEN) type of licence. Application of this policy will therefore usually relate to intensifications of such activities beyond the time limits (currently 26 days per year) and activity types or scales permissible (e.g. a maximum of 499 people in attendance including staff) under a TEN. Evidence of the success of a TEN may be submitted in support of the application as part of the Planning Statement, including information from resident/visitor feedback as a form of public engagement.
Protection of heritage assets will be achieved in line with policies 
D8 and D10, as relevant to the site and the type of development proposed. Temporary activation of vacant and at risk heritage assets may be beneficial in raising awareness about the significance of the asset and may help identify a suitable long term use. However, any temporary structures required to accommodate the pop-up activity should be self-supporting, well designed and sensitively integrated.
 HS4.2 The temporary use should not contribute to exacerbated existing cumulative impacts. For example, temporary hot food pop-ups, or food-based market operators should be encouraged to meet quality criteria of Policy HS6:1 as applied through their stall licensing practices. This should be secured through a planning obligation.See implementation of part 3 for Management Plan details considerations.
HS4.3 Applications for permanent short-lease flexible use or event spaces, 
i.e. ongoing pop-up spaces, will generally be considered to provide a Sui Generis use, unless all uses proposed fall under Commercial, Business and Service Uses (Class E). Evidence submitted through the Planning Statement should demonstrate successful take up of the space through application of a Meanwhile Use Strategy (following the principles set out in Policy HS2:7) over the past 12 months. Successful take-up means that the space was managed and marketed so that it was not vacant for more than a month, or three months in the case of event spaces, excluding any renovation or fit-out times. A list of expressions of interest from businesses may be submitted as evidence, alongside records of the operation of the space over the past 12 months.
The Management Plan should address:
•
   
 The principl
es of the Meanwhile Use Strategy (Policy HS2:7), 
detailing any lessons learned during the testing of concept period of 12 months preceding application.
•
   
 In the c
ase of new markets, how appropriate storage and servicing 
facilities are integrated.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESPlanning Obligations
•   A Mana gement Plan for night time operations 
covering a period of five years post-delivery will be 
secured through developer legal agreement, and will address safety, amenity and transport impacts of the development.  
•  
 Financi
al contributions towards improving night 
time public transport, delivering and sustaining local safety projects, and/or creating public facilities for night time workers and visitors (e.g. toilets, device charging point, information centres) will be secured through developer legal agreement.
Justification 
3.73 London Plan (2021) Policy HC6 encourages boroughs to develop a vision for the night-time economy, supporting its growth and diversification, in particular within strategic areas of night-time activity such as Town Centres. 
3.74 Proactively managing visitor Evening and Night 
Time Economy can lead to benefits such new jobs, the diversification of leisure and tourism offer of centres to support their vitality and viability, and more opportunities for social interaction. Further focusing investment in the public realm, alongside partnership working with businesses and key organisations, can promote a safer environment in centres and on night time public transport.
3.75 Consultation responses have identified a desire 
for more evening leisure provision, and particularly for evening cultural activities and family-friendly activities.  The NEMS household survey identified the most popular leisure activities across Newham’s households, with the most frequent being cinemas (35.8 per cent), cafés (35 per cent) and eating out/restaurants (33.4 per cent in the evening and 30.9 per cent in the daytime). There are only three cinemas in Newham, two of which are in Stratford, and the third, Boleyn Cinema, focusing on specialist independent films, which means that most people will travel longer distance and sometimes out of borough for this type of leisure activity. 
3.76 Stratford (both the traditional centre and 
Westfield) is a popular destination for cafes and restaurants for all residents of the borough, particularly those living closest. Cafes and restaurants in East Ham and Forest Gate are also popular. However, the food and drink leisure offer and attractiveness elsewhere in the borough is poor, with many people traveling to alternative destinations outside the borough such as Canary Wharf, and Barking and Ilford Town Centres. Central London/West End remains a popular destination for all residents, but residents living closer to Newham centres with a suitably established offer are traveling less outside of the borough.
3.77 This policy seeks to promote a vibrant evening 
and night time visitor economy within Newham that is accessible and responds to local demand, while mitigating amenity and safety concerns. 
HS5.1 The London Plan (2021) Policy HC6 
defines three scales of evening and night time economies, of which the following are relevant to Newham:•  
    NT2 – Ar
eas of regional or sub 
regional significance. These are areas that attract visitors from across and beyond London, and often have one or more larger venues and a mature night-time economy. In Newham, this is the role of Stratford Metropolitan Town Centre. It will remain the main destination in the borough for visitor focused Evening and Night Time Economy activities and will continue to be supported to 
  c
ontinue to 
    operate at a regional scale.•  
  NT3 – Ar
eas with more than local 
significance. There are areas than draw visitors from other parts of London and tend to feature smaller venues and premises. Currently, there are no centres that fulfil this role in Newham, but there is an aspiration to achieve this level for Green Street, capitalising on the area’s fashion and wedding heritage and thriving businesses, and building on links with the Victoria and Albert East and fashion sector. Implementation111
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESSmaller scale, local areas of Evening And Night Time Economy activity 
which draw visitors primarily from Newham will be encouraged in Newham’s other Town Centres – East Ham, Forest Gate, Canning Town, East Beckton and the future centre at Beckton Riverside.
HS5.2 The visitor Evening And Night Time Economy uses identified are 
based on residents’ views on the type of leisure and cultural activities they would like to see promoted as part of a quality Evening and Night Time Economy in Newham’s Town Centres. 
Hot food takeaways, due to reduced opportunities for social 
interaction and higher risk of antisocial behaviour in public spaces, are not considered Evening And Night Time Economy uses suitable to be promoted through this policy.  They are addressed through Policy HS6. 
Applicants should set out in their Planning statement the intended 
hours of operation for each of the units proposed to function within any of the visitor Evening And Night Time Economy uses identified.
Licensing and Environmental Health should be consulted on the 
content of submitted Management Plans (Part 4) for applications where the hours of operation would extend past 11pm.
HS5.3 Generally, Evening And Night Time Economy within local centres 
should be limited to sale of food and drink to be consumed primarily on premises, including pubs. In certain cases, smaller scale cultural uses may also be appropriate in a Local Centre, e.g. to support local heritage or an established cultural and creative Evening and Night Time Economy cluster. The Planning Statement or Design and Access Statement should provide an evidenced justification as to why the use and the scale is appropriate for the respective Local Centre.
In Neighbourhood Parades and Out-of-Centre locations the 
operation of businesses past 11pm will not be permitted, in order to:HS5.3 •  Safeguard residential amenity; and•  
 Help c
oncentrate Evening and Night Time Economy uses in areas 
where they can be managed to better effect cumulatively, including optimising impact of investment into night time public transport and safety interventions.
HS5.4 Active ground floor uses and illuminated building frontages play important roles in animating streets and other public spaces after dark and promoting a feeling of safety through natural surveillance. Conversely, dark, inactive, shuttered and blank frontages can break the rhythm of active frontages and compromise the legibility of the streetscape and create perceptions of an unsafe environment. It is therefore important that Town Centre frontages are designed for consideration of their impact during the day and at night, irrespective of opening hours, as per policies D6 and D7. 
In addition, the Evening and Night Time Economy uses the focus of 
this policy (Part 2) should consider as part of a Management Plan how their late operation can proactively:•  
 Help pr
omote safety and inclusivity after dark, on site as well as on 
the public realm routes used by visitors.
•  
 Mitig
ate noise, odour and other nuisances in outdoor spaces, 
including gardens and al fresco seating areas. 
Licensing and Environmental Health should be consulted on the content of Management Plans. Newham Community Safety Management team should be consulted to identify suitable local community safety schemes that the Management Plan can help promote, and that may be enforced through condition.
Newham Highways and Transport for London should be consulted 
in relation to opportunities to improve night time public transport connectivity and safety of Evening And Night Time Economy zones. 112

114
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.78 There is an ongoing need to create a healthy 
food and drink environment, addressing affordability and access, to support the delivery of the 50 Steps to a Healthier Newham strategy (2020). 
3.79 Public Health research indicates that increased 
access to healthy, affordable food for the general population is associated with improved attitudes towards healthy eating and healthier food purchasing behaviour. Conversely increased access to unhealthier food retail outlets is associated with increased weight in the general population, and increased obesity and unhealthy eating behaviours among children residing in low income areas. 
3.80 Newham’s residents continue to be concerned 
about the existing concentration of hot food takeaways and betting shops, and more recently adult gaming arcades. While policy has been in place since 2016 successfully restricting the exacerbation of existing hotspots, more needs to be done to tackle the health and wellbeing impacts of existing businesses. Planning policy can play a complementary role to the work of Public Health teams in addressing these qualitative concerns. Implementation
HS6.1 For the purpose of the concentration limits, betting shops, casinos and adult gaming arcades 
are all considered gambling premises as they have similar impacts and are subject to gambling legislation. The limits apply to them as a group and not individual uses. GIS mapping will be used to identify the location of all uses subject to controls and their 400 metre radiuses. These will be updated every two years. The mapping should be used to assess clusters and overconcentration in line with policy criteria, unless more up-to-date information is submitted by the applicant.   
Changes between uses subject to control, e.g. from a takeaway to an adult gaming arcade or 
betting shop to a casino, will also need to satisfy the policy and will be resisted if contributing to persisting cumulative impacts.
For the purposes of para e and f, the percentage points will be rounded to the nearest 
whole number.
HS6.2 A gain or retention of a hot food takeaway will be assessed against the cumulative impact criteria 
of Part 1 of this policy, and the Health and Social Value Impact Screening Assessment requirement of Policy BFN3, alongside any other planning matter relevant to the application.
Where the use is supported, the requirement for Healthier Catering Commitment will be 
secured in line with London Plan (2021) Policy E9.  Newham Public Health should be notified of permissions subject to this conditions so that commitment can be co-monitored and enforced.
HS6.3 A gain or retention of a gambling premise will be assessed against the cumulative impact criteria 
of Part 1 of this policy, and the Health and Social Value Impact Screening Assessment requirement of Policy BFN3, alongside any other planning matter relevant to the application.
Pay-day loan shops (Ec), pawnbrokers (Ec) and other similar financial operation use will be 
assessed against the Health and Social Value Impact Screening Assessment requirement of Policy BFN3, alongside any other planning matter relevant to the application. Newham Public Health and Licensing should be notified of permissions subject to display of information condition, so that commitment can be co-monitored and enforced.115

•   A Servicing and T ravel Plan covering the first five

Justification
3.81 Online spending has become a firmly established method of shopping. Evidence demonstrates the continued growth of this sector in terms of those that have internet access, those that use the internet every day, the methods and modes used to undertake such transactions, and the breadth of the population taking advantage of what is on offer, with the largest rise in the 65+ age group in recent years. Internet sales share of total retail surpassed 19 per cent in 2019 before rising to over 30 per cent in the second quarter of 2020, against less than 5 per cent in 2008.
3.82 In the case of the food and drinks industry, 
the increased demand for deliveries from popular restaurants and cafes is leading to more demand for ‘dark kitchens’, where food is prepared on-demand in commercial kitchens with no customer access. Similarly, a significant rise in demand for same-day convenience goods delivery has led to the emergence of ‘dark shops’, where traditional shops are used for distribution purposes instead of being available for walk-in customers.117
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.83 The Greater London Authority’s research 
on High Streets: Adaptive Strategies (2020), highlights opportunities to plan for coordinated deliveries to centres through ‘last mile’ delivery/consolidation centres in order to reduce servicing vehicle numbers, followed by low-emission last mile deliveries (especially cargo-bike delivery). These micro-fulfilment centres may also benefit High streets by hosting local collection points for customers, which in turn may generate further linked trips as with click and collect trends. 
3.84 Small changes in consumer behaviour could 
have significant cumulative impacts, particularly on travel patterns, which should be proactively and strategically managed. Therefore, this policy seeks to support dark kitchens, dark shops and micro-fulfilment centres in areas identified as suitable for employment or along high streets where their impacts on the Town Centres Network can be managed. This policy should be read alongside policies T3: Transport Behaviour Change and T4: Servicing a development. Implementation
HS7.1 Dark kitchens’ and ‘dark shops’ are modern reinterpretations of the hot food takeaway and the 
shop, and are therefore managed as part of the overall strategy for town centre uses set out in this chapter, while recognising their unique features.
The location hierarchy of this policy is in line with wider employment and Town Centre policies, 
balanced against the specific type of use and its impacts. 
The sequential sites search approach responds to the delivery-centred operation of these uses, 
which is best serviced on industrial allocations and local mixed use areas. Where there are no suitable sites in these employment locations, or the business needs require a location that is closer to the residential catchment intended to be serviced, other high street locations may be considered. 
Shopfronts, where their retention is required, should fulfil criteria of Policy D6 Shopfronts 
and Advertising. 
A servicing and travel plans should be prepared to manage servicing of the site, staff travel 
planning and arrangements to maximise deliveries by bike/cargo bike in line with Policy T3. 
HS7.2 In order to safeguard the potential benefits of consolidated coordinated servicing of businesses 
in Newham’s Town and Local Centres, applicants who’s proposals include micro-fulfilment centres should  submit evidence of early engagement with all businesses in the relevant centre, outlining services offered at competitive local market prices, and any expressions of interest received within one month of engagement.
Where interest from centre-based businesses is identified, the Design and Access Statement 
should provide information demonstrating how the scale and operation of the micro-fulfilment centre has been optimised in partnership with the relevant third parties. The Travel Plan supporting the application should demonstrate sustainable transport arrangements, in line with Policy T3. 118

The design of the micro-fulfilment 
centre must also address its evening and night time safety and neighbourliness impacts, in line with policies HS5:4 and D7, through the provision of adequate accessible, safe facilities for drivers/couriers, including sheltered waiting space, toilets and secure (cargo-)cycle parking.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  HS8: Visitor accommodation  
1.  Ho tels and other forms of visitor accommodation 
will be supported in:
 
  a.
  T
own and Local Centres outside 
of the Primary Shopping Area, and 
principally within centres in Stratford and Maryland Neighbourhood as a key tourist destination, and 
 
  b.
  Ar
eas within 15 minutes walking 
distance to the Excel conference centre. 
2.  
 The s
cale of development should be in 
proportion to the proposed location, justified by market demand testing and should be supported by a Management Plan outlining:
 
  a.
  Ho
w amenity and safety will be 
managed and maintained through the day and at night.
 
  b.
 A s
ervicing plan.
3.
   
 Al
l visitor accommodation should meet the 
accessibility standards set by London Plan (2021) Policy E10.Justification
3.85 The ‘Building Newham’s Creative Future’ Cultural Strategy (2022) seeks to put Newham on the map and promote it as a visitor destination, with a growing visitor economy and encourage footfall from beyond the borough boundaries. It recognises the importance of well-known anchor institutions that can unlock an area by attracting visitors who may spend their time further exploring the borough, as well as encouraging inward investment into revitalising cultural infrastructure in nearby areas. Such institutions are increasingly establishing themselves in Newham as part of ongoing regeneration activity. These include large education, culture and leisure institutions in Stratford, and conferencing and civic representation at Royal Victoria Dock. Improving the availability and accessibility of visitor accommodation in line with the London Plan (2021) will support Newham’s developing visitor economy.
3.86 However, the delivery of visitor accommodation 
must be balanced against need for other forms of development, not least housing.  The London Plan (2021) estimates that London will need to build an additional 58,000 bedrooms of serviced accommodation by 2041, delivered primarily within the Central Activity Zones, but also increasingly in Town Centres more broadly.  The study allocates a share of the need to Newham equating to 5.2 per cent or 3,031 net rooms. Latest monitoring indicates that 1,373 rooms have already been delivered, with a further 483 in the pipeline as of 2021/22. The policy therefore requires market demand testing to ensure there is not an over delivery and the protection of land for other uses.
Implementation
HS8.1 Visitor accommodation includes hotels, 
guest houses and serviced apartments (Class C1), which are identified by the National Planning Policy Framework as a main Town Centre use for their contribution to supporting footfall and a tourism economy within centres.  
The spatial strategy of this plan recognises 
the role of Stratford area as a key tourist destination, and the role of the Excel Centre as a widely recognised conferencing centre. Applications for visitor accommodation, particularly those more of a more strategic scale, should be directed to these areas where they are supported in principal.  More broadly, the Council will continue to support Newham’s economic growth and develop the tourism and leisure offer, cultural uses, and the evening/night-time economy, and generally develop and improve the business environment of Town Centres. Visitor accommodation will be an important part of the local offer to support the diversification of Town Centres. 120

HS8.2 Proposals for visitor accommodation should be scaled to:
•  
 Refl
ect the role of the centre or tourist area they are located in. More strategic 
proposals directed to Stratford Metropolitan, East Ham and Canning Town and the area of the Excel Centre. Green Street may also suitably accommodate growth in visitor accommodation to reflect its aspiration for a wider than local visitor Evening and Night Time Economy. Other District Centres and the Local Centres should see more modestly scaled provision targeting more localised market demand. 
•  
 Respond t
o up-to-date evidence of local or regional market demand, and be 
designed to respond to the type of demand targeted.
•  
 Be w
ell integrated within the site context, reflecting requirements of policies D1, D2 
and D4, and the capacity of the local transport network to accommodate servicing needs as per Policy T2.
Amenity impacts should be mitigated in line with Policy D7 and reflect the typical 24 hour of operation of visitor accommodation. Considerations include impact on public realm use, servicing needs, drop-off and pick-ups arrangements, highways impacts etc. These should be addressed through the design of the scheme and through operational arrangements set out in a Management Plan.
Newham Community Safety Management team should be consulted to identify 
suitable local community safety schemes that may then be enforced through condition.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCOMMUNITY FACILITIES 
3.87 An area’s community facilities are one of its 
greatest assets. Community facilities can be thought of as an ecosystem of local organisations, networks and services
2. Building a Fairer Newham (2022) pledges 
to enable every resident to live in an accessible and inclusive neighbourhood which will provide all of their social, civic and economic essentials. Community, leisure, cultural and education facilities all play an important role in supporting and enriching people’s lives. Both formal social infrastructure (such as health and education provision) and informal spaces and services (like hairdressers, cafes and pubs) provide important networks that make communities more connected and resilient. 
3.88 The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated just how 
crucial our community facilities are to our collective resilience and wellbeing. The impact of the lockdown restrictions, the closure of schools, places of worship and recreational facilities was coupled with a renewed reliance on our hospitals, parks, mutual aid groups and online advice services. 
3.89 Newham’s Towards a Better Newham (2020), 
Social Integration Strategy (2020), and its cultural strategy - Building Newham’s Creative Future (2022) call for a commitment to social justice by putting equity of health, wellbeing and access to culture at the heart of all policy making. This requires increased access to and the funding of community facilities, especially for early years, mental health services (especially for young people), youth services and access to cultural spaces and organisations
3. 3.90 The ’50 STEPS’ to a Healthier Newham strategy 
(2020) sets out a commitment to supporting our young people to be healthy and ready for adult life (Priority 2) by enabling schools, youth zones and other young people settings to be health promoting environments. It also looks to improve health and care service provision to all (Priority 3), support schools to be active travel beacons and increase the participation of young people in physical activity and sport (Priority 7). It also seeks to develop a universal sport and physical activity offer as well as looking to community facilities (parks, libraries, community centres and faith settings) as being hubs of physical activity (Priority 8). The Local Plan seeks to protect existing and deliver additional community facilities in the right locations, to help deliver these outcomes.
3.91 The Greater London Authority’s Making London 
Child-Friendly (2021) report stresses the importance of ensuring that young people’s needs are taken into account. We need to think about how the built environment impacts on how young people develop and behave. It is important for them to be independently mobile with safe access to education, play and informal recreation. Spaces away from home and school, such as parks, recreation facilities, libraries and other forms of social infrastructure provide an important space for social interactions to occur.

3.92 This list is not intended to be exhaustive and other facilities may be considered community facilities.   This chapter seeks to protect and promote community facilities, both those in public and private ownership, to meet the needs of Newham’s growing population. 
This section contains the following policies:
• CF1: Existing community facilities• CF2: New and re-provided community facilities• CF3: Cultural and leisure facilities• CF4: Education and childcare facilities  
* Main town centre uses, as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework and London Plan (2021)123
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  CF1: Existing 
community facilities 
1.  Existing f acilities will be protected and should not 
be lost to other uses, reconfigured, reduced in size 
or relocated unless it can be demonstrated that the following criteria are met: 
 
 a.
  The needs of the curr
ent users of the facility 
or potential users (where the facility is not in use) are met through: 
 
   i.
  pr
ovision of an on-site replacement 
facility; or
 
   ii.
  an off-sit
e replacement, within the 
15-minute neighbourhood of the original facility; or
 
   iii.
  an e
xisting local facility, within the 
15-minute neighbourhood which is both available and affordable; or 
 
 b.
  the e
xisting and any other community use is 
no longer required, as demonstrated by: 
 
   i.
  e
vidence that the existing use is not 
needed or viable; andJustification
3.93 The loss of a facility can have damaging effect on the health and wellbeing of a community. This policy seeks to protect existing community facilities, especially those in areas with a deficit of provision. Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) provides an audit of the borough’s existing facilities and considers the need to protect existing facilities and how future growth may influence the need for new services, to make it easier to live well, in better connected communities. It has mapped the location of facilities across Newham’s neighbourhoods, provided an understanding of access within the borough’s 15-minute networks and indicated locations experiencing an existing deficit in service provision.  
3.94 Newham’s wide range of community facilities 
help to support the needs of people living and working in the borough. There is extensive evidence about the impact of loneliness and social isolation on people’s lives. It is a serious public health concern, leading to higher rates of premature mortality comparable to those associated with smoking and alcohol consumption. In Newham 1 in 5 people report feeling lonely often and 23,412 people live alone in Newham. We want to protect those facilities which can help combat loneliness. Faith groups, community halls, youth zones, sports clubs and other community facilities play an important role in creating stronger communities.  
   ii.
  e
vidence that the facility has been 
actively marketed for community use for at least 12 months and it can be clearly shown there is no alternative community use that could take on the space to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood; or 
 
   iii.
  the pr
oposal is part of a strategy 
from a recognised public sector body’s estates programme; and
 
 c.
  A Soci
al Value and Health Impact 
Assessment (see Policy BFN3) is undertaken and provided.
2. 
 If the l
oss of a community facility can be 
demonstrated as being acceptable to the Council, then the preferred alternative use will be for the maximum viable amount of affordable housing (unless located in a Primary Shopping Area, Strategic Industrial Location or Local Industrial Location).  
© Andrew Baker124
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
CF1.1 Applicants wishing to bring forward a development which will 
impact an existing community facility should first consult Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) to understand existing provision in the borough and if the proposal site falls in an area of deficit. 
Appendix B of the assessment provides a starting point for applicants, 
to help understand if the proposal falls in an area with an existing need for a community facility. The maps take into account the street network and pedestrian barriers to identify parts of the borough that are further than a 15 minute walk to community facilities. 
Any replacement community facility should meet the criteria set 
out in CF2.6. Applicants will need to be able to demonstrate that a replacement facility will meet the needs of the existing or potential users (where the facility is not in use) and the neighbourhood it serves. It must be a realistic replacement, capable of demonstrating adequate funding, site availability and timely delivery of facilities appropriate to its users. 
Where marketing is required, a report should be submitted 
demonstrating that there is no demand for a community use despite continuous marketing at a reasonable rate for at least 12 months. The need for marketing applies to both open and closed facilities. CF1.1 It should include: 
•  
 Registr
ation of the property with a reputable local or national 
commercial property agent.
•  
 The l
ength and dates of the marketing and vacancy period. 
Marketing should be continuous and is considered to start from the point when the advertisement board is erected, or the online advert is posted. 
•  
 Er
ection of an advertisement board in a prominent location. 
•  
 The s
ales price/rent should reflect rates generally paid by 
community groups or voluntary organisations and be agreed with Newham Council. 
•  
 C
opies of the marketing literature. Advertisements should include 
the following basic information: location, size, site description, lawful land use, property type, specification and costs (including rent and service charges).  
•  
 Expr
essions of interest to be recorded and full reasons given as to 
why any offer was not accepted. 
There may be a need for public sector bodies to invest in modern, fit for purpose buildings and/or to reorganise the scale and locations of services to better meet future population needs or to sustain and improve services. Where the loss or reduction is from a recognised public sector body there is no need to undertake a marketing exercise. A Social Value and Health Impact Assessment (see Policy BFN3) and a service strategy will need to be provided to demonstrate details of rationalisation, including that they have considered the needs of service users as part of any service delivery strategy. 125
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCF1.1 A recognised public sector body can include: 
•  Hospital trusts and other health organisations.
•  
 The emer
gency services (Metropolitan Police Service, London Fire 
Brigade, London Ambulance). 
•  
 Public s
ector organisations, such as the Council, who maintain a 
portfolio of community premises.
•  Higher education institutions. 
A Social Value Health Impact Assessment (see Policy BFN3) is needed 
to support any application for a loss, reduction, replacement, reconfiguration or relocation of a community facility. The scope of the assessment will be agreed with the Council at the earliest possible stage of the planning process. The following will be required as a minimum:•  
 Det
ails how to maximise the proposal’s positive health and social 
effects and minimising its negative health and social effects.
•  
 Eng
agement with all the relevant bodies / organisations involved in 
provision of services. 
•  
 Evidenc
e to demonstrate who uses the facility or former users 
(where the facility has declined or closed). 
•  
 Ho
w the needs of the existing users or potential users (where the 
facility is not currently in use) have been considered before making the proposals to the facility. 
•  
 Why the chang
e to the facility is needed and how this best meets 
the needs of those using the service or potential users (where the facility is not currently in use).
•  
 Det
ails of other community uses for which there is an identified 
need in the locality (within a radius of 400m of the premises/site or neighbourhood - subject to the planning application) which could reasonably be accommodated from the existing premises/site.
•  
 Det
ails should be provided of consultation with public and 
community service providers, including Newham Council, to establish their needs and accommodation requirements.CF1.2 Where it can be demonstrated that the loss of a community facility 
is acceptable, we will seek to see the delivery of the maximum viable amount of affordable housing. The value uplift from such a decision will allow schemes which see the loss of a community facility to deliver more than the standard 35 per cent affordable housing requirement (see Policy H3). 
We will not support residential development in Primary Shopping 
Areas, Strategic Industrial Locations or Local Industrial Locations; these locations are protected for main town centre uses (see Policy HS1) and employment (see Policy J1) respectively.

Justification
3.95 Community facilities are shared resources within which experiences and social value are created. It is important that the growth in Newham’s population is supported by appropriately located, designed and managed community facilities. 
3.96 New facilities should seek to address gaps 
in provision, both existing and future. Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) has helped to establish an understanding of who lives in the borough currently and how this may change over time. Using this information, it considers where new and improved facilities might be best located. The requirement for neighbourhood and site-specific community facilities are set out in the Neighbourhoods chapter and Site Allocations. 
3.97 Convenient access to community facilities is 
important, it allows a range of people can easily use the services they need. This will often mean that new community facilities will be directed to Newham’s Town and Local Centres. This also has the benefit of drawing further footfall in our centres, improving their vitality. There may however be some flexibility on location, depending on the type and scale of the facility being provided. In all cases, community facilities should be easily accessible by walking, cycling and public transport in accordance with the Healthy Streets Approach. 
3.98 Community facilities should integrate with the 
surrounding area and create places where people feel welcome. Newham’s community facilities play an important role in providing spaces where people from different backgrounds can meet, socialise and have shared experiences. It is important to plan for, design and manage community facilities to help facilitate social interaction. 
3.99 When designing new and re-provided 
community facilities it is important think about its users from the outset. Co-design is particularly important in areas undergoing significant levels of change. The design of community facilities benefits from the involvement of operators, community groups, residents and workers. 
3.100 Increasingly, complementary services which are 
managed by a variety of different providers are being brought together in the same site or building. The co-location of services can bring together unlikely activities, this can facilitate social interaction between people who may not otherwise have met. It can also help to realise savings and efficiencies. 129
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.101 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) identifies 
infrastructure requirements across the borough, setting out what is needed, where, and when. It includes projects relevant to education, health, culture, sports and the emergency services. The IDP will form an important part of demonstrating sufficiency of, or requirement for, community facilities across the Borough throughout the plan period due to the live nature of the document which will be updated annually to ensure it remains current.
CF2.1 It is recognised that some community 
facilities naturally serve a catchment outside of a local neighbourhood or indeed the borough boundary. Community facilities with wider catchment areas (for example youth centres and larger places of worship) which can attract higher number of trips may create friction in residential areas due to increased traffic, noise and large numbers of people coming and going.  Larger community facilities and those attracting users from beyond the local neighbourhood are therefore best located in Newham’s Town or Local Centres. Larger and more popular community facilities should be accessible by a range of sustainable transport modes; as such they should be directed to transport hubs, major thoroughfares and locations in close proximity to bus stops. CF2.1 It is important that community facilities consider how both users and staff will travel to and from 
them. For the purposes of this policy:• 
  
 a l
ocal neighbourhood is defined as a 15 minute walking distance buffer around the site, taking 
into account the street network and pedestrian barriers. 
•  
 The definition of a l
arge number of trips will vary depending on the type of community facility 
being considered. When deciding if a scheme will generate a large number of trips we will consider the type and frequency of movement, the pattern throughout the day and over the course of the week. 
Applicants should provide a Full Travel Plan to allow proper assessment of any transport impacts.
Town centres are defined on Newham’s policies map and are set out in Policy HS1. 
A sequential test must be submitted as part of any application for planning permission for the development of a main town centre use (as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework and London Plan (2021) Policy SD7) that is not in a designated centre and not in accordance with the local plan. Applicants are advised to liaise with the council prior to the submission of an application to agree a suitable approach in respect of the application submission requirements. 
In undertaking the sequential test, applicants should clearly set out a series of site search 
thresholds, including the site size (having regard to the proposal), matters such as accessibility, visibility and location. It is important to set out the geographic area from which the proposal will likely draw its users.  It is from this ‘catchment area’ that the search for potential sequential opportunities can be concentrated, focusing on defined centres within that identified catchment. 
The sequential test should consider the suitability of the most central sites. If an Edge-of-Centre 
or Out-of-Centre location is proposed, preference should be given to accessible sites that are well connected to a Town Centre. 
Only if suitable sites in the Town Centre, Local Centre or Edge-of-Centre locations are not 
available (or are not expected to become available within a reasonable period) should Out-of-Centre sites be considered.Implementation130
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCF2.1 If the applicant or the council is able to identify an alternative 
site which is considered to be both available and suitable, and no 
robust justification can be provided as to why this site could not accommodate the development proposed, it is likely that planning permission will be refused.
Where a community facility development proposes a main town 
centre use of more than 1,000 sqm GIA, either through extension or new provision, outside of or on the edge of a defined centre an impact assessment will be required. It is for the applicant to demonstrate compliance with the impact test in support of relevant applications. Failure to undertake an impact test could in itself constitute a reason for refusing permission.
An impact assessment should follow the latest government guidance 
and should be proportionate to the scale and potential impact of the proposal. The purpose of an impact assessment is to consider the impacts of the proposal on Town Centre vitality and viability and investment. 
It is for the applicant to demonstrate that the proposal will not have 
a significant adverse impact on planned and committed Town Centre investment, or on the vitality and viability of the defined centres. The assessment should consider all Town Centres which may be affected, not just those located closest to the application site.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the council’s 
pre-application advice service to agree the scope of an impact assessment where one is required. Please note that the onus would be on the applicant to provide a framework impact assessment listing the points/information to be covered for comment.CF2.1 Where the test is passed, conditions will be used to ensure that 
the facility continues to serve a local function and does not lead to unintended character change.
CF2.2
Community facilities should be located in areas convenient for the communities they serve. This means that it may be acceptable for some smaller community facilities and those with a local user base to be located outside of a designated Town or Local Centre. In these cases, the users of the facility should be able to easily access the facility by foot or sustainable transport methods.
Applications outside of a Town or Local centre must demonstrate, 
though a Transport Assessment (see Policy T3), that there are no unacceptable transport or highways impacts. Development proposals for community facilities outside of a Town or Local Centre are likely to come forward in more residential settings. Because of this, it is important to ensure there are no negative impacts on the neighbourhood, this can include impact on outlook, privacy, sunlight/daylight and unacceptable disruption as a result of the development such as increased parking, smells, fumes or noise disturbance.
For any proposal outside of a Town or Local Centre it should be 
demonstrated that a search has been under taken following the hierarchy set out in point CF2.2.d (this applies to both main town-centre and non-main town centre uses). Town Centres are defined on Newham’s Policies Map and are set out in Policy HS1.
Applicants should consult Newham’s Community Facilities Needs 
Assessment (2022) to ascertain the current provision of community facilities in the borough and whether or not the site is in an area of deficit. A proposals neighbourhood will depend on the type of service it is offering. 131
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESWhere a community facility development proposes a main town 
centre use of more than 300sqm Gross Internal Area, either through extension or new provision, outside of or on the edge of a defined  centre an impact assessment will be required (see implementation text CF2:1 for further guidance). 
CF2.3
Where new community facilities are proposed the Council’s Resident, Engagement and Participation team should be consulted, to understand the need for such a space. The applicant should also consult Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) to understand existing provision in the area. 
These two steps are important because provision of unnecessary 
space or facilities which do not properly consider the end user(s) can lead to the delivery of unviable or unusable space. It can also mean that opportunities for other development, not least housing, is lost. 
CF2.4 For the purposes of this policy, re-provision can range from a 
simple minor extension to extensive modernisation, expansion or total rebuild of a community facility. Re-provision of a community facility in a Town or Local Centre will need to provide a Transport Assessment to allow proper assessment of any transport impacts (see Policy T3).
It is important to ensure there are no negative impacts on the 
neighbourhood, this can include impact on outlook, privacy, sunlight/daylight and unacceptable disruption as a result of the development such as increased parking, smells, fumes or noise disturbance.Where a community facility development proposes a main town centre use of more than 300sqm Gross Internal Area, either through extension or new provision, outside of or on the edge of a defined centre an impact assessment will be required (see implementation text CF2:1 for further guidance). CF2.5 For the purposes of this policy, re-provision can range from a simple 
minor extension to extensive modernisation, expansion or total rebuild of a community facility. 
Whilst the presence of an existing facility, which is operating from 
a location outside of a Town or Local Centre could be deemed acceptable, it is important to ensure that the proposed development will not impact negatively on the neighbourhood. This is especially important where a facility has been vacant and unused for some time.  When considering neighbourliness and the suitability of the existing location, consideration will be given to any existing complaints regarding highways impacts or noise. 
Out-of-Centre facilities will be required to demonstrate that the 
proposed development will not generate additional trips, draw from a wider catchment (users and staff) or disturb those living nearby. 
It is important to ensure there are no negative impacts on the 
neighbourhood, this can include impact on outlook, privacy, sunlight/daylight and unacceptable disruption as a result of the development such as increased parking, smells, fumes or noise disturbance.
CF2.6 New and re-provided community facilities should provide a Social 
Value Health Impact Assessment (see Policy BFN3). The scope of the assessment will be agreed with the Council at the earliest possible stage of the planning process. 
The following will be required as a minimum: 
•  
 eng
agement with all the relevant bodies / organisations involved in 
provision of services. 
•  
 e
vidence to demonstrate who uses / or is expected to use the 
facility and former users (where the facility has declined or closed). 
•  
 e
vidence of consultation with existing / former / future users of 
the facility. 132
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESThe design of community facilities, both spaces and services, can 
facilitate different forms of social integration. 
The Greater London Authority’s Connective Social Infrastructure 
(2020) document is helpful resource, setting out design considerations to think about when delivering community facilities. The layout, types of facilities provided (for example kitchen and food storage spaces) and storage was a common issue raise by those consulted for Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022).  
Examples of how facilities can be designed to be inclusive and 
accessible include: tactile surfaces, hearing loops, good signage and lighting, additional seating. There is a need for public toilets. A lack of provision can mean people are less able to go out into the community. We will expect major schemes with large numbers of visitors to provide public toilets.
Where appropriate, community facilities should incorporate public 
toilets which make provision those for people with learning and physical disabilities and their carers. The following facilities are considered especially appropriate for this provision: • Sport and leisure facilities• Cultural centres, such as museums, concert halls and art galleries• Town halls, civic centres and public libraries• Education establishments• 
  He
alth facilities, such as hospitals, health centres and 
  community practices
CF2.7 The sustainability of community facilities, including their funding, 
maintenance and management is incredibly important.We will seek opportunities to improve access to facilities through a 
Community Use Agreement to allow the shared use of a facility by the wider community or increased hours of community access. . It will also seek to enter an agreement on the ongoing revenue costs of the facility. Applicants will be expected to demonstrate how the successful long-term future of the facility will be secured. 
Applicants are encouraged to engage early in the development 
process with ward members, the Resident, Engagement and Participation team, community managers and the local community. This ensures that local people can meaningfully input into a scheme’s development. 
CF2.8 Meanwhile uses provide the opportunity to bring life and to activate 
an area before permanent development begins. It also enables a period of testing projects ideas and establishing uses, which can ultimately inform the final scheme brief and design. It is, however, important to ensure that any meanwhile uses do not result in unacceptable impacts on residential amenity and that the uses do not prevent development sites from being brought forward in a timely fashion. This means that meanwhile uses should occupy spaces which are available for at least five years, in order to offset the start-up costs and establish viable businesses or organisations. 
Meanwhile uses can be low cost and low risk, making them 
attractive to community groups and the creative and cultural sectors. The Council will work with developers to secure appropriate arrangements that could support occupiers of meanwhile space to secure space within permanent structures. 
If appropriate for meanwhile activities, Newham will secure a 
Management Strategy through a planning condition or legal agreement, which should identify the proposed steps to promote the meanwhile activities on the site (see Policy BNF1 and HS1).  133

3.102 The borough’s rich cultural offer includes cultural and creative facilities which stimulate vibrancy and vitality and promote diversity. Newham’s strategy Building Newham’s Creative Future (2022) sets out an ambitious programme to promote the borough’s cultural and art facilities. Its vision is for Newham to be a place where culture, creativity and heritage drive investment, inclusive participation and wellbeing. 
3.103 Over the past 15 years Newham has been at 
the centre of some of London and the UK’s largest and most ambitious cultural regeneration projects, with key developments at East Bank and the Royal Docks. Newham is home to a thriving and talented community of artists, dance groups, production agencies, musicians, community choirs, theatre companies, fashion designers and many more cultural producers who make Newham what it is today. This community is essential in showcasing and nurturing Newham’s cultural diversity and heritage, and in fuelling the creative economy.  
3.104 Artists contribute to vibrancy and the 
identity of a place and can encourage wider social value through mentoring, work experience, apprenticeships and volunteering opportunities, open studios, public performances/exhibitions, events, festivals, school arts programme or community workshops.135
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.105 Sports and leisure facilities are vital for 
promoting people’s health and well-being, helping people to live active lifestyles and de-stress. Priority 8 of Newham’s Health and Wellbeing Strategy seeks to create an active borough. Despite a substantial free activity offer and some improvements to our sporting infrastructure in recent years, participation in sport and physical activity levels in Newham remain among the lowest in England
5. 
3.106 We need to ensure that residents continue to have opportunities to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. In our borough people die younger, are more likely to suffer poor mental health and are more likely to die from diseases such as cancer and Cardiovascular Disease. Evidence suggests a link between the inactivity of residents and levels of local deprivation with the highest areas of deprivation almost 10 per cent more physically inactive than lowest deprivation areas
6. 
In addition, the perception that there is a lack of safe, green spaces as well as an ageing portfolio of leisure facilities around the borough, contribute to low participation in physical activity and creates a tipping point to poor health outcomes such as obesity and can affect mental wellbeing.CF3.1 Newham will look to protect existing cultural and leisure facilities, where they remain viable. Applicants wishing to bring forward a development which will impact an existing cultural facility should first consult Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022), We Are Cultural (2022) and the emerging Built Leisure Needs Assessment (2022) to understand existing provision in the borough and if the proposal site falls in an area of deficit.
Implementation text for Policy CF1 provides guidance on the loss of a culture or leisure facility to 
other uses (including a reconfiguration, reduction in size or relocation).
CF4.2
Applications for the enhancement of existing cultural and leisure facilities and provision of new facilities will be supported, subject to them being designed to a high quality and not giving rise to unacceptable impacts on amenity and on the transport network and public realm. Applicants wishing to bring forward a development which will impact an existing cultural facility should first consult Newham’s Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022), We Are Cultural (2022) and the emerging Built Leisure Needs Assessment (2022) to understand existing provision in the borough.
Large-scale cultural and leisure facilities will be required to support access to Newham’s
Culture Passport.
The co-location of sports facilities is encouraged, particularly within new and existing schools, 
colleges, commercial schemes and community centres. This will help ensure the right mix of facilities in the right places to meet sporting demand and to increase participation. 
Implementation text for Policy CF2 provides guidance on the development of new or re-provided 
cultural and leisure facilities (including modernisation and/or expansion). Implementation text for Policy BFN3 provides guidance on undertaking a Social Value-Health Impact Assessment.Implementation

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.107 Local Authorities have a duty to secure pupil 
places for all children of statutory school age (0-25) who are residents within the borough. Furthermore, in achieving sufficient high-quality educational places to meet the needs of local residents, young residents will sustain better outcomes, which provides a safeguard, reduces inequality, and goes hand in hand with the Local Plan’s guiding vision of providing better opportunities for young residents. The revised pupil forecast (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022) indicates that there are sufficient primary and secondary school places to meet local need up to 2027, but that there is need for more specialist provision, in particular for pupils with complex conditions. 
3.108 The Childcare Sufficiency Assessment (LBN, (2021) 
also states that there are currently sufficient childcare spaces to meet local need.Nonetheless, there is likely to be an increase in demand for all schools and childcare facilities over the Plan period, as forecasts indicate that in 2032, the population of 0 to 25 years will grow by 11 per cent (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022)). Fluctuations in pupil numbers take place due to a variety of geo-political factors, notably Brexit, Covid-19, and migration flows (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022) and Childcare Sufficiency Assessment, London Borough of Newham (2021)).  3.109 This suggests additional places will need to be delivered in line with new housing developments in some areas of the borough to accommodate future demand, which is why some sites have been strategically designated for education facilities, and why expansions on sites in areas with identified need are encouraged. 
3.110 Beyond addressing the statutory requirement 
of Local Authorities to provide sufficient places, this policy also speaks to the importance of educational facilities as sites that promote community cohesion. Educational facilities are vital locations for communities to meet, acting as core ‘hubs’ that foster unity, diversity, and interactions amongst local residents. Evidence shows that only twenty schools out of the 100+ schools throughout the borough have been identified to have community-shared spaces (Community Facilities Needs Assessment, Publica (2022)). A more effective use of sites will be achieved by ensuring that educational facilities have a variety of community uses, and are positioned in accessible and central locations. In doing so, the policy also achieves to address the identified need for community spaces  
(Community Facilities Needs Assessment, 2022), and minimise travel distances for usersCF4.1 The planned delivery of childcare facilities, primary schools,  secondary schools, and SEND schools on site allocations is based on the findings from the pupil forecast (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022), together with the Childcare Sufficiency Assessment (London Borough of Newham (2021). These forecasts identify where childcare facilities, primary schools, secondary schools, and SEND schools are needed based on increased levels of population resulting from residential developments and socio-economic trends.
In accordance with the Childcare Act 
(2006; 2016), all new primary school developments are expected to include childcare facilities, including full-time and part-time spaces. The provision of childcare facilities for ages 0-5 will have to be demonstrated in the proposed design of the site.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCF4.1 For expansions of existing education facilities, vertical and 
horizontal expansions will be considered so long as a high-quality 
learning environment is maintained, including the protection of out-door greenspace, playing pitches, and play spaces, in accordance to clause CF4.5, and there is not net loss of childcare facilities to primary and secondary facilities.
New education facilities outside of those planned in site allocations 
will be considered as long as need for them is demonstrated. Applicants will have to submit evidence of need, including the number of potential pupils and evidence that there are not sufficient education spaces to meet demand. 
Applicants should engage in early Pre-Application discussions with the 
Education Place Planning team and demonstrate such evidence. This will particularly be supported for proposed childcare facilities ancillary to commercial development in site allocations, which would achieve to address barriers to employment, as per policy J4.2.
CF4.2
The Places for All document (London Borough of Newham (2022) and the Childcare Sufficiency Assessment (London Borough of Newham (2021) will likely reflect an increase in demand in their future revisions, and the policy will be considered against the latest adopted evidence.   As such, the delivery of new educational facilities should be flexible in terms of both timescale and design to meet fluctuating pupil place needs. 
The phasing of education facilities should take place in a timely and 
coherent manner, delivering the facility at an appropriate phase based on anticipated pupil demand as per the revised pupil forecast (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022). CF4.2 Additionally, the delivery of new education facilities on identified site allocations should provide a long-term option up to 2038 to bring for-ward the facility, to allow for changes in the pupil place planning pro-file. In this case, appropriate meanwhile uses should be determined for the site whilst it does not come forward. Such uses should be defined in the scheme’s Meanwhile Use Strategy.
In terms of design, new proposals for educational facilities should 
comply with the design standards of the Area Guidelines for Main-stream Schools (Department for Education (2014) and Active Design (Sport England (2015), as well as incorporate a flexible design to allow for future expansions as pupil place needs fluctuate. Design and Access Statements should demonstrate how the design of the facility can incorporate future expansions that maintain the high-quality learning environment as outlined in clause 5 and retain outdoor greenspaces.
CF4.3
Although forecasts demonstrate that there are currently sufficient education facilities (Places for All, London Borough of Newham (2022) and Childcare Sufficiency Assessment, London Borough of Newham (2021), it is demonstrated that the young population of Newham will grow throughout the Plan period. As such, all childcare and educational facilities should be protected unless the revised Pupil Place Planning Report, or equivalent corporate strategy, suggests there is no long-term need for such facility. Outdoor greenspaces on educational sites should also be protected from future expansions. 
CF4.4 In line with the delivery of 15-minute neighbourhoods, school facilities 
should be located within a 15 minute walking radius from the nearest public transport link, as per policy T2. The site should also be directly linked to an active travel network, and should be designed to hold sufficient cycle parking for all pupils, as well as appropriate facilities to promote active travel, such as showers, changing rooms, and lockers. 141
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCF4.6 All new educational facilities, together with extensions to existing 
educational facilities, should comply with the design standards of Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of Practice: 0 to 25 Years (Department for Education and Department of Health (2015) to make sure that educational facilities are fully inclusive and adapted to meet all student needs.
Applications should demonstrate the implementation of SEND-relat-
ed design standards, and should also demonstrate evidence of co-pro-duction with parents, pupils, and teachers, to reach design decisions. This is particularly essential for unconventional and innovative design approaches, which are design forms that may not be traditionally associated with education sites. An example of this is rooftop play-grounds. All educational facilities should still follow the relevant build-ing guidance, but variation in design will be considered when required by site constraints and the final design still creates a high quality learn-ing environment and meets the requirements of the Education Place Planning Team.  Variations to the design of SEND schools are less likely to be supported, due to the specific needs of their pupils.
CF4.7 New education facilities need to provide access for community 
uses outside of core hours, which include before and after school hours, half terms, and summer holidays. All spaces within educational facilities, including classrooms, halls, gyms, outdoor spaces, and canteens, should be available for local community groups and the Council. In order to guarantee access to the community, a Community Use Agreement will be secured that will prioritise community uses at affordable rates.
The layout of new education facilities should be sufficiently flexible to 
adapt to different community uses, which includes, but is not limited to, full accessibility for people with reduced mobility. The flexibility of the proposed space should be demonstrated in the Design and Access Statement. CF4.4 Additionally, the location of the school facility should reduce expo-
sure to air pollution and improve safety by being located away from high streets and on streets that can allow for temporary restrictions to motorised traffic, as per policy GWS5. The school facility should ideally be located in a street that could become a School Street. 
All of the above shall be demonstrated in the submission of a travel 
plan. The travel plan should follow the specific guidance for education facilities listed in the Travel Plan Guidance (London (2022)). The travel plan should also demonstrate how impacts on road congestion, specifically in cases where the site is located within a residential area, will be addressed. 
Developments for schools and childcare facilities only need to fulfil 
the requirements of Policy CF4 as opposed to all CF policies. 
CF4.5
In addition to abiding by building regulations for childcare, schools, and further education facilities as per BB103 Area Guidelines for Mainstream Schools (Department for Education (2014), new educational facilities should guarantee a high-quality learning environment that places the climate emergency at its centre (see policy CE1 and GWS5).
In terms of layout, new education facilities need to provide outdoor 
greenspace at ground-floor level (including play spaces, allotments, gardens, trees, sheltered outdoor spaces, and food growing spaces) in line with Sport England’s Planning for Sport Guidance (2019). It needs to be sufficiently large to accommodate the maximum number of pupils. New educational facilities should also ideally be located within a 15 minute walking radius of an existing park (0.4ha or more) so outdoor activities can be carried out there, as per policy GWS1. Out of place greenspace should not replace greenspace on-site. 142
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCF4.8 Higher education providers need to deliver sufficient access to 
necessary student facilities to ensure that the student body does not 
overburden limited spaces in public facilities. The provision of such will be judged against meeting the needs of the maximum number of potential future students. 
The design of higher education facilities should follow the 
requirements in clauses 4,5, and 6, and the flexibility to allow for future expansion and protection of the facility should follow the requirements in clauses 2 and 3. 
Student facilities include studying spaces, sports facilities, eateries, 
and classrooms. 
CF4.9 Tuition centres, training centres, adult, and further, and higher 
educational facilities provide additional and lifelong learning to mainstream education. It is demonstrated that there is need for such uses for residents of all ages to gain more skills and qualifications.  Applicants will need to provide evidence of the relevant Ofsted registration from the Department for Education as well as details of student and staff numbers, enrolment criteria, and curriculum details.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESINCLUSIVE ECONOMY
3.111 The focus of Newham’s economic future and 
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is Community Wealth Building. This means building a fair economy which secures social, economic and environmental benefits for all. The approach delivers growth that meets strategic and local economic needs while tackling key economic challenges faced by residents and businesses. The policies in this chapter seek to create new jobs and deliver new employment floorspace to support key growth sectors including in clean industries, light manufacturing, green tech, digital, cultural/creative uses, transport and utilities, and warehousing and logistics. This will maximise the economic potential of land and economic development in Newham whilst securing higher quality employment opportunities for residents.
3.112 Newham is a strategically important economic 
location in London and has an important employment land resource. The policies in this chapter direct growth, across the borough, to areas which have the greatest economic potential. These include Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs) in Stratford, Canning Town, Royal Docks and Beckton, in close proximity to the Central Activity Zone (CAZ). All are critical to supporting the increasing demands for industrial and warehousing, ‘last mile’ logistics, production, manufacturing and utilities and transport infrastructure. Stratford, which has experienced significant growth since the Olympics, is emerging as a central hub for investment in the major office market, culture and leisure economies. The Royal Docks benefits from Enterprise Zone status and is an Opportunity Area. The Royal Docks area has significant potential for employment growth, principally to attract firms and jobs beyond the Newham market, including workspace clusters for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) type businesses. 
3.113 Newham’s network of local employment 
locations and high streets are home to start-ups, small medium enterprises and independent and micro businesses which all support Newham diverse local economy. These locations are all critical to maximising our borough’s economic potential as well as supporting the delivery of 15-minute neighbourhoods by improving access to economic opportunities, local supply chains and reducing the need to travel further afield to places of work. 
3.114 In response to Newham’s declaration of the 
climate emergency, building a greener economy is a core Local Plan objective and is considered a key element of our economic strategy. This means commercial developments must address the environmental impacts from economic growth, support new sectors for cleaner and greener industries and deliver improved design to support energy efficient workspaces across the borough. Cumulatively, these actions contribute to a greener future for Newham.

However, the study highlights that permitted office floorspace growth has been confined to the London Legacy Development Corporation area and the Royal Docks, with the rest of the borough experiencing more floorspace lost than gained. In addition, there is significant uncertainty around the office market and the delivery of the pipeline schemes. As such, the study concludes that office space should be directed towards Stratford Metropolitan Centre, reflecting its role in the London Plan (2021) as a potential Central Office Satellite. The policy follows this approach but does allow some flexibility, with the need figure set as a minimum to ensure future economic growth is not constrained and there is sufficient flexibility to accommodate any future changes in evidenced demand for office space.151

3.118 Overall the Employment Land Review (2022) highlights that all past trend and forecast data shows a 
positive need for industrial land, which aligns with the market view. Newham’s pipeline of supply is not sufficient to meet this need, nor are the sites with industrial potential currently in planning. Therefore, to meet this economic demand and enable employment growth there should be no further release of industrial land and industrial intensification will be encouraged and supported. The policy therefore requires industrial development to take the form of intensification to deliver further industrial floorspace and not co-location with residential, unless explicitly stated as suitable for mixed use in Policy J1. 
3.119 Newham is attractive to a range of sectors. 
These include light industrial, storage and logistics, manufacturing, creative industries and is home to a buoyant number of start-ups and micro-businesses. While Newham currently specialises in food and drink, manufacturing, transport and utilities, the Employment Land Review (2022) identifies future growth sectors. In particular there is an opportunity for warehousing and distribution, green technology, creative and cultural uses, manufacturing and construction. All of which service both local and wider London needs. 
3.120 This policy sets out Newham’s approach to 
enabling growth within current and emerging sectors by distributing appropriate types, scales and designs of employment space across the borough. The Policy directs sectors to suitable locations where businesses and industries can thrive, while ensuring that all new business space supports evidenced local and strategic economic needs. The requirement for an Economic Strategy to support economic development proposals, as it ensures delivery of floorspace and employment types which the borough requires to meet our economic objectives and market needs. 152
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJ1.1 Newham has an identified need for both industrial uses as well as 
warehousing and logistics space and office space over the plan period. Applicants proposing economic floorspace within developments are required to provide net increases in floorspace going forward to contribute to the identified need figures, while making the most efficient use of land. 
The Council’s Employment Land Review (2022) (and any subsequent 
updates) provides further detail on the sectors in most demand, alongside an assessment of employment site allocations. 
J1.2 Development proposals for employment floorspace must support 
the overarching economic vison set out in this policy and the spatial strategy, to deliver a range of workspaces and to enable growth in Newham’s key economic sectors. Applicants proposing employment floorspace must align their proposals to the supported planning land uses, alongside priority uses to support growth sector development as set out in Tables 6 to 10 in this policy. These tables guide proposals and provides a more granular understanding of the diversity of Newham’s current and future economy. This has been informed by the Employment Land Review (2022) as well as wider council economic strategies.
Strategic Industrial Locations are strategically important industrial 
locations critical to the economic function of London’s economy. These will be protected and intensified in accordance with London Plan (2021) Policy E7.
Local Industrial Locations are locations of particular importance for 
industrial uses which form part of the borough’s reservoir of industrial sites and network of employment locations to support economic growth. These will be protected and intensified.In cases where new industrial, warehousing/distribution is proposed on the borough’s existing retail and leisure parks, industrial intensification criteria will apply. To ensure the suitability of a proposed location, uses will only be supported where it can be demonstrated the Strategic Road Network is a requirement for the economic use as per Policy E4.D in the London Plan (2021). Economic development is expected to contribute to a greener future and deliver more sustainable transport options including how a site is serviced as set out in Policy T4. 
Local Mixed Use Areas are employment-led designations protecting 
and promoting Class E(g) and B8 uses. Employment-led development requires schemes to first meet employment needs (including the viable operation of employment generating uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites) in any design, and then other uses such as residential to be fitted around it. This will involve a co-design and market engagement exercise that establishes the optimum quantity and format of employment space which can meet market demand on the site. Evidence will also need to be provided that any other elements of the proposal do not prejudice the viable operation of employment uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites, and also designs-in compatibility with residential uses.
Micro Business Opportunity Areas are accessible locations 
complementing Town Centres, to provide smaller scale local and low cost employment opportunities. Proposals within these locations will aim to deliver a diverse range of (non-speculative) workspaces mainly in Edge-of-Centre locations, as supported in Policy E2 of the London Plan (2021). Proposals in these locations are required to be employment-led as defined by Local Mixed Use Areas.Implementation153
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESEmployment uses proposed on Site Allocations identified for mixed 
use or employment-led mixed use, will be expected to deliver a range of employment uses. Applicants must align their proposals with the spatial strategy, site allocation objectives and local market evidence as part of an Employment Strategy. Proposals that deviate from the priority uses will need to be sufficiently justified by economic evidence justifying the location and market demand.
Further information on each spatial designation is available in the 
Employment Land Review (2022) (and any subsequent updates) and applicants are expected to discuss their proposals with the Council at the earliest opportunity to ensure that they align with the function, character and priority uses of their proposed location. 
The Policies Map provides the locations of the boroughs designated 
employment land. 
J1.3 Developers with proposals incorporating employment floorspace must submit a robustly evidenced Economic Strategy, which must provide the appropriate economic assessment of each proposal. 
Submissions will need to detail the typology and format of new 
workspace and demonstrate how it supports the needs of occupiers within one of Newham’s priority growth industries and in accordance with part 3 of this policy. Proposals that deviate from the priority uses will need to be sufficiently justified by location and market demand evidence. Submissions should make use of the Employment Land Review (2022) (and any subsequent updates) and submit an Economic Strategy setting out how the proposed development supports economic objectives set out in this policy.  
Applicants must also provide an overview of scheme phasing to 
demonstrate how their proposed approach will maximise occupancy. Phasing is particularly important in relation to the deployment of meanwhile uses, infrastructure sufficiency and in some cases where commercial floorspace comes forward ahead of residential uses on mixed use development. Economic Strategies will need to incorporate and demonstrate how the requirements of Policy J4 can be met, particularly the delivery of Community Wealth Building objectives.

3.121 Newham’s employment land is an important asset, which plays a critical role in supporting both strategic and local economic needs. The Employment Land Review (2022) highlights that there is limited industrial land availability across London coupled with strong demand for industrial floorspace. Reflecting this, the policy requires the protection of all strategic and local employment locations, making the most efficient use of employment land through intensification and ensures that any residential development on an employment-led designation is sensitively designed. 
3.122 To maximise Newham’s economic potential and 
meet its economic needs in full, new employment floorspace on Non-Designated Industrial Sites will be supported providing spatial and wider economic objectives can be met. This approach recognises that Non-Designated Industrial Sites are key to delivering a range of Local Plan objectives including: improving peoples access to economic opportunities, reducing the need to travel further afield for work and supporting new and more localised economic development as part of the commitment to 15-minute neighbourhoods and the Community Wealth Building approach. 
3.123 For office development, the Employment Land 
Review (2022) identified that Newham has a large supply of stock which currently exceeds demand. Therefore, the policy looks to direct new office development to suitable locations (as set out in Policy J1), or as part of a mixed use development where demand can be demonstrated or via the sequential test prioritising Town 155
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJ2.1 Proposals which seek to intensify industrial and logistics uses within 
Strategic Industrial Locations and Local Industrial Locationss will be supported in principle. This is in line with approaches set by London Plan (2021) Policy E7.  As directed by the Employment Land Review (2022), all industrial proposals are expected to explore the scope for multi-deck as a priority followed by other formats (including, but not limited to, stacked units, higher plot ratios, or more intensive internal arrangements intensification where appropriate). 
Proposals that cannot deliver net increases in industrial floorspace 
must provide evidence which outlines:•  
 tha
t all intensification formats set out above have been fully 
explored and cannot be delivered due to lack of demand and/or significant viability and/or site constraints.
•  
 why their pr
oposed alternative approach delivers the best alternative 
intensified employment provision. 
This should be provided as part of the Economic Strategy.
To support implementation of this policy further guidance on the 
most appropriate formats for industrial intensification in Newham are set out in the Characterisation Study (2022) and Employment Land Review (2022).
Proposals should align with the London Plan (2021) and associated 
guidance/examples set out in the Greater London Authority’s Industrial Intensification Practice Note (2018) and Intensification and Co-Location Study (2019).Implementation
J2.2 This policy is supported by guidance in the the Characterisation Study (2022) on co-location and the principles to consider when integrating industrial and residential uses. 
In an employment-led development where existing businesses cannot 
be accommodated on site, a Relocation Strategy will be required. The Strategy will be required to demonstrate that reasonable endeavours have been made to relocate the existing business(es) to a suitable alternative site in Newham which meets their local and regional economic role. The strategy should also include details of how such a move relates to site phasing. 
J2.3 Proposals outside of designated employment locations will be assessed in line with the criteria set out in this policy. Non-designated Industrial Sites are locations being used for industrial and related purposes as per London Plan (2021) Policy E7. 
Development proposals must include the submission of up-to-date 
spatial mapping of the 15-minute employment network. This mapping exercise must identify the development site location in the context of all employment locations (including Town Centres) with a 15-minute walking distance (for example using isochrones and reflecting a detailed understanding of the actual walking conditions for a range of different users) of the site. This will demonstrate the level of employment coverage around the site and whether the proposed site is in an area which is not currently covered by the 15 minute network of economic opportunities for residents.
Affordable Workspace is defined in accordance with the London Plan 
(2021) and any provision must also meet the requirements of Policy J4.4.156
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJ2.4 Standalone office developments, outside of Town 
Centres and Micro Business Opportunity Areas (including those on site allocations and in within Local Mixed Use Areas) must comply with the sequential test and impact assessment approach as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. Proposals for office developments should be focused within Town Centres, and if no sites are available, Edge-of-Centre sites should be explored including Micro Business Opportunity Areas. In line with the London Plan (2022) Policy SD7 proposals must demonstrate through an impact assessment there is no harm to the vitality and viability of centres by the approval of Edge-of-Centre or Out-of-Centre office development.  
Standalone office development is defined as 
proposals that propose new Class E(g)(i) floorspace outside of Town Centres and Micro Business Opportunity Areas and are not ancillary in scale and function to another land use conforming designation. All proposals for employment uses are subject to a demand assessment as per J1.3 and conditions restricting uses may be used where appropriate.
J2.5 Micro Business Opportunity Areas support low cost and micro businesses in accessible locations close to Town Centres. Proposals for new micro-business floorspace are defined as enterprises which employ less than 10 people as defined by the FCA

Justification
3.124 The Employment Land Review (2022) demonstrates the need for the strong protection and safeguarding of industrial land, ensuring it is managed for intensification and growth as well as ensuring existing premises and viable floorspace is sufficiently protected with a no net loss position. 
3.125 For proposals on Strategic Industrial Locations 
and Local Industrial Locations no net loss of existing industrial floorspace (including yard space) is justified by the strong demand for industrial land and high levels of historic industrial land release across London. This is critical to support economic needs for London, the sub-region and within Newham. In very limited circumstances, where a net loss of 158
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
J3.1 and 
J3.2As a principle, the net loss of existing employment floorspace on Local Industrial Location and Strategic Industrial Location is not supported.
In very limited circumstances, where the net loss of employment space and/or loss of businesses 
is outweighed by other material considerations as part of the planning assessment, the Council will seek to secure contributions towards skills, training and local employment initiatives and secured via a development’s legal agreement, as per policy J4. Where existing businesses must be relocated, a Relocation Strategy will be required. 
The Strategy will be required to demonstrate that reasonable endeavours have been made to 
relocate existing businesses to a suitable alternative site in Newham which is suitable for the business’s local and regional economic role. The strategy should also include details of how such a move relates to site phasing. 
J3.3 Micro Business Opportunity Areas support low cost and micro businesses in accessible locations 
close to Town Centres. Proposals are expected to demonstrate as part of the Employment Strategy how replacement floorspace continues to protect these locations, providing low cost and/or affordable workspaces for businesses. Where occupied low cost and/or affordable floorspace forms part of the existing uses, this is expected to be replaced. This policy supports the ambitions of Policies E2 and E3 of the London Plan (2021).
J3.4 All viable employment floorspace will be protected in Local Mixed Use Areas and non-designated employment sites. Applicants must seek to protect employment floorspace in these locations including in a mixed use format.
Loss of employment floorspace will only be considered acceptable when suitably robust evidence 
can be provided to demonstrate that there is no current or future likely demand for the space.  Evidence must be submitted to demonstrate that the site has been offered to the market at a local market value covering a period for at least a 12 month period at locally benchmarked prices/rents for the full range of permitted uses. This should include the option for sub-division and mixed use development. This evidence must include dated marketing information outlining how the above requirements were met. This process is recognised as part of London Plan (2021) Policy E7.employment floorspace is justified, it is important that Newham does not lose the economic capacity as a result. Therefore, endeavours must be made to relocate any existing businesses within Newham and, through financial contributions, to support wider employment initiatives for training, skills development and jobs. This is a key component of the Community Wealth Building approach to support local residents into employment and protect Newham’s strong economic base. 
3.126 Town Centres, Micro Business Opportunity 
Areas, Local Mixed Use Areas and non-designated employment locations all serve a more localised need and are recognised as valuable components of Newham’s economic network by offering a range of cost efficient and locally important spaces. 
3.127 In Local Mixed Use Areas and identified 
non-designated employment locations existing employment floorspace must be protected.  This is to maximise economic opportunities and ensure the protection and provision of important and viable employment floorspace in Newham. This is generally secondary stock across the borough which offers a range of local economic functions. The policy does recognise that employment land in some locations may no longer be viable, but given the need and role of employment land, this requires rigorous market testing before any loss can be accepted.  159

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.128 In line with the Council’s priorities to support 
Community Wealth Building, this policy seeks to tackle inequality and ensure that everyone, regardless of skills, experience or background can meaningfully share and take an active part in Newham’s economy. The Employment and Health in Newham Assessment (July 2022) identified that high quality employment which provides job security, a sense of identify and purpose and income is a significant determinant of improved health and well-being. The assessment identified that residents experience barriers to employment including caring responsibilities (i.e. childcare), their mental or physical health status, language and skills and that wages remain typically lower than the rest of London.
3.129 While Newham has seen some improvements 
in employment rates, unemployment is still slightly higher than the London and UK averages. Newham residents continue to experience unemployment or low paid and insecure jobs. The Employment and Health Needs Assessment (July 2022) also identified that young people (18-24 years), ethnic minority groups, women and those with long term conditions, disabilities or mental health are most likely to be unemployed in Newham. This policy aims to create new opportunities including targeted support and securing new opportunities for local residents to develop skills, knowledge and training to have a role in Newham’s economic future. It ensures that all new employment generating developments in the borough play their part in building an inclusive economy. 
3.130 Newham is committed, as part of its economic 
recovery and climate emergency declaration, to creating a greener economy. Economic development has a central role in delivering this objective, through building design, business operations and business activity. 
3.131 While further evidence is required to 
understand the immediate need for Affordable Workspace, evidence suggests as rents rise and with limited employment land available, existing premises could become less affordable over the Plan period. The policy enables affordable workspaces to be delivered particularly to support creative/cultural, small and medium enterprises and light industrial uses. In supporting a diverse range of workspaces, the aim is to support the already high levels of starts ups and micro enterprises in Newham and to ensure businesses have spaces to thrive as an important component of ensuring a healthy and dynamic economy.

Applicants proposing employment floorspace are encouraged to liaise with the Council’s Economic Regeneration Team (linked with Newham’s employment support brokerage) as part of their pre-application discussions.
This will ensure that appropriate pathways 
and local economic opportunities are highlighted at the earliest possible opportunity. This should form part of the Economic Strategy and to fulfil requirements set by this policy.
J4.1 Applicants are expected to demonstrate how Community Wealth Building has been considered as part of each economic development proposal. The Community Wealth Building Business Pledges are a measure of how new development can deliver local162
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESIn liaison with the Council’s Economic Regeneration team, planning 
conditions will be used to secure employment and training contributions.

including targeting those that may experience barriers to employment or identified groups more likely to be unemployed than others including those with caring responsibilities or mental or physical health challenges, young people (18-24) and women.
The level and nature of the contribution will be determined at the pre-application stage and prior to determination of the planning application.  All employment contributions will be calculated using the average job density figures for B2 (General industrial) Uses. 
J4.2 Available childcare is recognised as a barrier to employment. Where commercial developments on site allocations are proposed, proposals are required to make an assessment of the increased demands for childcare facilities, with the expectation that this is met by existing local provision or new ancillary facilities.
The assessment should include anticipated demand from employees 
on commercial development on site allocations. The Council will consider this information against its latest evidence of existing childcare provision within a 15-minute walking distance of the development site. Requirements to include or contribute towards additional childcare provision will be applied on this basis and, in case of providing provision, the design and quality of the childcare facilities should follow Policy CF4.J4.3 All development is expected to contribute to the overarching ambition to create a greener economy. The policy sets out the approach to ensure all development embraces sustainable design and construction principles from the outset. This includes energy use, operational and whole life emissions, landscaping and design, transport impacts as well as supporting more localised supply chains across the borough. 
All Major economic developments are expected support the green 
economy in construction and operation, and as part of a proposal’s overall economic purpose. This may be evidence within the Energy Statement, Design and Access Statement and/or as part of the Economic Strategy.  Further guidance on the circular economy is outlined by the Circular Economy Supplementary Guidance (March 2022) in the London Plan (2021).
J4.4 Affordable Workspace is defined (as per the London Plan (2021)) as 
workspace at rents maintained below market rate for specific sectors that have social or cultural value or are disadvantaged groups. Provision can be provided or managed directly by workspace providers, public, charitable or private organisations. These can be secured in perpetuity or for a period of at least 15 years by planning or other agreements.
Where Affordable Workspace is proposed, the applicant must 
demonstrate how they have met criteria in this policy as part of the Economic Strategy submission. This includes details of how the workspace will be delivered including evidence of engagement with workspace providers. Applicants are encouraged to liaise with the Council’s Economic Regeneration Team at the pre-application stage to support this policy objective. This will ensure that, where necessary, appropriate affordable workspace providers can be involved early at the design stage. 163

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESHOMES
3.132 The delivery of genuinely high-quality, affordable 
homes helps our residents to live healthy and happy 
lives. When our homes are good quality, we can make connections and thrive in our neighbourhood. 
3.133 Newham (including the area of the borough 
administered by the LLDC) has one of the largest housing targets in the whole of London, with a requirement to deliver 47,600 homes in the ten years to 2029. This means we will be providing homes to not only meet the borough’s needs but also the housing needs of London’s wider population. When providing more homes we need to deliver a mix of housing types and tenures that address significant housing issues that our residents face, such as homelessness, and meet pressing housing needs, particularly for affordable and family-sized homes. 
3.134 We also want to diversify our housing offer, 
speed up construction and optimise the delivery of homes on both small and large sites, exploring the suitability of different types of housing including purpose-built, high-quality rented accommodation. We will seek to improve existing housing where we have influence, protecting much-needed family housing and re-providing existing social rent homes as part of regeneration projects.
3.135 Delivering new homes also means addressing 
the needs of residents who require specialist or supported accommodation. In delivering these homes we will consider evidence of local need, the suitability of a home’s location in relation to necessary services and the quality of accommodation provided. We will also ensure that delivery of specialist housing does not reduce or limit our ability to deliver conventional housing. Houses in Multiple Occupation will be located to reduce amenity impacts, while student accommodation will be delivered where it is most needed and where it will benefit Newham’s economy.
3.136 Finally, new housing should positively contribute 
to our residents’ health and wellbeing, providing homes with flexible layouts and high-quality amenity spaces that people are able to remain in over the course of their lifetimes.

   H1: Meeting housing needs
1.   Ne wham will enable a net increase of between 46,633 and 52,133 quality 
homes between 2021 and 2038. This will be achieved through:
 
 a.
  the majorit
y of new housing being brought forward on Site 
Allocations; and
 
 b.
  the op
timisation of housing delivery on sites below 0.25 hectares in 
size; and
 
 c.
  suppor
ting residential developments that come forward on windfall 
sites (land not allocated within the Local Plan for uses other 
than residential) unless other policies within the Local Plan direct otherwise.
2.  
 De
velopments should optimise site capacity through a design-led 
approach, as set out in Policy D3 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), taking into account a site’s context, capacity for growth and existing and planned supporting infrastructure capacity.
3.  
 Sit
es Allocations or sites with a recent consent for conventional 
residential or part-residential development should be developed at least in part for conventional housing.
4.  
 De
velopment of housing as a meanwhile use on a site while it is 
awaiting longer-term redevelopment will be supported subject to them addressing relevant policy requirements of the Local Plan.
5.  
 De
velopments that seek to deliver community-led housing, self-build 
or custom build housing will be supported in principle where they optimise site capacity through a design-led approach.
166
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH1.1 H1.1 sets out Newham’s housing target 
and sites where the principle of 
delivering new homes will be supported. Outside of designations (including but not limited to Strategic Industrial Land, Local Industrial Land, Metropolitan Open Land and Green Belt) or land uses with policy protections (for example, green space, community facilities or ground floor commercial uses in primary shopping areas) delivery of housing will be supported in principle.
Small sites will form a part of Newham’s 
housing delivery. Developments should seek to optimise housing delivery on small sites below 0.25 hectares in size, following the design-led approach and using the small sites typologies set out in the Newham Characterisation Study (2022). Over the course of the Plan period, Newham will aim to deliver 3,800 homes on sites of this scale, as set out in Policy H2 of the London Plan (2021). 
H1.2 Expectations for following the design-led approach are set out in policies D3 of the Local Plan and D3 of the London Plan (2021). In some circumstances, certain uses or buildings within a site boundary will need to be protected or re-provided.Implementation3.138 The stepped trajectory shows a significant amount of Newham’s housing target will be delivered in the medium to long term phase of the plan. This is because a large proportion of housing delivery numbers are likely to come from large, complex site allocations, many of which require associated infrastructure delivery to facilitate high density residential development. We have assumed a relatively conservative delivery timescale for these schemes; however it is acknowledged that many of these sites may be delivered more quickly than this delivery rate suggests. Indeed, a number of the largest of the borough’s site allocations are located on land owned by the Greater London Authority, with many of these sites anticipated to be subject to strategic level investment to optimise housing delivery aligned with London’s housing needs. 
3.139 In order to meet the borough’s ambitious housing 
target, developments will need to optimise the delivery of homes on site allocations, small sites and windfall sites using the design-led approach set out in both local and regional policy. Applicants will need to ensure that housing has access to adequate supporting infrastructure as well as local facilities such as retail, community spaces, open spaces and parks. Innovative methods of housing delivery, such as self-build, custom housebuilding and community-led housing developments will also be supported where these make optimal use of a site. Justification
3.137 Newham has a significant strategic role to play in delivering new homes to meet both the borough’s and London’s wider need for housing. Over the course of our plan period Newham will look to enable the delivery of between 46,633 and 52,133 additional new homes. This range target is capacity-derived, based on approved planning permission figures, design-led capacity testing of site allocations, capacity assumptions from the 2017 Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment and capacity assumptions from lapsed application sites. The higher growth figures will result from significant infrastructure projects unlocking development sites. Newham is also working on a methodology for housing capacity assumptions on small sites, which will inform capacity figures on developable small sites in the medium and long term phases of the plan period. Supply will be measured through a stepped trajectory, with a different target for every five year phase of the Plan, as follows:
Delivery Period Years Annual Delivery Target
Short term
2022/23 – 2026/27 2,990
Medium term 2027/28 – 2031/32 3,363
Long term 2032/33 – 2037/38 2,478167
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH1.4 compliance with other relevant development plan policies. This includes 
delivering a housing mix in accordance with the requirements of Local Plan policies H3 and H4 where a site delivers conventional housing, alongside other relevant requirements of Local Plan policies.
Applicants should also consider how temporary new builds can reduce 
their environmental footprint via Modern Methods of Construction and potential for reuse of temporary new builds in other locations. Developments using Modern Methods of Construction should accord with the requirements of policy CE3. Newham’s Climate Change Evidence Base (2022) provides further information on the environmental impact of a range of modern construction methods.
H1.5 Developments delivering community-led housing, self-build or custom build housing will be supported in principle where they are considered to optimise the capacity of housing delivery on a site. These developments will be assessed in accordance with the requirements of the design-led approach, as set out in policies D3 of the Local Plan and D3 of the London Plan (2021). They are also expected to meet the requirements of policies H3 and H4, alongside other relevant requirements of Local Plan policies.H1.2 In these cases applicants should consider relevant policy requirements set out within the Design, High Streets, Community Facilities, Green and Water Spaces and Transport chapters of the Local Plan. Where a development falls within a site allocation (see Neighbourhoods section), infrastructure requirements and development principles will set out what infrastructure and uses need to be provided within a site. Applicants should also consider the requirements of Policy BFN4, which seeks to ensure that developments contribute to delivering necessary infrastructure where needed.
Applicants for new housing developments should set out through 
supporting documents how housing densities reflect local context and character (using the guidance and analysis set out in the Newham Characterisation Study (2022)), environmental constraints and are appropriate in relation to the availability of supporting infrastructure including open space, transport, retail, community and other supporting facilities.
H1.3 Developments on sites with a recent consent for conventional residential or part-residential development are expected to propose conventional housing as part of their application submission. Where a development looks to deliver specialist accommodation in place of an existing consent for conventional residential housing, robust evidence should be supplied as to both the need for the proposed specialist housing and why the loss of the permitted conventional housing would not compromise Newham’s ability to meet its most pressing housing needs, including for three-bedroom homes and affordable housing. Assessments of such proposals should take into consideration the Council’s latest Strategic Housing Market Assessment.
H1.4 The policy outlines an in principle support for developments that look to provide housing as a meanwhile use on under-utilised or vacant sites. Such developments should not prevent the long-term permanent development of the site nor delivery of other strategic objectives within the Local Plan and would be expected to demonstrate 168

Justification
3.140 The scale of Newham’s housing target means, that alongside new housing delivery, it is necessary to protect existing housing floorspace, and in particular affordable floorspace. Newham’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment sets out that if we are to meet Newham and London’s housing need as we deliver the Greater London Authority’s housing target, just under 60 per cent of new homes need to be family-sized homes with three or more bedrooms. Therefore, to reduce pressure on overall housing delivery, the policy protects existing family-sized accommodation from conversion to Houses in Multiple Occupation, Large Houses in Multiple Occupation or subdivision to flats.
3.141 Despite the pressure to protect and provide 
more family-sized dwellings, the policy does recognise that there may be circumstances where subdivision or conversion of existing family dwelling houses may be acceptable. The exceptions allowed by the policy are circumstances where existing family accommodation may not be suitably accessed, where resulting units will be of a higher quality or 170
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESwhere conversion is meeting the housing needs of 
homeless people or care leavers. 
3.142 In recent years, Newham has consistently 
had the highest rates of homeless households in temporary accommodation in the country.
8  The 
affordability of privately rented housing is a key challenge, recognising homelessness affects many young single people, under the age of 35, who are subject to the shared accommodation rate for housing benefit. The supply of new Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation being granted planning permission is also limited given the acute identified need to protect family accommodation in Newham. This can lead to people either having to be placed in accommodation outside the borough or remaining in interim temporary accommodation for an extended period. Data from November 2021 suggests that just under 45 per cent of single people (of all ages) placed in temporary accommodation had been living in their accommodation for over three years. 
3.143 Care leavers also face similar challenges with 
regards to the affordability and availability of suitable accommodation upon leaving the care system, with there being a shortage of available standalone and shared accommodation.
9  Accordingly, Policy H2 looks 
to address these challenges by providing exceptional circumstances where the provision of Houses in Multiple Occupation that meet the specific needs of these groups will be supported.
  8GOV.UK Homelessness Statistics 
  9London Borough of Newham Sufficiency Strategy (2019-2022)H2.1 The Policy measures housing floorspace in terms of the overall floorspace within a building, rather than individual units. For example a building containing two one bedroom flats of 50m
2 each 
could be replaced with a three bedroom dwelling with a minimum floorspace of 100m2.
Where residential floorspace is being replaced, new floorspace should provide a bedroom size mix that meets Newham’s housing need, informed through the Council’s latest Strategic Housing Market Assessment and existing provision of affordable and family homes within a site. Considering these factors will help the borough to meet its most pressing housing needs for both affordable and family-sized accommodation.
H2.2 Developments that propose the loss of family-sized accommodation will be refused unless 
meeting the exceptions set out in parts 3 – 5 of the policy. These exceptions acknowledge that in some circumstances, subdivision or conversion of family housing can have multiple benefits or more desirable outcomes.
H2.3 The policy allows for the subdivision of accommodation to flats, or the conversion of 
accommodation to other forms of housing, such as Houses in Multiple Occupation or Large Houses in Multiple Occupation. 
For the purposes of H2.3.a, major roads are key arterial routes and local and destination routes set 
out within the borough’s Sustainable Transport Strategy. 
For the purposes of H2.3.d, poorly defined entrances are those which are not easily understood as 
being an entrance to a home and/or those which are not located in plain sight. This could include, but is not limited to, entrances that are accessed from alleyways or servicing roads to the rear of a commercial property or poorly lit spaces. Poorly defined entrances are discouraged through design policies and can be particularly challenging for the elderly, persons with disabilities or people with young children who may need to carry prams, car seats or other equipment long distances over uneven surfaces or up external staircases. Where practicable all approach routes to housing should 
be step free. Implementation171
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH2.4 The policy allows for sub-divisions that retain a family-sized house (three or more 
bedrooms) and provide a new dwelling house. High quality is considered to be a dwelling that meets the relevant design requirements of Policy H11. This includes both internal design requirements and the provision of high quality, external amenity space for each unit. 
H2.5 This Policy sets out an exception to allow for the conversion of family homes to Houses 
in Multiple Occupation where accommodation meets the specific housing needs of Newham Care Leavers or people requiring temporary accommodation as a result of homelessness. Accommodation placements for these groups should be made directly by the London Borough of Newham, with the definition of ‘Newham Care Leavers’ set out in the Local Plan glossary. 
Care leavers accommodation provided through this exception should be for up to six 
sharers. Accommodation for people placed or due to be placed in emergency temporary accommodation by Newham Council as a result of homelessness can be either be designed as a House in Multiple Occupation or as a Large House in Multiple Occupation.
Conversions under this part are expected to meet the requirements of Policy H9 relating 
to management plans, tenancy length and rent levels. Proposals should also meet the relevant quality requirements of Policy H11 (see Table 13). 
To meet the requirements of this Policy, the use of the accommodation specifically for 
Newham Care Leavers or homeless people placed by the London Borough of Newham should be secured via a legal agreement. Provision within the legal agreement ensures that planning permission would be required to change the use of the property from meeting these specific accommodation needs. This will be assessed in accordance with the requirements of Policy H9.2.
For the purposes of H2.5.c, major roads are key arterial routes and local and destination 
routes set out within Newham’s emerging Sustainable Transport Strategy.Monitoring

Justification
3.144 Policy H3 sets out Newham’s expectations for affordable housing delivery, recognising the pressing need to deliver affordable homes to meet both Newham and London’s wider housing needs. Around 50 per cent of Newham’s residents currently live in poverty when housing costs are taken into consideration, a situation that may worsen if cost of living increases continue along current trends.  Furthermore, recent years have showed that Newham has one of the largest housing registers in the country as well as the largest number of people in temporary accommodation.
3.145 The Newham’s Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (SHMA) sets out that 54 per cent of housing need across the plan period is for affordable homes, with 66 per cent of this need being for social rent homes. Accordingly, Policy H3 sets overall affordable housing and tenure mix targets, which developments are expected to meet on site. Newham’s strategic target seeks to deliver 50 per cent of all new homes delivered across the plan period as affordable housing. This will be delivered through 173
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESapplying the ‘threshold approach’ to applications set 
out in the London Plan (2021), which sets different affordable housing thresholds for public, private and industrial land. The policy does allow for provision of affordable housing off site or payment in lieu of affordable housing in limited circumstances where delivery on site is unfeasible. However, the stability of affordable housing as an asset means that delivering affordable homes forms a key foundation of the borough’s housing delivery, particularly in a context of economic uncertainty. 
H3.1 Part 1 of the policy sets out Newham’s overarching strategic target to deliver 50 per cent of new homes delivered across the plan period as affordable housing. To meet our strategic affordable housing target, affordable housing delivery should be maximised on publicly owned sites, developments brought forward by registered providers and on industrial land suitable for residential development and sites where the loss of Community Facilities are deemed acceptable as per Policy CF2. Industrial land considered suitable for residential development should be assessed in accordance with the requirements of Policy E7 of the London Plan (2021) and Local Plan Policy J3.ImplementationWhile the borough’s strategic affordable housing target is 50 per cent, the policy would not prevent the delivery of 100 per cent affordable housing developments, recognising the significant contribution such developments can make to strategic affordable housing delivery across the borough. Developments delivering above 50 per cent can also provide a more flexible tenure mix than required under part 2 of the policy, which will be assessed by the Council on a case-by-case basis.
H3.2 Developments are expected to provide affordable housing in accordance with Policy H5 of the London Plan (2021). The threshold approach sets minimum affordable housing requirements that developments are expected to meet. These are different depending on the land use or ownership of a site. Affordable housing targets of the threshold approach are as follows:•  a minimum of 35 per cent; or•  
 50 per c
ent for public sector land (this can vary for individual sites where agreements to deliver 
a portfolio of sites have been agreed with the Mayor of London); or
•  
 50 per c
ent for industrial sites where development would result in a net loss of industrial 
capacity.
Affordable housing targets are measured using the gross number of new habitable rooms within a development. 
The policy also sets out the target tenure mix for developments providing affordable housing. 
Developments that propose a higher proportion of social rent housing than required under the policy will be supported, and will not be required to submit a detailed financial viability assessment if the development provides a policy compliant level of affordable housing as a percentage of habitable rooms and family housing as a percentage of the development’s total units.
In addition to the overall tenure mix split, a development’s proposed bedroom size mix of social 
rent units should be informed by evidence of local housing need as published in Newham’s most up-to-date Strategic Housing Market Assessment. This helps to ensure the delivery of different affordable housing tenures is responsive to Newham’s latest evidence of housing needs, which currently shows a significant need for family-sized social rent dwellings.
Where developments meet the relevant affordable housing targets of the London Plan (2021) 
threshold approach, provide a policy compliant tenure mix as per Policy H3.2.b, and provide a174
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESpolicy compliant level of family housing as per Policy H4.2, they can 
follow a ‘Fast Track Route’ where they are not required to submit a viability assessment. Developments that do not meet these requirements should submit a detailed financial viability assessment with a Benchmark Land Value that uses an Existing Use Value plus approach. This will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. These developments will also be subject to review mechanisms as set out in Local Plan Policy BNF4.
H3.3 The policy sets an expectation that affordable housing provision should be delivered on site. The policy recognises that there may be exceptional circumstances where off-site provision or payment in lieu of affordable housing may be necessary. For example, developments delivering a small number of affordable homes (15 units or less) may not be able to secure a registered provider to take on a small number of units. However, such circumstances will only be considered acceptable where applicants provide clear and convincing justification and evidence that the provision of affordable housing on site is unfeasible and that units will not be taken up. This includes evidence of discussion with Registered Providers on Newham’s list of accredited providers showing no interest in the offer. These discussions need to be evidenced through a development’s financial viability assessment. Assessment of the acceptability of these schemes’ housing mix will also involve close scrutiny of a development’s proposed size mix, to ensure developments are meeting the need for more family-sized accommodation (in accordance with Policy H4) where they are unable to deliver affordable homes.
Developments proposing off-site provision or a payment in lieu of 
affordable housing will be required to submit a detailed financial viability assessment. Where developments propose off-site affordable housing provision, affordable homes should be delivered either before or at the same time as private homes proposed through the development.H3.4 The reliance of developments on an existing permission will be assessed through reviewing the overlap of site layouts, access, shared cores or entranceways and facilities. Where sites are judged to be reliant on one another to function or meet policy requirements or standards, affordable housing will be required based on the combined number of units of the existing site or permission and the new units proposed through the development.

Justification
3.146 Policy H4 requires the delivery of a mix of housing types, sizes and tenures to help meet Newham’s housing needs. Newham’s latest evidence of housing needs suggests that around 60 per cent of Newham’s housing need is for family-sized homes (three beds or larger). Accordingly, the policy sets minimum targets for the provision of both family-sized homes within major development proposals and affordable four-bedroom homes on site allocations. The lower minimum percentage requirements are reflective of Newham’s latest viability evidence, which suggests that delivering 40 per cent of family homes is viable across a range of different development size, types and locations. Setting a minimum target for three bed or larger dwellings will help address the acute need for the provision of family homes within Newham, while a minimum four-bedroom target on site allocations will help to encourage multigenerational living, re-provide larger family homes through regeneration projects and help address the needs of overcrowded families living in temporary accommodation. 
3.147 The policy also sets an expectation that no more 
than 15 per cent of a site’s housing mix should be one bedroom units, reflective of evidence of housing needs set out within the borough’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment. Studio units will also be resisted, as their size tends to lack sufficient flexibility to meet people’s changing needs over the course of their lifetime.177
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH4.1 Part 1 of the policy sets out the criteria that a development’s housing 
mix will be assessed against. All developments will be expected to 
meet the criteria of part 2 and 4 of the policy (and part 3 for site allocations), but the policy does allow some flexibility in allowing for consideration of various factors that may influence a development’s housing mix. These include Newham’s most up to date evidence of housing needs (the Strategic Housing Market Assessment), any financial viability assessment submitted alongside an application, the ability to meet policy targets via additional subsidy and an individual site’s context. 
Newham’s latest housing needs suggests that the majority of the 
borough’s housing need (around 60 per cent) is for family-sized homes (three or more bedroom dwellings). Two bedroom homes form a much smaller proportion of our housing need (just under 30 per cent) while one bedroom dwellings form a small proportion of need (just over 10 per cent). Accordingly, sites are expected to prioritise the delivery of family-sized homes as part of their housing mix, before determining the respective mix of two-bed and one-bed provision aligned with identified need. 
In terms of development design, different dwelling types should be 
evenly distributed across proposals and within buildings, giving real choice of floor, aspect and orientation to residents.
Although sites delivering below ten units are not required to meet 
the requirements of parts 2 and 4 of the policy, developments for sites of this scale are expected to provide a mix of housing that includes family-sized housing, recognising this is one of Newham’s most pressing housing needs. Failure to provide a genuine mix of housing sizes through minor developments may result in a refusal of an application. H4.2 Part 2 of the policy sets out expectations for the delivery of three or more bedroom homes (C3) within a residential development. This requirement applies to any development delivering dwelling houses (C3), including conventional housing, Build to Rent accommodation and older persons housing (excluding care home accommodation). Developments on individual sites capable of delivering ten housing units or more that provide less than 40 per cent of the total proposed homes within a development as three bed or larger homes will be required to submit a financial viability assessment demonstrating why a policy compliant level of family housing cannot be achieved. This financial viability assessment should also cover affordable housing delivery where this does not achieve policy compliant levels as per the requirements of Policy H3.2 concerning overall unit delivery and tenure mix. The financial viability assessment will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. Where a development does not achieve a policy compliant level of family or affordable housing, the Council will consider the overall housing mix being provided within a development to decide any necessary trade-offs between affordable and family housing delivery.
H4.3 Developments on site allocations (identified in the Neighbourhoods chapter of the Local Plan) should aim to deliver a minimum of 5 per cent of proposed homes as four or more bedroom affordable dwelling houses (C3). This 5 per cent counts towards the overall 40 per cent family housing target sought under part 2 of the policy.
H4.4 H4.4 sets a maximum delivery expectation for one bedroom homes on major development sites. Developments delivering above 15 per cent of the total units as one bedroom, two person units will need to robustly justify this provision in accordance with the requirements of part 1 of the policy.
H4.5 Developments should not provide studio units as part of a development’s housing mix. Where studios are proposed, applicants will need to robustly justify this provision in accordance with the requirements of part 1 of the policy.Implementation178

Where it is demonstrated that a Build to Rent approach will deliver less affordable housing in terms of a capital subsidy, a revenue subsidy may be considered as an appropriate alternative.
180
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.148 Build to Rent accommodation is purpose-built 
accommodation that is designed for rent rather than sale. It is distinct from shared rented accommodation such as Houses in Multiple Occupation (C4) and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation (sui generis) or Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living. Recent years have seen a significant growth in the role of the private rented sector, as a result of changes to letting polices and pressures on the housing stock that have made it less likely that young single persons will be allocated a one-bedroom social rent or affordable rented property. Latest evidence suggests there are roughly 50,000 private rented sector properties in the borough, with private renting particularly prevalent in people from white, non-British ethnic backgrounds and from Asian Indian backgrounds. Recognising its growing role in the housing market, Policy H5 looks to set quality standards for Build to Rent accommodation and requires the delivery of affordable housing. Unlike build for sale homes, Build to Rent properties are not subject to market ‘absorption rates’ (the rate developers will release homes onto the market to prevent price falls), meaning that the delivery of high quality and affordable Build to Rent accommodation can help to accelerate housing delivery within the borough.H5.1 Developments that do not meet the requirements of part 1 of the policy will not qualify as Build to Rent accommodation and will be considered as Build for Sale developments with respect to the delivery of affordable housing.
A valuation of the market and affordable units should be included within a development’s legal 
agreement. This will allow for the calculation of the clawback level if the covenant, required under H5.1.c, is broken.
H5.2 Developments that deliver Build to Rent blocks or phases in larger developments that also deliver 
build for sale accommodation will be required to meet affordable housing requirements set out in Policy H3.2.
H5.3 Part 3 of the policy sets out affordable housing delivery expectations on sites where Build to Rent 
is proposed as the sole housing tenure within a development. In these instances, affordable Build to Rent accommodation should be provided as affordable rented accommodation, with 65 per cent of new units being at equivalent rents to London Affordable Rent, and the remaining 35 per cent of new homes being at equivalent rents to London Living Rent. Weekly rent benchmarks for London Affordable Rent are published on the Greater London Authority’s website. The Mayor of London publishes benchmark London Living Rent levels for every neighbourhood in the capital, updated annually on the Greater London Authority’s website.
Industrial land appropriate for residential uses will be assessed in accordance with the 
requirements of London Plan (2021) Policy E7 and Local Plan Policy J3.
H5.4 Developments that fail to provide affordable housing in line with the requirements of parts 2 and 3 
of the policy will be required to provide a detailed financial viability assessment, with a Benchmark Land Value that uses an Existing Use Value plus premium approach. This will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. These developments will also be subject to review mechanisms as set out in Local Plan Policy BNF4. 
Developments delivering Build to Rent accommodation, either as the only housing tenure on site 
or as an element of a broader development, should detail within their financial viability assessment the different outcomes of delivering built to rent homes against delivering build for sale units.Implementation181

   Ne

3.149 Policy H6 seeks to meet the accommodation needs of different groups who may require specialist or supported accommodation, including people with learning disabilities or autism, looked after children, care leavers and homeless people. The policy seeks to protect and deliver high quality accommodation that meets need and is in locations that are well-connected, that meet the safeguarding needs of residents and have access to adequate supporting facilities. Information from Newham’s Adult Social Care team shows that people who need specialist or supported housing are currently housed outside the borough given a lack of available Newham-based accommodation. The borough’s latest evidence of housing needs also suggests that there are a significant number of people in Newham’s population who may need a form of supported accommodation, due to factors such as age, disabilities, mental health issues, autism, drug and alcohol misuse, domestic abuse or homelessness. However, the evidence makes clear that the number of people identified within the population with a support need may not necessarily require specialist accommodation, recognising that many people may not be eligible for accommodation or will have an individual preference to receive care and support in their home. Accordingly, developments should be assessed having regard to both the locational suitability of accommodation, as well as the need for different types of accommodation.4.  
 Ne
w specialist or supported housing for people 
with care needs, with the exception of sheltered accommodation for older people, should ensure that occupancy from residents from outside of Newham should not, on average, comprise more than 33 per cent of the total residents. 
5.  
 Lar
ger specialist homes (comprising six or more 
bed spaces or units within a wider development) for people with a Profound and Multiple Learning Disability will be resisted. 
6.  
 De
velopments for specialist housing should 
include an appropriately detailed and resourced management plan.183
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH6.1 Part 1 of the policy outlines the set of circumstances under which 
developments may seek to convert, redevelop or remove specialist or supported housing. Specialist provision for vulnerable people is housing that incorporates support for a particular group. Individuals may live in supported accommodation for the long term or for shorter periods until they are ready to move on. These forms of accommodation vary in the level of support provided, although they are likely to include some communal facilities for residents. Typically accommodation will be Residential institutions (C2), but some provision may be considered sui generis or a dwelling house (C3). 
Developments seeking to meet the criteria of H6.1.a should show 
that sufficient accommodation is or will be available to meet the accommodation needs of residents who would have utilised the existing facility to be lost. Accommodation should be available to meet the needs of residents immediately and should be of an equivalent affordability to the existing accommodation to be lost. The suitability of the replacement accommodation’s location should be discussed with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams to ensure its location is appropriate for the type of accommodation being provided and the needs of residents are fully considered (for example, they have convenient access to supporting facilities or are at an appropriate distance to a Town or Local Centre).
Alternatively, existing specialist or supported accommodation can be lost 
to other uses where relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams consider the provision is of a low quality. Evidence of discussions with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams should be submitted alongside an application. If provision is considered to be of suitable quality for occupation, accommodation should not be lost to other uses and applicants should work with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams to secure a provider for the accommodation.H6.2 Part 2 of the policy sets out the strategic principles that all developments for specialist housing will be assessed against. 
To provide high quality accommodation, developments through their 
application drawings and supporting documents should show how the proposed accommodation meets relevant quality standards set out within Policy H11.
Specialist or supported accommodation should form part of a broader 
housing mix within an area and should be located so residents will have access to both good quality public transport links and supporting facilities. These could include specialist healthcare or social and leisure opportunities. Applicants should consider whether existing supporting facilities can accommodate increased usage as a result of new accommodation provision. Typically, specialist or supported accommodation should be directed to locations that are accessible to Town and/or Local Centres and relevant supporting facilities. Accessibility to these locations should typically be a 5–10-minute walk (approximately 400-800m). However, in some instances proximity to Town Centres may be inappropriate. This could be because of safeguarding risks or distancing from potential health triggers. Alternative locations should be justified through early engagement with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams.
The need for accommodation should be set out within an application’s 
supporting documentation. In most instances, facilities should meet a local need for accommodation and accord with the requirements of parts 3 and 4 of the policy. In limited circumstances a sub-regional need for accommodation may be identified. The acceptability of these forms of accommodation will be determined in collaboration with colleagues in the Council’s relevant commissioning teams. In the majority of instances, sub-regional approaches should be identified within strategic papers (for example, agreed Cabinet decisions).Implementation184
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH6.3 Local need for accommodation should be evidenced through having regard to the Council’s or other 
relevant public sector bodies’ strategies, the borough’s latest published Infrastructure Delivery Plan and through discussions with relevant internal commissioning teams. London Borough of Newham commissioning teams should indicate the local need for the form of specialist accommodation proposed, as well as the quality of the proposed accommodation.
H6.4 The proposed occupancy of specialist or supported accommodation should be set out within a 
proposal’s site management plan. If the proposed facility is new and not yet operational, the applicant should set out which Local Authorities or charities the provider will be working with to show that a minimum of 67 per cent of occupiers will be existing Newham residents. Developments for sheltered accommodation for older people are not required to meet this requirement. Exceptions to this requirement may also be supported where accommodation is helping Newham to deliver a strategic sub-regional partnership approach to accommodation provision or where safeguarding issues require placement of residents outside of the borough. The suitability of exceptions to this requirement should be determined through evidenced early engagement with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams. Sub-regional approaches should also be identified within strategic papers (for example, agreed Cabinet decisions).
H6.5 Part 5 of the policy applies to accommodation for people with a Profound and Multiple Learning 
Disability. Profound and Multiple Learning Disability is a term used to describe when a person has a severe Learning Disability and other disabilities that significantly affect their ability to communicate and be independent. A person with a Profound and Multiple Learning Disability may have severe difficulties seeing, hearing, speaking and moving; and may have complex Health and Social Care needs due to these or other conditions. Where accommodation is proposed with more than six bed spaces, this should be agreed in consultation with relevant teams within the Council’s commissioning services to ensure the quality of accommodation meets the needs of future residents. 
H6.6 Management plans should demonstrate the residential population mix and other management practices that minimise safeguarding risks, maximise opportunities to create and sustain social networks and access appropriate support, and ensure that the development minimises amenity impacts. Management plans should also include details of numbers of staff on site and staff routines, how residents will be placed within the accommodation, the level of care provided, how resident independence would be sustained, expected comings and goings, safeguarding practices, health and safety procedures and the maintenance of the accommodation and any communal spaces provided.Monitoring

Justification
3.150 Policy H7 supplements the requirements of Policy H6, encouraging the provision of housing for older people where the accommodation meets need, is of a high quality and is provided in locations with access to supporting facilities. The London Plan (2021) sets the borough an annual benchmark to deliver 85 older persons accommodation units per annum between 2017 and 2029. However, Newham’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment suggests there is emerging picture of demand for different types of older persons housing, with different types of accommodation experiencing varying levels of demand and assistive technology meaning that people could stay in their homes for longer. There is an increasing emphasis on designing homes for people to ‘age in place’, with people’s desire to move being influenced by their personal circumstances.

3.151 Newham faces challenges when finding accommodation placements for older residents, with the borough currently making comparatively low in-borough placements compared with other boroughs. This is due to Newham’s relatively low rent costs and other boroughs ability to outprice the host borough. Latest evidence suggests there is insufficient in-

11. 
3.152 Older people within Newham also face challenges of housing affordability. Recent survey work undertaken as part of the borough’s Ageing Well Strategy (2022) suggests that around a fifth of residents surveyed aged over 50 found housing costs difficult to afford and 15 per cent very difficult to afford. Similarly, in 2019 37.3 per cent of Newham’s residents aged 60 and over were living in poverty.
12  
Accordingly, the policy seeks to address these issues, requiring that housing for older people should provide affordable housing in line with the requirements of Policy H3 (with the exception of care home accommodation).

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
H7.1 of H7.1.c will be required to provide a detailed financial viability 
assessment, proving why a policy compliant provision of affordable housing is not viable. This will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. These developments will also be subject to review mechanisms as set out in Local Plan Policy BNF4.
The policy supports the provision of small-scale community facilities or 
town centre uses in accommodation for older people where provision is considered appropriate by Newham’s relevant commissioning teams and falls within locations where community facilities and/or town centre uses would be supported (see policies HS2, HS3 and CF2). The scale of such facilities should be appropriate to the scale of the development and allow for use both by residents of the facility as well as members of the public.H7.1 Older people’s housing typologies typically include:•  
 Shelt
ered housing: self-contained accommodation designed for 
independent living with support available if required.
•  
 Extr
a care/assisted living: self-contained accommodation within a 
wider development with 24-hour care and support available. 
•  
 Car
e home accommodation: personal care and accommodation 
provided on site as a single package and often regulated by the care quality commission. 
Further details of these typologies can be found on the Age UK website and within the London Plan (2021) Policy H13.
13  
For the purposes of H7.1.b, major roads are key arterial routes and local and destination routes set out within Newham’s emerging Sustainable Transport Strategy. The requirements of H7.1.c do not apply to care home accommodation. ‘Care home accommodation’ for the purposes of this policy is defined as having the following attributes, as per the London Plan (2021) definition:•  
 per
sonal care and accommodation are provided together as a 
package with no clear separation between the two; and
•  
 the per
son using the service cannot choose to receive personal care 
from another provider; and
•  
 peopl
e using the service do not hold occupancy agreements such 
as tenancy agreements, licensing agreements, licences to occupy premises, or leasehold agreements or a freehold; and
•  
 lik
ely Care Quality Commission-regulated activity will be 
‘accommodation for persons who require nursing or personal care’.
The determination of whether a development is considered to provide care home accommodation will be considered on a case-by-case basis dependent on the nature of the accommodation being provided, andwill be reviewed by London Borough of Newham commissioning teams based on relevant needs and capacity assessments.

 De
velopments delivering purpose-built student 
accommodation should provide small-scale community facilities that meet the needs of the student population within a development unless they are located within 1,200 metres of existing student facilities that have sufficient capacity to meet increased need.189
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.153 Policy H8 seeks to deliver student 
accommodation to support the expansion of 
borough-based campuses. In recent years, Newham has seen high levels of student accommodation permitted, particularly within Stratford and Maryland. As of March 2022, just under 2,500 bed spaces have been permitted or completed in this neighbourhood since financial year 2019/20. This equates to around seven per cent of London’s wider need for purpose built student accommodation, completed or permitted in only three years of the London Plan’s (2021) ten year plan period. Newham’s latest evidence of housing needs suggests that Newham campuses account for a small proportion (around six per cent) of students enrolled in higher education providers in London as of 2020/21. 
3.154 Accordingly, the policy seeks to regulate 
levels of student housing delivery, to better reflect 
Newham’s higher education economy. The policy also prevents additional student housing delivery in the Stratford and Maryland neighbourhood, noting that the majority of pipeline and delivered student bed spaces in recent years have been provided within this neighbourhood. This approach seeks to secure associated local jobs and economic benefits that student accommodation accompanied by campus expansion can provide without undermining the delivery of general needs housing. Alongside delivering appropriately located accommodation, the policy also requires the delivery of affordable student bed spaces and looks to ensure that community facilities in proximity of new student accommodation do not face undue pressures as a result of new student populations who require space to work and study.
190
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH8.1 Part 1 of the policy sets out spatial requirements for the delivery of purpose built student 
accommodation. In all instances, purpose-built student accommodation provision should be linked to an existing Newham-based campus via a nominations agreement, as per part 3 of the policy. Accommodation should either be directed to campus developments within Newham, or to Town Centre locations that are well-connected by public transport. The exception to this is the Stratford and Maryland neighbourhood, where developments for purpose-built accommodation will only be permitted where they are replacing an existing facility. Developments within the Stratford and Maryland neighbourhood delivering purpose-built student accommodation should only re-provide the same number of bedrooms as the existing development and should not result in a net increase of student bed spaces.
H8.2 Affordable student accommodation is defined within the London Plan (2021) Policy H15, with the appropriate rent level published annually within the Mayor of London’s Annual Monitoring Report. Developments that fail to provide affordable housing in line with the requirements of part 2 of the policy will be required to provide a detailed financial viability assessment, demonstrating why a policy compliant provision of affordable housing is not viable. This will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. These developments will also be subject to review mechanisms as set out in Local Plan Policy BNF4.
H8.3 The majority of purpose-built student rooms are required to be secured through a nominations agreement with a Newham-based higher education provider. This agreement should be agreed prior to the commencement of above ground works on a development and will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
H8.4 Developments for purpose-built student accommodation should provide small scale community facilities to meet the needs of their student population proportionate to the scale of the development. These should be designed to primarily meet the needs of the students living in the proposed accommodation, but should consider options to allow for access for the wider population outside of term time. There is an exception to this requirement where existing facilities catering to the student population are within 1,200m of the development (a 15 minute walk) and have the capacity to meet the increased need from the new development, which would need to be evidenced as part of an application submission. These facilities could be, for example, within an existing campus development. Developments delivering new or expanded education floorspace alongside the provision of student accommodation should also meet the requirements of Policy CF4 . This policy contains specific requirements on providing access to other community uses outside of core hours.Monitoring

Justification
3.155 Policy H9 seeks to ensure that shared accommodation is delivered in suitable locations, is neighbourly and contributes to the supply of affordable accommodation within the borough. Latest housing needs evidence suggests that recent graduates are increasingly occupying Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation given pressures on the availability of social housing and rising private rents. Accordingly, there is a necessity in Newham to balance the need to protect family housing from conversion while also allowing for the delivery of new Houses in Multiple 5.  
  Lar

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESOccupation and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation 
that are of a high quality and affordable to young people. 
3.156 Policy H9 covers three types of shared 
accommodation, Houses in Multiple Occupation (C4), Large Houses in Multiple Occupation (sui generis) and Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living (sui generis). Forms of shared accommodation that are more intensely occupied, namely Large Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living developments, are directed to the borough’s major roads where residents will have better access to services and supporting facilities. Similarly, these locations can help mitigate amenity impacts from more intensely occupied forms of multi-occupancy housing, including increased trip generation and the potential amount of noise and waste generated from accommodation. Alongside locational requirements, the policy also requires that Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation contribute to the supply of low-cost housing. Large scale purpose built shared living developments are expected to deliver affordable housing, either as part of a wider mix of tenures  or via a payment in lieu of affordable housing. H9.1 Policy H9 includes requirements for different forms of multiple occupancy housing. These include:•  
 Hous
es in Multiple Occupation (C4): Small shared houses occupied by between three and 
six unrelated individuals, as their only or main residence, who share basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom.
•  
 Lar
ge Houses in Multiple Occupation (sui generis): Shared houses occupied by between seven 
and ten unrelated individuals, as their only or main residence, who share basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom. For the purposes of Newham’s Local Plan, shared accommodation occupied by eleven or more unrelated individuals is considered to be a Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living development.
•  
 Lar
ge-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living: Shared housing typically occupied by over ten 
individuals, as their only or main residence, who shared basic amenities including kitchens and communal amenity areas. Additional services and facilities are often included within these developments such as room cleaning, bed linen, on-site gyms and concierge services. Private rooms within large scale purpose built shared living should not be able to be lived in as self-contained accommodation. This form of accommodation can sometimes be referred to as ‘co-living’.
Developments proposing the loss of existing Houses in Multiple Occupation, Large Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living developments will be supported in principle. The only exception to this is Houses in Multiple Occupation or Large Houses in Multiple Occupation secured as housing for Newham Care Leavers or people placed or due to be placed in emergency temporary accommodation by Newham Council. The loss of these forms of accommodation will be assessed under part 2 of the policy.
H9.2 Houses in Multiple Occupation or Large Houses in Multiple Occupation secured as housing for Newham Care Leavers or people placed or due to be placed in emergency temporary accommodation by Newham Council are homes that have previously been approved under the criteria of Policy H2.5, with the use for these groups having been secured via an application’s legal agreement. Where these homes are proposed to be lost, the proposed use should be a family dwelling house (C3) with three or more bedrooms.Implementation193
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH9.3 Management plans should contain:
•  management practices that minimise safeguarding risks; and•  
 oppor
tunities for residents to create and sustain social networks; 
and
•  
 me
asures that will minimise the accommodation’s amenity impacts; 
and
•  
 s
ecurity and fire safety procedures.
For Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living developments, the management plan should also include all of the following:•  
 c
onfirmation that the accommodation will be under single 
management, with a minimum tenancy length of three months;
•  
 maint
enance of the internal and external areas of the building, 
including communal spaces and private rooms;
•

concierge service, gyms, room cleaning or linen changing services.
•  
 the mana
gement of deliveries for servicing the development and 
residents; and
•  
 arr
angements for moving in and out of the accommodation.
Management plans will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
H9.4
Developments for Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large Houses in Multiple Occupation are required to cap their rents at the relevant Local Housing Allowance Shared Accommodation Rate for the area. Local Housing Allowance Rates for an area can be found on the GOV.UK website:  Local Housing Allowance Rates for the Newham Local Authority : DirectGov - LHA Rates (voa.gov.uk). The capping of a property’s rents will be secured through a legal agreement.
H9.5 The affordable housing requirements for Large-Scale Purpose-Built 
Shared Living will depend on whether Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living is being delivered as part of a wider mix of tenures within an application’s boundary. If a wider mix of tenures are being proposed, then developments are expected to deliver affordable housing in accordance with the requirements of Policy H3 of the Local Plan.If Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living is being delivered as the sole tenure on site, then developments are expected to deliver a payment in lieu contribution towards conventional affordable housing provision, at a higher level of affordable housing to Newham’s 50 per cent strategic affordable housing target.
Developments that fail to provide affordable housing in line with 
the requirements of part 5a of the policy or provide a payment in lieu contribution towards conventional affordable housing will be required to provide a detailed financial viability assessment. This will be independently assessed by Newham’s viability consultants. These developments will also be subject to review mechanisms as set out in Local Plan Policy BNF4.
H9.6 Part 6 of the policy includes requirements for the location of more 
intensely occupied forms of multiple occupancy housing. These include Large Houses in Multiple Occupation and Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living developments. The policy requires these forms of multiple occupancy housing to be located within Town and Local Centres or along major roads. For the purposes of H9.6, major roads are key arterial routes and local and destination routes set out within the borough’s Sustainable Transport Strategy.
H9.7 These details should be set out in a development’s management plan, which will be secured via a legal agreement.
H9.8 Suitable locations are those which are defined as acceptable for town 
centre uses under Local Plan Policy HS2, Policy HS3 and community facilities under Policy CF2.194

•   Financi al and/or non-financial planning obligations 
may be required to secure the maintenance and management of a site and its infrastructure. This will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
 Justification
3.157 Policy H10 seeks to ensure that the housing needs of Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpersons’ communities are met. Under the government’s published Planning Policy for Traveller Sites, Gypsies and Travellers are considered to be “Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily” (the ‘planning definition’). The Planning Policy for Traveller Sites requires Local Planning Authorities to identify sufficient sites to meet any need identified for Gypsies and Travellers falling within the planning definition across their plan period. 
3.158 However, the planning definition excludes those 
members of the Gypsy and Traveller community who have ceased to travel permanently. This includes the majority of those who consider themselves part of the Gypsy and Traveller community in Newham. While the restrictive nature of the planning definition excludes members of the Gypsy and Traveller community who have ceased to travel permanently, the borough has a duty to consider the needs of people residing in or resorting to their district with respect to the provision of sites on which caravans can be stationed, or places  
 e.
  the sit
e is in a sustainable location, suitable 
for residential development and in reasonable proximity to relevant services and facilities, including transport, education, healthcare and other relevant community infrastructure provision.

 Developments that propose accommodation 
to meet the needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpersons should:
 
 a.
  pr
ovide an appropriately detailed 
management plan; and
 
 b.
  demonstr
ate that quality standards 
have been agreed in consultation with representatives of the local Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople community.196
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESon inland waterways where houseboats can be 
moored under housing legislation. Romany Gypsies, Irish and Scottish Travellers may also be able to claim a right to culturally appropriate accommodation under the 2010 Equality Act. 
3.159 Newham’s latest evidence of Gypsy and Traveller 
accommodation needs found that there was no need for new pitches for households that meet the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites definition of Gypsies and Travellers. However, the study found a need for 23 pitches for households that did not meet the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites definition. Accordingly, Policy H10 allows for developments for new pitches to come forward in appropriate locations that have access to necessary services and infrastructure. The Local Planning Authority will continue to work with colleagues in housing to meet the accommodation needs of Newham’s Gypsy and Traveller community where sites are proposed to be brought forward on publicly owned land.H10.1 Any development brought forward on the safeguarded site for uses other than Gypsy and Traveller 
accommodation will be refused.
H10.2 Developments proposing accommodation to meet these needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpersons should demonstrate need for the accommodation being proposed. Accommodation can meet the needs of members of the community whose accommodation needs are considered under the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites or members of the community who accommodation needs fall outside the scope of the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites.
In most instances, evidence should refer to the findings of Newham’s Gypsy and Traveller 
Accommodation Assessment, but additional details can be submitted alongside the application as necessary. This could be in the form of an up to date, robust needs assessment or evidence about personal circumstances and the adequacy of existing accommodation provision.
H10.3 Part 3 of the policy sets out locational requirements for new Gypsy and Traveller accommodation. 
Accommodation proposed in flood zone 2 should be justified with regards to the requirements of Policy CE7. The policy also sets out requirements for infrastructure provision and access to services and facilities. Primary physical infrastructure should include access to waste management, as well as access to specialist utility and communal spaces, and accommodation and access for large vehicles.
H10.4
A site’s management plan should outline how features such as communal infrastructure are managed on an ongoing basis to maintain neighbourliness within and beyond the site and ensure housing quality and amenity for residents. This should be proportionate to the scale of the development proposed. It may be necessary for financial and non-financial planning obligations to be agreed to secure the maintenance and management of a site’s infrastructure.
Applicants can refer to good practice design guidance (for example, see Places we are proud 
of: A short guide to providing and managing site for Gypsies and Travellers (2021) and should demonstrate engagement with representatives of Newham’s local Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople communities.Implementation197

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESPlanning Obligations
•  Ac cess to services and facilities should be provided 
via a membership model, with access for residents 
living in affordable accommodation being of a comparable cost to using a Council facility. This will be secured through a development’s legal agreement.
 
Justification
3.160 Policy H11 ensures that housing developments are designed for long term comfort and flexibility, and ease of maintenance. The design of homes should improve residents’ physical and mental health and be designed with adaptability in mind. This may include increased space for homeworking and study, provision of private gardens or amenity spaces, creating well-lit and airy spaces and in larger developments providing areas for play and communal recreation. Homes should also be able to adapt to people’s changing needs as they age. In tandem with policies promoting the provision of affordable housing, securing high quality housing delivery is a key means to improve the health of our residents. The policy also sets an expectation, as per the London Plan (2021), that all new homes delivered will be wheelchair accessible, with 10 per cent of new homes being either adaptable or adapted to meet the needs of disabled residents. Provision of fully adapted social rent homes will help to meet the needs of people on the Council’s waiting list for wheelchair adapted accommodation.H11.1 The requirements of Policy H11 are intended to be read in conjunction with, and build upon, 
the requirements of London Plan (2021) policy and guidance. They apply to all new housing developments, including homes created from subdivision, conversion or new builds.
Alternative layouts should demonstrate that homes can adjust to residents’ changing lifestyles 
over time (for example an office that could be converted to a bedroom). Developments should maximise non-load bearing walls to allow for potential future reconfiguration. Drawings should illustrate alternative furniture layouts that maintain circulation and views out.
Similarly, the design of rooms should allow for different functions throughout the day through 
intelligent placement of windows, doors, internal lighting, power and providing sufficient room widths. Considered placement of fenestration, lighting, sockets and utilities can allow for both layout changes and ease of maintenance. For example, the provision of cable ducts can enable convenient access to a dwelling’s electrics. This can also allow for rooms to provide different functions (for example living rooms could be used as areas for studying, play or exercise throughout the day).
Window placement should allow for natural light and ventilation within habitable spaces. 
Kitchens in dual aspect homes should allow for natural light and for the potential separation from dining or living spaces. 
Shared circulation areas should be designed to allow sufficient space for use by wheelchair users 
and people with reduced mobility.
H11.2 Part 2 of the policy sets the expectation that developments for general needs housing should 
meet the internal space standards of the London Plan (2021) and provide adequate external private open space. This includes the requirement to provide built-in storage within a dwelling for the storage of household items. Developments should provide good quality outdoor private external amenity space that is proportioned to be easily used and adapted to the functions that a garden should have, such as dining and drying laundry.Implementation203
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESBedrooms on the ground floor should be located to the rear of a 
dwelling, with other habitable spaces to the front of the dwelling to allow for sight of the public realm. This layout should also afford privacy for bedrooms. Bedrooms on the ground floor should consider providing ensuite facilities to allow for use by people with reduced mobility. Private outdoor amenity spaces accessed from bedrooms in family-dwellings should be minimised to protect the safety of any young children living in the property. 
Typically, habitable rooms within conventional dwellings should be 
designed to allow for the potential use as a bedroom. Windows should be designed with an unobstructed openable area of at least 0.33m
2 and a minimum of 450mm high and wide, to allow for means 
of escape in an emergency.
In seeking to avoid the providing single-aspect, north-facing units, 
typologies such as gallery access units, maisonettes or larger through-units should be considered along north-facing facades.
Above the seventh storey, private amenity spaces should be semi 
recessed to offer year-round use and the benefits of amenity space including natural surveillance, natural light, shelter and privacy.
H11.3
When designing supported and specialist accommodation, applicants should consult with relevant London Borough of Newham commissioning teams about the quality of proposed accommodation provision. The Council’s Housing Support Approved Accommodation Standards can be found on the Council’s website.
Setting the Standard is a centralised inspection service that grades 
temporary accommodation based on health and safety requirements. Further information can be found about the inspection criteria and design requirements on the Commissioning Alliance’s website: Setting the Standard (StS) - Commissioning Alliance.Providing dementia-friendly design should build upon best practice set out in guidance.
14 Legible signage, tactile paving and hearing loops can aid 
residents’ navigation through care homes. 
Alongside the standards set out within part three of the policy, applicants 
providing specialist and supported accommodation are also encouraged to review good practice design guidance related to the accommodation type they are providing. For example, the Kingwood Trust, the Helen Hamlyn Centre and BEING have produced good practice design guidance on housing for adults with autism.
15  Applicants should refer to any good 
practice design guidance that has informed design within their supporting planning documents. The design of homes should also help facilitate effective management of the accommodation, for example providing a room where carers can sleep outside of dedicated offices.
For the purposes of H11.3.e.iv internal communal spaces should be used to 
accommodate kitchen facilities, dining space, internal communal spaces and living areas. In addition to the required 5m
2 of internal communal 
space per resident, applicants should provide laundry facilities, space for the concierge service, external communal space (in line with part 4 below), circulation space and cycle storage. Applicants can also opt to provide additional facilities such as recreation or entertainment spaces, workspace and additional toilet facilities. Developments should include at least one refuse space, dishwasher and fridge per 20 residents. The requirement for 1m
2 built in storage under H11.3.e.iii should be provided in addition to the 
requirements for a minimum of 5m2 internal communal space required 
per resident.
H11.4 While the policy sets the expectation that major residential developments will deliver communal external amenity space, it is recognised that some smaller major developments may not be able to provide both private and communal spaces dependent on the scale of a site. Accordingly, applicants should justify any deviations from this policy requirement within an application’s supporting documentation. It is not

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESnecessary to provide external communal amenity space dedicated to 
each building when there is more than one block in a development. However, such spaces should have convenient access for residents, typically within 100 metres. 
External communal space should be provided as one or two 
aggregated spaces rather than small outdoor spaces in different locations. Communal external amenity should be landscaped, accessible to residents with reduced mobility and should be well-overlooked. It is good practice to provide direct access to communal external amenity spaces from private terraces where possible. Above the seventh storey level, these spaces should be sheltered to allow for use throughout the year.
For the purposes of H11.4.d, major roads are key arterial routes and 
local and destination routes set out within the borough’s Sustainable Transport Strategy. 
H11.5 This space should be easily accessible to all residents of the development and be designed for flexibility to foster a range of social activities, including space for co-working or small gatherings. Its operation should be programmed and managed as part of the wider place management. These spaces can be incorporated into a publicly accessible community centres where suitable, in line with the requirements of policies HS2, HS3, CF1 and CF2.  
It is not necessary to provide an internal communal amenity space 
dedicated to each building when there is more than one block in a development. However, such spaces should have convenient access for residents, typically within 100 metres.  
H11.6 The comparable cost of a Council facility should be determined by reviewing the nearest Newham-run facility or facilities to a development site. The requirements of H11.6.b should be secured through a development’s legal agreement.H11.7 Provision of wheelchair user dwellings (Part M4[3]) should be directed towards local need. It is expected that prior to the submission of major applications, or minor applications delivering M4[3](2)(b) homes, that engagement is undertaken with the Council’s Housing Occupational Therapist. They can provide further information on the size, tenure, and demand for wheelchair user adapted homes, and such information should help inform the mix and distribution of wheelchair adapted dwellings provided within a development. 
Applicants should clearly set out within plans and an application’s Design 
and Access Statement the location, size and tenure mix of M4[3] and M4[3](2)(b) units. Applicants should provide drawings of indicative furniture layouts and measurements (in m2) to ensure convenient use for residents who use a wheelchair. 
As well as private dwellings or rooms, the wider development should be 
designed for use by people who use wheelchairs or have reduced mobility. This includes the design of outdoor spaces, car and bicycle parking, communal facilities, communal door opening and internal circulation spaces e.g., hallways and lobbies. This should be clearly set out in planning application drawings.
H11.8 Like developments for conventional housing, it is expected that 10 per cent of rooms are delivered as wheelchair accessible accommodation. Applicants should provide drawings of indicative furniture layouts and measurements (in m2) to ensure convenient use for residents who use a wheelchair. 
As well as private dwellings or rooms, the wider development should be 
designed for use by people who use wheelchairs or have reduced mobility. This includes the design of outdoor spaces, car and bicycle parking, communal facilities, communal door openings and internal circulation spaces e.g., hallways and lobbies. This should be clearly set out in planning application drawings.205
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESH11.9 As the mix and distribution of wheelchair adapted dwellings 
provided within a development will have been informed 
through discussions with the borough’s Occupational Therapist, it is expected that any M4[3](2)(b) homes delivered through a development should be allocated to individuals on the borough’s waiting list for affordable wheelchair adapted dwellings. M4[3](2)(b) units should be clearly indicated within the application submission, with the design allowing for swift occupation of the units on the completion of a development.
H11.10 It is recognised that in some instances, for example areas of high flood risk, site constraints may preclude wheelchair adapted accommodation being delivered on the ground floor of a development. Accordingly, the policy allows for the delivery of a portfolio approach in limited circumstances to address this issue. The justification for such an approach should be set out within an application’s supporting documentation.
H11.11 Applicants should demonstrate how they have addressed 
the criteria of part 11 of the policy. Where developments are unable to meet all of the design requirements set out in this policy, the supporting documentation should set out clear and convincing justification and evidence that delivering these on site is unfeasible. Applicants should also demonstrate how the detrimental impacts of these design choices have been mitigated. For example, M4(3) units may be accessible from the ground floor where only one lift is provided, or unit mix may be based on feedback from the Council’s Occupational Therapist to address longstanding needs (in particular, the need to deliver larger fully adapted social rent homes with four or more bedrooms).

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESGREEN AND WATER SPACES
3.161 Newham’s green and water spaces are much 
loved and valued. The borough has an existing network of natural spaces; not just nature reserves, parks, and rivers but also playgrounds, playing pitches, allotments, gardens, hedges, green walls, green/brown roofs, cycle and footpaths, street trees, docks, lakes, and ponds. 
3.162 These are referred to as the borough’s green and 
water spaces, and are collectively described as open space’. Newham has some great parks, open spaces and a significant number of water spaces, including the historic Royal Docks. Newham also borders the three largest rivers in London, with the Thames to the south, the River Lea in the west and, to the east, the River Roding.
3.163 With a total of 923 hectares
16 of open space, 
which includes the borough’s 333 hectares of water 
spaces, Newham has a rate of provision for all open space of 2.57 hectares per 1,000 residents. This is a precious, but a scarce resource that provides multiple benefits. 
3.164 Green and water spaces give a home to wildlife, 
promote good soil structure and provide connections to help support biodiversity. Newham’s Climate Emergency Action Plan (2020) and the borough’s health and wellbeing strategy, Well Newham, 50 Steps to a Healthier Borough (2020) recognise the important role open spaces play in helping address the climate emergency. Green and water spaces can limit the risks to human health and the economy from extreme weather events and environmental threats through absorption of carbon dioxide and pollution, cooling the air and reducing the risk of flooding and pressure on sewage and water management systems. 
3.165 Open space also enhances the quality of our 
lives and makes Newham a more attractive and safer place. Easy and fair access to open space is important. Well-connected, designed and managed green and water spaces provide social and cultural benefits, with spaces for physical activity, play and community events all helping to improve mental and physical health. 
3.166 Children, young people and adults need safe 
spaces for play and recreation which allow for the freedom to explore. This could be a park, a playground, an imaginative footpath or another form recreation area. 
3.167 Newham’s open spaces offer opportunities 
for social interaction and, in a densely populated borough, give a valued link to the nature and a place of quiet retreat as well as a place of learning. There are also economic benefits, with beautiful green and water spaces encouraging people to spend time and money in a place and helping to generate and sustain green economy jobs. 
3.168 This chapter addresses the protection 
and enhancement of existing green and water spaces (quantity, quality, function, access, and connectivity), the creation of new biodiverse places, the development of green and waterside corridors to better link these spaces and the provision and protection of trees. It also seeks provision of publicly accessible play and informal recreation.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.169 Newham’s open spaces are highly treasured 
by those living in the borough, and parts of the borough appear to be very leafy and green, however the overall provision of publicly accessible space in Newham is low, with a rate of just 0.71 hectares per 1,000 residents, which is far below neighbouring boroughs. The borough currently experiences shortfalls in publicly accessible open space, areas for growing food and play space. 
3.170 Open space is also very unevenly distributed 
across the borough and residents can have very different experiences when trying to access open space where they live. Beckton, for example, is relatively well served with publicly accessible green space, with a rate of 2.23 hectares per 1,000 residents, significantly above the borough average (0.71 hectares per 1,000 residents). In contrast, Canning Town South has a rate of just 0.21, well below the borough average
17. 
3.171 Wards across the north-east of the borough (Forest Gate North, Manor Park and Little Ilford) across the east of the borough (parts of East Ham North, Wall End East Ham South and Beckton), the south of the borough (parts of Royal Docks and Custom House) and the centre of the borough (Plaistow South and Canning Town South) have poor levels of accessibility to all typologies of publicly accessible greenspace.3.172 Over the Plan period Newham’s population is projected to increase by just over 27 per cent. Assuming that open space provision remains the same (i.e. current provision is sustained and no new publicly accessible greenspace sites area added) publicly accessible greenspace in Newham will fall to 0.56 hectares per 1,000 residents in 2038. 
3.173 If Newham is to enjoy the same, or greater, 
level and quality of provision over the next 15 years, we need to deliver more publically accessible green space. Just to sustain provision at the 2022 standard we will need to create 70 hectares of additional publicly accessible greenspace.
3.174 Newham has 14 allotments and growing area 
spaces with a total area of 16.81 hectares. The National Allotment Society recommends the provision of 0.125 hectares per 1,000 resident. The borough currently provides 0.047 hectares per 1,000 resident. Both the current and projected rates of provision in 2038 are below the recommended standards. Spaces for food growing are important, not only do they deliver direct health and environmental benefits, but also enhance social connection and may deliver climate benefits through reduced food transportation and improved biodiversity. 
3.175 With a relatively low level of open space 
provision, when compared to other London boroughs, it is vital that we seek to deliver new and publicly accessible open spaces. We must also take every available opportunity to green the urban environment. Of equal importance over the Plan period will be the protection of the spaces we already have, making sure we take a sensitive approach to their improvement. How well a green space is designed and the opportunities for activities to take place in it can encourage more physical activity and benefit social connection and mental health. 
17 Please note, the Interim Green and Water Spaces Strategy (2022) uses Newham’s pre-2022 Ward boundaries. The Wards were revised in 2022 but demographic data is currently unavailable 
for the new boundaries. Calculations can be repeated to reflect current Ward boundaries once the demographic data becomes available.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
GWS1.1 The Local Plan seeks to protect all existing open space (including 
spaces not designated on the Policies Map), maintain the quality and distribution of spaces; as well as creating new space to meet the additional demand from new development. For the purpose of the Local Plan, open space means spaces in either public or private ownership, which can have unrestricted access, partially-restricted access or restricted access. This includes all open areas consisting of: major parks, local parks, playing fields (including playing pitches), allotments, community gardens and burial grounds, whether or not they are accessible to the public but does exclude private residential gardens. Over the Plan period we will: •  
 maint
ain 0.71 hectares per 1,000 resident of publicly accessible 
    open space  •  
 maint
ain 0.047 hectares per 1,000 resident of allotment and 
community garden space.
The Plan’s site allocations give further detail where new publicly accessible open space should be delivered.
Areas experiencing public open space and allotment deficiency are 
set out in the Interim Green and Water Spaces Strategy (2022). 
Opportunities for new green links should be maximised between 
green spaces by creating more legible and greener routes along streets and through development sites along the link, especially where Low Traffic Neighbourhoods are being implemented. Access points and public access to green space should be protected, enhanced, and created. Walking and cycle routes along or through green spaces should be improved and, where possible, expanded to provide improved wayfinding, safety, and better links to the existing transport network and other green spaces. Housing estates can also play a role in the creation of green links.
 Major development proposals should demonstrate in a Design and Access Statement how the scheme takes an integrated approach to green infrastructure. Applicants should provide to the Council and Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC compatible data on the existing and proposed landscaping elements.•

GWS1.2 It is important that everyone living in Newham has the opportunity to 
access open space within walking distance from their home. This is a key part of delivering successful 15-minute neighbourhoods. 
Public open space is defined as per the categories in Table 8.1 of the 
London Plan (2021) and include: •  
 Regiona
l Park (400 hectares)
•  
 Metr
opolitan Park (60 hectares)
•

t Park (20 hectares)
•

•  
 Sma
ll Open Spaces (under 2 hectares)
•  
 P

•  
 Line
ar Open Spaces212
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESAn application which increases the severity (less space per 1,000 
resident) or extends an area of deficiency, at any of the above scales, will not be permitted. It is important to realise that it is not acceptable to offset different scales of open space. For example, an application which will see an increase in Pocket Park deficiency, in a location where there is an excess of space at the District Park scale would not be permitted. These two spaces provide different experiences and meet different user needs.   
In the first instance replacement open space should be provided on 
site. If this is not possible, replacement space should be directed to its existing 15-minute neighbourhood. Only when this is not possible should space be provided in another part of Newham. If replacement space must be provided outside of the existing 15-minute neighbourhood it must be directed to an area experiencing open space deficiency. 
Many of Newham’s housing estates include areas of amenity green 
space with limited function. Maximising the range of benefits this green space provides has the potential to improve the function and overall resilience of the borough’s green infrastructure. Key interventions may include, but are not limited to:•  
 impr
oving habitat for wildlife to improve contact with nature 
transformation of underused areas of hard surface to create new communal green space
•  structural planting to provide a barrier to air and noise pollution •  planting trees and other vegetation to create cool, quiet spaces •  raingardens to store and release storm water •  run-off creating community food-growing areas
Changes to the existing greenspace on housing estates will need 
in-depth consultation with residents and should respect the role 
 of the existing landscape to provide privacy and amenity space for residents. 
It may be appropriate to allow a net loss of open space where it can 
be demonstrated that it will lead to the provision of facilities that will improve the way people can use and enjoy a green space. Suitable enhancements may include, but are not limited to: drinking fountains, cafes, public toilets, art, and interventions to improve nature inter-pretation or to enhance historical features, outdoor play, and fitness equipment. Importantly, any such additions should not have a nega-tive impact on wildlife and biodiversity.
GWS1.3 Applications for development referable to the Mayor of London, or 
where a specific green or water space need has been identified by the Council will be required to provide publicly accessible open space. 
We will always seek new publicly accessible local parks and open spaces 
(2 ha), where space allows. However, the creation of small green spaces (under 2ha), pocket parks (under 0.4 ha) and opportunities for urban greening throughout the borough is of equal importance. These spaces provide a patchwork of green steppingstones to complement our larger green spaces. Examples include, but are not limited to:  •  
 the de
velopment of new pocket parks to serve the needs of 
15-minute neighbourhoods where there is a lack of local open space and in locations where people do not have access to private gardens.
•  
 underutilis
ed spaces, such as surface level car parks and left-over 
land parcels should, wherever possible, be repurposed to provide open space and/or local food growing opportunities.
•  
 the cr
eation of new publicly accessible roof gardens where space at 
ground level is especially limited.213
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESGWS1.4 Applicants should refer to the priorities and open space needs set 
out in Newham’s Green and Water Spaces Strategy (emerging). The 
Strategy (emerging) should be consulted early in the development process, ideally before the pre-application stage, so that it can inform the design of the scheme. Applicants are expected to design green infrastructure into the scheme from the earliest possible stage. Green space is integral to the success of a development and should not be seen as an ‘add on’ at the end of the design process. 
New open space should normally be provided as green open space. 
New or improved hard landscaped public space, such as a public square, may be considered appropriate in certain areas. This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Where green public open space is not possible, development should maximise urban greening features such as planting and permeable paving.
Development must consider the following principles when improving 
existing or delivering new open space:
High quality and welcoming
•  be distinctive and welcoming – encouraging people to stay•  
 be designed and mana
ged to meet diverse and changing needs of 
Newham’s population
•  be designed for effective management and maintenance •

people, and adultsGWS1.4 •   pr ovide shade, shelter, and lighting suitable to the local environment
•  
 be c

Co-designed•  
 be c
o-designed with residents from the outset. Designs should be 
sensitive to any existing function of green spaces
•  
 c
o-design should include activities to target to population groups who 
are least often heard by the council, who use open spaces least, or who have specific needs. This may include children and young people, older people, disabled people, or other groups
•  
 me
aningful, inclusive, and diverse co-design can help ensure spaces 
achieve their intended outcomes, meet the needs of those who use them, and improve equity of access, with subsequent benefits to health inequalities
Connectivity •  
 deliv
er an improved network of green grid links in line with the 
emerging Green and Water Spaces Strategy to enhance access to key destination points (Town Centres, community facilities and publicly accessible open spaces) and to and along water spaces
•

off lead provides an opportunity which many dogs living in urban areas are unable to easily experience. Designing in specific areas to allow dogs to be off lead provides space to ensure dogs and have access to outdoor areas to support their wellbeing. 
The way that spaces and developments are managed has a critical impact on how they are used. Without appropriate management, even the best designed spaces will fail their users. Management Plans and agreed uses should be considered at the early stages of a project and should be informed by an understanding of the site and the awareness of any long-term capital funding required for the governance and maintenance of the proposal. Management should enable lasting flexibility of use and continued access to shared and communal spaces.215

217
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.176 Newham’s waterways provide habitats for 
wildlife, help mitigate the urban heat island as well as offering unique views of water which gives the borough its specific identity.
3.177 Newham’s waterways also provide significant 
and unique opportunities for leisure uses and activities both on and around the water. These different uses need to be balanced with the intrinsic natural value of the waterways. 
3.178 Our rivers and docks present some of the most 
exciting opportunities to increase access to nature and to deliver improvements to biodiversity. Better connections in the walking environment along the rivers Roding, Lea, Thames and the Royal Docks would be transformative for those living in Newham.  
3.179 Restoring, preserving and protecting our 
water environments can also increase connectivity between habitats and provide avenues for species to alter their distribution in response to climate change. With urban environments set to get hotter, rivers can also provide a vital cooling effect. 
3.180 It is therefore important to protect our 
valuable water spaces and seek to deliver improvements to public access, enhance biodiversity, to promote appropriate water-related and water-dependent recreation and to deliver high quality design to celebrate and recognise better the industrial heritage of our water spaces. GWS2.1 Development should be compliant with the Water Framework Directive and should seek to 
enhance the river or estuary habitat and hydromorphology, delivering Water Framework Directive actions and Thames River Basin Management Plan objectives. It is important to note that all in land waterbodies are protected under the Water Framework Directive not just main rivers. 
Development should, where possible, include open spaces and Sustainable Urban Drainage 
Systems and look to enhance the water environment and preserve buffer zones (see Policy CE8). Any planting schemes should include only species suited to the on-site conditions and be managed appropriately to achieve maximum benefit for biodiversity and river health. 
GWS2.2 Development in proximity to water space should work with the Council and our partners 
(including the Port of London Authority, the Canal and River Trust and the Environment Agency), landowners and the community.
Development in proximity to water space should not result in loss or covering of water space and 
demonstrate that it will not compromise the suitability of the water space for water-related uses. Overshadowing reduces the recreational and biodiversity value of water space. 
When assessing planning applications, consideration will be given to the water coverage and 
human experience of the openness of water space in terms of its visibility and visual connections across the water from the surrounding public realm. 
Development adjacent to water space should recognise and conserve its importance as a valuable 
social, environmental, and economic resource. Where heritage assets are present, design should pay special regard to their setting. 
Opportunities to improve public access to and along the borough’s water spaces, particularly 
where access is currently restricted, will be sought around the three docks (Royal Albert, Royal Victoria, and King George V), the River Lea, the River Roding, and the River Thames (e.g., the Thames Path and Capital Ring).Implementation218
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESThe edges of water space are an extremely important part of 
the functioning of water space as ecosystems, open space, and transport networks. There should be a minimum of an eight metre buffer zone for all freshwater courses. This is measured from the bank top and is needed to provide an effective and valuable river corridor and improved habitat connectivity. 
There should be no new or additional hardstanding or structures 
installed within the eight meter buffer zone. A 16 metre buffer should be in place for intertidal waters. Any development within 16 metres of the tidal Thames, Lea or Roding should follow the design principals of Estuary Edges to deliver ecological design for softening these ‘edges’ to encourage wildlife into urban estuaries. Around ponds a buffer of 5 meters should be in place to help preserve their value for wildlife. 
River re-naturalisation will be encouraged (see Policy CE7), design 
measures can include, but are not limited to: •  
 r
eplacing hard engineering alongside and within river channels 
with soft engineering options where feasible. 
•  
 r
econnecting rivers with their floodplains for flood risk 
reduction and resilience against climate change as well as habitat enhancement. 
•  
 de-cul
verting river channels where possible. Mitigation will be 
sought for any hard `engineering solutions applied to any river channels to compensate for any loss of habitat 
    (including buffer zones). 
GWS2.3 Water spaces provide significant habitats for wildlife, as well as a unique visual amenity which gives many parts of Newham a specific identity. There are also opportunities for leisure use and recreation activities both on and around the water. The balance of these uses will be managed by directing an appropriate intensity and type of activation to the right water space locations.GWS2.4 We will work in partnership with the Port of London Authority and the Canal and River Trust to determine the suitability of residential and visitor moorings.

Data recorded on the habitat(s) (type and size) and species present currently on site and data on the size and type of open space and ‘living building’ features proposed should be shared with the Council and Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC. 
3.  
 De
velopment in areas deficient in access to 
nature should seek to deliver new or improved green or water spaces which have intrinsic nature conservation value that would qualify as a Borough Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. Where this is not possible development should seek to deliver:
 
 a.
  habit

accessible to residents and wider public; and
 
 b.

4.  
 De

features of the site.
 
 b.
  Minimis

 The Epping F
orest Special Area of Conservation 
will be protected and enhanced by ensuring that development within 6.2km of the boundary of Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation demonstrates that, if necessary, measures are put in place to avoid or mitigate any potential adverse effects, through:
 
 a.
  de
velopments of new net additional 
residential homes contributing towards the delivery of the agreed Strategic Access Management and Monitoring Strategy; and
 
 b.
  de

residential homes contributing to the provision of Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace. 
Justification
3.181 As an urban borough, Newham’s network of natural spaces act as a green lung; protecting biodiversity by giving much needed space for wildlife (animals, birds, trees, plants, insects and fungi) and as well as reducing air pollution, helping water management and moderating urban temperatures. Having a biodiverse borough means having a rich mix of plants and animals; and this variety and complexity helps nature to thrive. 
3.182 As the number of homes increases over the 
plan period it will be of fundamental importance to match this growth by protecting and improving existing natural spaces (both green and water) and increasing the amount of habitat creation and through ecologically sensitive landscape design within the urban environment. 
3.183 The provision of urban greening through new 
developments and on existing streets will provide benefits to wildlife and people living in Newham. Whilst this may not provide space for recreation, such greening can improve people’s mental health and well-being, enhance the character of the townscape, and provide opportunities for food growing. 
3.184 Green corridors (connecting habitat for 
wildlife) can significantly improve the capacity of existing parks and nature conservation areas by extending their reach beyond their current boundaries. The provision of green corridors to provide access to existing parks and green spaces via safe and less polluted routes will also help people to access the existing network of open spaces.
3.185 Epping Forest, located outside of the borough, 
to the north of Manor Park, is the largest open space in London. The Forest is formed of ancient woodland and acid grasslands which cover an area of approximately 2,450 hectares. Two thirds of Epping Forest has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a special Area of Conservation. Epping Forest is a popular visitor destination, including for Newham residents. The rise in visitor numbers to Epping Forest from the surrounding area has led to a need to better balance the ecological needs of the Forest. Newham has been working with City of London and neighbouring authorities in London and Essex to develop a joint governance and delivery approach to the Strategic Access Management and Monitoring Strategy.

Systems which mimic natural processes in managing rainfall through the use of landscape form and vegetation.
The ecological value of existing sites of importance for nature conservation is maximised when they are connected by areas of complementary or supporting habitats in the form of green corridors or ‘steppingstones’. This is habitat that allows some species to move through the urban environment. This supporting habitat also provides wildlife a wider range of opportunities for meeting their foraging or breeding requirements.222
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESGreen corridors can be created and improved by:
•  
 cr
eating pockets of wildlife habitat between existing Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation 
•  
 incr
easing the species and structural diversity of vegetation in parks, 
amenity green spaces and the public realm to enable a wide variety of species to move between parts of the Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation network.
GWS3.2 Applicants should carry out ecological surveys and assessments for major developments, development in close proximity to a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, or for any proposed development which is likely to have an impact on a protected or priority species or habitat, as listed in Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act. 
Ecological assessments must be developed from the earliest stages of 
the pre-application process and should demonstrate as a minimum how the resource will be retained, enhanced and if necessary restored. The ecology assessment should include:a.  
 inf
ormation assessing the characteristics and situation of the site; and
b. 
  det
ails on how the proposals will protect, replace and enhance 
existing biodiversity on the proposed site, including measures for wildlife habitats and features aimed at particular species.
The ecological assessment should provide to the Council and Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC compatible data on the following: •  
 spa
ce type and the size of each provision (based on Greenspace 
Information for Greater London CIC typologies)
•  
 det
ails of any access restrictions (unrestricted, limited and restricted) 
including overnight closures
•

•  
 sit
e owner and managerInformation on data standards can be found on the Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC website: https://www.gigl.org.uk/recording-surveying/links-and-resources/survey-data-standards-and-guidance/
Ecological surveys must identify potential development impacts 
likely to harm the ecology of the site and recommend mitigation and enhancement measures. Where a survey is required, this must occur early in the design process of a proposal and be undertaken by an appropriately qualified ecologist.
The requirement for ecological surveys and assessments to be 
submitted in this policy also applies to refurbishment works which may impact species using the existing building, such as swifts or bats. The scale and detail of the survey will be dependent on the likely impact on biodiversity.
GWS3.3 In many parts of Newham residents do not have adequate access 
to the natural environment as they live more than more than one kilometre from an accessible Borough Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. 
When bringing forward development in these areas of deficiency 
applicants should consider whether through on-site habitat creation and/or ecological improvement of an existing green space areas of natural greenspace can be established which would meet Borough Site of Importance for Nature Conservation criteria. 
Where this is not possible development should include green links and 
routes through to allow residents to access the wider network of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation and greenspaces.223
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESOn-site interpretation boards, to show how habitats contribute to and 
support the wider biodiversity aspirations of the borough, and visible onsite features such as bird boxes, wildflower planting can help engage local communities positively in new developments. It can ensure best use of green and water spaces; and it can help to foster a sense of local pride by helping people to visualise the meaning and significance of new habitats within developments.
GWS3.4 Urban greening should be a fundamental element of site and building 
design and delivered on site, as part of a proposed development. 
The Urban Greening Factor is a method for expressing the quality, 
function and quantity of urban greening proposed as part of an application. By setting a minimum target, it aims to ensure that urban greening is a fundamental element of site and building design. 
GWS3.5 Biodiversity net gain is an approach to development that leaves 
biodiversity in a better state than before. Development proposals must aim to secure a net gain in biodiversity value, with a clear priority for on-site measures.  Development should use the latest DEFRA metric to quantify the baseline and post-development biodiversity value of the development site and off-site areas proposed for habitat creation.  The assessment should be undertaken by a suitably qualified and/or experienced egologist and should be submitted together with baseline and proposed habitat mapping in a digital format with the application. 
A 30 year Management Plan should be submitted detailing how the 
post-development biodiversity values of the site and any supporting off-site mitigation will be achieved. Any off-site habitats created should be provided in the borough and be located to maximise opportunities for local nature recovery and to improve access to nature.  Under the Environment Act 2021, all planning permissions granted in England (with a few exemptions) will have to deliver at least 10 per cent biodiversity net gain from an as yet unconfirmed date, expected to be in November 2023.GWS3.6 The presence of a protected species or habitat is a material planning consideration where a development is likely to result in harm. Species of Conservation Concern in London and Species of Principal Importance in England, as identified under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act.
GWS3.7 Under the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 2017 (as 
amended) the Newham Council is a “competent authority” working with other competent authorities to decide whether or not a plan or project can proceed having undertaken the following “appropriate assessment requirements” to: •  
 det
ermine whether a plan or project may have a significant effect on 
a European site; 
•  
 if r
equired, undertake an appropriate assessment of the plan or 
project; 
•  
 decide whether ther
e may be an adverse effect on the integrity of 
the European site in light of the appropriate assessment. 
Newham therefore has duties to ensure that planning decisions do not result in adverse effects upon the Special Area of Conservation. The Habitats Regulations Assessment element of the emerging Integrated Impact Assessment will consider what level and location of new residential development above the level of existing will have a significant effect on the ecological integrity of the Epping Forest Special Areas of Conservation alone and in combination with other plans. 
The need for Mitigation Strategies adopted by the Council to offset 
the effects of recreational pressure on Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation have been identified. These strategies will be reviewed and updated as required over the plan period. Presently the Council is working with partners to develop a package of mitigation measures which currently fall into two categories:•

 Justification
3.186 Trees and woodland cover 15 per cent of the borough, this figure is made up of all trees in Newham, which includes on both private and Council land. The Council’s tree stock is made up of 19,697 street trees, 5,548 trees within housing areas and 9,942 trees within parks. 
3.187 Trees and woodlands play an important role in 
Newham. Street trees have long been a feature of urban environments and can help to form green links between the network of parks and green spaces. They add to local amenity, a valued connection to nature for people and a habitat for wildlife. The planting of additional trees (especially large canopy trees) will assist in providing shade in hot weather and help to mitigate the impact of climate change. Trees also absorb rainwater and filter noise.
3.188 The Mayor of London wants to increase tree 
canopy cover in London by 10 per cent by 2050. Given the many and varied benefits trees provide it is important we ensure future development protects the trees we have and wherever possible we take the opportunity to plant more trees. These steps will help to achieve an increase in Newham’s canopy cover and contribute to the extent of London’s urban forest (the area of London under the canopy of trees). 226
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
GWS4.1 We will seek to deliver 20 per cent tree canopy cover over the plan 
period. To achieve this we will need to ensure that there is a net gain of trees on all Site Allocations, along with undertaking planting projects on Council owned land and where possible private land such as education sites.
Applicants should undertake an i-Tree study, to be submitted with the 
planning application. This is required to understand the existing and ultimate canopy cover. This should then be repeated at the end of the development condition period to show the gains made with the infrastructure planting.
Applicants should undertake a CAVAT study, to be submitted with the 
planning application. This is required to understand the financial value of the tree(s).
GWS4.2 The development potential of a site should be optimised in a way which does not result in tree loss and loss should only occur when there are no feasible engineering solutions or arboricultural techniques to mitigate any issues (such as root or canopy pruning). 
Any application to fell a tree(s) will need to be applied in conjunction 
with suitable evidence to document the reason why the removal of the tree(s) is considered necessary. This should be presented in an arboricultural report which includes:
•  Images to demonstrate the issue(s)
•  Decay detection report (where relevant)•  Site plan indicating clearly the tree(s) proposed for removal In instances where trees are removed there will need to be mitigation for the loss of the tree, with a suitable replacement planting, this will be calculated as follows: •  
 Major de
velopment which proposes to remove a tree(s) must submit to 
the Council a CAVAT assessment to establish current value of the trees on site. This figure will be used to inform the proportionate mitigation measures required. 
•  
 T
ree Preservation Order Applications: a tree to be planted in place of 
each tree that is felled, ideally this should be on site. 
GWS4.3 Careful consideration should be given to the size, species, and location of trees. To ensure best practice is observed all tree planting should follow BS 8545 (or the latest standard if updated over the course of the Plan period). BS 8545 gives recommendations for transplanting young trees, with a view to achieving their eventual independence in any landscape scheme. 
Care should be taken when choosing tree and hedge species to ensure 
the species chosen best meets the demands of the space (Right tree, right place, right reason). When specifying, the Tree Design Action Group publication ‘Tree Species Selection for Green Infrastructure: A Guide for Specifiers’ should be consulted. Where possible, large canopy trees will be encouraged as they provide a wide range on benefits for biodiversity and urban cooling. 
Applications should consider how trees and hedges can be used to 
improve local air quality (see Policy CE6). 227

ainable urban drainageGWS4.3 Due to the increasing risks posed to the flora and fauna in the UK planting should be sustainably sourced and where possible grown in the UK. This will reduce carbon emissions from importing plants whilst also reducing the risk of importing pests and diseases into the country such as Xylella fastidiosa, Asian longhorn beetle, and Emerald ash borer. Consideration needs to be given to species diversity when planting to ensure that should plants be affected by a pest or disease there will be variation within the species mitigating to spread and damage caused.
Where possible, utilities should be located within ducts or in a designated area 
away from planting. This will avoid damage to tree roots if repairs to utilities are required. In addition it will assist in preventing root damage to the utilities.
Growing space should be considered early on in the design of a scheme to 
ensure that adequate space is provided to reduce compaction. If possible, cell structure should be used in addition to permeable surfaces. 
Integration of trees early on in landscape plans will achieve the most benefits 
and it is vital they are given the space to grow above and below the ground. 
In instances where trees and hedgerows are being planted a five year 
maintenance condition will be sought. This is to ensure that all green infrastructure is established and thriving at the end of the condition period.

18 Bornat, D. Between Edges and Hedges. Essay: Designing for Play, 2018aJustification
3.189 London is a youthful city, with Newham the youngest of all the boroughs. Having access to stimulating and safe spaces for play and informal recreation is of huge value to the children and young people living in Newham. 
3.190 Despite our youthful population, Newham 
currently has a low level of play and informal recreation space. The borough has 84 publicly accessible playgrounds, with a total area of nine hectares. The Fields in Trust recommends a standard of 0.25 hectares per 1,000 residents for playgrounds. Newham currently falls short of this, with just 0.025 hectares per 1,000 resident, this represents a shortfall of 80 hectares.  
3.191 As Newham’s population increases to 456,462 
over the Plan period, play space provision will fall to 0.019 hectares per 1,000 resident. To achieve the standard in 2038 will require the creation 105 hectares of new play space. 
3.192 It is therefore vital we maximise any opportunity 
to provide new publicly accessible play space. These spaces must not only be exclusively for those living in new developments but must provide much needed play space to our existing neighbourhoods.   
3.193 Well-designed, environmentally friendly, and 
visually pleasing playground equipment should be an 
available resource for everyone’s benefit at all ages and stages of life. 3.194 Providing places in the borough for children and 
young people, which are not their home or school environment, gives the opportunity for younger people to meet in a space in which they can be independent, feel comfortable, make important social connections, and feel connected to the neighbourhood in which they live. For children and young people, the right to play, to gather and to participate in decisions that influence them, are enshrined in the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
3.195 Children have a right to be present and visible 
in public, shared and communal spaces, and their 
movement and play should always be regarded as a legitimate activity. Spaces which encourage independent and self-directed play have many benefits. Physical activity through play is closely linked to improving children’s physical and mental health.
18 
3.196 Play and informal recreation spaces can and 
should also be designed to encourage activity and provide a space for social interaction for adults – they have the right to play too.  Playground equipment and informal recreation spaces offer physical, intellectual, emotional and behaviour benefits which transcend age. 
3.197 Older adults (over 65), children under 12 and those 
with certain pre-existing health conditions (e.g. asthma, 
COPD) are most vulnerable to air pollution. Extra care should be taken to separate people and pollution in places, such as play and informal recreation facilities, where these vulnerable groups gather and wait. 229
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
GWS5.1 Applicants should refer to the mapping and audits of play and informal 
recreation facilities in the Interim Green and Water Spaces Strategy (2022) to understand if the proposal falls in an area of deficit. The study has categorised play provision using the Fields in Trust standards which are as follows: •  
 L
AP (Local Area for Play): A small area of open space specifically 
designated and primarily laid out for very young children to play close to where they live i.e. within one minute’s walking time. LAPs are designed to allow for ease of informal observation and supervision and primarily function to encourage informal play and social interaction for toddlers. The LAP requires no play equipment as such, relying more on demonstrative features indicating that play is positively encouraged.
•  
 LE
AP (Locally Equipped Area for Play): An area of open space specifically 
designed and laid out with features including equipment for children who are beginning to play independently. The number and nature of equipment and structures is a matter for local decision, though provision for a minimum number of six play experiences is recommended. Play features including equipment are an integral part of the LEAP and the attractiveness of such spaces, though it is also important that the space can be used for physical activity and games. LEAPs can also include landscaped areas of play; containing little formal equipment but imaginatively designed and contoured, using as far as is possible natural materials such as logs or boulders which create an attractive setting 
for play. 
•  
 NE
AP (Neighbourhood Equipped Area of Play): This is an area of open 
space specifically designated, laid out and equipped mainly for older children but potentially with play opportunities for younger children as well. It can provide play equipment and a hard surface area for ball games or wheeled activities such as roller skating or cycling. It may provide other facilities such as a ramp for skateboarding, a rebound wall, and a shelter for meeting and socialising. NEAPs can often be combined with LEAP provision.
 GWS5.2 Play and informal recreation facilities are an important element of a 
successful 15-minute neighbourhood. It is important such spaces are accessible, be inclusive, accessible and safe. To determine this, when assessing schemes the following questions will be considered:
19 
•   Can a chil d  /  y oung person walk or cycle to and from the provision 
alone? 
•  
 Wil
l children and young people feel welcome and able to play in 
public and communal spaces? 
•  
 Wha
t proportion of outside space is car-free, well overlooked and 
directly accessible from residential developments? 
•  
 Do chil
dren and young people have a high level of input into 
decision making regarding the built environment?
•  
 Does the envir
onment create conditions for children and young 
people to be outside after dark?
Co-production should be meaningful – weight and status should be given to feelings, opinions and experiences of children and young people, which should enable them to have an impact on policy, design, and development. Engagement should use creative methods to ensure children and young people are stimulated, including online and digital. Participation needs to be understood as a long-term process; ensuring post-intervention feedback and analysis means co-creation is not limited to the design of a space, but also its management and iterative changes. The testing of ideas through meanwhile use programmes for spaces to gather early-stage feedback from residents and young people should be considered.
Play and informal recreation facilities should be designed to allow 
for creative and challenging activities that help all of us, irrespective of age, to stay in shape mentally and physically. Play space should meet the needs and expectations of the people living or due to be living in the neighbourhood.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESGWS5.2 New play and informal recreation facilities 
should not be located close to pollution 
sources, such as beside roads or in areas where vehicles idle. Air quality should be considered at the earliest stages of planning and design, before the position of infrastructure and buildings is decided. A site-specific air quality appraisal should for part of any application which includes play or informal recreation facilities. Understanding the air quality constraints of a site as early as possible can benefit the design of a development. Consultation with Newham’s Environmental Health Officers is essential.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCLIMATE EMERGENCY
3.198 Ensuring that development can occur in 
Newham without adversely affecting, and indeed while improving, the health of residents in the borough, the local environment, and the climate itself, is a crucial element of planning. This includes considering how to improve the borough’s environment and air quality, reduce emissions which contribute to the climate emergency, mitigate impacts of climate change, and minimise and avoid the risks of all sources of flooding.
3.199 Historically, Newham’s environment has been 
polluted by heavy industry, leading to contaminated land and groundwater across the borough. Over the past 40 years, development has meant that many sites have been remediated or capped. However, the legacy of historical industrial use remains in many parts of the borough, notably in the Lower Lea Valley, Beckton Riverside and the Royal Docks. These industrial uses, as well as major roads passing through the borough, has led to a poor quality environment in many parts of the borough.
3.200 One in seven of Newham’s population are 
exposed to levels of Nitrogen dioxide (NOx) that is above the UK limit value for human health. On average, Newham residents are also exposed to a level of airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) that is 35 per cent greater than the World Health Organisation guidelines. Poor air quality in the borough kills 96 residents every year. Policies to improve air quality in the borough - in conjunction with transport policies - are key in improving the quality of life and the health of residents.3.201 There is overwhelming scientific consensus that significant climate change is happening. The UK, London and Newham are increasingly affected by extreme weather events such as flash flooding and heatwaves, demonstrating the reality of human driven climate change. These policies consider how these extreme weather events should be mitigated, including minimising and avoiding the risks of all flooding, as well as how overheating in new homes can be mitigated. 
3.202 The Climate Change Act 2008 legislates that 
the UK carbon account for 2050 must be 100 per cent lower than 1990 levels – i.e. the UK must be Net Zero Carbon by 2050. In 2019, Newham Council declared a Climate Emergency, setting a wide range of measures to tackle climate change and commits us to be net zero for council operations by 2030 and net zero in Newham by 2045. Planning policy, through ensuring that new buildings are designed and built to net zero targets and encouraging and enabling retrofitting of existing buildings, has a key role in delivering these measures to meet our targets.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES  
   CE1: Environmental design 
and delivery
1.   Al l development must consider the climate 
emergency throughout its design, construction, 
operation, and lifecycle, including the likelihood of consequential extreme weather events, increased water scarcity and warmer temperatures.
2.  
 De
velopment should be resource-efficient, 
minimising consumption, and waste throughout the lifecycle of a building. 
3.  
 De
velopment should remediate
 c
ontaminated land.
4.  
 De
velopment should help to improve environment 
degradation in the borough (such as poor water quality and habitat loss).
5.  
 Al
l development will incorporate water efficiency 
measures to achieve a consumption target of 105 litres or less per head per day for residential or ‘excellent’ Wat 01 rating for non-residential development. Justification
3.203 This policy is key in light of Newham’s declaration of a Climate Emergency, as well as future extreme weather events that will affect Newham. In future, it is anticipated that London will experience hotter summers, milder winters, increased periods without rain, increased intensity in rainfall and more extreme weather events. Newham is especially vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as flash flooding and heatwaves due to our geography – including the urban heat island, a lack of green spaces compared to other London boroughs, and its location surrounded by three rivers. When designing schemes, developments must consider these extreme weather events in line with design and other policies in this chapter.
3.204 Over the last century, heavy industry in 
the form of gasworks, chemical works, tanneries, dye works, paint works, distilleries, railways, and docks, combined with domestic refuse tipping, has left Newham with a legacy of land and water pollution. Most of this affected land, and associated groundwater, is located adjacent to the Lower Lea Valley and south of the A13 in the Royal Docks and Beckton. 
3.205 Over the last 40 years, as development has 
occurred across Newham, many sites have been remediated or capped. However, the legacy of historical industrial use remains in many parts of the borough, notably in the Lower Lea Valley, Beckton Riverside and the Royal Docks. This includes contaminated land and the remnants of industrial use such as gasholders. Without land remediation and amelioration of environmental degradation prior to development, a site may not be viable or may even be harmful to future residents or occupiers.
3.206  Water efficiency across London has improved 
over the last decade, however the London Plan target of 105 litres or less per head per day is not being achieved. This policy therefore seeks to ensure that new development will meet this target, with installation of water efficiency devices. In addition opportunities exist for new developments to be considered fully water neutral by contributing funds to retrofit existing homes and businesses to save water.
CE1.1 Development should demonstrate consideration of the climate emergency in the throughout its design, construction, operation, and lifecycle of the scheme, including in a Design and Access Statement, Flood Risk Assessment and Overheating Assessment. It is expected that all measures to improve resilience should be passive and not rely on energy intensive solutions, such as air conditioning.Implementation234
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCE1.1 Development should demonstrate consideration of the climate 
emergency in the throughout its design, construction, operation, and 
lifecycle of the scheme, including in a Design and Access Statement, Flood Risk Assessment and Overheating Assessment. It is expected that all measures to improve resilience should be passive and not rely on energy intensive solutions, such as air conditioning. 
Examples of ways that developments can respond to the climate 
emergency include consideration of overheating in design, through orientation, use of materials, overhangs and planting (expanded on in Policy CE4: Overheating), using drought resistant planting and designing a building and its surrounding landscape and townscape for flooding (expanded on in policies CE7: Managing Flood Risk and CE8: Sustainable Drainage).
CE1.2 Development should demonstrate consideration of resource 
efficiency throughout the life of a building, including in the construction, operation and use of a building. 
Examples of ways that developments can consider resource 
efficiency throughout the life of a building include design and choice of materials (expanded on in policies CE3, CE5 and D1), construction (expanded on in policy CE3), operation and use (expanded on in policy CE2) and waste and recycling (expanded on in policy W3).
CE1.3 Given Newham’s complex industrial past, developments are strongly 
recommended to engage with the Council’s Environmental Health team at the earliest possible opportunity, to gain an understanding of any potential land contamination or environmental degradation on site.
Where land contamination or environmental degradation is known 
or suspected, proposals should include adequate investigation of the contamination/degradation. Remedial works should be agreed with the Council prior to the start of development.
A desk study and site investigation verification report will be required 
through condition in order to provide confirmation that the remediation work has been undertaken properly in line with best practice. These include (but are not limited to):

CE1.4 Development should help to improve environmental degradation in 
the borough. 
Examples of how this could be achieved include new green space or 
expanding/improving existing green spaces (expanded in policies GWS1 and GWS3), improving biodiversity and urban greening (expanded on in Policy GWS3), consideration of design (expanded on in Policy D7), improving air quality (expanded on in Policy CE6), and working to improve water quality in rivers and docks (expanded on in Policy GWS2).
CE1.5
Development should demonstrate that water efficiency targets can be met, using the Part G Water Efficiency Calculator.
Ways to achieve these water efficiency targets include the installation of 
water efficient fittings, installation of modern appliances (that will also use ultra-low amounts of energy in operation), as well as capturing and reusing water on site. 235
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESMajor developments, and developments 
that have a high water usage (such as hotels, hostels or student accommodation) should include a grey water and rainwater harvesting system. Where such a system is not feasible, it should be demonstrated why this is the case.
Thames Water offers financial incentives 
to developers that achieve evidenced water efficiency targets (including the 110 litres/person/day), with the aim of achieving water neutrality (where the total demand for water is the same after the new development was built, as it was before) for new developments. Developers should engage with Thames Water  at the earliest opportunity 
regarding water and wastewater, as per the utilities policies.

Justification
3.207 In order to meet national, regional, and local climate commitments, we need to be delivering net zero buildings today. We should not be permitting homes that will need to be retrofitted in future. This is in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee, the London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).
3.208 Operational carbon emissions associated with 
new buildings that meet current planning policy requirements are still very significant. Newham also has the highest rate of fuel poverty in England, with nearly a fifth of households affected. 
3.209 This policy therefore ensures that all new 
buildings should be designed and built to be Net Zero Carbon in operation. The benefits of net zero buildings are substantial and wide ranging – whether global and national impacts from the reduced use of fossil fuels, regional and local impacts from improved local air quality and individual impacts for residents such as lower energy bills and an improved living environment. It will also allow the Council to meet its Climate Emergency and Air Quality commitments.
3.210 The Climate Change Committee recommends 
a space heating demand of less than 15-20 kWh/m
2/yr for new homes. This recommendation is also 
in line with the recommendations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the Low Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) and the UK Green Building Council. As a dwelling with a low space heating demand loses heat very slowly, it will make it easier for the wider energy system to deliver energy in a flexible way, helping to maximise the contribution from renewable energy and reduce energy costs for residents.
3.211 New buildings cannot continue to burn fossil 
fuels for heating if the London Borough of Newham is to stay within carbon budgets. Low carbon heat is therefore an essential component of a Net Zero Carbon building. Electricity can be provided through on-site renewables and through grid electricity, which is becoming increasingly de-carbonised. To achieve electrification of heat, several viable technologies are already available, including heat pumps (including air, ground and water source) and direct electric radiators.
3.212 For new buildings to be compliant with our 
climate change targets, they need to reduce the amount of energy they use over a year. A building  that uses ultra-low amounts of energy will directly reduce energy costs for residents and building occupiers. Energy use can also be measured post-construction, therefore helping to drive down the performance gap which is a significant issue in the construction industry.
3.213 New buildings should contribute to the 
significant increase in renewable energy generation required between now and 2050. The most robust way to deliver the overall objective of a balance between total energy use and renewable energy generation is for new developments to seek to achieve this balance at the site level. This also has the advantage of generating ‘free’ electricity close to its point of use, helping to deliver significant energy cost savings for residents and building occupiers. 
3.214 The Climate Change Evidence Base indicates 
that solar PVs are one of the most effective means of generating onsite renewable energy. We acknowledge there are alternative uses for roofspaces in a dense urban environment, but we are prioritising this use due to the importance of reaching net zero and the ability to deliver better useable greenspace at ground level for use by residents and the public. It is noted that roof space can have multi-functional benefits, with solar PVs installed in combination with smaller elements of green or brown roofs, as well as wildlife habitats (insect hotel, bird boxes etc).
3.215 As outlined by the Climate Change Committee, 
offsetting must have a very limited and defined role if we are to achieve Net Zero by 2050. The Climate Change Evidence Base details that mid to high rise residential blocks compliant with the recommended 238
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESNet Zero Carbon policies may be unable to fully 
generate sufficient on-site renewable energy to meet operational annual net zero. Therefore, this policy therefore proposes that the development should pay into the Council’s offset fund a sum of money equivalent to funding a PV renewable energy system elsewhere in the borough able to generate the shortfall amount of energy.  The Climate Change Evidence Base outlines that this is technically and financially feasible.
3.216 In order for the Net Zero Carbon buildings 
policy to be effective, it is important that new buildings deliver their intended performance. Unfortunately, the actual energy performance of buildings often fails to meet the design standard. This difference is commonly referred to as ‘the Performance Gap.’ The Zero Carbon Hub concluded in their Evidence Review Report in 2014 that a compliance process focused on design, rather than as built, performance is a key contributor to the performance gap. Excellent design and detailing need to be matched by high quality construction and commissioning for the ‘performance gap’ between the design and actual in-use energy to be reduced. 
3.217 This policy therefore proposes use of an energy 
performance construction quality assurance scheme to demonstrate compliance with the CE2 policies, as well as driving down this ‘performance gap’. The policy does not prescribe use of a particular scheme, noting that there are several well regarded and accredited schemes (such as Passivhaus, AECB or BEPIT) currently being used in the UK. The requirements to monitor and report operational energy in use is already incorporated in the London Plan “Be Seen” policy. It requires major development to report on energy performance for at least five years following completion, with online guidance and a data reporting spreadsheet available.
CE2.1 Net zero buildings use ultra-low amounts of energy, use low carbon heat, and contribute to the generation of renewable energy on-site. They will also have been constructed with low levels of embodied carbon.
Development must demonstrate they 
deliver all the policy requirements of CE2 through the provision of a detailed Energy Statement and through the use of an energy performance construction quality assurance scheme as detailed in CE2.6.
CE2.2 The space heating demand is the 
amount of heat energy needed to heat a home over a year and is expressed in kWh/m
2/yr. It is a measure of the 
thermal efficiency of the building elements.ImplementationVarious design and specification decisions affect space heating demand including building form and orientation, insulation, air-tightness, windows and doors and the type of ventilation system. 
Part L energy assessment methodologies 
(e.g. Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for domestic buildings and National Calculation Methodology (NCM) for non-domestic buildings) are currently used to evidence the energy and carbon efforts for all planning applications and demonstrate their compliance with current policy requirements. However, it is important to note that these were developed only to check compliance with Building Regulations, not whether buildings comply with Net Zero Carbon buildings policies, and or the prediction of future energy use. Instead, this policy recommends use of Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) for new build residential schemes, as it has been shown to predict energy use much more accurately than SAP. Comparative SAP/PHPP modelling undertaken on different typologies suggest that SAP underestimates space heating demand by more than 50 per cent.239
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESFor new non-residential schemes, this policy encourages the use 
of CIBSE Technical Memorandum 54 (TM54) predictive energy modelling. IESVE, TAS  and PHPP are three energy modelling packages 
that can be used to carry out TM54 assessments. Predictive energy modelling using CIBSE Technical Memorandum 54 (TM54) allows to estimate the operational energy for all end uses of a building (regulated and unregulated) much more accurately. With TM54, more realistic operational scenarios such as the length of hours the building is used can be taken into account.
CE2.3 Development should demonstrate they will not use operational fossil fuels in an energy statement and in the design of a scheme.
Heat pumps (including air, ground and water source) are currently the 
most viable technology to achieve widespread electrification of heat at scale while limiting overall demand on the electricity network. The Climate Change Evidence Base also considered ‘direct electric’ heating as well as heat networks with a heat pump. Other options, such as hybrid approach of using direct electric radiators with domestic hot water from a heat pump system are also possible.
At the present time, technology such as green hydrogen (i.e. 
hydrogen produced without using fossil fuels) is unavailable or not commercially viable. We also cannot foresee what technology will emerge as we move away from gas. Given this context, future heating technologies will be supported if demonstrated that they are low carbon and sustainable – i.e. ‘brown’ or ‘grey’ hydrogen made from fossil fuels would not be supported.
CE2.4 Energy Use Intensity (EUI), or metered energy use, is the total energy 
needed to run a home over a year (per square metre). It is a measure of the total energy consumption of the building (kWh/m
2/yr). The 
EUI of a building covers all energy uses: space heating, domestic hot water, ventilation, lighting, cooking, and appliances.Where a non-domestic development does not have an applicable category of use outlined in the policy, the development should discuss with the Council what the EUI target should be.
Part L energy assessment methodologies (e.g. Standard Assessment 
Procedure (SAP) for domestic buildings and National Calculation Methodology (NCM) for non-domestic buildings) are currently used to evidence the energy and carbon efforts for all planning applications and demonstrate their compliance with current policy requirements. However, it is important to note that these were developed only to check compliance with Building Regulations, not whether buildings comply with Net Zero Carbon buildings policies, and or the prediction of future energy use. Instead, this policy recommends use of Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) for new build residential schemes, as it has been shown to predict energy use much more accurately than SAP. Comparative SAP/PHPP modelling undertaken on different typologies suggest that SAP underestimates space heating demand by more than 50 per cent.
For new non-residential schemes, this policy encourages the use of CIBSE 
Technical Memorandum 54 (TM54) predictive energy modelling. IESVE, TAS and PHPP are three energy modelling packages that can be used to carry out TM54 assessments. Predictive energy modelling using CIBSE Technical Memorandum 54 (TM54) allows to estimate the operational energy for all end uses of a building (regulated and unregulated) much more accurately. With TM54, more realistic operational scenarios such as the length of hours the building is used can be taken into account.
CE2.5 The amount of energy generated per year should be measured in kWh per square metre of building footprint.
For developments that are unable to achieve the quantity of renewable 
energy generation on site as outlined in CE2.4, an offset payment to fund renewable energy generation in the borough is to be sought. 240
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCE2.5 This offset payment would cover the purchasing and installation of a 
PV renewable energy system elsewhere in the borough, which is able 
to generate the amount of energy equivalent to the gap in onsite provision.
Offsetting will only be accepted as a means to achieving planning 
policy compliance if the building is compliant with all other Net Zero Carbon buildings policies and if the following conditions have been met: •  The proposed building must not use fossil fuels on-site.•  
 It must ha
ve a level of space heating demand and energy use 
intensity (EUI) compliant with levels set in the Local Plan in CE2.2 and CE2.3.
•  
 On-sit
e renewable energy generation (e.g. through PVs) has been 
maximised and achieves at least 80 kWh/m2 building footprint for all building types (and 120 kWh/m2 building footprint for industrial buildings).
•  
 Det
ailed energy assessment provided as part of an energy 
statement demonstrating compliance with a, b and c.
The applicant should establish the shortfall in renewable energy generation to enable the annual renewable energy generation to match the Energy Use Intensity in kWh.
Based on the current average price and performance of a PV system, 
a floor price of £1.25/kWh has been set. With a 20 per cent project management fee added, this leads to an offset price of £1.5/kWh. The cost may vary over time reflecting the costs of delivering the required offset projects.

3.218 Both operational and embodied carbon must be reduced to address the climate crisis. Operational carbon has historically been more closely monitored in current legislation and policy, and policy CE2 Zero Carbon Development strengthens our policies on operational carbon. To achieve our climate targets, embodied carbon must also be drastically curtailed throughout the building life cycle. Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacture, transport, construction, repair, maintenance, replacement, and deconstruction of all building elements. 
3.219 Whole life carbon brings together embodied 
carbon, operational carbon, as well as any benefits associated with recovery, reuse, or recycle beyond the system boundary.  By considering embodied carbon, operational carbon and other benefits together at the planning stage, ways to reduce carbon can be most fully considered and have a larger resulting impact. Consideration of the design of a building at early stages can reduce embodied carbon by minimising the quantity used and waste created in both in the construction process and methods. It can also ‘future proof’ the development, by allowing deconstruction of a building for a new use; or allowing for modification, adaption or retrofitting of a building in future. 
3.220 Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) are 
increasingly being used in the construction industry, with parts or components of a building manufactured offsite. MMC does not directly reduce embodied carbon, as it is the materials of components that attribute the most to the Whole Life Carbon calculations. There are some benefits to MMC that can be used to address embodied carbon in a building’s concept design, procurement and end of life considerations – such as efficient control, reuse, recycling and proper disposal of waste. However, MMC can also result in higher levels of embodied carbon – due to potential over engineering of components and transport of components over a large distance (i.e. avoid overseas manufacture). 
3.221 A life cycle assessment (LCA) is the process by 
which Whole Life Carbon is calculated. The London Plan (2021) Policy SI 2 sets out a requirement for developments to calculate and reduce Whole Life Carbon Emissions, currently this is only for projects referred to the Mayor of London. 
3.222 This policy expands that requirement to all 
major developments. By requiring design teams to calculate embodied carbon, this policy helps developers and Newham start to quantify and then reduce embodied carbon. It is important that buildings meet both the upfront embodied carbon and the life cycle embodied carbon targets. An upfront embodied carbon targets is important, as it is in direct control of the developer and contractor. The calculations should be confirmed post completion, to ensure compliance with the policy. 242
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.223 At present, there are no universal standard 
targets for embodied carbon due to a limited evidence base across multiple typologies, however London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) and Royal Institution of British Architects (RIBA) have set baseline targets for embodied carbon. LETI research indicates that current ‘average design’ achieves an E (around 800kg CO2/m
2), with ‘good designs’ achieving 
a C score (around 500kg CO2/m2). This policy 
therefore has embodied carbon limits of less than 500kg CO2/m
2, as LETI and RIBA research indicates 
this is currently deliverable using industry best practice. 
CE3.1 Developments should show consideration of embodied carbon as early as possible, including, where applicable, in the pre application process. 
Development should reference the 
“Whole Life Carbon” principles in the Whole Life-Cycle Carbon Assessments London Plan Guidance, noting the interventions and measures proposed as a consequence of these principles. This could be demonstrated in a Design and Access Statement, as well as in an embodied carbon report at the time of submission. The embodied carbon report should be aligned with the energy strategy of the site.ImplementationCE3.2 Compliance with these requirements should be demonstrated in an embodied carbon report at the time of submission.
Examples of ways this could be demonstrated include: 
•  
 c
onfirmation that options for retaining existing buildings and structures have been fully explored 
before considering substantial demolition (including incorporating the fabric of existing buildings into the new development); 
•  the carbon emissions associated with pre-construction demolition; •  
 an estima
te of the percentage of the new build development which will be made up of existing 
façades, structures, buildings;
•  
 demonstr
ation that the potential for future deconstruction, modification, adaption and 
retrofitting has been considered in the design of the scheme; and
•  details of the Whole Life Carbon principles that are informing the development of the site.
CE3.3 A development proposing Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) should demonstrate: •  That an MMC design will meet space heating target and airtightness requirements.•  
 Tha
t an MMC design will meet Net Zero targets (i.e. space heating target), and that thermal 
bridging and connection have been considered.
•  That overseas manufacture of MMC elements has been avoided. •  A quantification of amount of wastage - a typical figure is five per cent.•  
 Tha
t an MMC design will meet embodied carbon Net Zero targets through an embodied carbon 
assessment, and target figures in line with LETI guidance.
CE3.4 Major developments should undertake a Whole Life Carbon assessment in line with the Whole Life-Cycle Carbon Assessments London Plan Guidance that was published by the Greater London Authority in March 2022. This should be submitted to the Council for assessment.
CE3.5 Major developments should demonstrate that the embodied carbon limits of less than 500kg 
CO2/m
2 can be met, within the Whole Life Carbon assessment. 
This should also demonstrate consideration of ways that embodied carbon has been reduced, as well providing details of the calculation of the expected upfront embodied carbon of buildings.243
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESAt outline planning stage this can be 
based on default figures from the RICS professional statement. At detailed planning stage this should be based on bespoke building assumptions. These embodied carbon calculations should be reconfirmed post completion.
More information regarding these 
embodied carbon limits can be found in the LETI “Embodied Carbon target alignment” paper.

   CE4: Overheating
1.  Al l new development must consider the potential 
of overheating, especially in the light of the 
changing climate and increased likelihood of heatwaves, and seek to reduce overheating risk. This must be demonstrated through:
 
 a.
  Al
l new residential development must 
submit the Good Homes Alliance ‘Early Stage Overheating Risk Tool’ . If a medium or 
high risk score (>8) is indicated, applicants should undertake overheating modelling; and
 
 b.
  F
or major residential applications, initial 
results of the Dynamic Thermal modelling overheating risk assessment should be provided during the pre-application process and a further iteration of the assessment should be provided at the time of the planning application.
 
 c.
  Al
l new non-residential development is 
expected to demonstrate how overheating potential has been minimised, reflecting the end use of the building.
2.
  De
velopments should mitigate overheating using 
‘passive design’ principles, rather than using ‘active cooling’ such as air conditioning.
3.
  Al
l development should submit proof of ability to 
meet the Building Regulations Part O provided as part of the planning application. Justification
3.224 In an increasingly warming climate, overheating is becoming extremely critical. The Greater London Authority’s Climate Risk map shows that the majority of the borough has a high level of heat risk, with homes in London particularly at risk to overheating due to the urban heat island effect. All new homes should therefore be designed to mitigate overheating effectively. 
3.225 The evidence base behind policy CE2 Zero 
Carbon development sets out how heat gain can be beneficial for buildings, as less heating is required. However, the design of new development should strike the right balance between helpful heat gain in winter and unhelpful heat gain in summer.  All development can suffer from overheating, such as new homes, commercial development and industrial warehouses.
3.226 This policy uses clear and simple, design based 
solutions to mitigate overheating potential at a very early stage, while acknowledging that Building Regulations and detailed overheating modelling can also play an important role in reducing overheating in new homes. The Building Regulations Part Document O was released in December 2021 which requires a project to demonstrate that unwanted solar gains are limited, and that heat can be adequately removed from the indoor environment. However, overheating needs to be considered at the earliest possible stages of design, so that ‘passive design’ principles can be incorporated. Design elements that can mitigate overheating risk include the orientation of buildings, reducing glazing, increasing the openable area of windows, ensuring dual aspect and cross ventilation and external shading. 
3.227 A poor quality design may require ‘active 
cooling’ such as air conditioning to meet building regulations – which would also hamper a development’s ability to meet Policy CE2 given the substantial amount of energy required to run a system.
CE4.1 For residential developments, applicants are recommended to submit the ‘Early Stage Overheating Risk tool’ as early as possible - such as at the pre application stage. This allows for overheating to be comprehensively considered during the early stages of design. Guidance on the tool is available on the Good Homes Alliance website. If a medium or high risk score (>8) on the tool is indicated, an Overheating Report should be submitted - including overheating modelling using the Dynamic Thermal Modelling method in accordance with CIBSE TM59 but with the additional limitations stipulated in Approved Document O.Implementation245
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESMajor residential schemes should conduct overheating modelling 
that takes in to account the effects of climate change, considers the outputs of the ‘Early State Overheating Risk tool’ and is in line with relevant Greater London Authority and Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers guidance. 
Non-residential developments should demonstrate consideration of 
overheating in a Design and Access Statement, noting the available guidance and design considerations to mitigate overheating.  
CE4.2 All new development should demonstrate consideration of ‘passive design’ principles in an overheating statement and the Design and Access Statement.
Examples of ‘passive design’ principles include: 
1.  
 op
timising solar gains (such as building orientation, overshadowing 
from buildings, external/internal glazing, the g-value of glazing);
2. 
 r
educing or minimising internal heat gains (using ultra-low energy 
appliances as per policy CE2;
3. 
 maximising pas
sive cooling potential (such as window size and 
location, window openable areas and mechanical ventilation);
4. consideration of materials;5. 
 l
ocal microclimate (such as avoiding large areas of unshaded 
concrete/tarmac).
This policy does not support the use of air conditioning to mitigate overheating risk.
CE4.3 Developments should provide proof of ability to meet Building Regulations Part O in an overheating statement at the time of the planning application. It is noted that developments need to meet these building regulations while meeting the other policy requirements.Meeting Building Regulations Part O should also be considered alongside other standards in the Local Plan including noise standards. Applicants in noisier areas must consider ways to reduce overheating which do not rely on opening windows, where this would expose occupants to uncomfortable or unacceptable noise levels.

Justification
3.228 New buildings will only make-up a small percentage of Newham’s buildings, and while the energy performance of existing buildings in Newham is improving, it remains poor. Therefore, to achieve Newham’s climate objectives, existing buildings across the borough will have to be retrofitted to reduce their energy use, and end the use of fossil fuels on site. CE5.1 Development is encouraged to submit a Retrofit Plan, including an Energy Improvement Strategy. These best practice fabric improvements could include improvements to building insulation, new windows, heat pumps, PV solar panels and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).

Proposed retrofit works for listed buildings or non-designated heritage assets should study relevant guidance from Historic England, and are recommended to engage with the Council’s pre application advice service at the earliest opportunity.Implementation3.229 For many residential buildings, most common retrofit measures do not require planning permission. Therefore this policy seeks to enable suitable retrofit schemes which do require planning permission and encourage the inclusion of further retrofit measures which reduce the carbon associated with a building and the submission of a comprehensive energy improvement strategy, alongside any works requiring permission. The costs of undertaking retrofit measures are significantly reduced when undertaken alongside other works to a building. 
3.230 ‘Best practice’ fabric improvements – i.e. high 
quality, comprehensive retrofit measures – are encouraged to ensure that a building does not need to be retrofitted twice. Evidence shows that ‘shallow’ retrofits of a building will only lead to a limited reduction in energy use, leading to neutral or even adverse effects.
3.231 A retrofit plan demonstrates how retrofitting 
has been considered comprehensively across the building, including various retrofit measures that could be undertaken and specific technologies that could be used. The retrofit plan therefore allows an understanding of the best retrofit works for a building. 
3.232 Quality assurances processes such as EnerPHit 
or Energiesprong include targets for heating demand, energy consumption and renewable energy generation. Taken together, these allow for an understanding.3.233 Taken together, these allow for an understanding of the quality of a proposed retrofit project, and the improvements that will be made.247

CE5.2 Applicants are encouraged to submit a Retrofit plan, including an energy improvement strategy – to ensure that the retrofit actions they are undertaking will deliver substantial benefits to the building.
Examples of positive retrofit actions that may not require planning 
permission include replacing windows (double or triple glazing), replacement of insulation, replacing heating systems (with low carbon heat such as heat pumps or direct electric), installing energy storage batteries, installing PV solar panels and replacing older appliances with ultra-low energy ones.

Justification
3.234 Newham has very poor air quality, with one in seven of Newham’s population exposed to levels of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) that is above the UK limit value for human health. On average, Newham residents are also exposed to a level of airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) that is 35 per cent greater than the World Health Organisation guideline value of 10    /m3 This poor air quality causes the highest rate of deaths from pollution in England – amounting to 96 people dying prematurely each year.
3.235 Newham has several major roads that run 
through the borough (A13, Barking Road and Romford Road) and major roads that run adjacent to the borough boundary (A406 (North Circular) and A12). This leads to poor levels of air quality adjacent to these routes. Newham’s industrial past means there are substantial polluting uses located across the borough, especially in the Royal Docks. Industry that 6.

249
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESsupports construction is also a major contributing 
factor to poor air quality.
3.236 Given the above, the whole borough was 
designated an Air Quality Management Area in 2018, and the Newham Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) sets out measures to reduce emissions from key sources of air pollution in the borough.  As with most areas in London, Newham is also a Smoke Control Area, which allows the borough to enforce the use of smokeless fuels in chimneys or fireplaces. It is noted that smokeless fuels still produce PM2.5.
3.237 This policy is therefore crucial in ensuring 
that development does not worsen levels of poor air quality, and improves air quality for residents in the borough. Other policies such as the transport, neighbourliness and economy policies will also help to deliver better levels of air quality in the borough. This policy sets out specific design interventions and considerations for development, ensuring that air quality levels in the borough are improved, and that health of residents is prioritised in the design of new residential developments. 
3.238 Measures to improve air quality should take 
place on site, such as filters on industrial chimneys or replacing inefficient fossil fuelled generators with direct power. In situations where it is not possible to fully mitigate levels of poor air quality from new development, developers will contribute to off-site measures to improve air quality elsewhere in the borough. Major developments that cause a large increase in vehicles trips will also have to contribute to monitoring levels of air quality in the borough, linking to the objectives of the Transport policies to reduce vehicles trips and improve air quality.
3.239 Since 2010, the number of houseboats in London has doubled. Over 50 per cent of boats do not have a permanent mooring. Heating systems on houseboats are typically fuelled by oil, natural gas or solid fuel such as wood and coal. Although all these heating sources contribute to poor air quality, solid fuel sources are particularly inefficient – leading to high levels of nitrogen dioxide and airborne particulate matter. This policy therefore sets out to encourage a move towards greener and less polluting houseboats, by ensuring that new moorings on waterways have electrical hook-ups.
3.240 The Greater London Authority’s Air Quality 
Positive approach aims to maximise benefits to local air quality in and around a large-scale development sites and masterplan area while also minimising exposure to existing sources of poor air quality. 250
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESExtending the distance between pollution sources and a facility 
allows for air pollution to disperse (mix into clean air), and can reduce exposure. Nature based solutions can also be introduced to act as a green screen buffer around play and informal recreation facilities (see GWS1 and GWS3). Species mix, density height and leaf shape should be selected to reduce the most harmful airborne pollutants. However, it should be noted that green infrastructure in itself is not the solution to air pollution. The amount of pollution removed or deposited on tree or shrub leaves is very low when compared to urban pollution concentrations.
As a component of good urban design, green infrastructure can 
help to
22 reduce emissions by encouraging usage of cycleway and 
footpaths; extend the distance between pollution sources and individuals via mixed planting to create heterogeneous surfaces, or grass verges between roads and footpaths and; protect vulnerable people (e.g. green barriers).
CE6.3
As part of an air quality assessment compliant with Greater London Authority guidance, development should demonstrate how measures to improve air quality will be delivered on site, and how emissions will be reduced to meet Air Quality Neutral requirements.
Developments that are unable to mitigate levels of poor air quality 
on site should contribute to off-site measures to improve air quality elsewhere in the borough – through proportionate financial obligations.
Major developments that cause a large increase in vehicles trips will 
also have to contribute to monitoring levels of air quality in the borough, linking to the objectives of the Transport policies to reduce vehicles trips and improve air quality.

Funding provided by NERC Innovation grant NE/S003487/1. https://doi.org/10.25500/epapers.bham.00003493CE6.1 Development should demonstrate how Newham’s poor air quality will be improved as part of an air quality assessment compliant with Greater London Authority guidance.
Our current guidance on air quality assessments requires all development 
to be Air Quality Neutra l (as does the London Plan (2021). Air quality 
assessments should show how the development will not create unacceptable risk of high levels of exposure to poor air quality.
In mixed-use developments, less sensitive uses should be used as a 
buffer to residential uses and outdoor amenity spaces. Considered placement of uses should respond to the existing environmental quality of sites. Masterplans and larger developments have the opportunity to locate more sensitive uses strategically away from sources of noise and air pollution.
CE6.2 Development should demonstrate how poor air quality from major roads (or other polluting uses) will be mitigated, as part of an air quality assessment compliant with Greater London Authority guidance, as well as in the design of the scheme (such as in a Design and Access Statement).
Physical and green buffers can improve local air quality locally. This 
is especially important along major routes and sensitive uses, where a physical buffer can reduce air pollution and improves views and aspects. The Characterisation Study provides specific guidance and recommendations on how this should be delivered. Along highly trafficked vehicular routes, building orientation and massing should maximise the environmental quality of external private amenity spaces, play space and internal spaces within apartments. In locations where residential uses are directly facing onto busy roads, internal layouts should be carefully considered to maximise the environmental quality in all habitable rooms and outdoor amenity spaces.Implementation251
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCE6.4 Development should demonstrate compliance with the Non-
Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) requirements by following the requirements set out in the Greater London Authority Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition SPG.
Development should also register Non-Road Mobile Machinery on the 
Greater London Authority website.
CE6.5 Development should demonstrate that all new moorings will provide suitable infrastructure to enable houseboats that use the new moorings to use electricity for heating when moored, rather than using fossil fuels. Applicants are recommended to discuss their proposal with the Canal and River Trust at the earliest possible opportunity.
CE6.6 Developments required to meet Air Quality Positive standards should demonstrate how they have done so within an Air Quality Assessment containing an Air Quality Positive statement compliant with Greater London Authority guidance, as well as in the Design and Access Statement.
This should demonstrate how proposals have considered ways to 
maximise benefits to local air quality and what measures or design features will be put in place to reduce exposure to pollution, and how they will achieve this.
The Greater London Authority’s Air Quality Positive approach aims 
to maximise benefits to local air quality in and around  large-scale development sites and masterplan areas while also minimising exposure to existing sources of poor air quality. It requires planners, designers, architects, and air quality experts to demonstrate what measures have been taken during the design stages to achieve the best possible outcomes for air quality.Monitoring

      CE7: Managing flood risk
 1.   Al l new development must avoid placing people or 
Essential Infrastructure at increased risk of flooding, through considering flood risk at the earliest design stage and, where required, by liaising with the Environment Agency, infrastructure providers and the Council (including Local Lead Flood Authority) to deliver climate resilient development. To meet this requirement, all new development must:
 
 a.
  as
sess the risk of flooding from all sources 
as informed by the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) or subsequent updates of the evidence and best available data; and
 
 b.
  be l
ocated in areas with the lowest risk 
of flooding (as informed by passing the Sequential Test) and if necessary the Exceptions Test. The sequential approach applies across the borough and within sites such that areas with the lowest risk should be identified and prioritised according to vulnerability of proposed use; and
 
 c.
  a
void and reduce the risk of flooding from all 
sources both on site and elsewhere on any location; and
 
 d.
  pr
ovide a Flood Risk Assessment in 
accordance with national requirements, the SFRA and Environment Agency advice. 
2.  
 De
velopments within Flood Zones 2 (medium 
probability of flooding) and 3 (high probability), or where detailed more up to date modelling shows it will be at increased risk of flooding due to the impacts of the climate emergency, should: 
 a.
 cr
eate space for water; and
 
 b.
  be designed and c
onstructed to be flood 
resilient; and
 
 c.
  l
ocate vulnerable uses above ground floor 
level, whilst still delivering active, welcoming and functional street level design; and
 
 d.
  Ensur
e all basement locations provide 
internal access and egress via floors no less than 300 millimetres above the one per cent annual probability flood level and an allowance for the impact of the climate emergency, or above the 2100 tidal breach flood level where the site is within the Thames tidal breach flood extent; and
 
 e.
  Ensur
e all ‘more vulnerable’, ‘highly 
vulnerable’ and ‘essential infrastructure’ uses have finished floor levels no less than 300 millimetres above the one per cent annual probability flood level and an allowance for the impact of the climate emergency; and
 
 f
.
  Pr
ovide safe access/egress, such that 
occupants can reach Flood Zone 1 via public rights of way.
3.  
 De
velopments (including redevelopment of 
existing buildings and sites) will be set back a minimum of 16 metres from tidal flood defences and eight metres river defences to future proof against increased risks of fluvial flooding, taking into account the requirements set out in the Thames Estuary2100 (and any subsequent updates).  Where no formal defences are present development will be set back eight metres from the top of the river bank.4.  
 De
velopment adjacent to flood defences must 
confirm through liaison with the Environment Agency, that defence structures are in good condition and will provide protection for the lifetime of the development including taking into consideration the latest Climate Change Allowance modelling, and, where applicable, meet the provisions set out in the TE2100 (and any subsequent updates). If any improvements are required, these should be made at the earliest possible stage (factoring in impacts on scheme phasing and the end users of schemes) and should consider the need to design for extreme climate change scenarios.
5.  
 Pr
oposals within Gallions Reach, North Woolwich, 
Royal Victoria, Royal Albert North Canning Town and Custom House and Manor Road Neighbourhoods  must have regard to:
 
 a.
  the infr
astructure requirements and 
recommendations set out in the emerging Local Integrated Water Management Strategy, particularly in relation to alleviating localised surface water drainage problems, ensuring sufficient infrastructure capacity and surface water and fluvial tidal flood risk measures; and

 Justification
3.241 Newham has declared a climate emergency, which requires urgent action to be taken to counter the impacts of climate change. Recent climate change projections suggest that London will experience changing rainfall patterns. This will mean more intense rainfall episodes for longer periods of time and sea level rise with potential for increased storm surges, including within the tidal Thames. 
3.242 Newham’s watercourses are at the Thames, 
Roding and Lea rivers with some major growth areas falling within Zones 2 and 3. Flood risk, both the likelihood and severity of occurrences, is therefore likely to increase from a range of sources: tidal, fluvial (rivers), rain (surface water), groundwater, sewer overflow and reservoir failure. As such it is vital that development minimises flood risk, and in particular reduces the risk to people and essential infrastructure. 
3.243 Tools to reduce this risk include the Sequential 
Test and Exceptions Test which must be followed, sustainable drainage solutions, delivery of well-designed and integrated flood defences, which should be designed so as to be sufficiently resilient as weather patterns change. CE7.1 Applicants will be required to demonstrate their proposals have taken account of flood risk from all sources (tidal, fluvial (rivers), rain (surface water), groundwater, sewer overflow and reservoir failure) and in the context of predicted climate change. If a site is not currently shown to be within Flood Zone 2 or 3, but more detailed and up to date modelling shows it is expected to be impacted when climate change is assessed, then the same design considerations should be applied as if it was within a higher risk Flood Zone.
Major proposals must use the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) as the primary document 
to inform site assessments and provide responses to this in relation to mapping, flood defences and Sustainable Urban Drainage System technical detail. In line with the National Planning Policy Framework this information should be used for Flood Risk Assessments (FRAs) where required. However, this should be supplemented with the latest and most relevant information from the Environment Agency, which may include models more up-to-date than those used in production of the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. 
The assessment must set out the known flood risk potential from all sources of flooding to the 
development site, the potential off site flood risk issues and set out how this will be managed, with due consideration to the impacts of the climate emergency;Investigation on flood risk issues should be commenced sufficiently early in the design and planning process so that all opportunities to reduce flood risk can be identified and maximised. 
CE7.2 Applicants must have regard to areas at risk from all sources of flooding to ensure that vulnerable 
uses (as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework) are not located in areas at risk of flooding and that suitable flood resilience and evacuation measures are incorporated into the design. 
In proposals in areas at risk to flooding applicants must refer to the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
and Planning Practice Guidance and design in measures from the outset reflecting the vulnerability classifications in policy and detailed design requirements. This should be considered at the earliest possible stage, with due consideration to the proposed uses and flood risk impacts. The full list of vulnerability classifications are set out National Flood Risk Guidance and are categorised as;•  ‘Essential Infrastructure’ including transport and utilities infrastructureImplementation254
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCE7.2 •   ‘Highl y Vulnerable’ – including emergency services stations, 
basement dwellings and emergency dispersal points.
•  
 ‘Mo
st Vulnerable’ – including hospitals, residential institutions, 
dwelling houses, drinking establishments, non-residential uses for 
health services, nurseries and education establishments.
•  
 ‘Les
s Vulnerable’ – including emergency services stations not 
required to be operations during flooding, buildings for shops, professional services, waste treatment, sewage treatment works if flood management control is in place, car parks.
•  
 ‘
Water Compatible’ –including flood control infrastructure, docks, 
marinas and wharves, navigation facilities, ship building, amenity open space, outdoor sports and recreation.
CE7.3 and CE7.4The TE2100 Flood defence (set-back) buffering line is indicative only and applicants are responsible for investigating the status and nature of flood defences in consultation with the Environment Agency at the earliest stage.
Further detail is set out in the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan which 
identifies the need for existing flood defences improvements and requirements to be considered in designing proposals adjacent to the river. The safeguarding of and future proofing of flood defences is critical to achieving climate resilient development. Proposals are expected to plan for the most extreme weather events with due consideration to the phasing of major development proposals and to implement flood defences and any identified upgrades at the earliest possible stage to avoid disruption (particularly at the occupation stage) caused by retrofitting. This process should be undertaken in liaison with the Environment Agency and the Local Authority. 
CE7.5 The Greater London Authority is producing both a sub-regional and a Local Integrated Water Management Strategy (to cover the Royal Docks and Beckton Opportunity Area) to identify options for sustainably managing water to meet the needs of growth.The strategies will supplement this policy as guidance to reduce the risks of flooding across the development areas and wider drainage network, whilst minimising the demand on stressed water resources, factoring in climate change. The relevant findings will be incorporated into this policy or where appropriate signposted to as additional guidance. 
The (emerging) Riverside Strategy will provide Supplementary Design 
Guidance to support the TE2100 objectives in an integrated way to improve flood risk management as well as recognising the multi-functional benefits of enhancing riverside access. Proposals should consider this document at the pre-application / design stage to implement flood risk management and to secure wider benefits The approach is supported by Policy SI12 in the London Plan (2021).

These will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
Justification
3.244 The policy recognises the environmental and cost benefits which can be achieved from an integrated approach to water management. Sustainable Urban Drainage Solutions (SuDS) are an effective flood and water management approach within the built environment, helping to protect existing and new communities from the harmful effects of surface water flooding. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems function by managing surface water run-off by treating it as near to the source as possible and by slowing down the rate of discharge. In pursuit of sustainable growth in urbanised areas like Newham, all new developments will be required to incorporate sustainable measures such as greening and drainage which have many benefits over time including managing flood risk and disruption, water quality improvements, biodiversity, increased natural cooling, and improved amenity.

5.  
 Al
l Major development and any new development 
falling within a Critical Drainage Area must be accompanied by a Surface Water Drainage Strategy that:
 
 a.
  cl
arifies the pre and post development run-
off rates and water quality impacts, ensuring run-off is clean and safe; and
 
 b.
  c
onfirms the ownership, management 
and maintenance arrangements of any Sustainable Urban Drainage System features; and
 
 c.
  c
onfirms, where it can be demonstrated that 
site conditions prohibit the achievement of greenfield run-off, that a rate of no higher than three times greenfield will be achieved.257
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESAs a principal the policy expects all proposals to adopt a more integrated water management 
approach. This includes due consideration in the design (factoring in the land uses proposed) of the overall water management including wastewater disposal, quality, supply and flood management as well as wider biodiversity, amenity and other benefits. The Construction Industry Research and Information (CIRIA) describe the four main categories of benefits that can be achieved by Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems  as shown below:
Four Pillars of Sustainable Urban Drainage System design defined by CIRIA: 
The SuDS Manual C753
CE8.1and CE8.2 All new development must demonstrate the management of risk of surface water flooding by reducing rainwater run-off and implementation of sustainable drainage solutions. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems deal with excess water from the site and return it to the water system in a controlled manner to alleviate flood risk and reduce discharge from other pollutants.

places for nature
The selection of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems measures must be appropriate to the site, scale and nature of the proposed development/or operations. As set out in the Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems Hierarchy below the more natural the solution the better the benefits. Given these multi-functional benefits (including environmental and amenity) of Sustainable Urban Drainage features, design solutions should be weighed up and chosen according to the Sustainable Urban Drainage System Hierarchy (Table 15).3.245 Localised flooding is already occurring at a regular basis in parts of Newham and is being raised as a key issue by local residents. With increased and heavier rainfall predicted because of climate change, the possibility of flood risk in urbanised areas from both surface water build up and subsequent sewer overflow is likely to increase even further. All new development can impact water management and quality in many ways, including pressure on capacity within the sewer network through to design measures that can reduce surface water run-off and improve drainage solutions. 
3.246 All development presents opportunities 
to reduce rainwater run-off and increase the opportunities for permeable ground surfaces and sustainable drainage solutions. The policy actively promotes an integrated approach to water management from small-scale design considerations such as greening and water reuse to larger options around Sustainable Urban Drainage Solutions. 258

Source: Environment Agency ‘SuDS A Practical Guide’Flooding from foul and combined sewers occurs 
when rainfall exceeds the capacity the networks or when there is an infrastructure failure. Separating foul water and run off is an important component both in sustainable design and to reduce pressure on the sewer network. All new development should be designed holistically in line the drainage hierarchy to deliver mitigating measures to overcome constraints on capacity. The separation of foul and surface water flows must be made if possible. Where only combined sewers are present, developments must incorporate the means to separate flows as sewer upgrades are made over time. 
Early discussions on Sustainable Urban Drainage 
Systems can ensure that the implementation of high quality drainage solutions maximise the potential in development and subsequently the benefits arising from new development in the borough. For Major development drainage solutions and mitigation should be a consideration in any site masterplan and for smaller scale development should be set out in Design and Access Statements.    259
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESCE8.3 In urban areas like Newham it is important that opportunities for 
permeable ground surface are secured. Factoring in the cumulative impacts of development the loss of permeable ground surfaces increases surface water flood risk in the borough. 
Newham has experienced losses in the quantity of grassed areas 
as people pave over gardens or seek alternative hardstanding on ground surfaces. Given the surface water risks this presents to people, properties and public spaces across the borough there is an expectation that permeable surfaces will be used as far as possible to reduce this risk.  Further detail on measures to implement permeable surfaces for front gardens is set out in Government guidance (Guidance on the permeable surfacing of front gardens) and within London Borough of Newham’s Sustainable Urban Drainage System guidance.
CE8.4 For Major development and proposals within Critical Drainage Areas (CDAs) a Sustainable Water Drainage Strategy is required demonstrating how greenfield run-off rates have been achieved through the application of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems and other design considerations. Greenfield run-off rates is the run off that would occur from a site in an undeveloped natural state.
This must be achieved in line with the requirement to discharge 
surface water run-off as high up the drainage hierarchy as possible. The drainage hierarchy is as follows:1.  Re-use on site2. Infiltration into the ground3. A natural watercourse4.
 Sur

5.
 C
ombined sewerDevelopers should refer to recognised best practice guidance set out in the CIRIA (The SuDS Manual C735) and Newham’s Sustainable Drainage Design and Evaluation Guidance in designing Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems into the scheme. This provides further detail and advice on design, greenfield run-off rates and practical solutions to maximise sustainable drainage options within new development. 
In circumstances where opportunities for de-culverting are present but 
not possible within the realities of a site, contributions to de-culverting elsewhere in the borough may be sought.
The Surface Water Drainage Strategy is a report detailing how surface 
water can affect a site and its surrounding. Proposals must establish water will behave on a site, estimating surface water run-off rates, viable flow pathways and likely sub-surface infiltration. This will also include consideration made to Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems featured proposed and measures to reduce run-off. The Strategy should follow this broad structure:•  Summary of proposal within surface water volumes and flows•  
 Pl
ans, drawings and specification of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems 
proposed, integrated with landscaping and materials requirements,
•  
 Demonstr
ation of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems considerations 
within the drainage hierarchy
•  
 Methods of w
ater quality control provided (including management and 
maintenance of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems).
The above details may also be required for smaller scale development where development is proposed within an area at risk of flooding from all sources and for proposals likely to increase flooding locally. Identifying such sites and the provision of this detail will be undertaken in consultation with the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority and Environment Agency if required. 260

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESTRANSPORT
3.247 High quality, sustainable transport is key to 
delivering many of Newham’s objectives – ensuring economic growth, allowing mobility for all, improving the health and wellbeing of residents and assisting in tackling the Climate Emergency. To achieve these aims, we needs to move away from a car dominated borough towards active and sustainable transportation. These policies covers all forms of transportation in Newham – walking, cycling, public transport, cars, vans, heavy goods vehicles, boats and planes.
3.248 Over the last 40 years, Newham has enjoyed 
substantial investment in public transport (DLR, Jubilee line, High Speed 1, Elizabeth line). The borough also has a very high number of accessible stations, with only 4 stations without step free access. Owing to this investment, the borough has a very high public transport mode share at around 40 per cent, almost six per cent higher than the inner London average. 
3.249 Newham has a target of 83 per cent of all 
trips to be made on foot, by cycle or using public transport by 2041. The borough also has a low car ownership rate, with over half of residents not owning a car. However, cycling mode share in Newham is low (around two to three per cent) and the reduction in car use has plateaued in recent years. There are also multiple barriers to connectivity across the borough, with major roads, rivers and historic urban grain limiting movement of residents. A significant number of Newham residents are regularly exposed to poor air quality which is harmful to their health. This air quality monitoring data also clearly shows that poor air quality is concentrated along major roads in the borough.
3.250 By increasing the number of residents who use 
active travel modes to get around, we can improve health (obesity levels, mental health), safety (road deaths, fitness) and equality (allowing all Newham residents to make the most of the opportunities that Newham and London offers them). Delivery of strategic transport infrastructure can speed journey times for residents, improve connectivity and unlock large development sites for housing. Better quality public transport can also deliver substantial benefits - connecting jobs, schools and community facilities to where people live - in a fast, cost effective and convenient way. By reducing vehicle use, these benefits are amplified further, as air quality in the borough (a major contributor to asthma, heart disease and other health conditions) is improved, road safety is improved and public transport journeys become more reliable.
3.251 Although these policies aim to reduce vehicle 
use, it is acknowledged that electric vehicles can play a key role in delivering Newham’s Climate Emergency targets. Therefore while the policies in this chapter primarily encourage active travel and public transport, some residents and businesses do require vehicles, and this policy encourages the uptake of electric vehicles for those uses.This section contains the following policies:•

infrastructure that unlocks the development site, provide funds to deliver strategic transport investment and improvements, or safeguard land for future strategic transport schemes. This will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
Justification
3.252 Newham strongly supports future Strategic Transport investments in the borough – such as the DLR extension to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead and future improvements to Stratford Station, and will proactively protect land and access to ensure the delivery of these projects in the future. These projects are required in order to increase public transport accessibility and capacity, improve air quality, increase residents’ access to services and facilities and reduce carbon emissions from transport and must therefore be designed to deliver these mutually supportive objectives. 
3.253 The Mayor of London, Transport for London 
and the Council are working collaboratively to deliver these strategic transport improvements. Long delivery timeframes mean that safeguarding projects and the land required to deliver them is crucial to ensure that strategic transport projects can be delivered at a future date. 
3.254 The policy also aims to protect transport 
networks from impacts, such as a development

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIEST1.1 Development should demonstrate that the development will minimise impacts on existing 
transport networks, through discussions with relevant infrastructure providers such as Transport for 
London and London Borough of Newham Highways. This may be secured via a Planning Condition.
Any development that may impact strategic transport infrastructure – whether due to 
proximity, scale or nature of the development – should demonstrate that the strategic transport infrastructure will not be impacted. This should be discussed with the relevant consultees, as outlined below, at the earliest possible stage to ensure that safeguarding measures are implemented. •

Mapping of transport infrastructure is available on the Council’s website and on the Policies Map, however this should not be the sole resource used to understand safeguarding requirements given the complex and technical nature of these matters.
If a piece of strategic transport infrastructure is proposed for release, agreement for the release 
from the relevant infrastructure provider should be provided, as well as demonstration that the development will not impact other operational transport infrastructure. 
Development should demonstrate that any proposal in close proximity to a future strategic 
transport project would not impact the delivery or function of the future project. A temporary development will still need to demonstrate that it would not impact the delivery or function of the future project. Implementationdecreasing safety on the road network, a building impacting radio coverage for a piece of transport infrastructure, and a development overcrowding a transport network to an unsafe level. It also aims to protect the current and future Strategic Transport network, as well as related ancillary facilities from development – unless they are declared surplus. This is to ensure the ongoing successful functioning of the transport system. This policy also helps to protect existing Safeguarded Wharves, following the policy set out in the London Plan (2021).

Justification
3.255 This policy will deliver and increase sustainable transport, supporting the delivery of 15-minute neighbourhoods and delivering multi-functional benefits for the borough and residents. These benefits include improved air quality, health, climate, as well as sustainable growth and will help to achieve Newham’s Air Quality and public health objectives. 3.256 This policy supports the delivery of the Council’s wider Walking and Cycling infrastructure, as well as pieces of local infrastructure including Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), School Streets and local connections. The borough has plans to roll out Low Traffic Neighbourhoods to the entirety of the borough and School Streets to as many schools as possible. By supporting existing interventions, and helping to deliver new interventions, development will facilitate improved street environments and improve local neighbourhoods for walking and cycling by reducing traffic volumes. 
3.257 Newham has several major barriers to 
movement, such as road and railway infrastructure, natural features like rivers and canals, as well the urban environment with disconnected street patterns and fence lines. For some residents, barriers to movement are worsened by other factors such as disability, age or safety fears. By delivering specific interventions outlined in the Walking and Cycling strategies, a development will assist in overcoming these barriers, improving connections, delivering 15-minute neighbourhoods and further encourage walking and cycling in the borough. Access to the three rivers that surround Newham will also be delivered, with routes along the Thames, Lea and Roding. 
3.258 Through financial contributions or direct 
delivery, development will support local transport improvements such as bus stops, pedestrian crossings or improved highway works. The level of 266
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIEST2.1 Development should show that the design of the scheme prioritises walking, cycling 
and public transport, and discourages vehicle use. Measures that improve the local public transport network, enhance existing journeys or reduce negative impacts are also supported. Developments should seek to reduce barriers to movement, benefiting pedestrians and cyclists in particular. Large buildings and development sites can also act as barriers, so masterplanning should consider optimal routes to, from and around sites.  Developments should demonstrate that sites are accessible for all residents, with pavements free of trip hazards/obstructions. Immediate access to a site should also be considered, with the provision of dropped kerbs at junctions or removal of pavement parking.
The Walking Strategy sets out an approach to developing a comprehensive, high quality 
walking network in the borough that is accessible to all and aligns with Transport for London’s Walking Action Plan. It is focused on overcoming the key barriers to people walking and in doing so maximising the number of trips that can be walked. It sets outs key principles for walking routes to enable 15-minute neighbourhoods, as well as identifying the key routes around Town Centres and public transport interchange facilities where improvement will enable people to walk to these areas. Improvements for walking routes primarily used for leisure are also highlighted in the strategy.
The Cycling Strategy sets out the requirements to deliver a borough-wide cycling network 
that meets the quality criteria set out by Transport for London’s Cycling Action Plan. It identifies new routes and improvements to existing, as well as local connections, to deliver a cycle network that will enable all residents, from age eight to eighty, to cycle short trips in the borough. It connects to key local destinations and centres, and builds on existing schemes delivered by the council. A combination of measures are identified to support both local and cross-London journeys, ensuring that the network serves a range of trip purposes and that all locations within the borough are in proximity to the network.Implementationimprovement will vary depending on the nature of the development and the nature of the intervention. Development should be accessible to all residents, with work to improve access and mobility across the borough including the provision of dropped kerbs at junctions, removal of pavement parking and ensuring that pavements are free of trip hazards/obstructions.
3.259 This policy also seeks to deliver regional 
transport initiatives including the Healthy Streets approach, cycle hire provision and wayfinding, all of which are designed to help Londoners use cars less and walk, cycle and use public transport more. Embedding these approaches in Newham ensures residents benefit from access to a wider network of connectivity and the delivery of best practice design approaches.
3.260 The policy also seeks to enable future 
transportation technology that may arrive over the Plan period. Technology such as drones or electric vehicles are starting to be more commonplace, whereas delivery robots or fully autonomous vehicles are not yet available. The policy supports development that supports new technologies – where this does not cause amenity impacts for residents (such as noise, privacy, safety or air quality) or impact the smooth functioning transport network.267
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIEST2.1 Development should support the delivery of these Strategies by:
•  
 suppor
ting improved and quicker connections to employment 
locations, community facilities and green space; and
•  
 suppor
ting and/or improving existing or delivering new strategic 
cycling routes as shown in the Cycling Strategy; and
•  
 suppor
ting and/or improving existing or delivering new strategic 
walking routes identified in the Walking Strategy such as the Greenway, Leaway, River Roding Way and Thames Path.
Applicants are expected to discuss improvements to public transport and other interventions with the Council’s planning and transport departments, as well as with infrastructure providers such as Transport for London. Applicants should demonstrate relevant delivery in a Design and Access Statement, as well as in a Transport Assessment (see Policy T3). Ongoing management should be demonstrated in a Servicing and Management Strategy.
A Low Traffic Neighbourhood is a predominantly residential area that 
is bounded by main roads, in which a set of modal filters has been installed to prevent motor vehicles from using the residential area as a shortcut. School Streets are interventions outside of schools to improve air quality, and encourage more families to make journeys to school on foot or cycle.
Applicants should demonstrate that they have considered Low Traffic 
Neighbourhoods and School Streets in the design of their scheme, liaising with the Council’s transport department as appropriate. Developments adjacent to existing Low Traffic Neighbourhoods or School Streets should support these existing installations, delivering improved public realm, cycle parking and implementing a scheme that discourages vehicle trips. T2.1 Where a new school is proposed, the development should embed School Street principles from the outset of design – minimising vehicle trips to/from the school. Applications for new schools are expected to discuss the proposals with the Council’s planning and transport departments at the earliest possible opportunity. Applicants should show that the Healthy Streets principles have been considered throughout the design of the development. This should be demonstrated in a Transport Assessment (see Policy T3), and in a Design and Assess Statement.
T2.2 Applicants should demonstrate in the Design and Access Statement that 
wayfinding has been considered and that placement of Legible London signage has been considered.
Applicants should work in partnership with Transport for London regarding 
the installation and ongoing maintenance of Legible London signage.For very large development sites (over 200 units), a wayfinding statement or a signage strategy should be submitted for approval.
Applicants should demonstrate consideration of local cycle hire, following 
the recommendations in the Sustainable Transport Strategy.Applicants should work in partnership with operators as appropriate - Transport for London regarding Santander Cycle Hire, London Borough of Newham regarding Brompton Bike Hire and other operators as relevant.
T2.3 Applicants should demonstrate that the development that supports 
or enables new transportation technology does not negatively impact residents or the transport network.
Applications that enable or support new transportation technologies 
are expected to discuss the proposals with the Council’s planning and transport departments at the earliest possible opportunity. Depending on the size, scale and nature of development, this may include submission of air quality impact assessments, Transport Assessment and Travel Plans.268

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.261 To achieve its modal share target, Newham 
needs a substantial shift in behaviour towards public transport and active travel. Other policies are helping to improve the infrastructure in the borough – however this policy is designed to discourage vehicle use, encourage zero emission mobility and increase active travel.
3.262 The policy follows the approach laid out in the 
London Plan (2021), with all new development to be car free. Residential car parking is not supported, noting that electric vehicle parking is not considered a valid reason to provide car parking at a residential development. For commercial and industrial development, car free development is always the starting point for an application. 
3.263 However, a quantity of car parking could be 
justified - depending on the hours of operation, shift patterns, employment density and PTAL of the site. Where some parking for commercial and industrial development can be justified, the Council will seek the lowest possible quantity.
3.264 Car clubs are an excellent way to allow 
occasional vehicle use by residents without encouraging car ownership or continuous car use. This policy therefore supports and encourages car clubs, providing them at a level appropriate to the scale of development, existing local car club bays and local parking demand.3.265 This policy also aims to increase percentage of vehicles which are electric or switch from combustion engines to electric – given the public health and air quality benefits of them – while also continuing to restrict new car use in the borough given the need to reduce traffic and encourage active travel. This policy therefore seeks to increase the number of available Electric Vehicle Charging Points (EVCPs), installing them where parking is proposed, and seeking contributions from car free developments. This will ensure that a sustainable network of charging points is available across the borough, allowing the servicing and transport needs of all residents, including in car free developments, to be met by electric vehicles. 
3.266 However, no works to permit parking of an 
electric vehicle in a front garden (paving of front gardens, installation of dropped kerbs etc) will be supported. London Borough of Newham does not support new dropped kerbs, as they remove front gardens (worsening biodiversity and increasing rainwater runoff), cause accessibility issues for pedestrians and reduce the quantity of available on-street parking. Given the above and the increasing availability of on street charging stations the desire to charge an electric vehicle is not considered a reason to deviate from this long standing policy.
3.267 This policy acknowledges that developments 
need to receive deliveries and be serviced, and that residents will receive visitors who use cars. This policy supports the provision of short term parking bays for specific uses (such as deliveries or visitors) where the need for this can be justified and evidenced. 3.268 Over the last 20 years, large quantities of cycle parking have been provided as part of new development. As the amount of people cycling in London continues to grow, the supply of cycle parking is extremely important. This policy outlines criteria for high quality cycle parking, helping people feel safe and reducing bike theft. 
3.269 It also ensures that cycle parking areas have 
space for, and can be used by, an increasing variety of mobility options– becoming sustainable transport storage. This could include parking for bicycles, e-bikes, tandems, cargo bikes, electric scooters, buggies and mobility scooters. According to research by Transport for London, 76 per cent of disabled people are able to ride a cycle, but may rely on adapted cycles such as handcycles, tricycles or recumbent cycles. These types of cycles will not always be able to use standard cycle parking. 
3.270 Cargo bike parking is also important to 
encourage greater cargo bike use – for both businesses and households – to move shopping, bulky items and children and pets around the borough, enabling these trips to be made without the use of a motor vehicle. By 2030, two thirds of cycle purchase in the EU and UK are expected to be of electric-assist models. 
3.271 This policy also encourages greater provision of 
cycle parking for properties that have three or more bedrooms and have standalone cycle parking. This follows residents feedback that the space available to park bikes was not large enough, especially when 272
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESfamilies often have prams/buggies, bikes for small 
children as well as other mobility devices such as scooters.
3.272 Following the Sustainable Transport Strategy, 
the policy strengthens provision of short term and long term larger non-standard cycle parking provision for a wide variety of uses. The policy also sets design specifications for non-standard cycle parking stands, in the absence of London-wide standards. 
3.273 This policy also plans to cement changes 
through the successful use of Travel Plans – long-term management strategies that aim to facilitate change in travel behaviours in favour of active, efficient and sustainable transport modes. By working to implement, monitor and report on their Travel Plan, developments will deliver on the intended outcomes.T3.1 Following the London Plan (2021), car free development is the starting point for all development 
proposals. 
Developments should provide a quantity of blue badge spaces, proportionate to the scale of the 
development and the quantity of existing blue badge spaces in the local area. Although individual spaces are not allocated to individual residents, blue badge parking should be located as close as possible to the access point of the building they are associated to. They should be clearly marked as designated for disabled persons. The parking spaces should be on firm, level ground, as should the route to the building entry, or where this is not possible, a step-free gently sloping route is acceptable.
Where developments wish to provide mobility scooter parking instead of blue badge spaces, 
applicants should demonstrate that the approach is suitable, noting public transport accessibility, accessible stations, accessible pavements and dropped kerbs. 
Applicants should demonstrate the blue badge provision in a Transport Assessment containing a 
parking stress survey, as well as through discussions with the Council’s transport and public health teams.
For some industrial and commercial uses, parking may be considered acceptable where these 
industrial/commercial uses have 24-7 hours of operation, multiple shift patterns, low employment density and a very low PTAL (level 2 or below). Where parking can be justified, the Council will seek the lowest possible quantity, following the London Plan (2021). Applicants should demonstrate this in a Transport Assessment.
Applicants should work in partnership with London Borough of Newham, Transport for London 
and car club providers to understand the proposed level of car club bays and amount of contributions required. This should take into account the scale of development, existing local car club bays and local parking demand. The Council’s Car Club Strategy and the Sustainable Transport Strategy outlines the preferred approach towards car clubs, and the level of support required.Implementation
273
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIEST3.1 Developments that propose short term bays – such as for deliveries, 
servicing and short term visitor parking - should evidence the need 
for their installation, as well as providing details on how the bays will be managed. Applicants that wish to propose on-street short term bays should discuss the acceptability of this with the Council’s transport colleagues.
T3.2 Developments should demonstrate that parking has been be 
considered cohesively as part of the design of the urban realm and building. Where including parking as part of the design of the urban realm, it should:•  Be capable of changing and evolving over time•

•  Consideration of all, including older persons and the disabled•  Clear, easy to understand signage 
Applicants should demonstrate this in a Design and Access Statement, as 
well as in a Landscaping statement.
T3.3
Applicants should demonstrate the quantity of sustainable transport storage proposed (including cycle parking in line with, or higher than London Plan (2021) standards) in a Transport Assessment. 
Cycle parking should meet London Cycle Design Standards. The 
Sustainable Transport Strategy outlines that a minimum of five per cent of cycle parking should be dedicated to larger non-standard cycle parking.  This larger non-standard cycle parking should preferably be provided in the same location as standard cycle parking. It should accommodate a range of non-standard cycles, through provision of sufficient space to park and manoeuvre and step-free access. 
Where standard parking is provided in the form of Sheffield Stands, the 
end stands can be dedicated to non-standard cycles if there is sufficient space to either side. Other stand options could include ground anchors or lower and extended Sheffield Stands. All larger non-standard cycle parking should be clearly labelled such that it is dedicated to larger non-standard cycles only.
Applicants should demonstrate in a Design and Access Statement that 
they have considered the following to ensure delivery of high quality sustainable transport storage:•  Who will use the storage – residents, shoppers, employees, children etc•  Security of the storage, and how it’s accesses274

T3.4 The Sustainable Transport Strategy sets out charging requirements 
for sustainable transport storage. Where twenty or more long-term cycle parking spaces are provided, one e-charging point should be provided per twenty spaces. Applicants should demonstrate what chargers are to be provided, and how they are to be maintained and managed.
T3.5 The Sustainable Transport Strategy sets out appropriate levels for 
Electric Vehicle Charging Points. 
All parking at residential developments should include Electric 
Vehicle Charging Points. At non-residential developments it is expected that 20 per cent of long-term parking spaces have active EVCP provision, with the remaining spaces being equipped with necessary infrastructure such that charging could subsequently be installed (this is also known as passive provision). For visitor parking, 20 per cent of spaces should have active Electric Vehicle Charging Points installed.T3.5 Developments that propose Electric Vehicle Charging Points should ensure 
that they meet the requirements of Policy T3.2, noting the requirements for high quality realm, and Policy T2.1d noting the requirements for accessibility. Electric Vehicle Charging Points that introduce ‘trip hazards’ or other obstructions to the public realm will not be supported. 
Signage and road markings should make clear that spaces are dedicated 
to Electric Vehicle Charging Points. Details regarding the charging point operator should also be clearly signed, with contact information to report faults or damage.
T3.6 Applicants should undertake a Transport Assessment following Transport for London’s Healthy Streets Transport Assessment format, or the latest format if updated over the course of the Plan period.   
The Transport Assessment should illustrate accessibility to the site by all

3.274 Department for Transport data shows that over the last 25 years, light goods vehicle use in London has increased by 54 per cent, while heavy goods vehicles use in London has decreased by six per cent over the same period. One of the reasons for this rise is that over the past 20 years, there has been substantial growth in online shopping and deliveries – as shown in the Retail and Leisure Strategy. Online shopping of convenience goods has risen from 1 per cent in 2008 to 5.4 per cent in 2021 and is projected to grow to 7 per cent by 2040. Online shopping of comparison goods has risen from 7 per cent in 2008 to 22 per cent in 2021, and is projected to rise 29 per cent by 2040.
3.275 As a consequence of the substantial quantity 
of deliveries and servicing that takes place, servicing and deliveries need to be considered from the outset of design. Poor quality design could lead to impacts on the highways network, as well as decreased safety for vulnerable road users.
3.276 Construction of a development can also 
have impacts on the road network as well as on local residents. Servicing and deliveries to/from a construction site often use heavy goods vehicles or large vans and therefore safety needs to be considered. Development should also consider how a development can be constructed and how construction deliveries to the site can be managed.3.277 The Sustainable Transport Strategy outlines how servicing by sustainable means can be encouraged through the use of zero-emission vehicles or e-cargo bikes, as well as freight consolidation between businesses. Development should support these measures through the provision of appropriate infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging, cargo bike parking and delivery lockers. 
3.278 Newham’s poor air quality is exacerbated 
by the quantity of servicing and deliveries to developments in the borough and other boroughs.  Consequently, this policy encourages servicing and deliveries to take place using more sustainable means – such as zero emission vehicles and cargo bikes.
277
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
T4.1 Where possible, servicing and deliveries should take place within 
the curtilage of the development. Applicants are recommended to

4.
  Any de

impact on local residents, and additional works to Planning obligations
•   C ontributions will be sought from airport 
developments for Our Newham Work. This will be secured via a development’s legal agreement.
Justification
3.279 One of London’s major airports, London City Airport opened in 1987, and has been expanded several times over the last 30 years. The current planning permission for the airport was granted in 2016 by the Secretaries of State for Transport and Communities and Local Government. 
3.280 Destinations include other parts of the UK 
and Europe, with a mixture of business and pleasure travel.  Two thirds of passengers access the airport using public transport, the highest proportion of any airport in the UK. However, nearly 60 per cent of Airport staff still use private cars to travel to the Airport. 
3.281 The airport is the largest private sector employer 
in the borough and a catalyst for investment in East London. National policy states that the best use should be made of existing airport capacity, as well as the need to support long term economic growth. National policy also notes that a priority is to make better use of existing runway capacity at all UK airports. further mitigate existing impacts for local residents is encouraged.
5.
  De
velopment proposals should improve 
sustainable access to the airport site for both airport passengers and staff alike. This could include:
 
 a.
  De
velopment that reduces the level of car 
parking on site.
  b.  Development that makes improvements to 
public transport access to the airport.
6.
 De
velopment should work with the Council to 
ensure that local residents are supported into airport and aviation related jobs.
7.
 De
velopment in proximity to the airport needs 
to consider a range of factors, including the Agent 
of Change principle, noise and height limitations. Proposals should be discussed with London City Airport at the earliest possible opportunity.
279
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES3.282 Residents have told us they do not support 
an increase in the number of flights (actual aircraft movements) or reduction in the extant respite period – especially in light of Newham’s declaration of a Climate Emergency and Air Quality commitments. 
3.283 In addition, and partly due to the role of the 
airport, the area around London City Airport is transforming rapidly from a predominantly industrial area to an increasingly residential and mixed use part of the borough, providing new homes and jobs at a scale of significance to the whole of London. The location of a major airport in a rapidly densifying part of central London is unique and careful land use management has ensured that current scale and nature of the airport, as secured in the City Airport Development Programme (CADP) Permission (13/01228/FUL) and associated conditions, is able to operate alongside this emerging context.  
3.284 As the planning authority, the Council has 
limited powers regarding the airport and the use of the site. Our approach in exercising these powers is to balance these different objectives by working with the airport to enable its current aviation role to continue on a consolidated and more efficient site. This includes ensuring greater community benefits are secured from changes, including access to stable, well paid jobs in the aviation industry and industries adjacent to aviation such as engineering. 
3.285 We also support improvements to surface 
access to the airport by sustainable means and efforts by London City Airport to achieve net zero, and would support development that facilitates this – such as electric vehicle charging points, solar panels and removal of fossil fuels from the site. The Council acknowledges that zero or low emission technology for commercial air travel is in a very early stage and that airlines, the airport and the Council are unaware of the requirements for such technologies. As we are unaware of what zero or low emission commercial aviation will look like, this policy requires that residents will not be adversely impacted by this new technology.
3.286 Given the above, expansions in the size, 
function, operating hours and frequency of the airport activity is not supported. London City Airport has historically been a passenger focused site, with very small freight volumes. In light of this – the Council would not support freight planes using the airport or an increase in freight volumes on passenger aircraft, especially given the consequential rise in goods vehicle trips that would result from these flights. Nor are proposals to introduce helicopters and other noisy aerial uses such as commercial sized drones supported, in light of the adverse impacts to local residents and housing sites in close proximity to the airport. 
T5.1 Development should show how it will 
make the best use of the limited airport site, enabling land to be unlocked for other employment generating uses that are suitable for close proximity to the airport. This could include uses that support or complement the airport, such as laundry or catering. This should be demonstrated in a Design and Access Statement.
T5.2 The City Airport Development 
Programme (CADP) Permission (13/01228/FUL) was granted in 2016. This permission replaced all of the previous planning permissions at the airport. The planning conditions and planning obligation on the CADP Permission are therefore the only ones that regulate the airports operations. It includes conditions which:•  
 Al
lows for 111,000 actual aircraft 
movements per calendar year. 
•  
 Restric
ts flight numbers on specified 
days (Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays).
•  
 Mana
ges the hours that aircraft can 
take off and land, with exemptions when delays have occurred. 
•  
 Restric
ts any non-fixed wing aircraft 
including helicopters, tilt rotors or gyrocopters. Implementation280
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIEST5.5 The Council does not require an Elizabeth line station at the airport 
to facilitate the levels of growth in the Royal Docks – however the 
Council would support a privately funded station to improve access to the airport site. 
Development that improves sustainable access to the airport site 
should demonstrate the modal shift that will result. A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted as appropriate to the scale of development.
T5.6 Development at the airport should liaise with the Council’s economic 
regeneration and Our Newham Work teams to ensure that local residents are supported into airport and aviation adjacent jobs.
This should be demonstrated at the time of submission, with the 
quantity of local residents supported into airport jobs secured by condition.  
T5.7 Development in proximity to the airport should demonstrate 
consideration of London City Airport at the time of submission. 
This could include noise, air quality, safety, wider Agent of Change 
principles, and height limitations (including construction cranes).
Applicants that propose developments in proximity to the airport 
should discuss the potential implications of the scheme with London City Airport and the Council’s planning team as early as possible. 
Details regarding height restrictions, noise contours and the Public 
Safety Zone can be found on London City Airport’s website.
The outcomes of discussions, and any agreed draft conditions should 
be shared with the Council as part of the application.T5.2 It is considered that the following changes in the use and function of 
the airport would result in an unacceptable increase in adverse impacts to existing local residents and to development proposals for new homes:•  
 De
velopment proposals which would increase the number of actual 
aircraft movements from the airport, or reduces the extant respite period. 
•  Development that would enable the use of the airport site for helicopters or drones.•  
 De
velopment that would encourage greater use of the airport by 
freight planes and increases the number of goods vehicle trips.
A significant number of new homes are planned on site allocations in close proximity to the airport. These homes are required to deliver the London Plan (2021), emerging Royal Docks and Beckton Opportunity Area Planning Framework and local needs. 
T5.3 The Council is supportive of ongoing research and development to 
increase the use of zero carbon technologies in the airport’s operations. This is conditional on any new technology not having unacceptable impacts on existing residents and future housing developments. Examples of impacts that would need to be mitigated include noise, vibration, smell and air quality.
T5.4 Development should demonstrate how impacts on local residents will 
be mitigated. Examples of impacts that would need to be mitigated include noise, vibration, smell and air quality.This should be demonstrated in documentation submitted as part of a planning application. Works to mitigate impacts may be secured by condition.
T5.5 Examples of improvements to surface access which could be supported include proposals which will improve access for local residents to get to/from the airport. This includes work to reduce car trips in the early morning and late at night, work to improve active travel around the Royal Docks and connections to ExCeL and local hotels. 281

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESWASTE AND UTILITIES
3.287 Sustainable waste disposal, collection and 
management are the foundations of a healthy city. As a member of the East London Waste Authority, it is important that Newham works with its east London neighbours (the London Boroughs of Redbridge, Barking and Dagenham and Havering) to manage waste capacity across the East London. The London Plan (2021) sets a target for Newham to manage an apportioned quantity of London’s household, commercial and industrial waste: 383,000 tonnes by 2021 and 407,000 tonnes by 2041. The Joint East London Waste Plan (2012), which is due to be updated, will set out in detail which existing waste sites in Newham will be safeguarded to meet this target.
3.288 Alongside the updated Joint Waste Plan, the 
Local Plan’s waste and recycling policies will guide the management of waste in new developments and the operation of waste management facilities. These policies can help ensure that waste is managed in a sustainable manner, reducing the amount of waste generated and minimising the environmental and amenity impacts of processing waste. Working in tandem with the Joint Waste Plan update, the policies safeguard existing waste management sites and seek to encourage the delivery and improvement of waste management facilities. The policies also seek to enhance the quality of waste and recycling stores within housing and commercial developments. Historically, Newham has had some of the lowest recycling rates in the country as a result of the high density developments delivered in the borough. As such, it is important that new developments support the delivery of the circular economy and help improve the borough’s reuse and recycling rates.
3.289 Utilities infrastructure relates to the provision 
of facilities to deliver a range of critical functions such as providing heat, power, digital connectivity and communications, water supply and wastewater removal. These are necessary for quality of life and a functioning economy. The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Plans to align growth needs with infrastructure delivery as a component of sustainable development. This includes assessments of the quality and capacity of infrastructure, including utilities, to meet demand.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESW1: Waste management 
capacity
1.   The mana gement of waste and the development 
of waste management facilities in Newham should 
follow the principles of the circular economy and waste hierarchy, prioritising reduction, reuse, recycling, and energy recovery before final disposal.
2.  
 Ne

target set out within the London Plan (2021) through the delivery of an updated East London Waste Plan in collaboration with the East London Waste Authority boroughs.
3.  
 Existing w
aste management sites within Newham 
will be safeguarded and should be retained in waste management use. 
4.  
  De
velopments which would reduce or undermine 
the continued or enhanced use of an existing waste management site will only be supported where appropriate compensatory capacity is made within London at or above the same level of the waste hierarchy and the compensatory capacity at least meets, and should exceed, the maximum achievable throughput of the site proposed to 
     be lost. Planning Obligation
•   In s ome cases, it may be necessary for 
developments that are proposing the loss of waste management facilities to secure appropriate 
 c
ompensatory capacity via a development’s legal 
agreement.
Justification
3.290 Policy W1 outlines that waste management in Newham must follow the principles of the circular economy. This concept reflects efforts to retain materials in use at their highest value for as long as possible. Materials are then re-used or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste. The benefits of such an approach include saving resources, increasing economic efficiency and lower carbon emissions. This strategic principle seeks to build flexibility into the assessment of waste management facilities to allow for changing circumstances and new technologies to be brought forward over the course of the plan period.
3.291 The policy also sets out Newham’s 
commitment to manage the apportioned tonnage of household, commercial and industrial waste target set for the borough within the London Plan (2021) (383,000 tonnes by 2021 and 407,000 tonnes by 2041). The forthcoming updated Joint East London Waste Plan will outline which waste sites within Newham are safeguarded to meet our apportionment target. Our latest evidence sets out that Newham has more than enough management capacity to meet our apportionment target. As such, as the preparation of the Joint East London Waste Plan commences, it is likely that some waste sites will be identified as suitable for release. These sites will be agreed upon collectively with the other east London boroughs, considering the future waste management needs of East London and London Plan (2021) policy SI9, which requires the proposed release of current waste sites to be part of a plan-led process. 
3.292 However, until agreement is reached with the 
other East London Boroughs, Newham will continue to safeguard existing waste sites within the borough that contribute to our apportionment target unless compensatory capacity can be made elsewhere within London. This will ensure the borough contributes to delivering net waste self-sufficiency for London by 2026.284
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESImplementation
W1.1 This sets the strategic principle for the assessment of developments 
that seek to manage waste within developments or develop waste 
management facilities in the borough. Achieving the principles of the circular economy will be a key component of decision-making. Developments referable to the Greater London Authority should demonstrate their adherence to circular economy principles though the submission of circular economy statements as per Policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021).
W1.2 Newham will deliver an updated Joint East London Waste Plan 
in collaboration with the east London Boroughs of Havering, Barking and Dagenham and Redbridge. This document will set out safeguarded sites within the borough that should be retained in waste management use. Until the adoption of the Joint East London Waste Plan, developments proposing the loss of a waste management site will be assessed in accordance with parts 3 and 4 of the policy.
W1.3 The adopted 2012 East London Waste Plan, which is due to be 
updated, safeguarded land in Beckton Riverside as a potentially available and suitable site for a future waste management facility. However, latest evidence of waste capacity suggests that east London has sufficient capacity from existing waste management sites to meet its London Plan (2021) apportionment target. Accordingly, the land at Beckton Riverside is not safeguarded within the Local Plan, noting that surplus waste management capacity is currently available in the borough.
The Evidence Base for the East London Joint Waste Plan (Anthesis, 
2021) sets out the waste sites identified in Newham as having capacity applicable to meeting Newham’s London Plan (2021) apportionment target and construction, demolition and excavation (CDE) waste needs.As progress is made on the drafting of the updated Joint East London Waste Plan, it is likely that some waste sites will be identified for release. These may be sites that have been vacant for several years or may be on site allocations and located outside of strategic industrial land. As such, the list of sites that will be safeguarded through the Evidence Base for the East London Joint Waste Plan will be updated as production of the updated Joint East London Waste Plan progresses.
W1.4 Maximum throughput should be calculated using the maximum throughput for the site over the last 5 years.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESJustification
3.293 Policy W2 seeks to ensure that new, 
replacement or intensified waste management facilities support the circular economy and reduce environmental and amenity impacts associated with their use. The policy seeks to incorporate flexibility into the assessment of new waste management uses, recognising the evolving nature of both waste management practices and national and regional policies that may result in a need for retrofit or the delivery of new waste management facilities in the borough. The criteria outlined within the policy will help to ensure that waste management facilities are located in sustainable locations, both in terms of amenity impacts and proximity to the sources of waste. Similarly, the policy seeks to reduce heavy goods vehicle movements where sites have the capability to support rail and water transport of waste, recognising that much of the borough’s industrial land is located next to the River Thames, the River Lea and the River Roding.
3.294 The policy also sets out requirements for waste 
management facilities to provide site management plans, to avoid amenity impacts associated with waste uses. While quality standards will be partly addressed through Environment Agency permits, the policy seeks to secure best practice through site layouts, facilities and regular maintenance checks. These requirements will help to ensure that facilities do not produce significant amounts of dust emissions or track mud or dirt onto the highway.Implementation
W2.1 Applicants should demonstrate how they meet the requirements of part 1 of the policy through an application’s supporting documents. In W2.1.a ‘safeguarded waste sites’ refer to those sites listed in Appendix 5 of the Evidence Base for the East London Joint Waste Plan (Anthesis, 2021) that have been identified as contributing to capacity applicable to either the London Plan (2021) apportionment target or Construction, Demolition and Excavation Waste capacity. ‘Existing waste sites’ refer to those sites where existing waste management facilities are operating, irrespective of whether they are safeguarded through the Evidence Base for the East London Joint Waste Plan.Further guidance on applying circular economy principles can be found in the following documents:•  Greater London Authority London Environment Strategy (2018)•  
 Gr
eater London Authority Circular Economy Statement Guidance (2022) (relevant to 
developments referable to the Mayor of London).
It is recognised in some instances that it may not be viable for existing waste management facilities to fully enclose their facilities. This may be the case where sites have temporary permissions to allow for the future redevelopment to other uses (for example, on site allocations). In these instances, applicants should demonstrate they have undertaken all feasible measures to limit noise and dust exposure to neighbouring uses through their site management plan.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESW3: Waste management in 
developments
1.  Ne w housing development should provide 
sufficient and accessible space to separate and 
store dry recyclables, organics and residual waste for collection, both within individual units and for the building as a whole. Waste storage facilities within housing developments should be designed to avoid any adverse amenity impacts. 
2.
  Major r
esidential development proposals should 
be accompanied by a Waste Management Plan that accords with the requirements of Newham’s most up-to-date Waste Management development guidelines.
3.
  Major housing de
velopments on site allocations 
should provide a well-managed re-use and circular economy room, where residents can leave items for other residents to collect and reuse and/or which residents can use as a space for tool sharing. 
4.
  De
velopments should provide only one waste 
management solution or technology on site.  5.
  Non-r
esidential developments should be 
designed to accord with the requirements of Newham’s most up-to-date Waste Management development guidelines. Applicants should identify the types of businesses intended for any units proposed on their site, and ensure that adequate storage capacity is provided for the likely quantity of waste generated. Waste and recycling stores for non-residential uses should be separated from residential waste and recycling stores.
6.  
 Major non-r
esidential developments should 
seek to provide waste management services as part of the service charges to businesses, with one contractor appointed for all business waste collections.
7.  
 Pr
ovision of waste storage and collection should 
be informed through early engagement with relevant London Borough of Newham service areas. Developments that propose alternative waste management technologies should be discussed at an early stage of design with the waste and recycling team. Justification
3.295 Policy W3 seeks to set quality standards for the design of waste and recycling stores in new developments. It is recognised that Newham’s recycling rates are noticeably below the East London Waste Authority’s target to achieve a minimum 28 per cent recycling rate for Local Authority Collected Waste by 2030
23. The quantity and high density nature 
of developments in Newham has historically made it challenging for the borough to meet its recycling targets. Accordingly, the policy sets best practice criteria for the delivery of waste storage facilities within new developments, providing convenient access and use for residents. 
3.296 This includes encouraging the delivery of ‘re-
use and circular economy rooms’ on site allocations, allowing residents to leave belongings they no longer require for other residents to use or functioning as a space for tool sharing. The policy also provides requirements for commercial developments, and allows for the delivery of innovative waste collection systems such as underground storage or automated vacuum collection systems where agreed with Newham’s Waste and Recycling team. 
23 East London Waste Authority Joint Strategy for East London’s Resources and Waste 2027 - 2057 (2022)290
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESW3.1 The amenity of future residents and neighbours should be considered 
when designing waste storage facilities for new developments, taking into consideration Newham’s Waste Management Guidelines for Architects and Property Developers.
W3.2 As a minimum, Waste Management Plans should set out:
•  
 Ho
w private residential units are designed to provide adequate 
internal storage, usually within the kitchen, for the segregation of recyclable materials from other waste. Design of private residential units should be future-proofed to allow for the potential future storage of food waste bins.
•  
 The pr
ovision of on-site composting facilities for use by residents 
and caretakers, including individual compost bins in private gardens and community composting sites in major developments. The management of this provision should be detailed.
•  
 Ho
w the waste will be delivered from private residential units to 
waste and recycling stores and the path from these to the vehicle, taking into consideration convenience for residents and the needs of people with disabilities. Residents should not have to walk further than 30m from their front door (excluding vertical distances travelled by stairs or in a lift) when carrying refuse and recycling. 
•  
 Ho
w the waste storage arrangement for the entire development 
or individual blocks provides satisfactory storage arrangements for domestic waste, recyclable material and the future ability to meet storage requirements for food waste collection. The size of waste and recycling stores should allow for a potential increase in waste generation and/or a change in council service provision per dwelling, including the future ability to meet storage requirements for food waste collection. A bin store’s size and layout should allow for reorganisation of bins when individual bins become full, and should allow for arrangement of bins side-to-side, to allow residents to access bins from the wide front edge.•   The l ocation of bin stores, ensuring they will not cause significant 
odour impacts and considering land gradients when accessing the store. Bin stores should be located a sufficient distance from bedrooms or other habitable rooms to avoid odour impacts to residents.
•  
 Ho
w collection distances from the presentation point to the collection 
vehicle accord with the requirements of Newham’s most up-to-date Waste Management development guidelines. For the transportation of bins to collection vehicles, the distance from the presentation point to where the collection vehicle can safely stop should be no more than 15m for bins of up to 240-litres, or 10m for larger containers.
•  
 Any pr
oposed separate collection point from the bin stores, and the 
method/timings for transferring waste to this location.
•  
 St
orage areas for special collections of bulky household items.
•  
 The mana
gement of re-use and circular economy rooms where these 
are provided.
•  
 F
or Underground Refuge Storage (URS) systems:
- 
 Det
ails of the maintenance of the URS system and surrounding 
areas/surfacing, including the marking of any URS systems that are not functioning properly
- The clearing of excess waste from URS systems- 
 Suit
able areas of hardstanding of a suitable size for a collection 
vehicle with its stabilising legs fully extended.
- The locking of all hatches to prevent misuse.
•  
 Ho
w vehicles will safely access from the public highway, arrive at 
collection points, and leave the site safely. Access and highway proposals are required to demonstrate how they respond to other significant planning constraints, such as landscaping, playspace, and public realm layout. Vehicle access arrangement should ensure they can accommodate the Council’s vehicle dimensions and be of a suitable road strength. Swept path analysis should be provided through an application’s supporting documents.Implementation291
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIES•   Det ails of management and maintenance of bin areas, and how 
information on storage area cleanliness will be distributed to residents. 
Signage within the bin store should be clear, displaying information on what items can be recycled in the recycling bins. Signage should follow Resource London guidance Making recycling work for people in flats: Toolkit for the Flats Recycling Package (2020) to allow for the convenient use of bin stores by residents.
•  
   The appr
oach to resident induction, that includes information on local 
organisations and businesses that will accept bulky and other items 
for reuse. 
The above guidelines should be read in conjunction with Newham’s most recently published waste management guidelines and Newham’s Waste and Recycling Collection Policy. 
W3.3 A reuse and circular economy room is a dedicated space for the practice of circular economy principles within a development. This can be a space for re-use between residents or which residents use for tool sharing. While the policy lists examples of room uses, other examples of appropriate uses can be proposed by applicants. However, this space should be separate from any internal communal amenity space or community facilities on site. Applicants should set out how such spaces will be managed within their Waste Management Plan.
W3.4 This requirement seeks to ensure that only one type of refuse vehicle should be needed to service a site. For example, if a development proposes an underground storage of waste, this should be only solution waste management solution across a development to allow for efficient servicing by a suitable collection vehicle.
W3.5 Further guidance on designing waste storage facilities for commercial 
and mixed-use developments can be found in Newham’s Waste Management Guidelines for Architects and Property Developers.W3.6 This requirement will help to minimise the environmental impacts 
of these developments, reducing vehicle movements and fuel consumption, minimising impacts on congestion, air quality and decreasing carbon emissions.
W3.7 Discussion of alternative waste management technologies with 
Newham’s waste and recycling team will help to ensure the development can provide vehicle collection capacity and well as interrogate the feasibility of providing such technologies.In addition to Newham’s most recently published waste management guidelines, Newham’s Waste and Recycling Collection Policy contains additional guidance on the management and maintenance of Underground Refuse Storage systems. This guidance should be adhered to when designing Underground Refuse Storage systems for new developments.  292

 b.
  Demonstr
ate that there is sufficient utility 
infrastructure capacity to meet the demand of development during the construction and operation phases. Where there is an identified deficit in utilities capacity to meet the needs of the development, proportionate contributions will be sought towards studies or upgrades where necessary. Developments likely to have a significant impact on utility infrastructure capacity, which may limit the delivery of key objectives in this Plan, may be refused or required to delay delivery until sufficient capacity is delivered to meet their needs.  
  
 c.

ate that the spatial, visual, amenity 
and environmental impacts of utilities infrastructure will be minimised and where feasible reduced, particularly where existing facilities are being expanded or reconfigured.
2.  
 Utilities infr

expansion) will need to align growth needs and support the creation of new neighbourhoods and economic opportunities. Utilities proposals must support the requirements set out in the Spatial Strategy and Neighbourhoods Policies. Projects set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) will be supported in principle. 
3.  
 Al

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN:  POLICIESPlanning Obligations
•   C ontributions to support future studies exploring 
sufficiency of utilities infrastructure capacity 
or utilities upgrades will be secured via the development’s legal agreement
Justification
3.297 This policy seeks to ensure that sufficient utilities infrastructure is provided to ensure new developments and neighbourhoods in Newham have access to power, heat, fresh water, sewage and digital connectivity. The successful delivery of high quality utilities infrastructure is critical to enable wider plan objectives to be met, particularly around the climate emergency and sustainability, delivering a modern economy and to meet the needs of development and growth in Newham.  As such the policy sets out an integrated, enabling and place-based approach to utilities planning, design and delivery. For digital infrastructure the policy aims to harness growth that builds on Newham’s good digital connectivity to homes and places of employment. 
3.298 In addition, the policy seeks to address the 
challenges created as new development starts to be delivered in close proximity to existing infrastructure facilities and networks. This requires the delivery of high quality sensitive design to better integrate utilities into the urban landscape as well as managing potential amenity and neighbourliness impacts.W4:1 Applicants must proactively engage with utilities providers at the pre-application stage to design-in suitable connections and future proofed solutions to ensure construction and occupation demands are supported by sufficient utilities capacity. Utilities sufficiency must be set out as part of the Infrastructure Sufficiency Statement as part of the application. This must set out expected demand, factoring in the cumulative impacts of growth in the area and the influence of climate change on future demands, and provide evidence there is sufficient capacity from utility providers to meet this need. 
Where required, developments which result in the need for off-site upgrades will be subject 
to conditions to ensure the occupation is aligned with the delivery of necessary infrastructure upgrades. Developments which place an unusually large demand on utilities provision, such as data centres on power networks, must demonstrate that meeting their requirements will not undermine the ability for future planned housing and employment development, required to meet targets set out in this Plan. If this cannot be demonstrated, such developments may be refused or conditions (with attention to phasing) may be applied to ensure sufficient capacity is provided in advance of their delivery. 
Proposals for new and expanded utilities are expected to make the most efficient use of space 
whilst addressing any potential environmental and amenity impacts e.g. noise, smells, vibration.  Proposals should demonstrate through an options appraisal that the favoured scheme is the most appropriate in terms of spatial and environmental impacts, costs and feasibility.
Applicants must use the Greater London Authority’s Infrastructure Mapping Tool, to assess 
infrastructure capacity, understand the existing utilities’ conditions and planned utilities infrastructure to identify future requirements and to support growth in London.  Development proposals should be prepared and reflect best practice guidance including those published by statutory consultees and utilities providers, including Environment Agency, National Grid, Thames Water and UKPN.
W4.4 Odour Impact Assessments will need to be submitted incorporating details of good scheme design and mitigation measures to address odour impacts from existing odorous uses in the vicinity. Mitigation which resolves potential conflicts may be necessary for development to proceed. Implementation295

Mitigation which resolves potential conflicts may be necessary for development to proceed. W4.4 Advice should be sought from Environmental Health at the pre-
application stage highlighting any key issues with proposals relating to odour. 
Proposals should have regard to the latest Institute of Air Quality 
Management Guidance on the assessment of odour for planning.
W4.5 Connections to decarbonised heat networks are an increasingly important driver for heat network deployment and objectives in the plan to transition to carbon free development. Proposals for new and extended networks will need to demonstrate that the energy source is a renewable source through the submission of an Energy Strategy. 
Proposals seeking connections should support zero carbon ambitions 
and be well-designed using innovative technologies e.g. ground source heat pumps. These should be designed, constructed and managed (including decarbonising the energy source) in accordance with the London Heat Network Manual II (May 2021). 
The London Heat Map (including proposals within Heat Network 
Priority Areas) should be used by applicants to identify opportunities 
to connect to existing or future planned energy networks. This should be undertaken in liaison with the Greater London Authority’s energy infrastructure team. 
Applicants should have regard to existing Heat Networks established 
within Stratford and the Royal Docks.
W4.7 The provision of high quality digital infrastructure and communications 
infrastructure is an essential component of modern neighbourhoods and the delivery of sustainable and inclusive growth in Newham. Proposals must improve digital connectivity and should focus on affordability, security, sufficiency of power and resilience to ensure provision of digital infrastructure meets the current and future needsW4.7 of Newham and London.  Further guidance on planning for digital 
infrastructure will be set out in the emerging Greater London Authority’s sub-regional Digital Strategy.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSNEIGHBOURHOODS  
Introduction
4.1 Newham’s spatial strategy is underpinned by the 
15-minute neighbourhood concept, through which every resident in Newham can live in an accessible and inclusive neighbourhood which provides their social, civic and economic essentials. The strategy is not intended to create isolated and self-sustaining areas but to support access to services and facilities for everybody. The 15-minute neighbourhoods therefore form part of a wider network of connected neighbourhoods, which give residents a choice in where they access different facilities and services, whether that is within their own neighbourhood or within the wider network. 
4.2 The Local Plan sub-divides the borough into 16 
distinct neighbourhoods, providing the ability to shape growth at a more local and detailed scale. These neighbourhoods have been identified through the Newham Characterisation Study (2022) and informed by public engagement which took place in autumn 2021. The proposed boundaries of the neighbourhoods were identified through an analysis of the different ways the borough can be sub-divided, including administrative boundaries, planning designations and character and function. The proposed boundaries were then shaped by public engagement and feedback from residents, businesses and local organisations on what they perceive to be their neighbourhood, what is important to them and what they like and don’t like. 
Implementation
4.3 The policies in this chapter set out how each neighbourhood will change up to 2038. The policies provide the vision, design and development principles for each neighbourhood, which will inform and guide development in each neighbourhood. Site allocation policies will inform and guide development on specific sites. The neighbourhood policies are to be read alongside the other policies in the Local Plan which set out the requirements for different uses. The neighbourhood policies and site allocations are strategic policies for the purposes of neighbourhood planning. 
4.4 The delivery of site allocations will be monitored 
in line with the phasing criteria set out in each of the site allocations.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN1 GALLIONS REACH
Neighbourhood profile
4.5 The Gallions Reach neighbourhood is located 
in south east of the borough and is in the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. It is bounded by the A13 to the north, the River Roding to the east and Royal Docks Road to the west. 
4.6 The north of the neighbourhood is occupied 
by large-scale infrastructure, including the Beckton Sewage Treatment Works which is the largest sewage treatment works in Europe. Gallions Reach Retail Park, with its extensive car parking, is located to the south of this infrastructure, along with the Strategic Industrial Location, the former Beckton Gas Works and the DLR depot. The industrial land plays an important role serving London’s industrial needs particularly for warehousing, due to its good links to the strategic road network. Housing is being developed around Gallions Reach DLR station, including the formation of a new Local Centre with local shops and facilities. Given its industrial character and current population, the neighbourhood has few community facilities, with PowerLeague playing pitches providing sports and leisure facilities for the neighbourhood.
4.7 The neighbourhood contains large areas of 
open land that attract birds and other wildlife, meaning it has various sites that are protected for their nature and biodiversity significance, including along the River Roding and the Beckton Creekside Nature Reserve. This open land in the north of the neighbourhood is also designated as Metropolitan 4.8 Open Land, but much of this has limited public access. The Barking Creek Barrier, located where the River Roding meets the River Thames, is a landmark along the riverside and provides flood protection. Beckton and Beckton Sewage Works Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.9 The neighbourhood has very limited access 
to public transport, with a moderate level of public transport access to the south west of the neighbourhood near Gallions Reach DLR station. The council, Greater London Authority, Transport for London, Homes England, St William, ABRDN, the Thamesmead Waterfront Joint Venture and the London Borough of Greenwich are proposing to extend the DLR through the neighbourhood and deliver a new DLR station. The DLR would continue to another new DRL station at Thamesmead in the London Borough of Greenwich. The neighbourhood has limited connectivity to the wider network of neighbourhoods, particularly to Beckton and Royal Albert North, and a poor quality network of pedestrian and cycling routes, with the Greenway ending before it reaches the neighbourhood.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSVision 
Gallions Reach will be transformed into a new 
neighbourhood through the delivery of an extended DLR line and new DLR station at N1.SA1 Beckton Riverside.  The new neighbourhood will include a large number of homes, new and intensified employment and industrial space and the creation of a new Town Centre, all delivered on the former Strategic Industrial Location. The neighbourhood’s riverside location will be optimised, through improved access and landscaping along both the River Thames and the River Roding. The neighbourhood will benefit from new green spaces and improved access to existing green spaces and nature. New development will benefit from new and improved public transport connections and a network of safe, green and accessible walking and cycling routes leading to destinations across the neighbourhood and to the wider network of neighbourhoods. A new Town Centre will be created, building on the existing retail offer and the neighbourhood will be supported by new community facilities and schools. 
The sewage works will be retained and any 
environmental impacts will be mitigated through appropriate buffering and design responses. The remaining industrial land will be intensified and continue to attract industrial, utilities, storage and distribution uses utilising the good accessibility to the strategic road network. The vision for Gallions Reach will be achieved through the extension of the DLR and the creation of a new DLR station to enable an uplift in housing density and the creation of a new Town Centre and by: 1.

Development principles
Residential development, industrial and employment uses, community and education uses, leisure uses, open space and town centre uses. 
The development of this site should occur only 
once the outcome of the Beckton to Thamesmead DLR extension project is known and must reflect the agreed outcome. 
Where no funding is secured for a new DLR station, 
development should meet the following principles: 
 - 
  
 No de
velopment should occur on the land 
safeguarded for the road crossing. 
 - 
  
 Empl
oyment uses should be primarily 
concentrated on the Strategic Industrial Locations and provide industrial floorspace for transport and utilities and warehousing and logistics. 
 - 
  
 Empl
oyment uses outside of the Strategic 
Industrial Locations should be for light industrial uses. 
 - 
  
 De
velopment should provide a new primary 
school and a secondary school.
 -  
 De
velopment should provide a health hub 
designed to meet NHS needs and standards. 
 -  
 The t
ype and quantity of town centre uses 
should be consistent with a District Centre designation. It should be located on a portion of the Gallions Reach Retail Park. The development of the new Town Centre must follow the requirements in Local Plan Policy HS1.2. 
 -  
 A r
etail and community facilities cluster 
consistent with a Neighbourhood Parade designation should be provided at a point between the new District Centre and Albert Basin Local Centre.
Where funding is secured for a new DLR station, development should meet the following principles: 
 -  
 De
velopment should occur in two phases, with 
the second phase only able to commence once the DLR construction contract is let. 
In the first phase:
 -  
 De
velopment activity should be concentrated 
in the south-east section of the site.
 -  
 Signific
ant development and redesign of 
Gallions Reach Retail Park should not occur and its ongoing function should be protected.
 -  
 Onc
e safeguarding has been released, 
development can occur on the land safeguarded for the road bridge in the south-east section of the site.
 -  
 Empl
oyment uses should be primarily 
concentrated on the Strategic Industrial Locations and provide industrial floorspace for transport and utilities and warehousing and logistics. 
 -  
 Empl
oyment uses outside of the Strategic 
Industrial Locations should be for light industrial uses. 
 -  
 De
velopment should provide a primary 
school and a secondary school. 
 -  
 De
velopment should provide a health hub 
designed to meet NHS needs and standards. 
 -  
 A r
etail and community facilities cluster 
consistent with a Neighbourhood Parade designation should be provided at a point between the new District Centre and Albert Basin Local Centre.
In the second phase:
 -
  De
velopment activity on the remainder of 
the site can commence.
 -
  A ne
w Town Centre should be delivered, 
consistent with a District Centre designation. There is an opportunity to provide the quantity and scale of uses consistent with a major centre subject to evidence of favourable market conditions at the time. It must be located in close proximity to the DLR station. The development of the new Town Centre must follow the requirements in HS1.2. 305
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN1.SA1 Beckton Riverside
In all of the above scenarios:
 -
  The t
ype and quantity of community 
facility floorspace should be informed by 
the borough’s Community Facility Needs Assessment (2022) evidence base and will be assessed in accordance with Local Plan policies CF1, CF2 and CF3.
 -
  De
velopment proposals should ensure 
that flood risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principlesWhere no funding is secured for a new DLR station, development should meet the following principles: 
 -
  Buil
ding heights should generally be between 
3 and 6 storeys, rising to between 7 and 10 storeys at the new Town Centre and the areas closest to Gallions Reach DLR station.
Where funding is secured for a new DLR station, development should meet the following principles: 
 -
  In the s
outh of the site building height 
should generally be between 3 to 8 storeys, rising up to 13 storeys in the areas closest to Gallions Reach DLR station.
 -
  In the nor
th of the site building heights 
should generally be between 6 and 8 storeys, rising to between 13 and 16 storeys at the new Town Centre and DLR station.
 -
  Design of the sit
e should ensure legibility and 
connectivity across the new rail line.
In all of the above scenarios:
 -
  The sit
e should be designed and developed 
comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2 reflecting the final outcome of the Beckton to Thamesmead DLR extension project.
 -
  A buff
er of employment uses should be 
provided between residential uses and the Strategic Industrial Location both within and adjacent to the Site Allocation.
 -
  The ne
w Town Centre should be designed to 
significantly increase accessibility by public transport and pedestrian and cycle routes in order to reduce car dependency and parking when travelling to the site. The Town Centre should provide active frontages and quality public realm, including a new public square.
 -
  The he
alth hub, leisure and larger community 
facilities should be located in the most accessible part of the site alongside other town centre uses.
 -
  Sma
ller community facilities can be located 
as part of the Neighbourhood Parade and in addition to the required retail provision.
 -
  The primary s
chool should be located to the 
southern part of the site, to the north of Atlantis Avenue. The secondary school and associated shared open space should be located to the north of the DLR depot on the site on the former Beckton gasworks and in close proximity to the new Town Centre and public transport (new DLR station or bus provision).
 -
  Open spa
ce for the secondary school 
can be split between the core school site requirements and hard outdoor PE provision, which should be provided on the school site, and soft outdoor PE provision which can be met in another part of the allocation but within a 10 minute walk of the school.
 -
  Bo
th the hard and soft outdoor PE provision 
should also be accessible by the wider community.
 -
  Additiona
l significant public open spaces 
should be provided at the northern boundary of the site and around the attenuation pond adjacent the Thames. These new public open spaces should have the scale, function and design of large Local Parks.
 -
  The l
ayout of the site should increase access 
to nature, including the Roding and Thames rivers and attenuation pond. 
 -
  The l
ayout of the site should enable the 
continuation of the Thames Path through the site.306
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN1.SA1 Beckton Riverside
Infrastructure requirements
If a new DLR route and station is to be provided on site, development should support its delivery.
Development should provide a new primary and 
secondary school of the scales required to meet projected need for school places alongside early years childcare provision, a leisure centre and a health hub designed to meet NHS needs and standards.
Development should address existing open space 
deficiency by providing new open space. The development should provide a local park to service nearby residential neighbourhoods.Land within the site safeguarded for the Thames Gateway Bridge should continue to be safeguarded unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of State.
Phasing and implementation 
Medium to long term.
Phasing of the site should reflect the development 
and design principles above and respond to the agreed transport provision.
 -   The l ayout of the site should include the 
extension of the Greenway into the site and should aid connectivity between the Greenway and the River Thames.
 -
  Rout
es through and to and from the site 
should improve access and connectivity to the new residential neighbourhoods at Gallions Reach, Gallions Reach DLR Station, along the edge of the River Thames and with existing residential neighbourhoods at Beckton. 
 -
  The design of the sit
e should also explore 
the feasibility of connections to National Cycling Route 13 that runs east-west through the docks. 
 -
  Design me
asures should minimise exposure 
to odour from Beckton Sewage 
 
 T
reatment Works. 
 - 
  Design me
asures should minimise exposure 
to poor air quality on Royal Docks Road. 
 - 
  La
yout of site should respond to the 
London City Airport noise contours across the site. 
 - 
  The design and l
ayout of the site should 
take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN2 NORTH WOOLWICH 
Neighbourhood profile
4.10 The North Woolwich neighbourhood is located 
in the south east of the borough and is in the Royal 
Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. It is bounded by Royal Albert Dock to the north and the River Thames to the south. Albert Road and two sets of train tracks which run east to west cut across the neighbourhood. The wall along the Crossrail tracks is a significant barrier in the neighbourhood with crossing points only at the far ends of the neighbourhood. 
4.11 The neighbourhood has a rich history built on its 
industrial past and is now home to mix of uses and 
facilities, with London City Airport in the north of the neighbourhood, housing to the south of the DLR tracks and heavy industrial and infrastructure uses to the south of Albert Road. The neighbourhood includes King George V Dock. The neighbourhood has limited green spaces, consisting mainly of small pocket parks and open space on housing estates. Royal Victoria Gardens, located in the east of the neighbourhood, provides the one significant open space in the neighbourhood and provides important natural habitats as well as views along the Thames, sports facilities and a children’s play area. 
4.12 A large portion of the neighbourhood south of 
Albert Road is designated as a Strategic Industrial 
Location and includes a number of industrial estates. This mixed industrial area is predominantly made up of older industrial stock providing cost efficient industrial space for a range of local businesses. It is home to the Tate and Lyle sugar factory and the Silvertown Bus Garage. The area of housing between the Tate and Lyle factory and the airport includes the former homes of Tate and Lyle factory workers. The neighbourhood’s heritage assets include the former North Woolwich station and the entrance to Woolwich pedestrian tunnel, which are listed buildings and the locally listed Royal Standard pub, the former police station and 2 – 34 Barge House Road. Woolwich Manor Way is identified as an Area of Townscape Value. The Royal Docks and Manor Park to North Woolwich Roman Road Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.13 The North Woolwich Local Centre is located 
around Pier Parade and Woodman Parade on Pier Road 
and provides a local retail offer. Albert Road shopping parade provides an additional local retail offer in the west of the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood has a small number of community facilities, with a higher density of community centres than the average for the borough. Facilities include the newly refurbished library and the Royal Docks Learning and Activity Centre. 
4.14 The neighbourhood has poor public transport 
access, with the highest public transport accessibility 
levels around the two DLR stations. The Woolwich ferry terminal and the entrance to the Woolwich pedestrian tunnel are located in the south of the neighbourhood. This area experiences high volume of HGV traffic and other main roads in the neighbourhood have narrow footways and carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise, poor air quality and a poor environment for walking and cycling.

Development principles
Mixed-use residential with industrial and employment uses, prioritising light industrial to complement adjacent Strategic Industrial Location to the west of the site, and open space.  
Community uses in the former railway station will 
be supported subject to heritage considerations. The type and scale of the community facility should be informed by the Newham Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) evidence base and Local Plan policies CF1 and CF2.
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment, as per Local Plan policy CE7. 
Design principles 
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan policy CE7 Policy BFN2. 
Up to 16 storeys will be acceptable on the west side 
of the site, stepping down to 5 storeys near the former North Woolwich station through the use of courtyard blocks. Development should provide public realm and greenspace enhancements to Pier Road including a pedestrian route, as well as enhanced greenspace on the northern former rail tracks. 
Development should improve pedestrian 
connectivity to North Woolwich Local Centre, King George V DLR station, and Royal Victoria Gardens.  The design and layout should provide two east to west routes across the north and south parts of the site, the north route being located within greenspace provision on the former rail tracks. There should also be a north to south route across the centre of the site to improve connectivity with the Woolwich Pedestrian Tunnel and Pier Road along the riverfront. The former North Woolwich station should also be accessible from the west side of the site. 
The design and layout of the site and industrial 
use should provide a buffer to adjacent Strategic Industrial Location. 
Development should be set back from Pier Road, 
as well as the former rail tracks to the north of the site, and the Store Road Pumping Station to the northwest. 
Design measures should ensure an air quality neutral 
approach and minimise exposure to poor air quality as per Policy CE6. The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.

Development principles
Comprehensive redevelopment to provide residential, retail, community floorspace in the form of a health centre, and provision of greenspace. 
The provision of the health centre should meet 
NHS needs and standards.
The type, quantity and location of town centre uses 
should be consistent with the North Woolwich Local Centre designation, as per Local Plan Policy HS2. The site should provide a medium-sized food store of 500-800 sqm fronting Rymill Street within the Local Centre. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles 
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
The building height can be 10 storeys fronting King 
George V DLR station, stepping down in scale to 3-4 storeys fronting the southeast of the site and 3-5 storeys fronting the southwest of the site. In the west of the site, development should follow the building line of the existing buildings to the west.The design and layout should provide an east to west route across the north of the site and a north to south route across the centre of the site. 
Greenspace provision should be located mostly 
toward the centre of the site, with a frontage to Rymill Street and King George V DLR Station. It should introduce street trees and improve the public realm fronting Rymill Street.
Ground-floor uses in the east of the site fronting 
Rymill Street and north east of the site should provide active frontages.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN3 ROYAL VICTORIA 
Neighbourhood profile
4.15 The Royal Victoria neighbourhood is located in 
the south west of the borough and is in the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. It is bounded by Royal Albert Dock to the north and the River Thames to the south. North Woolwich Road and Connaught Bridge and the DLR tracks, which run east to west, cut across the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood includes Royal Victoria Dock and Pontoon Dock and the northern end of the Thames Barrier. The Royal Victoria Dock Footbridge links the two sides of the dock as does the Connaught Bridge. 
4.16 The neighbourhood has a mix of uses and 
facilities, with the ExCeL exhibition centre and hotels in the north, City Hall and leisure facilities in the north east and housing and industrial uses to the south of Royal Victoria Dock. Part of this area is designated as a Strategic Industrial Location and includes the Tate and Lyle syrup factory. These are important employment locations which are all key to the economic future of the area, as is the new workspace around City Hall within the Silvertown Arches, Thameside West, Central Thameside West and St Mark’s Industrial Estate. 
4.17 The neighbourhood consists of a series of 
developments which each have their own identity but limited connectivity between them. This includes Britannia Village which was built in the 1990s in the form of low to medium density housing. Recent development such as Royal Wharf has started to create a new neighbourhood character, reflecting the change from a historically predominantly industrial neighbourhood into a mixed-use neighbourhood. Local shops and services are starting to emerge around Pontoon Dock, as part of new Silvertown Local Centre, and by West Silvertown station as part of future Lyle Park Neighbourhood Parade. 
4.18 Lyle Park, Royal Wharf Gardens and Thames 
Barrier Park are important open spaces in the neighbourhood and water-based activities take place around the north-eastern part of Victoria Dock. Royal Victoria has approximately 12 community facilities, including a small number of community centres, approximately three places of worship and cultural facilities including the Brick Lane Music Hall. The density of community centres and places of worship is lower than the borough average. The neighbourhood’s heritage assets include Silo D, Millennium Mills, the Silvertown War memorial, the Stothert and Pitt Cranes and Victorian era warehouse buildings such as Warehouse K. The Royal Docks and Fort Street Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.19 The neighbourhood has poor public transport 
access, with the highest public transport accessibility levels around neighbourhood’s DLR stations and the Elizabeth line at Custom House.  A new DLR station is set to open at Thameside West along with a new Local Centre. The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in poor connectivity, high levels of noise and poor air quality. Silvertown Way and North Woolwich Road are set to be transformed to create new public spaces, wider pavements, separated cycle lanes, better crossings and connections to make it easier to get around for pedestrians and cyclists or by public transport.

Royal Victoria will be transformed into a unique, 
cohesive and lively city neighbourhood and will benefit from a high level of growth, delivered through the transformation of key sites at N3.SA1 Silvertown Quays, N3.SA2 Lyle Park West, N3.SA3 Connaught Riverside and N3.SA4 Thameside West, which make the most of the water and that complete and knit the neighbourhood together. The neighbourhood’s industrial land will be intensified and will provide new jobs in a greener local economy.
The neighbourhood will continue to be home to 
a successful mix of uses including new housing, industrial and employment uses, visitor attractions and community facilities, as well as City Hall. It will benefit from public transport improvements, including a new DLR station and a new bridge to connect the two sides of the dock. New housing will be supported by a series of viable and vibrant Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades providing a local retail offer. 
The neighbourhood will have improved 
connections across the neighbourhood and will benefit from strong links to the wider network of neighbourhoods, particularly to Canning Town and Custom House. The dominance and severance of the neighbourhood’s road and transport infrastructure will be reduced through the transformation of North Woolwich Road and Silvertown Way and through a new and improved network of safe, green and N3: ROYAL VICTORIA

Millennium Mills and Silo D and their settings. 
The layout of the site should increase access to the 
water, improve the public realm on the dock edge and maintain the open character of the water. 
Development should establish a connected 
network of streets and spaces that connects to the wider street network and establish a street hierarchy. Routes through, and to and from, the site should improve access and connectivity across the dock, along the dock edge, to the DLR station and to Royal Wharf. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to 
poor air quality on North Woolwich Road and Connaught Bridge. 
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of the noise contours across the site from London City Airport. The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN4 ROYAL ALBERT NORTH 
Neighbourhood profile
4.20 The Royal Albert North neighbourhood is 
located in the south east of the borough and is in the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. It is bounded by Royal Albert Way to the north and Royal Albert Dock to the south. Connaught roundabout provides the western edge of the neighbourhood and the neighbourhood stretches across to south of Albert Island. The neighbourhood’s road infrastructure separates it from the surrounding area, particularly Beckton. 
4.21 The neighbourhood is home to a mix of 
uses including hotels, offices, the University of East London campus, new housing at Gallions Reach and marine-based industrial uses on Albert Island. A large proportion of offices are currently vacant. The neighbourhood has a small number of community facilities and is home to the London Regatta centre. The neighbourhood has a small number of heritage assets including Compressor House, the Central Buffet at Custom House, the Dock’s Manager’s Offices and Gallions Hotel which was built between 1881 and 1883 for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam 4.18 Navigation Company. The Royal Docks and Manor Park to North Woolwich Roman Road Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 4.22 The neighbourhood’s main roads and highway infrastructure dominate parts of the neighbourhood and carry high levels of traffic resulting in poor connectivity, high levels of noise and poor air quality. Although the neighbourhood has three DLR stations and is adjacent to Gallions Reach DLR station, it has poor public transport accessibility, with the highest public transport accessibility levels near Cyprus station and towards Gallions Reach.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSVision 
Royal Albert North will be a vibrant and cohesive 
neighbourhood, home to new high quality employment uses, higher-education campus and residential developments. The neighbourhood, and the University of East London in particular, will be successfully integrated into the wider network of neighbourhoods, with improved connections to neighbouring Town Centres and open spaces, particularly to Beckton. 
The neighbourhood will benefit from the 
transformation of N4.SA1 Royal Albert North and the completion of existing developments under construction. The neighbourhood’s high quality employment offer will be in the form of a mix of workspace, light industrial and modern heavy industrial uses. 
The isolated nature of the neighbourhood will be 
reduced and the dominance and severance of the neighbourhood’s roads and transport infrastructure at Connaught roundabout and Royal Albert Way will be reduced along with a new and improved network of safe, green and accessible walking and cycling routes, particularly to Beckton, Royal Victoria, North Woolwich and Gallions Reach and to the water. The vision for Royal Albert North will be achieved by: 1.

Development principles
Residential development, industrial and employment uses, community and education uses and open space. 
Employment uses should be for range of flexible 
office / workspaces uses suitable for small and medium-sized businesses and services, creative and cultural industries and high technology. 
Any existing community facilities within the 
site, including the gym and regatta centre, listed public house and London Design and Engineering University Technical College should be protected and assessed in accordance with Local Plan policies CF1 and CF2.
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
Building heights should not exceed 10 storeys, with heights stepping down to 4 storeys. Taller buildings should be located in proximity of Royal Albert Way and Connaught North highway infrastructure, with scope for a taller building adjacent the dock edge to the west of the Council offices. Outside of these locations heights should be between 4 and 6 storeys. To the eastern half of the site open spaces and employment uses should be focused along the dock edges and Dockside Road. To the western half of the site, employment uses can be positioned in proximity of existing non-residential uses and realigned highways infrastructure.
The location of residential uses should carefully 
consider the proximity of London City Airport, and its implications for amenity and heights. 
Development should conserve and enhance the 
listed buildings within and in proximity of the site and their settings. 
The layout of the site should protect the Site of 
Importance for Nature Conservation and increase access to nature and the surrounding waterways by providing a continual route along the river edge. 
Routes through and to and from the site should 
improve access and connectivity to Beckton Park, Silvertown Quays, along the dock edge and improve legibility across the site east-west and north-south.
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality on Royal Albert Way.
The layout of site should respond to the London 
City Airport noise contours across the site.The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.
Infrastructure requirements
Development should address existing open space deficiency by providing new open space. The development should provide a local park to service nearby residential neighbourhoods.
The realignment of Royal Albert Way and northern 
Connaught roundabout, through the removal of the flying roundabout to the north of Connaught Bridge and the creation of two new T junctions.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN5 CANNING TOWN AND CUSTOM HOUSE 
Neighbourhood profile
4.23 The Canning Town and Custom House 
neighbourhood is located in the west of the borough and is in the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. Barking Road, Newham Way and Silvertown Way cross across the neighbourhood. The Greenway runs to the north of the neighbourhood. 
4.24 The neighbourhood is predominantly 
residential with low density post-war residential housing to the north and south of Barking Road. Canning Town District Centre is located on Barking Road, complemented by the recent development at Hallsville Quarter. The Town Centre provides a mix of shops, food and drink and leisure uses along with the market and community facilities including the library. Canning Town and Custom House has many community facilities, including community centres, two libraries, a youth zone, galleries and a high number of places of worship. The Local Centre on Freemasons Road provides local shops and services. 
4.25 The neighbourhood has a number of localised 
industrial and mixed use employment areas which play an important role in supporting the 15-minute network of employment uses, alongside providing important premises and workspaces for local businesses and industries. 4.26 The neighbourhood has many green spaces including the East London cemetery, Memorial Recreation Garden, Star Park, Hermit Recreation Ground, Kier Hardie Recreation Ground, Malmesbury Road Park, Canning Town Recreation Ground, Cundy Park and the Bow Creek Ecology Park. Some of these green spaces also contain important natural habitats and biodiversity. However, the neighbourhood as a whole is deficient in sites important for nature and biodiversity. The neighbourhood’s heritage assets include the Royal Oak Public House, the former library, the Chapel of St George and Church of St Luke. The neighbourhood is also in the Canning Town/Newham Way, Thames Ironworks and Prince Regent Lane Archaeological Priority Areas. 
4.27 Public transport accessibility varies across the 
neighbourhood with the highest levels of public transport around Canning Town station which is a major transport interchange and the Town Centre. The poorest public transport accessibility is in the east of the neighbourhood, although Custom House now benefits from access to the Elizabeth line.  The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in poor connectivity, high levels of noise and poor air quality. Silvertown Way is set to be transformed to create new public spaces, wider pavements, separated cycle lane, better crossings and connections and to make it easier to get around for pedestrians and cyclists or by public transport.

Development principles
Residential development, industrial and employment uses, a Town Centre use and open space. The type and quantity of town centre uses should be consistent with a District Centre designation.
The industrial and employment floorspace should 
provide a range of employment spaces to support the growth of new economic sectors, within E(g) and B use classes. Development on the site should deliver the same quantity of business and industrial as existing. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
Building heights should not exceed 16 storeys, with 
taller buildings concentrated along Silvertown Way, stepping down to eight storeys to the southern part of the site fronting Silvertown Way. To the north-east of the site, heights should range between 8 and 6 storeys, stepping down in height adjacent lower rise developments adjacent the site to the north and east. The site should provide a Town Centre use as an active frontage along Silvertown Way, aligned with the site’s District Centre designation. The Town Centre use should provide an active ground floor frontage with quality public realm. If any community facility floorspace is proposed, the type and quantity of floorspace should be informed by the borough’s Community Facility Needs Assessment and will be assessed in accordance with community facilities Policy CF1.
The industrial and employment floorspace should 
be designed to be neighbourly to surrounding uses, including residential. These uses should be provided to the ground floor, to the rear of the Town Centre use.
Development should preserve or enhance the listed 
buildings in proximity of the site and their settings. 
Routes through and to and from the site should 
improve access and connectivity along Silvertown Way and Shirley Street, and to St Lukes church and Keir Hardie Recreation Ground.
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality and noise on Silvertown Way.
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.
Layout of site should respond to the London City

Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
Building heights should not exceed 19 storeys. On 
the Limmo peninsula building heights should range between 10 and 19 storeys, with taller buildings concentrated adjacent the railway line and open space. Above the bus station, development should range between 8 and 13 storeys.
The layout of the site should protect the Site 
of Importance for Nature Conservation and increase access to nature and the surrounding waterways. The layout of the site should enable the continuation of the Leaway riverside walk. The park and riverside walk should provide links to the Ecology park to the north-west and the river walk secured at Thameside West.Development should preserve or enhance the listed building in proximity of the site and its setting.
Site design and layout should take into 
consideration pylons, cables and power lines that cross the site to the east and north.
Routes through and to and from the site should 
improve access and connectivity to Canning Town station and District Centre, along the river edge as part of the Leaway river walk and connectivity to City Island, Thameside West and Brunel Street Works.
Design measures should minimise exposure to 
poor air quality on Silvertown Way and the Lower Lea Crossing.
The placement of buildings and open space should 
reduce noise canyoning effects to the railway line, adjacent Brunel Street Works. The layout of site should respond to the London City Airport noise contours across the site.
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.Infrastructure requirementsDevelopment should address existing open space deficiency by providing new open space. The development should provide a local park to service nearby residential neighbourhoods. Open space should be concentrated to the south of the site, with some open space also provided to the north opposite Canning Town Station.
The site contains an active bus station. If other 
uses are proposed to co-locate on the bus station site there will need to be careful consideration of how the site is developed so as to not interrupt the operational capacity of the station.

Development principles
Residential development, industrial and employment uses and open space.
Residential development should be delivered in the 
western half of the Local Mixed Use Area as part of employment-led development. Residential uses should also be delivered outside the Local Mixed Use Area to the southern half of the allocation. 
Employment uses should be concentrated within 
the part of the site designated as a Local Mixed Use Area (LMUA12 Bidder Street). The industrial and employment floorspace should provide light industrial workspace, as well as workspace for creative and cultural and digital and technology industries.
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Open space including a pedestrianised walk way 
should be provided along the River Lea.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
The layout of the site should enable the 
continuation of the Leaway Walk through the site.Heights should not exceed 15 storeys, with the tallest buildings to the south of the site, stepping down in height to four storeys to the north adjacent Bidder Street. Heights across the rest of the site should be broadly between 6-8 storeys. 
Employment uses should be positioned to buffer the 
neighbouring Strategic Industrial Location.
Open space provision should be largely concentrated 
along the river edge. 
Development should conserve and enhance the listed 
building in proximity of the site and its setting. 
Routes through and to and from the site should 
improve access and connectivity to Canning Town Station and District Centre, along the river frontage and onward connections to the Lea River Park and Bow Creek Ecology Park. Redevelopment of the site should secure design enhancements to the existing underpass under the A13 on Wharfside Road. 
Vehicular routes should allow for servicing of 
employment uses and make links to existing routes along Bidder Street.
Development should contribute to an improved 
pedestrian and cycling environment along Bidder Street. Design measures should minimise exposure to poor air quality and noise on the A13 and Bidder Street. 
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. 
Sustainable drainage should be considered from the 
outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.
Infrastructure requirements
Development should address existing open space deficiency by providing new open space and a walkway along the edge of the River Lea. Open space should also be provided to the east of Wharfside Road.
Phasing and implementation 
Medium term 
Redevelopment of the Local Mixed Use Area can only 
take place once the maximum achievable throughput of European Metals Recycling (EMR) waste site has been re-provided at Standard Industrial Estate. The maximum throughput of P M C Soil Solutions Ltd waste site also needs to be re-provided, either within the site boundary or elsewhere within London. The maximum achievable throughput of the existing waste sites need to be fully reprovided before redevelopment of the existing waste sites can take place, in accordance with London Plan (2021) Policy SI 9.360

The design and layout of the site should provide 
a welcoming gateway from the Crossrail Station with high quality public realm. Façades should be animated with active ground floors fronting and animating the street level, with spaces well-integrated into layouts to create a small square outside the station steps.
Development should conserve and enhance the 
listed buildings in proximity of the site and their settings.
Routes through and to and from the site should 
improve access and connectivity to Custom House Crossrail station, Cundy Park, along Freemasons Road and towards Canning Town station and District Centre via Custom House Phase 2. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality on Freemasons Road.
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.
Layout of site should respond to the London City 
Airport noise contours across the site.
Infrastructure requirements
Development should address existing open space deficiency by providing new open space. The multiple functions of William Patton Gardens, including the associated growing space should be re-provided as part of new open space on the site. New open space should be concentrated around Custom House Local Centre and in proximity of Cundy Park. Existing TPO trees to the north of the allocation should be protected.

Neighbourhood profile
4.28 The Manor Road neighbourhood is located in 
the west of the borough. It is bounded by the River 
Lea to the west and by train tracks and Manor Road to the east. The neighbourhood has strong links to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and is part of the wider Poplar Riverside Opportunity Area. The southern portion of the neighbourhood is in the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. 
4.29 The neighbourhood is industrial in character, 
with a mix of older and newer industrial estates, 
comprising of warehouses and yards for storage and distribution, heavy industry, transport infrastructure and waste and recycling processing, including a number of businesses that serve the needs of central London. Reflecting this, the majority of the neighbourhood is designated as a Strategic Industrial Location. Cody Dock also provides space for creative industries, alongside a community garden. 
4.30 Manor Road, Stephenson Street and Cody Road 
are the three main roads in the neighbourhood. The secondary roads form entrances to gated industrial estates which has produced a network of hard to navigate and impermeable streets. These roads carry heavy traffic, are in poor quality and provide a negative unpleasant environment for walking and cycling. 4.31 The neighbourhood has a small number of 
green spaces, including the West Ham Memorial Garden which is important for its heritage, nature and biodiversity. The west of the neighbourhood has on-street green infrastructure in the form of trees, verges and planting. The Canning Town/Newham Way Archaeological Priority Area is in the neighbourhood. 4.32 The neighbourhood has a varied public transport 
access, with the highest public transport closest to Star Lane DLR station. The lowest public transport access is to the west of the neighbourhood. The Leaway path runs along the west of the neighbourhood from Twelvetrees Crescent along the River Lea but currently stops at Cody Dock.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN7 THREE MILLS 
Neighbourhood profile
4.33 The Three Mills neighbourhood is located in 
the west of the neighbourhood. It is bounded by the High Street and the Greenway to the north, Manor Road to the east, Twelvetrees Crescent to the south and the River Lea to the west. River channels cut across the neighbourhood and define much of its character. The area’s green and water spaces are protected for their nature and biodiversity importance and this includes the River Lea, Three Mills Wall River Weir, the Prescott Channel, the Greenway and the green space surrounding the gasholders. Train tracks run east to west towards the south of the neighbourhood and cause severance across the north and south of the neighbourhood. The planning powers for part of the neighbourhood currently fall under the London Legacy Development Corporation.
4.34 The Three Mills neighbourhood has a mix of 
rich industrial heritage, industrial uses and housing. Its industrial heritage is closely connected to its location on the River Lea and the Three Mills is a former working mill. Three Mills Island is designated as a conservation area and is home to a number of listed buildings including the House Mill, the offices opposite the Clock Mill and the Clock Mill itself. Three Mills Island is now home to industrial and employment uses for creative and digital industries, including 3 Mills Studios and Three Mills Park. Other heritage assets in the neighbourhood include the Abbey Mills Pumping Station and associated buildings, the Sugar House Lane conservation area and the seven Bromley by Bow Gasholders. The Canning Town/Newham Way, River Lea and Stratford Langthorne Abbey Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.35 Housing is located in the north-west and west 
of the neighbourhood, with new communities being developed on Sugar House Island. The neighbourhood currently only has four community facilities and is deficient in all types of community facilities. 
4.36 The neighbourhood has varied public transport 
access with the highest levels of accessibility in the north and east of the neighbourhood towards Abbey Road and West Ham station.

Bromley by Bow Gasholder site should provide a range of light industrial workspace suitable for micro-businesses and small and medium enterprises. There is potential for floorspace to be tailored to specialist sectors including high tech media, low carbon and digital industries subject to robust market testing to demonstrate suitability. 
Development on the former Parcelforce depot site 
should deliver the same quantity of business and industrial floorspace as the permitted scheme. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment. Design principlesThe site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
Building heights should range from 3 to 30 storeys, 
with the greatest height accommodated in the east of the site stepping down towards the gasholders.  
The Twelvetrees Local Centre should be located on 
the former Parcelforce depot in proximity to West Ham station and provide ground floor active frontages. 
Development should conserve and enhance the 
Three Mills Conservation Area, the listed Gasholders and the listed buildings in proximity of the site and their settings. 
Development should recognise the role of the 
Gasholders as heritage and character assets and their potential contribution to place making, particularly gas holder 4 due to its enhanced listed. 
The design and layout of the site should minimise 
the impact on noise from the railway line and Pressure Reduction System on residential amenity.
The layout of the site should protect the Site of 
Importance for Nature Conservation and increase access to nature. The layout of the site should enable the continuation of the Leaway Walk through the site along Crows Road and through to N7.SA1 Abbey Mills. 
The design of the site should take into account the 
waterside setting and increase access to the waterways. 
Development should establish a connected 
network of streets and spaces that connect to the wider street network and should establish a street hierarchy. Routes through and to and from the site should improve access and connectivity to the West Ham station, N7.SA1 Abbey Mills, the Twelvetrees Local Centre and the Manor Road neighbourhood. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality on Manor Road. 
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8. 383

Development principles
Mixed-use development of residential, employment and industrial, retail and open space. 
Plot MU3 should be employment-led mixed-use 
development with residential. The employment and industrial floorspace should be suitable for modern light industrial uses, including for creative industries, and business and flexible workspace. 
The other development plots should deliver the 
same quantity of business, industrial and retail as the permitted scheme. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment. 
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2.
Development should conserve and enhance both 
the Sugar House Lane and Three Mills Conservation Area and the listed buildings in proximity of the site and their settings. 
Building heights on Plot MU3 should range between 
3 – 8 storeys. For the remainder of the site building heights should be in accordance with Local Plan Policy D4. The design and layout of the site should respond to the site’s environment and historic industrial legacy through canal and rive frontages, robust yet adaptable buildings, intricate yards and passages and weaving high-quality new buildings into the historic fabric. 
The design of the site should take into account 
the waterside setting and increase access to the waterways and improve the waterside environment of the River Lea, Waterworks river and Bow Back River. 
Development should establish a connected 
network of streets and spaces that connect into the wider street network and should establish a street hierarchy. Routes through and to and from the site should improve access and connectivity across the waterways and provide a new bus route through the site. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality on the High Street.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN8 STRATFORD AND MARYLAND 
Neighbourhood profile
4.37 Stratford and Maryland is the north west of the 
borough and is an important economic centre for East London. The neighbourhood is bounded by the A12 to the north, the River Lea to the west and the High Street and Greenway to the south. The planning powers for part of the neighbourhood currently fall under the London Legacy Development Corporation. Many railway tracks, the river, the A112 and the High Street cut across the neighbourhood. 
4.38 Stratford Metropolitan Centre is at the centre 
of the neighbourhood, with Westfield, the Stratford Centre and the Broadway providing a mix of shops, leisure facilities, a market, offices, education, food and drink and civic uses such as the courts. The London Plan (2021) identifies the Town Centre as having a potential to become an International Town Centre, recognising its potential to be a globally-renowned retail and leisure destination. Part of the Town Centre is a conservation area and contains a number of listed buildings including the Church of St John. Maryland Local Centre provides local shops and services and now benefits from connections via the Elizabeth line. The River Lea, London to Colchester Roman Road, Stratford Railworks and Stratford Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.39 Stratford and Maryland has the highest number 
of community facilities and, excluding galleries and places of worship, has the highest density of all types of community facilities in the borough. Facilities include the library and youth zone and approximately eight community centres, 23 public houses and 17 places of worship. The neighbourhood is also home to cultural facilities such as the Theatre Royal Stratford and the East Bank which will soon be home to education and cultural institutions, including University College London, University of the Arts’ College of Fashion, the BBC, Sadler’s Wells and the V and A.
4.40 The west of the neighbourhood is occupied 
by the Queen Elizabeth Park, the London stadium and the London Aquatics Centre. New residential and mixed-use neighbourhoods have been created, including East Village, Chobham Farm, Chobham Manor and International Quarter South. More established communities exist to the north of the High Street in the Carpenters Estate and in Maryland. However, due to the difference in scale, typologies and demographics of communities in the neighbourhood, as well as the location of major transport infrastructure and Westfield Shopping Centre, there is both a physical and perceived severance between these two parts of the neighbourhood. 
4.41 Stratford has seen significant investment in 
large offices and is home to international businesses and major companies making the most of the neighbourhood’s public transport connections, such as International Quarter South. There is also more localised office and businesses space in the east of the Town Centre as well as to the north of the centre which is home to a number of local employment locations supporting small businesses and workspaces. 
4.42 The majority of the neighbourhood has 
excellent public transport accessibility levels but severance is caused by the neighbourhood’s complex river, road network and transport infrastructure, particularly the railway line. Stratford station is Britain’s busiest station with an estimated 14 million passengers using the station in 2020/21 and needs upgrading to increase capacity and to reduce congestion in the station.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSVision 
Stratford and Maryland will be a safe, fair and lively 
neighbourhood with a mix of uses that recognise its unique and important role in both Newham and for London. The neighbourhood will continue to benefit from a high level of growth that will deliver new housing, including through the restoration and redevelopment of the Carpenters Estate, and large numbers of jobs as well as shops, leisure and community and cultural facilities for the neighbourhood’s residents, visitors and workers. This growth will be supported by significant improvements at Stratford station, resulting in increased station capacity and improved public transport access via the Elizabeth line at Maryland station. 
The distinct areas of the neighbourhood will be 
brought together into a place with strong sense of place and character and through safe, accessible and easy to navigate walking or cycling routes. These new connections will run east to west and north to south and bring together the new and existing communities. Severance caused by the neighbourhood’s road and transport infrastructure will be also be reduced through new and improved bridge connections at the station and Bridgewater Road, which will also improve access to the Queen Elizabeth Park and to the water. The character of the neighbourhood’s heritage assets will be conserved and enhanced, including through the use of locally important buildings as cultural and civic venues.

be consistent with a Metropolitan Town Centre designation. Any redevelopment should retain or re-provide Stratford Indoor Market. 
Development should reconfigure and consolidate 
the road infrastructure and parking infrastructure surrounding the Stratford Centre and provide a mix of residential, employment and industrial uses and town centre uses including retail and office. 
Employment and industrial uses should prioritise 
light industrial spaces suitable for small and medium enterprises, creative and cultural industries and digital and technology sectors. 
Development on the Morrison’s site should provide 
a consolidated supermarket, a health centre and residential. 
Community and leisure facilities will be assessed 
against Local Plan policies CF1, CF2 and CF3 and should be informed by the Newham Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022). Development proposals should ensure that flood risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2.
Building heights should range from 5 to 18 storeys 
and provide suitable transitions to the conservation area and heritage assets. Tall buildings should be located in the tall building zone. 
Any development of The Rex should retain 
its façade. 
The design and layout of sites should improve 
walking and cycling links to and through Stratford Station, Stratford Centre and the Cultural Quarter and provide new and improved public spaces and public realm. 
Development should conserve and enhance St 
John’s Conservation Area, St John’s Church and its other listed buildings as well as the University Conservation Area and listed buildings in proximity to the site. 
Design measures should ensure an air quality neutral 
approach and minimise exposure to poor air quality particularly on Stratford High Street, the Broadway, The Grove, Romford Road and Great Eastern Road. 
Sustainable drainage should be considered from 
the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8. The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7.
Infrastructure requirements
The redevelopment of the Morrison’s site should provide a minimum of 2500 sqm of floorspace for a health centre designed to meet NHS needs and standards. 
Development should address existing open space 
deficiency by providing open space and improved public realm across the site.

Development principles
Residential development, industrial and employment uses, community and town centre uses and open space. 
The type and quantity of town centre uses should 
be consistent with a Local Centre designation. Any provision of community facilities should meet the requirements of Local Plan Policies CF1 and CF2 and be informed by the Community Facility Needs Assessment evidence base.
Development outside of the land on Pudding Mill 
Lane should provide the same quantity of business and industrial floorspace as the permitted schemes. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2.
Building heights should be between 5 – 15 storeys.  The surrounding heritage assets should be 
conserved and enhanced.Development should establish a connected network of streets and spaces that connects to the wider street network and establish a street hierarchy. The Local Centre should be located adjacent to Pudding Mill Lane DLR station. Ground floor active frontages should be provided on a new central east to west street. The health centre should be located in the Local Centre. 
Design measures should ensure an air quality neutral 
approach and minimise exposure to poor air quality on High Street and A12. 
The design and layout of the site should take into 
account the waterside setting and increase access to the waterways. 
Sustainable drainage should be considered from 
the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8. The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7.
Consideration will need to be given to ensure 
development does not prejudice the operation of the safeguarded rail freight site to the west, particularly noise. Design measures should ensure appropriate transition between industrial and employment and residential uses. Infrastructure requirementsDevelopment should address existing open space deficiency by providing new open space. 
Development should provide 2000 sqm of health 
floorspace designed to meet NHS needs and standards. 
The utilities infrastructure should remain on 
the site. 
Bridges should be provided to create a new bus, 
walking and cycling connection from Stratford High Street to Marshgate Lane and a new pedestrian/cycle connection from Wrexham Road over the A12 and River Lea. 
Phasing and implementation 
Short to medium term. 
It is understood that the waste use at Barbers 
Road (the Barbers Road Facility) has ceased to operate. Any application to redevelop the waste site must provide evidence that the maximum throughput of the Barbers Road waste site has been re-provided elsewhere within London.

The residential character consists of low-rise homes constructed in the late 1980s within a network of short streets and cul-de-sacs. This forms a series of communities around Savage Gardens, Winsor Terrace and Tollgate Road and to the west of Stansfield Road. The north-east of the neighbourhood is characterised by out of town retail parks with car parking and large warehouses to the south of the Greenway. This industrial land is designated as a Strategic Industrial Location and provides a range of large modern industrial uses with good access to the Strategic Road Network. Existing industrial premises include food and drink production, print and manufacturing within modern industrial estates with valuable yard space that meets occupier needs.
4.53 The neighbourhood has a network of parks and 
open spaces including Beckton District Park, New Beckton Park, Beckton Corridor and King George V Park, including the former Newham City Farm. This network of open space will see investment and improvement through the Beckton Parks Masterplan. Many of these open spaces and Beckton Alps contain important natural habitats for biodiversity.
4.54 The neighbourhood has a limited number of 
heritage assets. The Second World War anti-aircraft emplacement in Beckton District Park is a Scheduled Monument, the pumping station is a locally listed building and there are a number of locally listed buildings on Winsor Terrace. The neighbourhood contains the Beckton WW2 Gun Emplacement, Canning Town/Newham Way, Woolwich Manor Way, Manor Park to North Woolwich Roman Road and Beckton Archaeological Priority Areas. 
4.55 The purpose built East Beckton District Town 
Centre is central in the neighbourhood and is Newham’s sixth largest Town Centre. The Centre provides a mix of convenience, comparison and leisure offer and consists of a supermarket, a small parade of shops, a hotel and car parking. Tollgate Road shopping parade provide a small number of shops in the west of the neighbourhood.  The neighbourhood has a number of community facilities, many in the District Centre, including places of worship, healthcare, gymnastics club and the youth zone and centre, the Beckton Globe library and others across the neighbourhood, including the West Ham United Foundation. 4.56 The neighbourhood has low public transport access, with the highest levels of public transport accessibility being in the south west of the neighbourhood and in the east by Beckton and Gallions Reach stations and Beckton bus station. The District Centre and the neighbourhood’s out of town retail parks are often visited by car. The large scale roads surrounding the neighbourhood are a barrier to pedestrians and cyclists in accessing surrounding neighbourhoods and further afield. These roads also carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise and poor air quality.

Beckton will continue to be a successful 
neighbourhood with a mix of housing, improved green spaces, shops and community facilities. The neighbourhood will be less car dependent and it will be easier to access the neighbourhood’s green spaces and the Town Centre by walking or cycling on safe, green and accessible routes. Growth in the neighbourhood will be delivered through incremental change that increases density and enhances the neighbourhood’s existing character and through the transformation of the District Town Centre to provide new housing alongside new shops and facilities. 
The neighbourhood’s retail parks and industrial 
uses will be more efficiently used with intensified industrial and employment uses. The severance of Newham Way, Royal Docks Road and Royal Albert Way and the neighbourhood’s industrial and retail parks will be reduced and connections to the Royal Docks will be improved.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN11.SA1 East Beckton Town Centre
Development principles
Reconfiguration of part of East Beckton District Centre to provide residential, town centre uses, community facilities and open space.
The type and quantity of town centre uses should 
be consistent with the East Beckton District Centre designation. Development should retain the overall quantity of retail floorspace in the form of small and medium units and a consolidated supermarket. Leisure and cultural uses should form part of the Town Centre offer and should support the development of a local evening and night-time economy. 
The re-provision of community facilities and the 
provision of cultural and leisure facilities should be informed by the Newham Community Facilities Needs Assessment (2022) evidence base and Local Plan policies CF1 and CF2.
Development should consolidate and reduce the 
amount of car parking. 
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2.Building heights should be between 4 and 11 storeys and be in accordance with the Tall Building Zone and Local Plan Policy D4. 
The design and layout of the site should support 
the reconfiguration of the Town Centre and its extensive car parking to a more compact format with improved walking, cycling links, and public realm. 
Development should provide ground-floor active 
frontages, particularly on Woolwich Manor Way and Tollgate Road. 
Development should establish a connected 
network of streets and spaces that connect to the wider street network and establish a street hierarchy. The design and layout of the site should enable an urban block structure and provide a central public square as well as improved walking and cycling links north to south and east to west and to Beckton Bus Station, DLR Beckton Station and Beckton Corridor. 
The surrounding heritage assets should be 
conserved and enhanced.
Design measures should ensure an air quality neutral 
approach and minimise exposure to poor air quality on Tollgate Road and Woolwich Manor Way. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8. The design and layout of the site should take account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7.
Infrastructure requirements
Development should re-provide existing community facilities and provide 2000 sqm of health floorspace, designed to meet NHS needs and standards. 
Development should address existing open space 
deficiency by providing a central public square and open space as well as new open space in proximity to Beckton Corridor and Beckton Bus Station. 
Phasing and implementation 
Medium to long term.
The phasing of the development should retain the 
functionality and vitality of the Town Centre and its retail offer. 454

Neighbourhood profile
4.62 The East Ham neighbourhood is located in the 
east of the borough. It is bounded by Woodgrange Park Cemetery and the railway line to the north and the North Circular Road to the east. The railway line that runs east to west and High Street North which runs north to south cut across the neighbourhood. Barking Road runs east to west in the south of the neighbourhood, intersecting with High Street North and High Street South. 
4.63 The neighbourhood is predominantly residential 
in character, consisting of terraced housing along gridded streets. East Ham is a Major Town Centre and is the third largest Town Centre in Newham. The Town Centre runs north to south along High Street North and eastwards from the junction with Barking Road. The Town Centre provides well known national chains along with a market and independent and specialised shops and food and drink offer. It also has a strong representation of financial and business services but there remains an extremely high number of betting shops and hot food takeaways. 
4.64 The neighbourhood has many listed buildings, 
with a concentration of listed buildings in the south of the neighbourhood on Barking Road and High Street South. These buildings are located in the East Ham Town Centre conservation area and include the Newham Town Hall and surrounding buildings. The East Ham, Manor Road to North Woolwich Roman Road, Newham Cemeteries and River Roding Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood. 
4.65 The neighbourhood also has a number of 
green spaces, including Central Park, Barking Road Recreation Ground, Plashet Park and Plashet Jewish Cemetery. Plashet Park and Central Park were awarded Green Flag awards in 2021. The green spaces on the eastern boundary of the neighbourhood are Metropolitan Open Land but not currently publicly accessible. Many of these green spaces are also important for their nature and biodiversity significance. 
4.66 High Street North provides a local retail offer 
as does Katherine Road. The neighbourhood has 43 community facilities, including a number of civic buildings, higher education facilities, community centres and places of worship. 
4.67 The neighbourhood has varied levels of public 
transport access, with the highest public transport accessibility levels around East Ham station, although improvements are needed to East Ham station to make it step-free. The east of the neighbourhood has poor public transport accessibility. The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise and poor air quality. However, there are plans to improve the public realm on High Street North, including improved space for pedestrians, increased street greening, improved access to the market and changes to bus services.

Development principles
Residential development with retail floorspace. 
A reduction in the quantity of retail floorspace will 
be supported provided that it does not impact the vitality and viability of the Town Centre, its functionality, meets the needs of future occupiers and the reduction will not compromise the functionality, accessibility and viability of the unit. 
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
Building heights should be between 5 and 6 storeys. 
Development to the rear of the High Street North should be set back from existing buildings. 
The design and layout of the site should enable 
appropriate servicing of the retail floorspace. 
Development should reinforce the existing street 
hierarchy by following the existing building line on High Street North. 
Development should provide a ground floor active 
frontage and improved public realm on High Street North and Pilgrims Way.Development should conserve and enhance the East Ham Town Centre Conservation Area and the listed buildings in proximity of the site and their settings. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality on Ron Leighton Road and High Street North. 
Sustainable drainage should be considered from 
the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8.

Development principles
Residential development, open space and community facility. 
Development should take place on the 1.6 hectares 
of developable land outside the Metropolitan Open Land. Development should protect the openness of the adjacent Metropolitan Open Land and maintain the site’s role in providing a continuous chain of open space along Newham’s eastern boundary.
The provision of community facilities should meet 
the requirements of Local Plan polices CF1 and CF2 and be informed by the Newham Community Facility Needs Assessment evidence base.
Development proposals should ensure that flood 
risk is minimised and mitigated informed by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.
Design principles
The site should be designed and developed comprehensively in accordance with Local Plan Policy BFN2. 
Building heights should be between 3 and 6 storeys.  
Development should step down in scale and massing to sensitively integrate with the existing two storey terraces on Leigh Road. Development should establish a connected network of streets and spaces and that connects into the existing street network. 
The community facility should be located where 
there are good connections to the existing street network and in proximity to the open space. 
Routes to and from and through the site should 
improve access and connectivity to the River Roding. 
Design measures should minimise exposure to poor 
air quality. 
The design and layout of the site should minimise 
the impact on noise from any required Pressure Reduction System on residential amenity.
The design and layout of the site should take 
account of risk of flooding from all sources and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE7. Sustainable drainage should be considered from the outset and meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy CE8. Infrastructure requirementsDevelopment should address existing open space deficiency by providing publically accessible open space, including on the Metropolitan Open Land. 
Development should retain the gas governor 
on site.  Phasing and implementationLong term 475
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN14 GREEN STREET 
Neighbourhood profile
4.68 The Green Street neighbourhood is one of 
the borough’s central neighbourhoods. The south of the neighbourhood is dissected by the railway line that runs east to west and the centre of the neighbourhood is dissected by Green Street north to south and by Plashet Road and Plashet Grove east to west. 
4.69 Green Street District Centre is at the heart 
of the neighbourhood. The Centre provides a specialised, local retail offer and Queen’s Market is a successful historic market which provides a distinctive and cultural mix of foods, textiles, clothing and other products catering to the needs of the local community. The neighbourhood has been associated with the textile retail and jewellery industry since the 1980s and the corner of Green Street and Plashet Grove is home to a cluster of specialist jewellery makers and traders. However public realm in the Town Centre, particularly at Queen’s Market, Upton Park Station and St Stephen’s parade, needs to be improved. The neighbourhood has the highest density of community facilities in the borough, with its offer including a number of community centres, the library and places of worship. 4.70 The neighbourhood is predominantly residential in character, consisting of terraced housing along streets laid out in a grid pattern. Priory Park is in the south east of the neighbourhood whilst the west of the neighbourhood is in close proximity to West Ham Park and Plashet Park. Priory Park also has important natural habitats and biodiversity. However, the neighbourhood as a whole is deficient in sites important for nature and biodiversity. Heritage assets in the neighbourhood include a number of listed buildings including the Church of St Anthony and monastery, the Red House and the Duke of Fife public house. The Green Street, Upton and Plashet Archaeological Priority Areas are in the neighbourhood.
4.71 The neighbourhood has moderate public 
transport access, serviced by Upton Park station. However, the accessibility of Upton Park station needs to be improved and better links are needed from the station to the wider neighbourhood. The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise and poor air quality. The environment for pedestrians and cyclists needs to be improved by the creation of new cycling infrastructure.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN15 FOREST GATE  
Neighbourhood profile
4.72 The Forest Gate neighbourhood is in the 
north of the borough. It is bordered by Wanstead 
Flats to the north and West Ham Park and Green Street to the south. Two train lines, Romford Road, Woodgrange Road and Upton Lane cut across the neighbourhood. West Ham cemetery and Forest Lane Park are in the north west of the neighbourhood and the Forest Gate Community Garden is located on Sprowston Road. 4.73 The neighbourhood is predominantly residential, with large amounts of terraced housing. The Woodgrange Estate Conservation Area is located around Hampton Road, Osborne Road, Claremont Road and Windsor Road and is characterised by double-fronted Victorian houses. The neighbourhood has a number of listed buildings. An Area of Townscape Value has been identified south of Forest Lane and west of Woodgrange Road. Parts of Serbert Road are also identified as an Area of Townscape Value. The neighbourhood is also in the Newham Cemeteries and London to Colchester Roman Road Archaeological Priority Areas.
4.74 The Forest Gate District Town Centre runs 
north to south on Woodgrange Road to Upton Lane and is also designated as a conservation area. The Town Centre is mostly made up of independent shops and businesses and has a limited evening offer. Woodgrange market operates on a weekly basis. The neighbourhood’s community facility offer includes places of worship alongside the Youth Zone, the Gate library and Durning Hall, which is due to be redeveloped alongside new housing. The neighbourhood has the third highest density of community facilities in the borough. 
4.75 The Nursery Lane Local Industrial Location is 
west of the Town Centre and is home to Hovis. Industrial and employment uses are also located in the neighbourhood’s railway arches.  
4.76 The neighbourhood has moderate public 
transport access with the highest public transport accessibility levels around Wanstead Park and Forest Gate stations. The neighbourhood is now serviced by the Elizabeth line, which will be connected through Central London and further west by the end of this year. Wanstead Park requires improvements to have step-free access. Public realm improvements have been made around the station but there are opportunities to improve the public realm to increase the amount of green infrastructure and to improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise and poor air quality. However, the Odessa Low Traffic Neighbourhood has been made permanent following a successful trial that saw a significant decrease in traffic volumes and a significant increase in cycling trips and improvements in air quality.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSN16 MANOR PARK AND LITTLE ILFORD 
Neighbourhood profile
4.77 The Manor Park and Little Ilford neighbourhood 
is in the north east of the borough. It is bordered by the London Borough of Redbridge to the north and east. The neighbourhood is dissected by two train lines; in the north of the neighbourhood the train line runs east to west and in the south of the neighbourhood the train line runs south east to west. Romford Road runs through the neighbourhood east to west and the north circular runs north to south along the eastern boundary of the neighbourhood. High Street North runs south from the junction at Romford Road. 
4.78 The neighbourhood has a clear identity, mainly 
formed of streets of terraced housing which are easy to navigate. There are also areas of post-war maisonettes and tower blocks in the east of the neighbourhood. Durham Road Conservation Area is in the west of the neighbourhood and the neighbourhood has a number of listed buildings. The streets to the north of Manor Park Cemetery are identified as an Area of Townscape Value, as are the buildings at the junction of High Street North and Romford Road. The neighbourhood is also in a number of Archaeological Priority Areas, including the Newham Cemeteries, Wanstead Flats, Manor Park to North Woolwich Roman Road, London to Colchester Roman Road, River Roding and Little Ilford.4.79 The neighbourhood has many green spaces, including the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium, Manor Park Cemetery and Crematorium, Woodgrange Park Cemetery, Little Ilford Park and Barrington Playing Fields. Many of these green spaces are important for biodiversity and nature and the City of London Cemetery is a designated historic park and garden. The Manor Park community garden is one of the newest community gardens in the borough and is located on Manor Park Road.  
4.80 The Manor Park Local Centre is located on 
Station Road to the south of Manor Park station. The Local Centre provides local independent shops and facilities. There are additional shops, local facilities and businesses on Romford Road and High Street North. Jack Cornwell Street Neighbourhood Parade and Church Road – Little Ilford Neighbourhood Parade are in the east and south of the neighbourhood and provide important local conveniences in a part of the borough which does not have easy access to other shopping facilities. The neighbourhood has approximately 36 community facilities, including the library, youth zone, community centres and places of worship. 
4.81 The neighbourhood has a number of local 
employment designations supporting a range of small scale local industrial functions, which are important to supporting access to jobs and workspaces within this location. 4.82 The neighbourhood has varied levels of public transport access, with the highest public transport accessibility levels around Manor Park station, which is now serviced by the Elizabeth line and Woodgrange Park. Woodgrange Park requires improvements to provide step-free access. Some parts of the neighbourhood, particularly to the north and east, have poor public transport accessibility. Public realm improvements have been made around the station but there are further opportunities to improve the public realm to increase the amount of green infrastructure and to improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, particularly at the junction of Station Road, Romford Road and High Street North. The main roads in the neighbourhood carry high levels of traffic resulting in high levels of noise and poor air quality.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: NEIGHBOURHOODSVision 
Manor Park and Little Ilford will evolve into a 
residential neighbourhood with an increasingly united and clear identity. This will occur through incremental change, with new development enhancing the existing character. The neighbourhood will benefit from improved public transport connections via the Elizabeth line. The Local Centre and its shopping and food and drink offer will be diversified to provide a variety of uses and its public realm will be improved through greening, wayfinding and better street furniture. Little Ilford will also benefit from improvements to its shops, community facilities and public realm. 
The neighbourhood will have a network of easy to 
use, safe, green and accessible walking and cycling routes which improve north-south connectivity and that provide access to the Local Centre, public transport and the River Roding and the neighbourhood’s network of green spaces and community facilities. Routes to the wider network of neighbourhoods and their green spaces, particularly Forest Gate, East Ham and Ilford, in neighbouring Redbridge, will also be improved. The level of traffic, noise and pollution on the neighbourhood’s main routes will be reduced and the junction at Romford Road with Station Road and High Street North will be pedestrian and cyclist friendly and have an improved public realm. The vision for Manor Park and Little Ilford will be achieved by: 1.

NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONSNEWHAM
LOCAL PLANGLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONS498
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONSActive cooling: Active cooling refers to the use 
of external devices to enhance heat transfer to cool a building. Examples of active cooling include air conditioning systems.
Affordable Housing: Social rent, London 
affordable rent, affordable rent and intermediate housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house prices. Affordable housing should include provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households or the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable provision. 
Affordable Housing Off site Provision: Securing 
the provision of required affordable housing on a site separate to and outside of the development site.
Affordable Housing Payment in Lieu: A payment 
taken through planning obligations in lieu of direct provision of affordable housing on or off site. It can be used to purchase street properties to be used as affordable housing, fund building new affordable housing, make improvements to existing stock, or to bring vacant properties back into use.
Affordable rent housing: Let by local authorities 
or private registered providers of social housing to households who are eligible for social rented housing. Affordable Rent is subject to rent controls that require a rent of no more than 80 per cent of the local market rent (including service charges, where applicable).
Agent of Change Principle: Denotes that it is 
the responsibility of any new development (i.e. the agent of change) seeking to locate to an area, to mitigate any adverse impacts from any existing uses. This is to ensure that occupants of the new development are protected from adverse impacts and existing uses are protected from complaint.  Similarly, any new development likely to generate adverse impacts (for example a music venue) would need under the principle, to put in place measures to mitigate impacts on any existing development close by.
Air Quality Neutral: An Air Quality Neutral 
development is one that meets, or improves upon, the air quality neutral benchmarks published in guidance from the Greater London Authority. The benchmarks set out the maximum allowable emissions of NOx and Particulate Matter based on the size and use class of the proposed development. Separate benchmarks are set out for emissions arising from the development and from transport associated with the development. Air Quality Neutral applies only to the completed development and does not include impacts arising from construction, which should be separately assessed in the Air Quality Assessment. 
Air Quality Positive: The Air Quality Positive 
approach maximises the benefits to local air quality in and around a development site or masterplan area and minimises exposure to existing sources of poor air quality. It requires planners, designers, architects and air quality experts to show what measures have been taken during the design stages to achieve the best possible outcomes for air quality. This approach goes beyond compliance with both the Air Quality Neutral benchmarks and the minimum requirements of an air quality assessment and sets out the measures taken to benefit local air quality and reduce exposure to poor air quality.All-through School: Schools that provide primary and secondary education from the age of 4 to 19.
Archaeological Priority Areas (APA): Defined 
area where, according to existing information, there is significant known archaeological interest or particular potential for new discoveries. These areas are technical in nature and defined by Historic England.

education from age 0 to 4, including nurseries, crèches, and day care. 
CIBSE TM59: CIBSE TM59 is a design 
methodology for assessing the overheating risk of homes – it is not designed to be an overheating prediction tool. A building which complies will have a lower risk of overheating, but it does not mean it will never overheat.
Circular economy: This concept reflects efforts 
to retain materials in use at their highest value for as long as possible. Materials are then re-used or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.

Dark kitchen: a commercial kitchen with on-
demand preparation of foods to be delivered off the premises via third party online delivery platforms. The use class falls under use class Sui Generis due to a number of features of the use, including the frequency of small-scale deliveries that would occur from the premises.
Dark shop: a warehouse type storage of food 
and drink, with on-demand delivery of goods sold via an online platform. Although some dark shops operate from a typical shop premise (and therefore integrate a shop front and goods stored on a shop floor, there is no customer interface on site.

Planning Policy Framework as ‘for retail purposes, a location that is well connected and up to 300 metres of the primary shopping area. For all other main town centre uses, a location within 300 metres of a Town Centre boundary. For office development, this includes locations outside the Town Centre but within 500 metres of a public transport interchange. In determining whether a site falls within the definition of Edge-of-Centre, account should be taken of local circumstances.’
Embodied Carbon: Embodied carbon refers to 
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacture, transport, construction, repair, maintenance, replacement and deconstruction of all building elements.
Energy assessment methodologies: 
Methodologies used to assess and compare the energy and environmental performance of buildings.

More accurate methodologies are now available, such as P assive House Planning 
Package  (PHPP).
Energy performance and construction quality assurance scheme: A quality assurance process that attests to the energy performance and construction quality of a particular development, by using an industry recognised standard. Examples of said quality assurance processes include the Passivhaus standard, the Building Energy Performance Improvement Toolkit (BEPIT), and the Association for Environment Conscious Building (AECB) standard.
Energy use intensity: Energy Use Intensity 
(EUI), or metered energy use, is the total energy needed to run a home over a year (per square metre). It is a measure of the total energy consumption of the building (kWh/m2/yr).

Green Belt: A designated area of open land 
around London (or other urban areas). The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence. 
Green corridors / Green links: Relatively 
continuous areas of open space leading through the built environment, which may link to each other and to the Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land. They often consist of rivers, railway embankments and cuttings, roadside verges, parks, playing fields and extensive areas of private gardens. They may allow animals and plants to be found further into the built-up area than would otherwise be the case and provide an extension to the habitats of the sites they join. Green corridors are more associated with creating ecological connections. Green links are associated with providing linear links between open space for the benefit of people. Green links can also be green corridors if designed with wildlife in mind. 
Green links: See Green corridor/Green linksGreen roofs/walls: Planting on roofs or walls to 
provide climate change, amenity, food growing and recreational benefits
Green space: All vegetated open space of public 
value (whether publicly or privately owned), including parks, woodlands, nature reserves, gardens, allotments, community gardens and playing pitches, which offer opportunities for sport and recreation, wildlife conservation and other benefits such as storing flood water, growing food and can provide an important visual amenity in the urban landscape.
Greenfield Run-Off: The rate of run-off that 
would occur from the site in its undeveloped and undisturbed stage.
Gypsies and Travellers: Persons of nomadic habit 
of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling showpeople or circus people travelling together as such. This definition has been taken from Planning Policy for Travellers Sites (DCLG, 2015) and is specifically for the purposes of planning policy. 500
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONSHeat Networks: A distribution system of 
insulated pipes that take heat from a central source and delivers is to a number of domestics or non-domestic buildings. 
Heat pump: A heat pump captures heat from 
outside and moves it into a building. It uses electricity to do this, but the heat energy delivered is much more than the electrical energy used to power the system. This heat energy is then used to heat the building. Common types of heat pumps include air source (transfers heat from the outside air) and ground source (transfers heat from the ground outside).
Heritage Asset: A building, monument, site, 
place, area or landscape positively identified as having a degree of significance as a component of the designated heritage assets (those buildings, monuments, structures, parks, etc. that are subject to national listing/scheduling, and those areas designated as Conservation Areas) and assets identified by the local planning authority during the process of decision-making or through the plan-making process (including local listing).

rent provided at a cost above social rent, but below market levels subject to the criteria in the Affordable Housing definition above. These can include shared equity (shared ownership and equity loans), First Homes, London Living Rent and other low-cost homes for sale and intermediate rent, but not affordable rented housing. Homes that do not meet the above definition of affordable housing, such as “low-cost market” housing, may not be considered, for planning purposes, as affordable housing.
Key Movement Corridor: These corridors refer 
to arterial streets that form strategic linear gateways and offer the shortest way between main centres of activity. Due to their particular characteristics and alongside improvements to the public realm, they make an important contribution to people’s perception of place by providing clear and identifiable linear connections where there is good to excellent access to sustainable modes of transportation (pedestrian, bicycle, bus, train); on-street parking controls (Residential Parking Zones and other on-street parking restrictions) and services as part of mixed, town centre uses.
kWh: A kilowatt hour (kWh) is a measure of 
energy use. Large Houses in Multiple Occupation: Shared houses occupied by between seven and ten unrelated individuals, as their only or main residence, who share basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom (sui generis).

PM10 and PM2.5: Particulate matter (PM) 
is everything in the air that is not a gas and therefore consists of a huge variety of chemical compounds and materials, some of which can be toxic. Due to the small size of many of the particles that form PM some of these toxins may enter the bloodstream and be transported around the body. Therefore, exposure to PM can result in serious impacts to health, especially in vulnerable groups.

buildings that is publicly accessible, including streets, squares, forecourts, parks and open spaces.
Public Realm Net Gain: The process by which 
development helps deliver a significant step change in the quantity, quality and management of Newham’s network of public realm that supports active travel and social interaction. The improvements can be delivered either directly on site or through contributions secured through legal agreements. Improvements can be:•  
 Qua
litative: enhancing the look, feel and utility 
of the existing public realm for the benefit of the wider local communities; and designing outdoor communal spaces that are otherwise a requirement of development (e.g. play space) as accessible to the wider public.

viability defined with a Legal agreement enabling the reassessment of development viability after permission has been granted, at an early, mid or late stage in the development process. These mechanisms address uncertainties in the application stage assessment of viability to enable the maximum level of affordable housing provision over the lifetime of a proposal. 
Safeguarded Wharf: A site that has been 
safeguarded for cargo handling uses such as intraport or transhipment movements and freight-related purposes by Safeguarding Directions. A site remains safeguarded unless and until the relevant Safeguarding Direction is formally removed or amended.School Streets: School Streets are interventions outside of schools to improve air quality, and encourage more families to make journeys to school on foot or by bike.
Secondary School: Schools that provide 
education from the age of 11 to 19.  
Shared Ownership: A form of shared equity 
under which the purchaser buys an initial share in a home from a housing provider, who retains the remainder and may charge a rent. The purchaser may buy additional shares (‘staircasing’), and this payment should be ‘recycled’ for more affordable housing. In most cases, a purchaser may buy the final share (‘staircase out’) and own the whole home.
Site of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC): Areas of land chosen to represent the best wildlife habitats in London and areas of land where people can experience nature close to where they live and work. Sites are classified into Sites of Metropolitan, Borough and Local Importance depending on their relative value. SINCs are not legally protected, but their value should be considered in any land use planning decision. SINCs are approved by the London Wildlife Sites Board. 
SME: Small and Medium EnterpriseSocial Rent Housing: Owned by local authorities 
and private registered providers (As defined in S80 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008), for which guideline target rents are determined through the national Rent Standard Guidance. 
Space heating demand: The space heating 
demand is the amount of heat energy needed to heat a home over a year and is expressed in kWh/m2/yr. Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)A site defined in the European Union’s Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), also known as the Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora to protect habitats and species.
Special Educational Needs and Disabilities 
(SEND) School: Schools that provide education solely for pupils with SEND
Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace 
(SANG):The purpose of SANG is to divert potential visitors away from Epping Forest SAC such that the likelihood of adverse effects on the ecological integrity of the European site is reduced. This is achieved through the provision of alternative opportunities for activity which are designed to accommodate recreational access and public use and provide alternatives to the European site.
Specialised/Specialist Housing: Housing which 
meets the specialised housing needs of groups such as (but not limited to) older people, people with learning disabilities or autism, looked after children, care leavers and homeless people.
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA): 
Framework for the consideration of flood risk when making planning decisions. The SFRA is a requirement of the National Planning Policy Framework and enables a sequential risk based approach to be applied to decision making at all levels of the planning. 
Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs): Defined 
and protected by the London Plan (2021) and are identified industrial areas of strategic importance with capacity to support industrial, logistics and related employment uses that support the functioning of London’s economy. 503
NEWHAM LOCAL PLAN: GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONSSustainable transport storage: An secure area 
that allows for parking of bicycles, including larger non-standard bikes (such as cargo bikes) and e-bikes,, electric scooters, buggies and mobility scooters – with charging points as relevant.
Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS): 
Sequence of water management practices and facilities designed to drain surface water in a manner that will provide a more sustainable approach than the conventional practice of routeing run-off through a pipe to a watercourse.
Town Centre: defined in the London Plan (2021) 
as ‘places in London that provide access to a range of commercial, cultural and civic activities, including shopping, leisure, employment, Evening and Night Time Economy, entertainment, culture, and social and community facilities. Town Centres are classified in the London Plan (2021) according to their existing role and function in light of characteristics such as scale, mix of uses, economic performance and accessibility.’ The scales set out by the London Plan (2021) are: •  
 Int
ernational Centre: London’s globally-
renowned retail and leisure destinations, providing a broad range of high-order comparison and specialist shopping, integrated into environments of the highest architectural quality and interspersed with internationally-recognised leisure, culture, heritage and tourism destinations. These centres have excellent levels of public transport accessibility.
•  
 Metr
opolitan Centre: serve wide catchments 
which can extend over several boroughs and into parts of the Wider South East. Typically they contain at least 100,000 m2 of retail, leisure and service floorspace with a significant proportion of high-order comparison goods relative to convenience goods. These centres generally have very good accessibility and significant employment, service and leisure functions. Many have important clusters of civic, public and historic buildings.•  
  Major C entre: typically found in inner and some 
parts of outer London with a borough-wide catchment. They generally contain over 50,000 m2 of retail, leisure and service floorspace with a relatively high proportion of comparison goods relative to convenience goods. They may also have significant employment, leisure, service and civic functions. 
•  
 Distric
t Centre: distributed more widely than 
Metropolitan and Major Centres, providing convenience goods and services, and social infrastructure for more local communities and accessible by public transport, walking and cycling. Typically, they contain 5,000–50,000 m2 of retail, leisure and service floorspace. Some District Centres have developed specialist shopping functions.
Town Centre Network: An interrelated network and hierarchy of high streets designated as Town Centres, Local Centres or Neighbourhood Parades.
Travelling Showpeople: Members of a group 
organised for the purposes of holding fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This includes such persons who on the grounds of their own or their family’s or dependants’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as defined above. This definition has been taken from Planning Policy for Travellers Sites (DCLG, 2015) and is specifically for the purposes of planning policy. 
Unit: a frontage, as defined in relation to street 
naming and numbering.
Urban Greening Factor: A land-use planning 
tool to help determine the amount of greening required in new developments.Urban greening: Urban greening describes the act of adding green infrastructure elements. Due to the morphology and density of the built environment in London, green roofs, street trees, and additional vegetation are the most appropriate elements of green infrastructure in Newham.
Urban heat island: The height of buildings and 
their arrangement means that while more heat is absorbed during the day, it takes longer to escape at night. The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day. The Urban Heat Island effect is noticeable during both the summer and winter months.
Utilities Infrastructure: relating to heat, power, 
digital connectivity and communications, water supply and wastewater removal for public use.  
Viability assessments: An assessment of the 
financial viability of a development to determine the maximum level of affordable housing and other policy requirements that an application can provide.
Waste Hierarchy: The waste hierarchy ranks 
waste management options according to what is best for the environment. It gives top priority to preventing waste in the first place. When waste is created, it gives priority to preparing it for re-use, then recycling, then recovery, and last of all disposal (e.g. landfill). 
Waste management facilities: Waste 
management sites (as defined in the glossary) or other waste management facilities that deal with the collection, recovery, treatment, transfer or disposal of waste. 
Waste management sites: Sites where the 
following activities take place:•  waste is used for energy recovery
•  
 the pr
oduction of solid recovered fuel, or it is high-quality refuse-derived fuel  meeting the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Refuse derived fuel definition as a minimum which is destined for energy recovery 
•  
 it is s
orted or bulked for re-use (including repair 
and re-manufacture) or for recycling (including anaerobic digestion) 
•  
 It is r
eused, or recycled (including anaerobic 
digestion).
Water neutrality: Total demand for water is the same after the new development was built, as it was before. This is achieved by retrofitting older homes and businesses with water efficiency devices, as well as building and development that uses little water.
Whole house approach: The concept of treating 
the whole house as a system when planning a retrofit and ensuring that any action taken does not preclude another action at a later date. It also means that actions which may affect other aspects of the dwelling’s performance are properly considered to ensure that they do not result in any unintended consequences.
Whole Life Carbon: Whole life carbon brings 
together embodied carbon, operational carbon, as well as any benefits associated with recovery, reuse, or recycle beyond the system boundary.
Zero carbon: Activity that causes no net release 
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
Zero emission: Activity that causes no release 
of air pollutants and carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.
Zero emission: Activity that causes no release 
of air pollutants and carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases
