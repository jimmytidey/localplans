3.1 Introduction
What is a spatial strategy?
3.1.1The spatial strategy is based on the strategic objectives and outlines the spatial
framework for the future development in Royal Greenwich up until 2028. It sets out the
Royal Borough's future plans for housing, employment, town centres, open spaces,
infrastructure and community. The spatial strategy also identifies locations for strategic
development,whichsetsoutinbroadtermsthemainlocationsforgrowth.

Housing
3.2.4RoyalGreenwichwillmakeasignificantcontributiontoLondon'shousingoverthe
plan period with the second largest housing target of all London Boroughs in the London
Plan 2011 (25,950 new dwellings between 2011/12 - 2020/21 and a further 2,595 per year
thereafterincludinganassumptionforsmallsites).
3.2.5The housing growth targets set out in Table 1 will primarily be met by providing
housing within the Opportunity Areas and Intensification Area as identified in the London
Plan as they have the greatest potential for development. Royal Greenwich's Opportunity
Areas are focused in the waterfront area and therefore much of the future housing will
occur along the riverside. The locations for strategic development are detailed in section
3.3.
3.2.6There will be a mix of housing sizes and types developed in Royal Greenwich,
includingfamilyhousingandapartmentsaswellasasignificantamountofaffordablehousing.
3.2.7The planned phasing of housing delivery, which is based on the findings of the
London-wideStrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment,issetoutinthetablebelow.
In line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (paragraph 47),
the Royal Borough will identify a five-year supply of deliverable housing based on these
targetswithanadditionalbufferof5-20%dependingontherecordofdelivery.Thefive-year
supply will be updated annually and published on the Royal Greenwich website as part of
theAuthorityMonitoringReport.

3.4 Contingencies
3.4.1The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Plans to have sufficient
flexibilitytorespondtorapidchange.Policieshavetobeflexibleenoughtoaccommodate
needs not anticipated in the Plan and to allow a rapid response to changes in economic
circumstances.
3.4.2This section identifies three 'what if' scenarios relating to aspects of the spatial
strategy with which there is some uncertainty. The key areas covered are the delivery of
housing in line with the London Plan, the creation of a projected 21,000 new jobs and the
deliveryofcriticalinfrastructuretosupportthelevelofgrowthanticipated.
What if the housing target of 25,950 is not delivered over a ten year
period as set out in the London Plan 2011?
Why would this not be achieved?
3.4.3Thereissomeconcernregardingtheabilitytodeliver25,950housesover10years.
Landhasbeenidentifiedforthislevelofgrowthandplanningpermissionisinplacetodeliver
over70%ofthistarget.However,giventhecurrenteconomicclimatethisnumberofhouses
may more realistically be met over a 15 year period. This was originally considered as an
alternativespatialstrategy,however,increasingthetimeperiodfordeliveryofthehousing
targetsto15yearswouldbeoutofgeneralconformitywiththeLondonPlanandtherefore
could not be included as an alternative strategy. Whilst the Royal Borough has the land
supply (capacity) to accommodate this level of housing growth, the current state of the
housing market has led to concernsthat the industrywill be unable to deliver this level of
development.
What are the likely implications should this occur?
3.4.4Thiswillresultinlessnewhousingbeingdeliveredwhichwillalsoreducethenumber
ofaffordableunitsprovided.
3.4.5A slower rate of growth will reduce the number of residents shopping locally,

3.4.6A slower rate of growth may reduce the demand for infrastructure which may
undermine the ability of the Royal Borough to secure commitment and funding for
infrastructure projects. A slower rate of housing growth could impact on the new
infrastructure delivered within Royal Greenwich, such as improved connections on the
waterfront,improvednorth-southlinksandnewrivercrossings.
38RoyalGreenwichLocalPlan:CoreStrategywithDetailedPolicies
3.4.7A slower growth rate would reduce the opportunities to attract more skilled
workers to live in Royal Greenwich and to work in local businesses, impacting on their
potentialgrowthandproductivity.
How will the Core Strategy adapt to these changing circumstances?
3.4.8As the issue of not achievingsufficient deliveryof housingto meet the targetsset
is not a land supply issue, the Royal Borough will seek to ensure that it is continuing to
create a climate that encourages development. This will include pursuing the delivery of
infrastructure and continuing to enhance Royal Greenwich to create the best possible
environmentfornewdevelopmentthatencouragesdevelopment.
What if the jobs target of 21,000 by 2028 is not delivered?
Why would this not be achieved?
3.4.9ThejobtargetssetoutintheCoreStrategymaynotbeachievedforanumberof
reasons. Increased competition from the established office location at Canary Wharf and
theproposalsatStratfordmayimpactonthelevelofofficedevelopmentthatcomesforward
atGreenwichPeninsula.Similarly,theanticipatedincreaseinretailfloorspaceinWoolwich
Town Centre may be impacted on by competition from other retail centres, such as the
new Westfield development at Stratford. Both of these situations could impact on the
numberofjobscreated. Inaddition,reducedpublicspendingovertheearlypartoftheplan
period is likely to impact on jobs locally where nearly 40% of employment is in the public
sector.
What are the likely implications should this occur?
3.4.10If the Royal Borough's job targets are not met, this will limit the employment
opportunitiesforlocalresidents.Therewouldbeanincreaseinthelevelsofworklessness,

meet the objectives outlined in section 2.3 of this document. The NPPF states that Local
Plansarethekeytodeliveringsustainabledevelopmentthatreflectsthevisionandaspirations

Development Management
3.5.2The development management process is a key mechanism for achieving many of
theobjectivesoftheCoreStrategy.Mostdevelopmentrequiresplanningpermission(other
than that allowed under 'permitted development rights') and the Royal Borough is the
statutorylocalplanningauthorityforRoyalGreenwich,withthepowertodetermineplanning
applications and enforce the implementation of policies and decisions. (Major applications
are also subject to the Mayor's powers of refusal or determination.) This provides an
opportunitytomanagetheformthatdevelopmenttakesinRoyalGreenwich,inrelationto

achieved through the protection and improvement of existing infrastructure and/or
establishingnewinfrastructurealongsidetheproposeddevelopment.
3.5.18The range of infrastructure required to support the level of housing and
employmentgrowth is the responsibilityof a wide range of private organisations,agencies
and government bodies. The Royal Borough will work with these partners to ensure that
thenecessaryinfrastructureisdelivered.
3.5.19In particular, the Royal Borough will work with TfL who are key to the delivery
of new transport infrastructure in Royal Greenwich. The Royal Borough will work with
TfL to investigate improvements to public transport in the waterfront corridor of the
Boroughandtoprovideapackageofrivercrossingsandtoimprovenorthtosouthlinks.

Greenwich Town Centre
 4.3.1Royal Greenwich's town centres such as
Woolwich, Eltham and Greenwich have multiple
functions. They not only provide for the retail
needs of residents, workers and visitors but are
hometomanyofRoyalGreenwich'sresidentsand
are places for leisure and culture, where people
can meet and socialise in a safe and high quality
environment. Towncentresarealsoimportantfor
the economy and provide local employment
opportunities. It is their multiplicity of roles that
make town centres so important for Royal
Greenwich. The Greenwich Strategy seeks to
ensurethatRoyalGreenwichhasvibranttowncentreswitharangeofshopsandservices.
STRATEGIC POLICIES
Policy TC1 Town Centres
Town centres are the preferred location for major retail, leisure, cultural, office and
other uses that attract and serve the public. The Royal Borough will support Royal
Greenwich's town centre hierarchy of major, district and local centres and its
neighbourhoodparades. Residentialdevelopmentintowncentresissupported.

4.3.2Policy TC1 promotes the regeneration and revitalisation of Royal Greenwich's
network of centres and neighbourhood parades and seeks to manage Royal Greenwich's

4.3.4The improvement of our town centres will provide residents with greater
opportunities to access jobs, entertainment, cultural attractions and community facilities,
therefore impacting positively on the quality of life in Royal Greenwich and can also assist

in creating a strong community identity. Development in town centres should be of very
high quality design to enhance the quality of each town centre as a retail and cultural
destination.

intensification of use that they provide can also act as a catalyst for regeneration. Tall

4.5.3The high level of growth will create increasing competition for land in Royal
Greenwich to use for housing, transport infrastructure and other types of developments.
Ouropenspacesarethereforeunderincreasingpressureandmustbeprotectedtoensure
thatresidentsandvisitorscontinuetobenefitfromthem. RoyalGreenwich'sopenspaces
are highly valued by residents and the open space network is one of the features that
115RoyalGreenwichLocalPlan:CoreStrategywithDetailedPolicies
residents like most about Royal Greenwich(20). The heritage value of Royal Greenwich's
open spaces should also be considered,including the various registered historic parks and
gardens.

"Sustainability measures, to meet challenges such as climate change and flooding, will have been
incorporated into new development and significant progress will have been made in assimilating
them into existing areas. These measures will have reduced waste, water and energy consumption
and zero carbon and low carbon developments will be the norm thus ensuring a cleaner, greener
Greenwich."

Policy E1 Carbon Emissions
CarbonemissionswillbereducedinaccordancewiththeMayor'senergyhierarchyby:
i. First, requiring all development to reduce demand for energy through its design
(BeLean);
134RoyalGreenwichLocalPlan:CoreStrategywithDetailedPolicies
ii. Second,requiringalldevelopments,withagrossfloorareagreaterthan500sqm,
or residential developments of five or more units, to connect to an existing
decentralisedenergynetwork. Wherethisisnotavailableasitewidedecentralised
energy network is required. Where it is demonstrated that a site wide
decentralised energy network is unfeasible and / or unviable, developments will
be required to provide sufficient infrastructure to enable a connection to a
decentralisedenergynetworkforimmediateorfutureuse(BeClean);
iii. Third, supporting the incorporation of renewable energy generation within
developmentproposals(BeGreen).
Allmajordevelopmentproposalswillrequireanenergyassessment.
Support
4.6.5In Royal Greenwich the main emitters of carbon dioxide are domestic activities,
which account for 39% of total emissions, and commercial and industrial activities, which
account for 36% of total emissions. Transport accounts for 25% of total carbon dioxide
emissions(22).
4.6.6The Royal Borough is committed to tackling climate change and reducing carbon
dioxide emissions. The Royal Borough's Climate Change Strategy aims to achieve this by
reducingdemandforenergy,increasingenergyefficiencyandpromotingtheuseofrenewable
energytechnologyinlinewiththeenergyhierarchy.Alldevelopmentshouldachievecarbon

4.6.7Royal Greenwich will experience significantlevels of developmentand population
growth over the plan period. Consequently there is the potential for carbon dioxide
emissionstorisesignificantly.Thelevelofnewdevelopmentandpopulationgrowththerefore
represents a key challenge and also an opportunity to ensure that a reduction of carbon
emissionsinRoyalGreenwichisachieved.
4.6.8Theenergyefficiencyofabuildingislargelydeterminedbyitsdesignandchoiceof
materials. The principles of sustainable design and construction should be applied at the
earliest design stages to reduce the energy demands of developments. The Greener
Greenwich Supplementary Planning Document will provide further guidance on how to
achievethis.
4.6.9ApriorityoftheRoyalBoroughistoreducerelianceonthenationalgridandmove

Royal Arsenal, Greenwich Peninsula and the Eltham Centre. Combined heat and power
systems use fuel more efficiently and increased use of this technology will reduce Royal

Section 4.1 requires that for domestic refurbishment the BREEAM "Excellent" rating is
required.

reduce dependence on private vehicles and encourage use of public transport, cycling and

4.7.10Community facilities play an important role in developing stronger and more
cohesive communities. They can provide a focal point for a community and can help to
encouragea sense of belonging.It is importantto ensure that the provisionof community
facilities continues to reflect the needs of a changing and increasingly diverse population,
and that these facilities are accessible to all. Development of community facilities within
Royal Greenwich will be required to demonstrate that they are for the local community
and meet their needs. They should also reflect the Royal Borough's delivery strategy, as
the pattern of providing these community facilities evolves in response to legislative and
organisationalchanges, changes in the needs of the community and changes in methods of
servicedelivery.
4.7.11Community facilities are those facilities used by the local community. These can
include:
