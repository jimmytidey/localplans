“Welcome to the Knowsley Local Plan Core Strategy. This Plan sets out the vision, 
objectives and policies which will guide deve lopment within Knowsley up to the year 
2028.  
Knowsley is a place with huge ambition to deliver significant and accelerated economic 
growth. This Local Plan Core Strategy is a key delivery mechanism for achieving 
Knowsley’s aspirations in facilitating growt h and investment through identifying sites for 
new development whilst ensuring that this new development is positively managed.  
This Plan will meet the needs and demands of existing business while attracting new 
economic investment to the borough in delive ring a stronger and more diverse local 
economy. It will deliver a wide range of new high quality housing, to rebalance the housing 
market in order to meet the needs and aspirations of both existing and new residents. It 
will facilitate the regeneration of existing town centres, business parks and residential 
areas, to ensure they are sust ainable, vibrant and welcoming.  
Knowsley has a number of unique environmental assets which the Plan will help to protect 
and enhance, including sites of biodiversity and ge ological value, together with buildings, 
structures and areas of historic importance. The Plan will deliver physical and community 
infrastructure to ensure that existing communities and new development are well served 
by a range of local amenities. It also  seeks to ensure that new development is well designed 
and embraces sustainability principles to improve health and wellbeing and reduce 
environmental risk and the impacts of climate change.  
Our Local Plan seeks to capitalise on the borough’s unrivalled lo cation and our assets 
whilst cementing its place within the Liverpool City Region. In particular, the Plan will 
deliver growth which matches the needs of the Liverpool City Region economic growth 
sectors and exploit Knowsley’s outstanding road, rail air an d sea transport connectivity 
whilst retaining 49% of gre enbelt land within the borough.  
This Plan has emerged from extensive public consultation and joint working with key 
stakeholders and neighbouring authorities and this Council remains deeply committed to 
working with our partners and the local community to transform our borough. Thank you 
to all of those who have been involved to date.  
I hope that everyone with an interest in Knowsley will work with the Council  to deliver the 
vision for much -need ed grow th set out in this Plan.”

 Introduction 
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 1 Introduction  
Page 3 1 Introduction  
1.1 Welcome to the Knowsley Local Plan: Core Strategy. This chapter explains the 
purpose of this document, its central role within the Local Plan and its relationship 
to other policy documents. The chapter also explains in broad terms h ow the Core 
Strategy has been prepared, and how the document is structured.  
What is the Local Plan: Core Strategy?  
1.2 The Knowsley Local Plan  will comprise several documents. The Core Strategy 
part of the Local Plan will set the strategic framework for the gr owth and 
development of Knowsley up to 2028 and beyond. It sets out how and where new 
development and regeneration should take place and will therefore promote, guide 
and manage the future development of the borough. The Core Strategy will also 
shape the i nvestment plans of the Council and other public, voluntary and private 
sector organisations.  
1.3 The Core Strategy will provide the strategic context for other planning policy 
documents, including other parts of the Local Plan (for which further detail is give n 
in paragraphs 1.9 to 1.13). The Core Strategy also includes site allocations for 
areas to be removed from the Green Belt to meet future development needs, 
referred to as ‘Sustainable Urban Extensions ’ and on which further details are set 
out in  Chapter 7 . 
What are we trying to achieve?  
1.4 The Strategy for Knowsley1 aims to make Knowsley ‘The Borough of Choice ’, 
with a susta inable and diverse population, living in successful suburban townships 
that provide a sense of place and community. The vision states that : 
‘By 2023, Knowsley will have:  
 Attractive, sustainable neighbourhoods with a wide choice of housing and 
excellent com munity facilities;  
 Vibrant and welcoming town centres;  
 Residents and local communities who are able to make positive lifestyle 
choices;  
 High quality employment areas which help to drive economic growth in the 
Liverpool City Region;  
 Narrowed the gap in depr ivation levels both between different parts of the 
borough and between Knowsley and elsewhere. ’

Page 4 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
1.5 This vision will be achieved through the actions of the Council and the wider 
Knowsley Partnership, linked to key outcomes. The Knowsley Local Plan will set 
out how the borough  will develop spatially in the short, medium and longer terms 
to deliver these aspirations.  
Planning Policy within Knowsley  
Changes to the Planning System  
1.6 The Knowsley Replacement Unitary Development Plan  (UDP) was adopted in 
20062. 
1.7 In June  2009, the Council ‘saved ’ most of the UDP policies under the transition to 
the revised system introduced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 
2004. Several policies were deleted at this point. Append ix C: Schedule of UDP 
Policies to be Replaced  identifies which of the UDP policies will lapse and which 
will continue to be ‘saved ’ when the Local Plan Core Strategy is adopted. In due 
course, all the UDP policies together with the UDP Proposals Map will be reviewed 
or replaced as new Local Plan documents are adopted – see paragraphs  1.9 to 
1.13 for further details.  
1.8 Further changes to the planning system have been mad e by government, through 
new legislation3, the National Planning Policy Framework4 and the associated 
Planning Practice Guidance5. This has resulted in the availability of new planning 
tools (e.g. Neighbourhood Plans, Community Infrastructure Levy), revise d 
terminology (e.g. Local Plan) and new requirements (e.g. Duty to Cooperate). The 
Council has reflected these changes in its approach to developing its Local Plan.  
1.9 Knowsley's Local Plan Core Strategy will be supported by other planning 
documents. The numb er and type of documents to be produced has been carefully 
considered by the Council, so that the Local Plan can be produced, adopted and 
reviewed in the most efficient and time -effective manner. The planning policy 
documents which either will or may be pr oduced are set out in  Figure 1.1: 
Planning Policy in Knowsley . There are (as at adoption in 2015 ) no proposals to 
prepare Neighbourhood Plans in Knowsley, and these would need to be led by 
local communities rather than the Council. The Council does not intend to 
implement a Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule in the short term

Strategy progresses.

Other Local Plan Documents  
1.10 The Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies  document will 
identify further proposed site allocations for new housing, employment and other 
developm ent. These are likely to be focussed within the current urban areas of 
Knowsley and will supplement the allocations for the Sustainable Urban 
Extensions set out in this Core Strategy. Where the Core Strategy identifies broad 
locations and distribution of d evelopment, the Site Allocations and Development 
Policies document will define individual development sites, by reference to the 
Local Plan Policies Map . This document will also contain further detailed policies 
that will be used to determine planning appl ications.  
1.11 The Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan6 (which was formally 
adopted in July 2013 ) has been prepared by Merseyside Environmental Advisory 
Service for Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral Councils 
and sets out the pla nning strategy for the sustainable management of waste 
across the sub region. It includes site allocations for waste management uses and 
is a constituent part of each district's Local Plan.  
1.12 The Local Plan Policies Map  will be maintained as a separate docum ent and will 
set out, on an Ordnance Survey map base, site allocations and land designations

covering the whole borough . The Policies Map will be updated as appropriate, 
further details are available in Appe ndix C: Schedule  of UDP Policies to be 
Replaced . 
1.13 As stated, these documents will progressively replace the policies and site 
allocations set out in the Knowsley Replacement Unitary Development Plan . 
Other Planning Policy Documents  
1.14 The Council is also prep aring various Supplementary Planning Documents  
(SPDs) to provide further detail where necessary on the policies set out in the 
Core Strategy and other parts of the Local Plan. SPDs can be area - or theme -
based. Several SPDs are already adopted; these will b e reviewed subsequent to 
the adoption of the Core Strategy. In addition, several new SPDs will be prepared.  
1.15 An additional type of planning policy document available for use is the 
Neighbourhood Plan . These plans must be community -led, and can provide 
addit ional planning policies for specific areas within the borough . 
1.16 The Council is also able to produce and adopt a Community Infrastructure Levy 
Charging Schedule . The purpose of such a document is to set out a standard 
tariff to be paid by developers to the C ouncil and where appropriate, its partners, 
to support the provision of supporting and strategic infrastructure. Although the 
Council decided in 2014 not to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy in the 
short term , this decision will be kept under revie w having regard to relevant 
evidence.  
Planning Process Documents  
1.17 A Monitoring Report  (Authority’s  Monitoring Report or AMR) is published by the 
Council in December each year to assess progress in addressing the key 
economic, social and environmental issues  facing Knowsley, as well as the 
performance and effectiveness of adopted planning policies. This will utilise the 
policy delivery mechanisms set out in Appendix D  of this Core Strategy and the 
Local Plan Monitorin g Framework as a basis for assessing performance. Further 
details of the role of the Monitoring Report are provided in paragraph 1.45 below . 
1.18 The Statement of Community Involvement7 sets out the Council's stan dards for 
public and stakeholder engagement in preparing new planning policies, and 
determining planning applications.  
1.19 The Local Development Scheme  sets out further information on the range of 
planning policy documents to be produced by the Council, includ ing timetables for

on the Council 's website8. 
1.20 A number of evidence base studies  and technical reports  have been completed 
to inform Knowsley's Local Plan. These are referred t o and relied upon throughout 
this Core Strategy document, and a comprehensive list of relevant publications 
and studies which make up the evidence base is avail able on the Council's 
website9. 
Preparing the Core Strategy  
Sustainability Appraisal  
1.21 National le gislation and policy requires the Council to promote sustainable 
development. This means promoting:  
 Social progress which meets the needs of everyone;  
 Effective protection of the environment;  
 Prudent use of natural resources; and  
 High levels of economic g rowth and employment.  
1.22 The Core Strategy has undergone a process of Sustainability Appraisal  as it has 
been prepared. This has identified the economic, social and environmental 
impacts of the strategy and has been used to ensure that changes are made to the  
strategy to maximise the contribution to sustainable development. Under 
European and related UK law10, the Sustainability Appraisal has incorporated a 
Strategic Environmental Assessment which has assessed and suggested 
mitigation for the effects of the pla n on the environment. Reports of the 
Sustainability Appraisal process have been published at each formal stage of plan 
production.  
Additional Assessments  
1.23 European law11 also requires the Core Strategy to undergo a Habitats 
Regulations Assessment  (HRA) as it  is being prepared, in order to assess the 
impacts of the strategy on habitats, and in pa rticular on ‘European Sites ’12. 
Although Knowsley does not contain any European Sites, there are several in

Species and Habitats Regulations 2010. SPA and SAC sites are often grouped together under the 
term Natura 2000 sites .

surrounding districts (e.g. the Mersey Estuary and Sefton Co ast) which could be 
affected by Core Strategy policies. A Habitats Regulations Assessment report has 
been published at the different stages of plan production.  
1.24 The Council has also prepared a Health Impact Assessment  (HIA) to address 
any impacts that the p lan may have on the health of the local population, and an 
Equality and Diversity Impact Assessment  (EqIA), which has assessed the 
impacts of the Core Strategy on different population groups.  
1.25 All Sustainability Appraisal, Habitats Regulation Assessment, He alth Impact 
Assessment and Equality Impact Assessment Reports have been publis hed on the 
Council's website13. 
Policy Context  
1.26 A range of past, existing and emerging policy documents have had a major 
influence on the development of the Knowsley Core Strategy.  In some cases, 
these have provided a statutory framework to which Core Strategy policies must 
adhere. The policy context has been subject to major change as the Core Strategy 
has been prepared. The existing context is illustrated in  Figure 1.2.

National Policy

aims to promote sustainable development and growth while making the planni ng

Chapter 1 Introduction  
Page 9 system less complex and more accessible. The Core Strategy strongly reflects the 
principles of the NPPF, complies with the policy guidance within it, and also 
adheres to its guidance on plan -making.  
1.28 Before the publication of the NPPF, a large number of national Planning Policy 
Statements (PPS) and Planning Policy Guidance Notes  (PPG) set the context 
for much of the preparation of the Core Strategy. Although most have been 
replaced by the NPPF, a small number of policy and guidance documents remain 
in pla ce, mainly relating to waste and minerals planning14. 
1.29 Planning Practice Guidance  was published in March 2014 as a web based 
resource to assist the implementation of the NPPF . The preparation of the Core 
Strategy has taken account of the specific requirement s relating to plan making.  
Regional Policy  
1.30 Knowsley is located within the North West region of England. From September 
2008 until May 2013, regional planning policy for this area was provided by the 
North West Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS)15. The RSS set the statutory 
framework for development and investment in the region, setting targets for the 
scale of housing and economic growth to be achieved in each district. The RSS 
has therefore set the context for much of the work in preparing Knowsley's Core 
Strategy.  
1.31 However, through the Localism Act 2011, the Government made legislative 
provision for the abolition of this regional planning tier. In advance of this abolition, 
work towards a replacement Regional Strategy for the North West (known as 
RS2010) was ca ncelled. The evidence base and early work on  this project was 
published as ‘Future Northwest ’, which set out agreed shared priorities for the 
region, albeit in a non -statutory form. The implications of the abolition of the RSS 
are documented in the support ing Technical Reports for the Core Strategy. The 
North West Regional Spatial Strategy was formally revoked in May 2013.  
Sub-regional Policy  
1.32 Knowsley is located at the heart of the Liverpool City Region, sometimes referred 
to as Greater Merseyside. The City  Region comprises the local authorities of 
Halton, Liverpool, St. Helens , Sefton and Wirral, alongside Knowsley. The strong 
working relationships which operate across the City Region were formalised in 
2009 by the formation of the Liverpool City Region Cab inet. These relationships 
were also consolidated by the creation of the Liverpool City Region Local 
Enterprise Partnership (LEP) in 2011 , and by the formation of the Liverpool City 
Region Combined Authority in 2014 . There are also close working relationshi ps

between Knowsley and other neighbouring and nearby districts including West 
Lancashire, Warrington and Cheshire West and Chester.  
1.33 Various policy documents have been produced at this sub -regional level, which 
have influenced the development of the Core S trategy:  
 The Merseyside Local Transport Plan 316 provides a long -term strategy and 
delivery programme of transport investment and service improvements. It aims to 
give Merseyside a safer, sustainable, efficient and integrated transport network, 
accessible t o all. The Plan is operational from 2011 until 2024.  
 Neighbouring authorities  within the Liverpool City Region are also in the process 
of producing their own planning policies. Clear efforts have been made to ensure 
that plans are complementary across the City R egion, including through shared 
commissioning of evidence and various methods of joint working. Further details of 
how the Council has cooperated with neighbouring authorities and other key 
partners are available within supporting documents for the C ore Strategy.  
 Other plans and strategies  which jointly affect the Liverpool City Region area 
include: Atlantic Gateway, Liverpool Airport Master Plan and the Liverpool City 
Region Ecological Framework. Further details regarding these plans and 
strategies a re available in the Technical Reports for the Core Strategy.  
Local Policy  
1.34 The key local policy document is the Strategy for Knowsley: The Borough of 
Choice  (see paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5). This is highly influential for the Local Plan, 
which seeks to deliver many of the aims and objectives set out in the strategy.  
1.35 Many other important plans and strategies are also produced by Kn owsley Council 
and its partners : 
 The Knowsle y Housing Strategy17 sets out the strategic priorities for housing 
within the borough  from 2011 to 2014. The strategy focuses on three objectives, 
around provision of high quality new housing, improvements to existing housing 
and connecting people to Knowsl ey's housing offer. An update to the Housing 
Strategy is under preparation for 2015 onwards.  
 The Knowsley Economic Regeneration Strategy18 outlines the economic 
objectives and action plan for the development of Knowsley between 2012 and 
2015. This includes the achievement of key goals relating to promoting sustainable 
business growth, establishing the borough  as a location of choice, and 
empowering residents to achieve their economic potential.

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 1 Introduction  
Page 11  The Knowsley Corporate Plan19 sets out the Council's key prioriti es for the 
period 2012 –2015, focusi ng on delivering ‘ the Borough of Choice ’. The Plan 
includes six key pledges which the Council and its partners will seek to deliver, 
relating to education, employment, skills, housing, business, and advice for 
residents.  
 Other plans and strategies  which relate  to green spaces, climate change, health 
and well -being, amongst other  themes . Further details regarding the roles of these 
influential documents in the development of the Core Strategy are available in 
Technical Repo rts which support this Core Strategy.  
1.36 In addition, and as previously noted, the Council already has a range of adopted 
planning documents, including SPDs, saved UDP policies and the Merseyside and 
Halton Joint Waste Local Plan. Reflecting ongoing or recent ly emerging planning 
priorities, these documents have also been influential in relation to the 
development of the Core Strategy.  
Consultation on the Core Strategy  
1.37 The Council has sought to involve everyone who has an interest in the future of 
Knowsley in p reparing the Core Strategy, using innovative and wide -ranging 
consultation methods. This includes local residents, businesses, partner 
organisations and other stakeholders, including statutory agencies and 
neighbouring local authorities. Consultation has b een undertaken through several 
key stages, in compliance with the relevant regulations at the time of the 
consultation period in question, and in compliance with the Council's adopted 
Statement of Community Involvement. These include the stages known as Is sues 
and Options (November 2009 –January 2010),  Preferred Options (June 2011 –
September 2011) and Proposed Submission Version (Autumn 2012). Additional 
consultation was undertaken on modifications to the Core Strategy during its 
Examination in Public in 2014  and 2015 . The content of consultation documents, 
as well as summaries of main findings of the consultation periods and how they 
have influenced the Core Strategy are available on the Council's website20.

Duty to Cooperate  
1.38 In preparing the Core Strategy, th e Council has demonstrated compliance with the 
‘Duty to Cooperate ’, as introduced by the Localism Act 2011 and the NPPF21.The 
Council has set this out in detail in its Duty to Cooperate Statement22. Activities 
undertaken include:  
 Consultation with key bodies : the Council has engaged and cooperated with the 
prescribed organisations and authorities, as set out in the legislation and 
regulations, and in compliance with its adopted Statement of Community 
Involvement;  
 Collaboration and cooperation in plan making: the Council continues to work jointly 
with partners to develop a comprehensive evidence base which addresses key 
planning issues across the sub -region, alongside joint work on the Joint Waste 
Local Plan; and  
 Consideration of cross -boundary impacts: The Cou ncil has engaged proactively 
with neighbouring authorities in considering and addressing strategic and site -
specific cross -boundary impacts arising from both Knowsley's plans, and the plans 
of our neighbours.  
Structure of the Core Strategy  
1.39 The Core Strateg y is broken down into distinct sections, as described below.  
Introduction  
1.40 This section describes Knowsley at the time of Core Strategy preparation, and 
highlights key issues and opportunities the Council is seeking to address through 
its Local Plan policie s. 
Vision and Strategy  
1.41 This section sets out the overall vision and objectives of the Local Plan, a central 
policy regarding the delivery of sustainable development, along with eight spatial 
strategy policies, focusing primarily on the borough  as a whole.  
Area Priorities  
1.42 This section describes spatial priorities concerning each of Knowsley's 
communities (grouped under Huyton and Stockbridge Village; Kirkby; Prescot, 
Whiston, Knowsley Village and Cronton; and Halewood), and identifies six 
Principal Regenerat ion Areas (PRAs) within Knowsley, for which detailed Core 
Strategy policies are set out. This section also includes a range of policies relating 
                                            
21 See Section 33A of the Localism Act and paragraph s 178–182 of the National Planni ng Policy

Chapter 1 Introduction  
Page 13 to Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) proposed in parts of Knowsley to meet 
residential and employment develop ment needs.  
Thematic Policies and Delivery  
1.43 The final section of the document sets out a range of policies concerning strategic 
themes which are not fully covered in previous chapters (housing, quality of place 
and the environment) and refers to an Infrastr ucture Delivery Plan  (IDP) which 
the Council has prepared as a separate document. The Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan identifies the key items of infrastructure which are required to deliver the Core 
Strategy, how and when these are proposed to be delivered, and by whom.  
Appendices  
1.44 The appendices within this document contain important supporting information. 
Appendices A  and B set out a glossary and range of detailed definitions which ar e 
referred to within the Core Strategy policies. Appendix C  identifies which UDP 
policies will be replaced and thus deleted when the Local Plan: Core Strategy is 
adopted. Appendix D  sets out how each policy of the Core Strategy will be 
delivered, key risks to delivery and how these have been addressed, and key 
targets and mechanisms that may trigger remedial measures if a specific policy is 
not being achieved. Appendix E  includes site profiles for each of the Sustainable 
Urban Extensions proposed as site allocations within the Plan.  
Local Plan Monitoring Framework  
1.45 The Local Plan Monitoring Framework should be read alongside the Core Strategy  
and in particular the policy delivery mechanisms in Appendix D . It explains how 
achievement of the objectives and policies within the Plan will be measured by 
assessing performance against a wide range of monitori ng indicators. The results 
of this assessment will be presented within a Monitoring Report , to be produced 
and published by the Council at least once a year. This process will enable the 
Council to assess whether the Core Strategy is being implemented effe ctively, and 
will highlight any issues which could prompt revision of the Local Plan. It is 
expected that the Local Plan Monitoring Framework will be updated and/ or 
amended as Local Plan documents are adopted or revised.  
Presenting the Policies  
1.46 Each of th e policies is presented in a purple box (numbered Policy SD1, then 
Policy CS1 –Policy CS 27, with Policy SUE1 –Policy SUE2c being inserted between 
Policy CS14 and Policy CS15 ). Following this is a further orange box which 
explains how the policy links with ot her Core Strategy policies, delivers the Core 
Strategy's strategic objectives, and relates to other planning policy documents, 
including supplementary and related plans. This also indicates the broad delivery 
mechanisms for the policy. Each policy is also accompanied by supporting text, 
including information which is important to the understanding and interpretation of 
the policy, and therefore should be read alongside the policy wording. Detailed  
 
Page 14 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
justification for the policy approaches set out within the C ore Strategy can be 
found within the Council's evidence base, supporting documents and previous 
consultation documents.  
Further Information  
1.47 As noted, a range of information relating to the Local Plan Core Strategy has been 
made available on the Council's w ebsite23. This includes evidence base studies, 
technical reports, assessments and other supporting documents which have all 
influenced the development of the Core Strategy. Information relating to previous 
stages of preparation of the Core Strategy is also available, including consultation 
documents and summaries of the findings of previous consultation periods. 
Monitoring Reports detailing the performance of Local Plan policies are also 
available to download from this website.

Page 15 2 Knowsley – The Place  
2.1 In order to plan for the future, it is critical to understand the present. This chapter 
briefly describes the borough  of Knowsley and the key  issues and opportunities 
which affect the area. These characteristics are interlinked and set the agenda for 
the Local Plan, including this Core Strategy.  
Knowsley Fact Box

Liverpool City Region Context  
2.2 Knowsley  is part of the Merseyside conurbation, between the city of Liverpool to 
the west and St. Helens  to the east. Sefton and West Lancashire districts lie to the 
north while Halton district lies to the south. These areas functionally form part of 
the wider Liv erpool City Region.  
Map 2.1: Liverpool City Region  
 
2.3 Knowsley forms part of the Liverpool City Region's  Northern Housing Market 
Area24. It also plays a major role as a location for employment, and recreational 
opportunities within the City Region. It has good transport links, particularly in an 
east-west direction to Liverpool City Centre, the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool John 
                                            
24 The Liverpool City Region Housing Strategy (TMP, 2007) defines three housing market areas, 
one of which —the Northern Mark et Area —includes  Knowsle y, Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral.

2.4 Knowsley is in a position to contribute to and benefit from the City Region's 
economic initiatives and opportunities such as Atlantic Gateway25 including the 
Liverpool SuperPort concept26. Liverpool John Lennon Airport's expansion plans 
would be advantageous for future economic inves tment in the borough , particularly 
in freight or passeng er transport related services27.  
                                            
25 See Atlantic Gateway website at http://www.atlanticgateway.co.uk/  
26 The Liverpool SuperPort concept will strengthen the City's role as a major international gateway 
by ensuring that its air, port, logistics and transportation assets are developed in  a coordinated way

Settlement Pattern and Local Context  
2.5 Knowsley comprises a belt of large suburban towns, villages and open areas. 
Most residents live in the suburban towns of Huyton, K irkby, Prescot, Whiston and 
Halewood. The majority of development in these towns date s from the 1920s 
onwards, with much of the growth resulting from ‘overspill ’ development by the 
City of Liverpool. The exceptions to this include the older historic town o f Prescot 
and a few pockets of older development in the other towns. The suburban housing 
areas are served by town and/ or district centres providing a range of mainly local 
shopping and other services.  
2.6 The borough  contains a number of large industrial and business parks which play 
a crucial economic role in the City Region. These include the very large Knowsley 
Industrial  and Business Parks (in Kirkby), the Jaguar Land Rover car plant (in 
Halewood), Kings Business Park, Huyton and Prescot Business Parks in the 
central belt of the borough . Whiston Hospital is another major employer of sub -
regional significance. The employme nt and housing areas of the borough  are 
generally highly segregated.  
2.7 The countryside and urban fringe areas of the borough  are designated as Green 
Belt, much of which is high grade farmland, and within which the attractive villages 
of Knowsley, Cronton and  Tarbock are located. Knowsley Safari Park (located 
within the historic Knowsley Hall Estate) represents a unique tourism facility, 
receiving over 500,000 visitors per year, while the National Wildflower Centre at 
Roby (Huyton) constitutes a further signif icant cultural asset for the borough . 
2.8 Knowsley's local context, including key transport links, town centres, the extent of 
urban areas and areas designated as Green Belt (as at 2012), is illustrated in Map 
2.3.  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 2 Knowsley – The Place  
Page 19 Map 2.3: Knowsley Local Context as at 2013  
 
Knowsley's Population  
2.9 During the 1970s and 1980s, a loss of manufacturing jobs in the Knowsley area 
left thousands of local people facing unemployment. This, coupled with a relatively 
poor choice of housing to buy, contributed to a population decline of nearly 40,000 
 
 
Page 20 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
between 1971 and 199128. To address the decline in population the Council 
embarked upon an ambitious ‘stabilisation strategy ’ in 1991. This resulted in a 
relative stabilisati on of population since 2000. The 2011 Census suggests that the 
population was 145,900 in March 2011. National projections indicate that the 
borough 's population will increase by about 4,000 between 2011 and 202129. 
2.10 Knowsley's population structure is ageing,  with the number of persons aged under 
65 projected to decrease by 4,600 between 2008 and 202830, while the number of 
those aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 8,600.  
Housing in Knowsley  
2.11 The 2011 Census highlights that Knowsley currently has 62,967  dwellings31 with a 
high proportion (over 26.6%) being within affordable tenures , including social 
rented32, with the highest concentrations occurrin g in Kirkby and North Huyton33. 
2.12 The average household size in Knowsley is comparatively large with a high 
proportion containing dependent children and lone parent families34. 
2.13 Although house prices are generally comparatively low within Knowsley, housing 
affordability is an issue as average salaries of residents are also low35. Since the 
‘credit crunch ’ of 2008, the affordability issue has been exacerbated for those 
seeking to become homeowners, by the difficulty of obtaining suitable finance and 
mortgages.  
2.14 As part of the Council's ‘stabilisation strategy ’, extensive housebuilding was 
undertaken between 1991 and 2002 with over 6,000 dwellings being built. 
Although this led to an improved choice of housing, shortages remain in some 
areas for some housing types, sizes and tenures, meaning the housing market in 
Knowsley remains unbalanced. Particular shortages exist for l arger, executive 
market homes, and for smaller one -and two -bedroom units in the affordable

occupation by older people to meet the needs of the ageing population36. 
2.15 The delivery of  new housing in Knowsley since 2003/04 has generally been at a 
slower rate. Whilst 4,205 new homes were completed between 2003/04 and 
2012/13, the high number of demolitions particularly associated with the North 
Huyton regeneration programme meant that ne t delivery in the borough  only 
totalled 1,890 over this period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the impact of demolitions on 
net completions in the borough  between 2002/03 and 2012/13. A significant 
proportion of housing which has been del ivered in recent years has been on 
previously developed land. Knowsley's urban area is now, however, relatively 
constrained in terms of housing land availability37 38.

indicate a n eed for permanent and/ or transit pitches to be provided to serve the 
borough 's needs39. 
Economy and Employment in Knowsley  
2.17 Approximately 59,600 people are employed in the borough40, with the total number 
of VAT registered businesses operating in Knowsley estimated at around 3,00 041. 
2.18 The manufacturing sector has declined as a proportion of total jobs in recent years 
but still accounts for a higher proportion of jobs in Knowsley than it does at the 
national level42. This reflects the borough 's role in the automotive industry and its 
supply chain, as well as advanced manufacturing and engineering sub -sectors. 
The borough  has a disparity in income levels, with Knowsley residents having the 
lowest incomes on Merseyside, while those who work in the borough  have the 
second highest43. This i ndicates that Knowsley residents can find it difficult to 
access the higher paid jobs, whilst higher income earners are generally choosing 
not to live in the borough . 
2.19 The Public Administration, Education and Health sector forms a large part of the 
borough 's economy but this is expected to reduce due to public sector spending 
cuts. The Council has recognised the need to broaden the borough 's employment 
base and target growth sectors including transport and communication, 
distribution, finance and business se rvices, and manufacturing, including 
advanced engineering and materials, automotive industry, green energy, food and 
drink44. 
2.20 There has been significant investment in new employment opportunities since the 
1990s. Key successes have included introduction of new models and expansion at 
the Jaguar Land Rover car plant at Halewood, development of a high quality 
business park at King s Business Park in Huyton, and high profile inward 
investments in Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks.

Page 23 2.21 Despite successes, major c hallenges remain which include:  
 Low business start up rates45; 
 Scope to improve the suitability of buildings and infrastructure in employment 
areas and reduce vacancy rates, particularly in Knowsley Industrial Park46; and  
 A shortage in the long -term supply of available employment land to support 
economic growth47. 
Town Centres, Shopping and the Evening Economy in Knowsley  
2.22 Kirkby, Prescot and Huyton Town Centres provide a broad range of services to 
distinct catchment areas associated with each centre. Kirkby a nd Huyton centres 
date largely from the 1950s and 1960s while Prescot contains a much older 
historic core. The town centres are smaller than some centres in neighbouring 
districts, particularly the city centre of Liverpool and the town centre of St. Helens . 
The borough  also contains smaller suburban district centres in Halewood, 
Stockbridge Village and Page Moss, and a network of smaller local centres and 
parades providing valuable neighbourhood facilities.  
2.23 Huyton, Prescot and especially Kirkby Town Centres  are currently failing to 
perform to their full potential as locations for shopping, leisure and other town 
centre uses48. They have very little in the way of an evening economy, having no 
cinemas or theatres, and a limited range of restaurants. They also s uffer from high 
levels of ‘leakage ’ of shopping expenditure to other centres, particularly to 
Liverpool. Cables Retail Park, adjacent to Prescot Town Centre is, however, 
commercially successful. A number of the smaller centres and local shopping 
parades in  Knowsley are also experiencing difficulties with regard to  vacancy and 
ranges of uses49. 
Transport in Knowsley  
2.24 Knowsley's road network includes the M62, A580 (East Lancashire Road) and 
A562 (Speke Boulevard) providing good transport links facilitating move ment of 
people, goods and freight between Knowsley and other areas of the Country. The 
M57/ A5300 provides a major north to south road route through the centre of the 
borough .

2.25 Links by public transport to Liverpool are generally good while those in the north to 
south direction through Knowsley are weaker. Knowsley is crossed in a west -east 
direc tion by three railway lines, running from Liverpool Lime Street station to:  
 Manchester (via Warrington) – serving  Halewood;  
 Manchester (via Chat Moss) – serving  Huyton and Whiston; and  
 Wigan (via St Helens) – serving  Huyton and Prescot . 
2.26 A fourth line from Liverpool Central to Kirkby is part of the Merseyrail electrified 
network. The Knowsley Rail Freight Terminal at the north end of Knowsley 
Industrial Park is located on a branch of the Kirkby to Wigan line. Part of the West 
Coast Main Line also runs throug h Knowsley, near to the Jaguar Land Rover 
complex at Halewood.  
2.27 Knowsley has an extensive bus network, including many routes running from 
Liverpool City Centre to different parts of the borough . There are, however, issues 
regarding the availability and freq uency of services between Knowsley's towns, 
linking residential areas to key employment opportunities and Whiston Hospital. 
Knowsley also has an extensive network of footpaths and cycleways, including a 
section of the Trans Pennine Trail running through Ha lewood.  
2.28 The Government has announced funding approval in principle for the electrification 
of selected railway lines between Liverpool and Manchester. This and additional 
plans for transport improvements for Knowsley and the wider Merseyside area are 
set o ut in the Third Local Transport Plan (LTP3), which covers the period from 
2011 until 202450. 
2.29 Although located outside of Knowsley, the planned expansion of Liverpool John 
Lennon Airport could bring significant benefits to Knowsley's transport network. 
The p roposed Eastern Access Transport Corridor would connect the Airport with 
the A562 (Speke Boulevard) east of the Jaguar Land Rover Plant in Halewood51. A 
further major scheme in the wider area which could impact on transport networks 
in Knowsley is the propo sed Mersey Gateway Bridge, a six -lane road crossing of 
the River Mersey between Runcorn and Widnes.  
Green Spaces, Outdoor Sport and Leisure in Knowsley  
2.30 Knowsley benefits from an extensive network of open countryside and green 
spaces. Many of the open and g reen spaces in urban areas are accessible to 
residents, providing opportunities for formal and informal recreation and improved

habitats, of which some are locally designated a s Local Wildlife Sites52. 
2.31 The greenspaces in Knowsley's urban areas are, in many cases, multi -functional 
but have been categorised into different use types (for example parks and 
gardens, children and young people’s  facilities, amenity green space and 
allotments). An audit of Knowsley's open space provision identified that, although 
the borough  has a significant overall quantity of green space, it has an uneven 
distribution and therefore the quality and accessibility of green spaces vary 
throughout Knowsley53. 
2.32 Knowsley is part of the Mersey Forest initiative54. This is a long term plan to 
enhance woodland cover and landscape and provide associated recreation 
opportunities across a broad part of the Merseyside and Cheshire areas.  
2.33 Knowsley is well served by indoo r leisure facilities, playing pitches and other 
outdoor sporting facilities55. These include modern sports centres at Huyton, 
Kirkby, Halewood, and Stockbridge Village, as well as facilities available for wider 
community use within many of Knowsley's school s. 
Water, Air, Minerals and Waste Management  in Knowsley  
2.34 Knowsley contains 431 hectares of land which has a high or medium risk of 
flooding56. The majority of such areas are in the Green Belt with under one percent 
of properties in the urban area being affe cted.  
2.35 Air quality within Knowsley is generally good with no Air Quality Management 
Areas designated within the borough57. The biological and chemical quality of the 
rivers in the borough  has improved in recent years but is still some way short of 
the region al average.  
2.36 The Liverpool City Region (including Knowsley) produces significant amounts of 
domestic and commercial wast e. As referred to in Chapter 1: Introductio n, the 
Council has prepared a J oint Waste Local Plan with sub -regional partners58, which 
                                            
52 The term ‘ Local Wildlife Site ’ has replaced the term ‘ sites of biological and/or geological interest ’ 
used in the Knowsley Replacement Unitary Development Plan, 2006

56 This figure has been obtained from maps produced by the Environment Agency in 20 11. ‘High’ 
risk is defined as flooding on average more than once in 100 years while ‘medium ’ risk is where 
flooding occurs on average between one in 100 and one in 1 ,000 years  
57 An Air Quality Management Area is an area which must be declared by the Counci l if air quality 
falls short of recognised standards. In these circumstances, the Council must also publish an Air 
Quality Action Plan  
58 See Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan (MEAS, 2013)   
 
Page 26 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
will guide the scale, location and type of facilities required to manage all types of 
waste in Merseyside and Halton. This includes identifying proposed sites to be 
allocated in each authority area for development of new waste mana gement and 
treatment facilities.  
2.37 Knowsley has a long history of extraction of minerals such as coal and clay for 
brick making. With the exception of those at Cronton Clay Pit, the operations have 
now ceased. A study of minerals resources59 recommended that the Cronton Clay 
Pit and surrounding area be safeguarded from other forms of development which 
could sterilise it as a resource. The Coal Authority has also indicated that coal 
resources still exist under a large part of the borough60. 
Built Environment and  Heritage  in Knowsley  
2.38 Knowsley has a varied built environment, from the historic core of Prescot, through 
typical 1920s and 1930s suburban developments to the more recent municipal and 
private sector estates. The rural villages within the borough , includin g Knowsley 
Village, Cronton and Tarbock, are notable for their more rural character, 
comprising a higher proportion of historic properties than elsewhere in the 
borough . Prescot town centre is an area of particular historic interest, with origins 
dating ba ck to medieval times and strong connections with the 18th and 19th 
Century clock and watch manufacturing industries. Some of the older parts of the 
borough  have a strong local sense of place based, for example, on the use of local 
red sandstone, Welsh slat e and red brick in buildings.  
2.39 Knowsley contains 121 individual listed structures, of which one is Grade I, four 
are Grade II*, and 116 are Grade II. They range from large buildings of grandeur, 
such as Knowsley Hall, to structures like railway bridges. The re are no listed 
buildings in Knowsley on the national buildings at risk register61. 
2.40 Knowsley has fifteen Conservation Areas of which two are considered by English 
Heritage to be at risk and in a condition which could deteriorate62. Three of the 
Conservation  Areas are designated as ‘Article 4 ’ areas where the planning 
controls over minor developments are tighter than elsewhere. The Council has 
publishe d Conservation Area Appraisals63, which identify the key characteristics of 
each area and any changes (e.g. to  key buildings or the streetscape) which have 
occurred since their designation.

Deprivation in Knowsley  
2.41 Despite significant progress in recent years, Knowsley is ranked the fifth most 
depriv ed district in the country64. The distribution of deprived areas is shown in 
Map 2.4. The most deprived areas of the borough  are in Kirkby, Stockbridge 
Village and North Huyton, although smaller pockets of deprivation exist in othe r 
areas.

2.42 Knowsley has high levels of worklessness. In March 2012, 6.1% of the residents of 
working age were claiming Job Seeker’s Allowance, many on a long term basis65. 
The numbers of claimants of Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disability Allowance are 
also high.  
2.43 Educational attainment levels in Knowsley are low. In 2011/12, 40.9% of pupils 
achieved  five or more A* –C grades at the end of Key Stage 4, compared to 58.8%

Page 29 in En gland66. The level of educational attainment for boys is particularly low. 
Knowsley has the fourth highest proportion of 16 to 18 year olds that are not in 
education, employment or training (also referred to as ‘NEET ’). Educational 
attainment remains a prio rity for the Council and its partners. The Future Schools 
programme has replaced eleven secondary schools with seven new Centres for 
Learning, while primary schools have a programme of rationalisation and 
investment.  
2.44 The Council and its partners have taken  action to tackle deprivation, for example, 
by remodelling housing areas in North Huyton through the Revive programme67. A 
similar, but smaller scale, regeneration project is proposed in Tower Hill (Kirkby) 
although the start of development has been delayed  by dif ficulties in the housing 
market68. The Council is also reviewing opportunities to carry out appropriate 
regeneration projects to remodel housing areas in other deprived parts of the 
borough , for example, Stockbridge Village.  
Health and Wellbeing  in Knowsley  
2.45 Although life expectancy has increased in recent years , the borough 's levels (75.6 
years for males and 81 for females) are still among the lowest in the country69. The 
borough  has high mortality rates from cancer (particularly lung cancer), 
cardiova scular disease (including coronary heart disease and stroke) and 
respiratory disease. These are issues which can be associated with lifestyle 
choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption and diet70, but also with wider 
environmental factors such as housing standards, quality of employment 
opportunities, access to health and other services/ facilities, open space and the 
natural environment.

Local areas of Knowsley  
2.46 Each of Knowsley's communities faces distinct issues and opportunities. To 
analyse these and id entify future planning interventions required in each the 
remainder of this document groups the communities into four broad areas as 
follows:  
 Huyton and Stockbridge Village;  
 Kirkby;  
 Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village; and  
 Halewood.  
2.47 The speci fic issues, priorities and policies affecting each of these areas are set out 
in Chapter 6: Area Priorities .

Chapter 3 Vision and Objectives  
Page 35 3 Vision and Objectives  
Vision for the future  
3.1 Following the analysis of Knowsley in 2012, this chapter sets out a vision 
describing the type of place which Knowsley will become by 2028. This is 
supported by strategic objectives which identify priorities in more detail,  and will be 
delivered via Local Plan and other planning policies which will guide new 
development and regeneration. Key influences on the vision and objectives have 
been the Strategy for Knowsley (see Chapter 1: Introduction  of this document), 
and the key challenges and opportunities facing Knowsley (see Chapter  2: 
Knowsley – The Place ). 
City Region Context  
3.2 A further key influence on the vision has been the joint working on spatial planning 
matters which has taken place between the local authorities of the Liverpool City 
Region. This has established the strong links which exist with neighbouring 
districts, for example in terms of commuting patterns and housing markets, 
particularly with Liverpo ol to the west but also with other districts (see Chapter 2: 
Knowsley – The Place  for further details). The vision which is set out below will 
consolidate and strengthen the role of Knowsley's towns as large suburban 
centre s, providing employment, services and housing, which will complement that 
available in larger built up areas in surrounding districts. It will ensure that the 
future regeneration and development of the borough  contributes effectively to that 
of the Liverpo ol City Region as a whole.  
Spatial Vision – Knowsley  in 2028  
By 2028, Knowsley Borough will be known for its successful suburban 
townships  that provide a sense of place and community, having sustainable, 
diverse, more prosperous and healthy populations.  
Knowsley’s economy  will be stronger and more diverse, providing employment 
choices for local people and helping to drive economic growth in the wider 
Liverpool City Region. Knowsley will be attractive for businesses to invest in, 
providing a range of employ ment land and premises to meet their needs. The new 
Learning Centres coupled with investment in primary schools, adult training and 
skills initiatives, will raise educational attainment, skills and aspiration levels, so 
Knowsley’s people can access a wider  range of jobs and better meet the needs of 
employers.  
Knowsley will provide a wide choice of housing to meet needs. Residents will be 
attracted to the housing on offer and the vibrant, safe and cohesive communities 
of which it forms part. Housing renewal projects in Kirkby, North Huyton and 
Stockbridge Village will be successfully completed. New housing will be provided 
in sustainable locations, and be well -designed, affordable and form attractive and  
 
Page 36 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
identifiable neighbourhoods where residents will choose  to live.  
Kirkby , Prescot  and Huyton Town Centres  will have defined and enhanced 
roles, be regenerated, vibrant and welcoming, providing focal points where local 
residents will choose to shop and access health care, cultural and other key 
services and faci lities. The district centres of Halewood and Stockbridge Village 
will be renewed and thriving, serving as centres providing local shops and services 
for those communities.  
Knowsley’s communities will be better connected  to local employment 
opportunities, h ealth care, education, shopping, leisure and recreation provision. 
Land uses and transport will be well co -ordinated to allow Knowsley’s residents, 
workers and visitors to choose more sustainable forms of transport, including 
public transport, walking and cycling.  
The gap in deprivation levels  will be narrowed, both between different parts of 
the borough  and between Knowsley and elsewhere, with opportunity married with 
need. Areas of high social and economic deprivation, including Kirkby, North 
Huyton and S tockbridge Village, will have been transformed into distinctive places 
where people will choose to live, in vibrant, safe and cohesive communities.  
Knowsley’s open spaces and indoor and outdoor sporting, recreation and leisure 
opportunities will be enhance d so that residents and visitors can choose to 
become more active and pursue healthier lifestyles . Open spaces will become 
well-used multi -functional areas incorporating attractive walking and cycling links 
between homes and destinations, and complementing  the wider environmental 
benefits of the Green Infrastructure network , which assist the response to the 
impacts of climate change.  
The character and quality  of Knowsley’s rural villages of Cronton, Tarbock and 
Knowsley Village will be protected. Rural area s will provide distinct breaks 
between urban areas, and good public access for informal countryside recreation 
and opportunities for formal recreation.  
Knowsley’s areas of environmental importance , including sites of biodiversity 
and geological value, toge ther with buildings, structures and areas of historic and 
cultural importance will be protected, managed and enhanced, to ensure a positive 
contribution to Knowsley’s environmental quality and distinctiveness.  
 
   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 3 Vision and Objectives  
Page 37 Strategic Objectives  
Strategic Objective 1  
Sustainable Economic and Employment Growth  
To encourage and maintain sustainable economic  and employment growth  in 
Knowsley, complementary to that within the wider Liverpool City Region, by 
accommodating employment related development, improving skills within the 
workforce, and promoting enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation.  
 
3.3 This objective seeks to build upon recent successes in sustainable economic and 
employment growth in Knowsley, and raise the currently low levels of skills and 
attainment. T he aim is to ensure that Knowsley plays an important role in the 
economy of the Liverpool City Region, and that the economy grows sufficiently 
and in the correct areas to provide a range of employment and new business 
opportunities for local people.  
 
Strat egic Objective 2  
Well-Balanced Housing Market  
To promote a well-balanced housing market  throughout Knowsley by providing 
a sufficient quantity and mix of high quality sustainable housing in appropriate 
locations to meet needs and demand (including for ma rket, affordable and 
supported housing).  
 
3.4 This objective supports housing growth in Knowsley, which is needed to redress 
the imbalances in Knowsley's housing market, such as shortages of affordable 
housing, accommodation for older people and larger homes,  whilst promoting 
sustainability of new development. The focus will be on meeting the housing 
needs of those living in Knowsley, including newly emerging households, and 
attracting new households to settle in Knowsley, hence boosting community 
sustainabili ty and vitality, and supporting local service provision.  
   
 
Page 38 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Strategic Objective 3  
Regenerate and Transform  
To regenerate  and transform  areas of social and economic deprivation so they 
become more sustainable, safer, healthier and more cohesive communities , thus 
narrowing the gap between the richest and poorest communities in Knowsley.  
 
3.5 North Huyton, Stockbridge Village and Kirkby are currently the areas most affected 
by social and economic deprivation. These areas will therefore be a primary focus 
for act ion to ensure that people will choose to live there, within vibrant, safe, 
healthy and cohesive communities. We will aim to narrow the gap in deprivation 
levels between these areas and other parts of Knowsley in terms of both income 
and social capital (i.e . community cohesion and health). Smaller pockets of 
deprivation such as those which exist in Knowsley's other towns will also be 
tackled, and responses made to any changes to the pattern of deprivation across 
the borough  which may occur during the plan pe riod. 
 
Strategic Objective 4  
Distinctive, Viable and Sustainable Town Centres  
To promote distinctive , viable  and sustainable town centres  in Huyton, Kirkby 
and Prescot, by improving choice, variety and quality in their range of retail, leisure 
and other town centre uses, together with thriving district centres, including 
enhancement of those in Halewood and Stockbridge Village, and a more 
sustainable pattern of local centres.  
 
3.6 This objective focuses on ensuring that the town and district centres in Knows ley 
develop in a manner which supports local communities, addresses gaps in existing 
provision relative to demand and improves the retail, leisure, and also potentially 
residential offer associated with each of the centres. This will include enhancing 
the distinctiveness of the centres and ensuring that they are lively, well designed, 
well used and well maintained.  
   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 3 Vision and Objectives  
Page 39 Strategic Objective 5  
Quality of Place  
To promote the quality of place  within Knowsley by protecting historically 
important features and enh ancing the character, quality and diversity of 
Knowsley's built environment, including town centres, key employment areas, 
residential neighbourhoods, green spaces, conservation areas, rural areas and 
villages, key gateways and transport routes.  
 
3.7 This obj ective seeks to protect what is locally distinctive about Knowsley, including 
the local historic environment such as designated listed buildings and conservation 
areas. The aim is to ensure that the sense of place provided by these unique 
aspects of the bu ilt environment are not lost, and remain appropriately integrated 
into the design of new places and spaces within Knowsley. Design quality and 
sustainable principles in new development will be prioritised.  
 
Strategic Objective 6  
Sustainable Transport  
To ensure new development in Knowsley encourages a reduction in the overall 
need to travel, and prioritises sustainable transport  such as walking, cycling and 
public transport. This will help to ensure accessibility and linkage between housing 
areas and emplo yment locations, shopping, leisure, culture, health care, 
education, community and sporting facilities, green spaces and other services.  
 
3.8 This objective seeks to maintain and improve connectivity both within Knowsley 
and linking to key destinations in the  Liverpool City Region and beyond. The aim is 
to ensure that new development is appropriately located (including possible co -
location with existing development) to reduce the need to travel, and also to 
maintain and improve access to a choice of travel net works, including those 
involving walking, cycling and public transport. This includes ensuring that 
transport is accessible to all living and working within Knowsley through careful 
design and consideration of the diverse needs of the population, including  
vulnerable, elderly and disabled people.  
   
 
Page 40 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Strategic Objective 7  
Manage Environmental Resources  
To manage environmental resources  in Knowsley prudently by focusing on 
sustainable development, recycling and renewable technologies, minimising 
pollution, r educing carbon emissions and responding to the impacts of climate 
change.  
 
3.9 This objective aims to ensure that resources such as energy, waste, water and 
minerals in Knowsley are used and managed in a sustainable manner which 
reduces generation of waste an d carbon emissions. This includes the potential use 
of renewable technologies in resource management and energy production. The 
aim is to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of Knowsley's residents, 
employees and businesses and ensure that future imp acts of climate change on 
the borough  and the wider Liverpool City Region (for example through changes to 
weather patterns or flooding) are mitigated.  
 
Strategic Objective 8  
Green Infrastructure and Rural Areas  
To support and strengthen the role of Knows ley’s Green Infrastructure  (in rural 
and urban areas), promote biodiversity, and maintain the character of rural 
settlements including Cronton, Tarbock and Knowsley Village.  
 
3.10 This objective focuses on the role of Knowsley's green and open spaces, in both 
rural and urban areas. The objective seeks to maintain and enhance the most 
valuable aspects of these areas, including recognising their value to local flora, 
fauna and geology, and their positive effect on health and wellbeing through 
leisure and recreati onal use. The objective also supports the role of Green Belt 
areas in maintaining breaks between the urban areas of Knowsley's townships, 
and the unique landscape settings of Cronton, Tarbock and Knowsley Village, all 
of which sit within the Green Belt. Th ere is however a requirement to review 
existing Green Belt boundaries to ensure delivery of Knowsley's development 
needs, whilst establishing new robust boundaries which ensure remaining Green 
Belt areas are provided long term protection.  
   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 3 Vision and Objectives  
Page 41 Strategic Objec tive 9  
Promoting Health and Wellbeing in Knowsley  
To address existing health inequalities and encourage enhancements to the 
health and wellbeing  of Knowsley's residents by ensuring a health promoting 
environment and provision of healthy lifestyle options  for those living and working 
in the borough . 
 
3.11 The final objective focuses on the priorities of tackling health problems and 
inequalities in Knowsley. The objective will encourage new development to have a 
positive impact on the health and wellbeing of bo th individuals and population 
groups, by providing a healthy environment and opportunities for healthy lifestyle 
options for those living and working in the borough . This is a cross -cutting  theme 
to which all of the previous objectives will contribute, thr ough improved access to 
high quality, sustainable and well designed housing, employment opportunities, 
open space, services and facilities, and prioritising sustainable transport modes 
like walking and cycling. In addition, maintaining existing and creatin g new 
opportunities for physical activity associated with sport and recreation, and 
supporting community involvement, cohesion, cultural activities and self -
improvement will all help to improve health and wellbeing within Knowsley.  
Delivering the Strategic  Objectives  
3.12 The Core Strategy policies in Chapters 4 to 11 of this document will each help to 
deliver one or more of the Strategic Objectives. More detailed aspects of the 
objectives will be delivered via other Local Plan documents. Appendix D of this 
Core  Strategy sets out how each policy will be delivered and how the risks to 
delivery will be managed. Indicators and targets have also been developed which 
will be used to measure the extent to which the Strategic Objectives are delivered. 
The Local Plan Mon itoring Framework sets out the full matrix of objectives, 
policies, targets and indicators, including reference to how the implementation and 
monitoring of Knowsley's planning policies will link to the delivery of Strategic 
Objectives. The indicators and t argets will be regularly reviewed to ensure that 
they remain ‘SMART ’ (i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-
bound).

Policy SD1:  Sustainable  Development  
4.1 The NPPF  requires that a presumption in favour of sustainab le development be 
central to both plan -making  and decision -taking. Policy SD 1 reflects the 
commitment to this approach within Knowsley's Local Plan.  
Policy SD1  
Sustainable Development  
1) When considering development proposals, a positive approach will be tak en, 
which reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained 
in the National Planning Policy Framework. Work will be undertaken pro -
actively with applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals can 
be approved wherever p ossible, and to secure development that improves the 
economic, social and environmental conditions in the area.  
2) Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan (and any 
relevant policies in Neighbourhood Plan s) will be approved witho ut delay, 
unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
3) Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are 
out of date at the time of making the decision then permission will be granted 
unless material considerations indi cate otherwise – taking into account 
whether:  
a) Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and 
demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in 
the National Planning Policy Framework taken as a whole; or  
b) Specific policies in that Framework indicate that development should be 
restricted.

4.2 Policy SD1 has been included to translate the ‘presumption in favour of 
sustainable development ’, which lies at the heart of the NPPF, to the local level. 
This policy is cent ral to all elements of the Knowsley Local Plan, as well as  
 
Page 44 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Supplementary Planning Documents and any Neighbourhood Plan s which may be 
brought into effect. This approach reflects the need to plan positively to meet 
development requirements arising within Kno wsley, to encourage growth and 
investment within the borough , while seeking to maintain and enhance 
environmental, social and economic sustainability. The policy will ensure that the 
vision and nine strategic objectives of the Local Plan are delivered with in the plan 
period.  
Definition of Sustainable Development  
4.3 For the purposes of Policy SD 1, the definition of ‘sustainable development ’ is 
given in the NPPF71. This definition refers to those held by both the United Nations 
General Assembly, as well as the UK 's ‘Sustainable Development  Strategy: 
Securing the Future ’72. The NPPF emphasises the economic, social and 
environmental roles which the planning system must perform in order that 
sustainable development can be delivered in accordance with these definitions . 
Delivering Sustainable Development in Knowsley  
4.4 The NPPF explains that Local Plans need to take local circumstances into 
account, to respond to the different opportunities for achieving sustainable 
development in different areas. Ther efore, in addition to  Policy SD 1, the delivery of 
sustainable development is reflected in a range of other policies within the 
Knowsley Local  Plan. In particular, Policy CS 1: Spatial Strat egy for Knowsley  and 
Policy CS 2: Development Pri nciples  set out a clear spatial strategy for the 
development of the borough  over a fifteen year period, alongside locally specific 
development principles which will be applied to ensure that sustainable 
development is delivered.  
4.5 As noted in Chapter 1 : Introduction , the Core Strategy has been subject to a 
Sustainability Appraisal process, undertaken in accordance with the Strategic 
Environmental Assessment requirements. This, along with other policy drafting 
measures, has ensu red that the plan policies promote sustainable development.

5.2 These policies will underpin the area -based and theme -based policies in Chapters 
6 to 11 of this document and in other Knowsley Local Plan documents. The 
policies also reflect how Knowsley's future development will relate to that of the 
wider Liverpool City Regio n. 
Policy CS 1: Spatial Strategy for Knowsley  
5.3 Policy CS 1 is the central policy of the Knowsley Local Plan, providing principles for 
Knowsley's spatial development, and highlighting development priorities and areas 
which will be of strategic importance over the plan period.  
Policy CS1  
Spatial Strategy for Knowsley  
Knowsley’s Spatial Development  
1) The spatial development of Knowsley to 2028 will be achieved by:  
a) A focus on development within existing urban areas, with emphasis upon 
areas that are within or easi ly accessible from areas in need of 
regeneration;  
b) Maintenance of the existing settlement hierarchy, including the role of 
Huyton/ Stockbr idge Village, Kirkby, Prescot/ Whiston and Halewood as 
larger suburban centres, and of Cronton, Tarbock and Knowsley Vi llage as 
rural villages;  
c) Maximising Knowsley's contribution to the development of the Liverpool City 
Region and key sub -regional projects;  
d) An efficient and sustainable use of land and infrastructure, encouraging 
where possible the reclamation and reuse of previously developed land; 
and 
e) Removal of the Sustainable Urban Extensions identified in Policies SUE1 , 
SUE2 , SUE2a , SUE2b , and SUE2c  from the Green Belt to help meet needs 
for housing and employment development, and maintaining the openness 
of remaining Green Belt areas.   
 
Page 46 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Knowsley’s Spatial Development Priorities  
2) Priorities for the development of Knowsley to 2028 will be to:  
a) Re-balance the hous ing stock by providing a wide choice of new market 
sector and affordable housing with supportive services and facilities 
appropriate to needs;  
b) Regenerate and enhance existing residential neighbourhoods, particularly 
in areas with higher levels of deprivati on, through neighbourhood 
management initiatives, improvements to public realm, and appropriate 
investment in service provision and in the existing housing stock;  
c) Enhance existing employment areas and provide a suitable range of sites 
and premises for new employment development;  
d) Maintain and enhance the borough’s town, district and local centres;  
e) Maintain and enhance networks for passenger and freight transportation, 
prioritising the use of sustainable modes of travel; and  
f) Maintain and enhance the Green Inf rastructure network, areas of 
environmental importance and heritage assets.  
Principal Regeneration Areas  
3) Opportunities for regeneration and development within the following Principal 
Regeneration Areas will be maximised (in no order of priority):  
a) North H uyton and Stockbridge Village;  
b) Kirkby Town Centre;  
c) Tower Hill, Kirkby;  
d) Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks;  
e) Prescot Town Centre; and  
f) South Prescot.  
4) Regeneration will be promoted outside the Principal Regeneration Areas where 
this is of a scale and natur e which meets the needs and opportunities in the 
local area.

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 47 5.4 Policy CS 1 sets out the overall spatial development strategy for Knowsley up to 
2028. The policy summarises the  Council's approach to delivery of the Vision and 
Strategic Objectives of the Local Plan, and of the Sustainable Community Strategy 
(SCS)73. The approach will reconcile competing priorities for the development of 
the borough , while reflecting priorities set  by national planning policy, including 
planning for housing and employment growth, supporting urban regeneration, 
maintaining a hierarchy of centres and promoting environmental and social 
sustainability.  
5.5 Policy CS 1 will guide the strategic decisions of th e Council, its partners and 
potential investors within the borough . New development proposed in Knowsley 
will be ex pected to comply with Policy CS 1, particularly with respect to the 
characteristics of the spatial strategy, and the different roles for ident ified areas of 
Knowsley.  
5.6 The approach of Policy CS 1 has much in common with that in the emerging Local 
Plans of nearby districts in the Liverpool City Region, for example in its emphasis 
on tackling deprivation and promoting urban renewal. One particular i ssue which 
several of the districts within the City Region have had to consider in their Local 
Plans is the need to review Green Belt boundaries (which were first set in 
Merseyside in 1983) to meet long term development needs. Further detail on thi s 
issue is set out in Policy CS 5: Green Belt . A number of locations (referred to as 
Sustainable Urban Extensions) have been removed from the Green Belt to ensure 
an adequate supply of land for housing and employment development, on which 
further det ails are set out in Chapter 7. 
5.7 Policy CS 1 identifies Principal Regeneration Areas which will be subject to major 
change during the plan period; more detail ab out these is given in Chapter 6: Area 
Priorities . 
5.8 The policy states that where appropriate, opportunities for development and 
regeneration may be sought in areas identified as requiring regeneration, in 
addition to the defined Principal Regeneration Areas. The purpos e of this element 
of the policy is to ensure long -term flexibility within the Local Plan, enabling local 
responses to opportunities arising in different parts of the borough  to undertake 
physical, social or environmental regeneration, during the plan perio d. 
5.9 Knowsley's regeneration areas comprise a mix of previously developed 
(brownfield) and greenfield land. As a result, whilst encouraging remediation of 
previously developed land, the policy does not set a rigid target for the proportion 
of development to be on previously developed land. This approach will facilitate 
positive planning and prevent potential barriers to development in areas of 
regeneration need.

Policy CS 2: Development Principles  
5.12 To support the overall strategy set  out in Policy CS 1, there is a need to establish 
local principles which  will underpin new development in Knowsley. These will, in 
conjunction with other policies set out in the Local Plan and other planning 
documents, apply to decisions relating to policy and investment, together with the 
determination of planning application s. 
Policy CS2  
Development Principles  
1) New development in Knowsley and the preparation of subsequent stages of 
the Local Plan will be expected to support the following development principles:  
Principle 1 : Promote sustainable economic development, tackle the  causes of 
deprivation and disadvantage and narrow the gap between the richest and 
poorest neighbourhoods by:  
a) Meeting needs for new housing, employment, retail and other service 
provision;  
b) Improving business productivity and employment levels in Knowsley;  
c) Reducing economic, environmental, education, health and other social 
inequalities between Knowsley and other parts of the UK; and  
d) Providing opportunities for positive lifestyle choices and health improvement 
for people of all ages.  
Principle 2 : Reduce carb on emissions and adapt to the effects of climate 
change by:  
a) Contributing to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from all sources, in 
line with national targets;  
b) Ensuring an ability to adapt to future changes to national targets for carbon 
dioxide and ot her greenhouse gas emissions, including recognising the role 
of new technology;  
c) Identifying and applying measures offering effective mitigation and 
adaptation to likely environmental, social and economic impacts of climate 
change; and  
d) Meeting appropriate m inimum standards for sustainability.  
Principle 3 : Reduce the need to travel and increase accessibility by:  
a) Selecting locations that reduce the need to travel, especially by car, and 
enable people as far as possible to meet their needs locally;  
b) Assisting th e Council in achieving a shift towards more sustainable modes 
of transport for people, goods and freight;  
c) Encouraging safe and sustainable access for all, particularly by promoting 
the use of public transport, walking and cycling between homes and 
employme nt; and  
d) Supporting the provision and retention of shared space, community facilities 
and other local services (such as local shops, health facilities, education  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 51 provision, meeting places, sports venues, cultural buildings, public houses 
and places of worsh ip).  
Principle 4 : Recognise environmental limits, protect and enhance 
environmental assets, enhance local character and promote quality of place by:  
a) Understanding and respecting the character and distinctiveness of places 
and landscapes;  
b) Protecting and en hancing the historic environment;  
c) Promoting good quality design and ensuring that development respects its 
setting taking into account relevant design requirements, and best practice;  
d) Maximising opportunities for the regeneration of previously developed la nd, 
including derelict or unsightly areas to improve the image of Knowsley and 
use land resources efficiently;  
e) Mitigating potential negative impacts of traffic growth and road traffic on 
highway safety, air quality, noise and health;  
f) Supporting policies re lating to Green Infrastructure and the greening of 
towns and cities;  
g) Maintaining or enhancing the tranquillity of open countryside and rural 
areas;  
h) Maintaining or enhancing the quantity and quality of biodiversity and 
habitats, including potential impacts on nationally and internationally 
important sites for biodiversity;  
i) Addressing any issues of unstable land, resulting from Knowsley's legacy of 
minerals extraction; and  
j) Minimising negative impact upon flood risk, air quality, water quality, land 
quality, s oil quality, and noise or vibration levels and ensuring any negative 
impacts are appropriately mitigated.  
Development that will have an unacceptable impact upon any of the above  
will only be permitted where the benefits of the proposal clearly outweigh 
the harm.  
Principle 5 : Make the most efficient use of available resources and 
infrastructure by prioritising locations consistent with the spatial strategy, 
which:  
a) Do not require major investment in new infrastructure, including transport, 
water supply and se werage, or where this is unavoidable, incorporate 
appropriate development phasing and delivery assistance;  
b) Ensure environmental protection is enhanced through the phasing of new 
development and delivery of supporting infrastructure, including working 
with neighbouring authorities and key partner agencies where appropriate;  
c) Support prudent and efficient management of natural and man -made 
resources; and  
d) Promote sustainable construction and efficiency in resource use (including 
reuse and recycling of materials ).   
 
Page 52 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Application of the Development Principles  
2) The development principles are not in order of priority, will be applied equally 
alongside other Local Plan policies, and will be implemented using 
development assessment tools including:  
a) Environmental Impact  Assessment and associated legislative requirements;  
b) Health Impact Assessment;  
c) Equality and Diversity Impact Assessment;  
d) Transport Assessment and Travel Planning; and  
e) Design and Access Statements.

5.13 The development principles in Policy C S2 seek to deliver sustainable communities 
and create healthy environments in Knowsley, in line with national policy. The 
principles respond directly to Chapter 3 : Vision and Object ives of the Local Plan. 
They are overarching and consistent to underpin the additional detail provided 
within subsequent Local Plan policies, including those within the Core Strategy.  
5.14 The development principles will be applied through the Council's develo pment 
management process using various assessments, which the Council will expect to 
be prepared and submitted where appropriate as part of planning applications. 
The circumstances within which each assessment will be required will be set out in 
other Loca l Plan documents and guidance to be prepared by the Council. Some 
aspects of the development principles will be applied through other legislative and 
regulatory requirements.    
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 53 Policy CS 3: Housing Supply, Delivery and Distribution  
5.15 To support the spatia l strategy set out in Policy CS 1, there is a need to actively 
plan for housing growth in Knowsley. This includes setting a target for the amount 
of new housing to be developed in Knowsley up to 2028, and also principles to 
guide when and wh ere new housing will be delivered.  
Policy CS3  
Housing Supply, Delivery and Distribution  
New Housing Provision in Knowsley  
1) Provision will be made for 8,100 new dwellings to be delivered in Knowsley 
between 2010 and 2028, at an annual average of 450 dwelli ngs per annum. 
This is a minimum net figure, accounting for conversions, changes of use to 
and from residential use, and clearance of dwellings via demolition and is 
required to meet the need for new housing over the Plan period.  
Distribution of New Housi ng 
2) The broad indicative distribution of new housing development to be delivered 
over the plan period will be as follows: Huyton and Stockbridge Village (36%); 
Kirkby (16%); Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village (32%); and 
Halewood (16%).  
Supply and Phasing of Land for New Housing Development  
3) Land for housing development will be identified to ensure that a five year 
supply of deliverable sites is maintained at all times74. This will support the 
efficient use of available land and protection of urb an regeneration priorities, as 
outlined in Policy CS1 : Spatial Strategy for Knowsley  and Policy CS2 : 
Development Principles . Land identified for housing development within the 
Sustainable Urban Extensions will be r eleased subject to the requirements of 
Policies CS5  and SUE1 to SUE2c . 
                                            
74 A five year supply of housing land will be able to accommodate 2,250 dwellings, which is five 
times the annual target of 450 dwellings per annum. The five year land supply will also need to  
include an allowance for any ‘shortfall ’ accrued against the target from 2010 onwards.  Subject to 
historic delivery rates, national planning policy requires local authorities to identify an additional 
‘buffer ’ of either 5% or 20% on top of their five -year housing land requirement. The buffer required 
may change throughout the plan period in line with future monitoring and will be reported on an 
annual basis via the Council's Monitoring Report and/or Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment   
 
Page 54 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Housing Sizes, Tenures and Density  
4) The tenure, type and size of new housing delivered in Knowsley will support 
the re -balancing of the housi ng market to better meet housing needs and 
demands arising in Knowsley. Applications for new residential development 
must demonstrate how they contribute to this re -balancing.  
5) Densities of a minimum of 30 dwellings per hectare will be required for 
resident ial development in Knowsley. Lower densities will only be acceptable in 
circumstances where:  
a) The nature of the location in question allows for this; and  
b) It can be demonstrated that an identified local housing need will be met.

Establishing Housing Targets  
5.16 Policy CS 3 sets out the scale of new residential development to be 
accommodated in Knowsley up to 2028. The setting of a plan period a nd an 
average annual target for the delivery of new homes is a central element of the 
spatial strategy. The choice of targets has been informed by available evidence on 
local housing need and demand, housing land availability, and on their ability to 
meet national and local policy objectives. The policy is also consistent with the 
aims and objectives of the Knowsley Housing Strategy.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 55 5.17 The annual target of a minimum of 450 dwellings to be delivered per annum (net of 
demolitions, conversions and changes of use ) is supported by an up -to-date and 
evidence -based justification75. 
Operation of Housing Targets  
5.18 The annual and plan -period targets will operate as minima from 1st April 2010 until 
the year ending 31st March 2028. The Council's Monitoring Report will report  on 
performance against these targets each year. For years where the annual target is 
not met, the ‘shortfall ’ accrued will be accounted for within the following five years 
or alternativel y through a review of Policy CS 3. Should the annual target be 
signif icantly exceeded over a number of years, this may als o trigger a review of 
Policy CS 3. 
5.19 Policy CS3 complies with national planning policy for housing, including the need 
to have a flexible and responsive supply of housing land continually available. The 
policy particularly emphasises the importance of maintaining a ‘five year supply ’ of 
housing land, in accordance with national planning policy (including an allowance 
to address any shortfall accrued to date against the target within a five year period 
and an  additional ‘buffer ’ of either 5% or 20%. The buffer required may change 
throughout the plan period in line with future monitoring. This will be reported on 
an annual basis via the Council's Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
and/or Monitoring Reports). The approach of ‘plan, monitor, manage ’ will be 
employed, with the policy indicating that management of land should be efficient 
and effective whilst protecting brownfield reg eneration priorities. Policy CS 3 also 
complies with the national policy priority to focus new development on previously 
developed land.  
5.20 For clarity, an allowance for windfall sites76 will not be considered to be part of the 
housing land supply in Knowsley, which will be clearly set out in evidence base 
and monit oring reports. Nevertheless, the new housing development arising from 
these sites will be monitored on an annual basis and will be counted towards 
annual and overall targets for net housing delivery. In accordance with the NPPF , 
no allowance has been made in the Council's land supply assessments for new 
housing within residential gardens. The Council has historically received very few 
proposals for this type of development which will only be permitted where there is 
no unacceptable harm to the local area or  neighbouring properties.  
Rebalancing the Housing Market  
5.21 A key theme running through the Core Strategy is the need to rebalance the 
housing market in Knowsley in order to meet the needs of local people and 
                                            
75 For furt her details, see ‘Planning for Housing Growth in Knowsley ’ Technical Report ( Knowsley 
Council , 2013) , available online at http://www.knowsley.go v.uk/pdf/TR01_Planning -for-
HousingGrowth -Technical%20Report -Submission13.pdf  
76 A definition of ‘windfall sites ’ is given in Appendix B 'Detailed Definitions'   
 
Page 56 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
address projected out migration. This will include  widening the choice of market 
sector housing across the borough  whilst also helping to meet established needs 
for affordable housing. There is a particular need to broaden the mix of housing 
available in areas of relatively high deprivation such as North Huyton, Stockbridge 
Village and Kirkby.  
Location of New Housing  
5.22 Based on a wide range of evidence which is summarised in the technical papers 
which s upport this document, Policy CS 3 indicates in broad terms how new 
housing delivery will be split between th e different township areas of Knowsley. 
The higher proportion of housing to be located in Huyton and Stockbridge Village 
results in part from the residential development potential associated with the North 
Huyton regeneration programme, including the exist ing committed proposals for 
replacing previously demolished stock in this area. The township areas of the 
borough  will each receive between 16% and 36% of new residential development, 
depending on their individual needs, and availability of opportunities f or location of 
additional residential development in each area. It is expected that the 
percentages stated in Policy CS3 may be subject to minor alteration over the Plan 
period, as evidence regarding delivery and supply is updated. These changes will 
be re flected in future Local Plan Monitoring Reports.  
5.23 In meeting long -term housing targets in Knowsley, it is recognised that there is an 
overall shortage of housing land within the urban area and therefore a need for 
Green Belt release over the plan period. Th e detailed mechanism for review of 
Green Belt locations in Knowsley suitable for longer term residential deve lopment 
is set out in Policy CS 5: Green Belt . 
5.24 The currently envisaged trajectory of new housing delivery, which is based on a 
best-available estimate of the likely actual rate of delivery against the annual 
target, is illustrated in Figure 5.1: Knowsley Housing Trajectory . This illustrates the 
sources of land which are anticipated to contribute towards h ousing delivery over 
the plan period. Further details regarding this trajectory and its components are 
available within the Local Plan evidence base and supporting documents. It is 
critically important that new housing is delivered in accordance with the L ocal Plan 
objectives. The Council will therefore monitor the trajectory on an annual basis, 
and implement review mechanisms if necessary as part of its overall approach set 
out above. A review of Policy CS3 and of related policies may be appropriate if 
there is significant and sustained under -delivery of housing against the plan period 
target, to the extent to which the borough 's housing requirements can no longer be 
met successfully. Future Local Plan Monitoring Reports will consider this issue on 
an annua l basis.

Housing Density  
5.25 Policy CS 3 adopts a flexible approach to housing density, recognising that there is 
scope for densities to vary within the borough . This vari ance could be based on 
factors like site location (e.g. high densities adjacent to town centres and transport 
interchanges) or desirability of housing mix (e.g. lower density housing is needed 
to re-balance the mix of housing in some areas). However, given  housing land 
availability constraints which currently exist in Knowsley and the character of the 
borough , densities of at least 30 dwellings per hectare are considered to be 
appropriate and lower densities acceptable only in accordance with the criteria i n 
Policy CS3. There are some locations in Knowsley where densities of up to 40 
dwellings per hectare or higher may be acceptable.

Policy CS4: Economy and Employment  
5.26 A key requirement of the Core Strategy is to facilitate employment development of 
the rig ht type and in the right location to support the Council's employment 
priorities. This is particularly important given the high levels of socio -economic 
deprivation which exist in the borough . These and other requirem ents are 
addressed by Policy CS 4. 
Polic y CS4  
Economy and Employment  
Overall Employment Development Strategy  
1) Planning, site assembly and other available interventions will be used to:  
a) Support sustainable economic growth and meet the development needs of 
established and emerging employment sect ors, including the Liverpool City 
Region key economic sectors;  
b) Provide sufficient land to meet employment development needs to 2028;  
c) Enhance the quality and efficiency of land use within existing employment 
areas;  
d) Improve accessibility to an appropriate ra nge of jobs, for example by 
encouraging mixed use employment/ residential schemes where appropriate 
and improving transport linkages between housing and employment areas;  
e) Address skills and educational barriers to employment;  
f) Encourage recruitment targeted  towards communities living in and around 
the development site;  
g) Support new start up businesses including social enterprise;  
h) Encourage homeworking through improvements to digital communications 
and telecommunications infrastructure;  
i) Support the diversific ation of the rural economy; and  
j) Support the appropriate development of tourism facilities.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 59 Scale and Distribution of Development for Employment Uses  
2) Provision will be made for at least 164 hectares of land to be developed for 
employment uses77 between 2010  and 2028, to be located primarily within the 
following locations : 
 Knowsley Industrial Park (including Knowsley Business Park);  
 Huyton Business Park;  
 Kings Business Park;  
 South Prescot; and  
 Jaguar Land Rover (Halewood).  
3) Sites identified within Policy SUE1  have been removed from the Green Belt 
and allocated to meet needs for a high quality business park, large scale 
distribution/ logistics and any other appropriate uses within the Liverpool City 
Region key economic sectors up to 2028.  
Land Supply for Emplo yment Uses  
4) Land for employment development will be made available to ensure that at all 
times there is a sufficient range of available and deliverable sites and premises 
by size, location, type and suitability to meet the needs for employment 
development over the following five year period . 
‘Town Centre ’ Employment Uses – Retail, Leisure and Offices  
5) New retail and other main town centre uses, as defined in Appendix A : 
Glossary , will be primarily located within existing town  centres in accordance 
with Policy CS6 : Town Centres and Retail Strategy . A sequential approach to 
site selection shall be applied with locations in existing town, district and local 
centres of an appropriate scale being considered fir st, then edge of centre 
locations and then only if suitable sites are not available should out of centre 
sites be considered. For edge of centre and out of centre proposals, preference 
will be given to accessible sites that are well connected to the town c entre . 
6) Office uses may be located within accessible locations in the other employment 
areas listed in 2 ) provided that town centre and edge of centre sites have been 
considered first in accordance with the sequential approach. The sequential 
approach, howe ver, will not be required to be undertaken where the office use 
is ancillary to other employment uses.  
                                            
77 Defined as development within Classes B1 ( ‘Business ’); B2 ( ‘General Industrial ’) and B8 
(‘Storage and Distribution ’) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as 
amended). It should be noted that offices are main ‘town centre ’ uses which are also subject to 
criteria 5 and 6 of Policy CS4   
 
Page 60 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Safeguarding of Existing Employment Land  
7) Land which is currently in use or allocated for employment development will be 
safeguarded from changes to oth er types of development, except where: there 
is no current or likely future demand for employment uses on the land; or 
where other uses would bring wider regeneration, environmental and amenity 
benefits.

Local and Sub -Regional Employment Priorities  
5.27 As established in Chapter 2 : Knowsley – The Place , Knowsley's economy is 
inextricably linked with that of the wider Liverpool Cit y Region, with the borough 's 
large employment areas providing thousands of jobs for residents of Knowsley and 
of adjoining borough s. In order to support sustainable economic growth in 
Knowsley and the wider City Region, it is therefore crucial that the Cou ncil plans 
pro-actively to meet the development needs of businesses and support the 
economy.  
5.28 The Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership has identified four key 
sectors that have potential to create new jobs and new opportunities78. These are 
set out below, together with the contribution that Knowsley can make to meeting 
these:  
 Knowledge Economy – knowledge  intensive industries including advanced 
manufacturing, life sciences, creative and digital industries, environmental 
technologies, and financi al and professional services. Knowsley's infrastructure 
                                            
78 The Mersey Partnership Economic Review 2012 (TMP, 2012) , available online at 
http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/pdf/LC10_MerseyPartnershipEconomicReview2012.pdf   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 61 provides a competitive advantage across knowledge based industries in particular 
advanced manufacturing and financial and business services. Knowsley has an 
internationally recognised advanced manufac turing industry with companies such 
as Jaguar Land Rover, Getrag and Halewood International having chosen to 
locate in the borough . 
 Liverpool SuperPort – transformation  of the City Region's ports, airport, road, rail 
and logistics assets into a low carbon SuperPort of international status. Studies 
supporting the SuperPort strategy79 have identified a need for warehousing and 
available land for development that is suitable for logistics operations. Knowsley is 
well located to meet some of this demand by virtu e of its excellent transport links 
with the port and the wider transport network, and large employment areas such 
as Knowsley Industrial Park.  
 Low Carbon Economy – job creation and growth through new opportunities in the 
low carbon sector including: renewa ble energy generation, retrofitting homes and 
buildings, and low emission vehicles and transport. Knowsley Industrial Park is 
home to a growing nucleus of businesses in renewable energy and environmental 
technologies and has the potential to be a 'Green En ergy Hub'80. 
 Visitor Economy – establishing  the City Region as a major visitor destination 
through the marketing and development of the region's cultural and heritage 
assets, retail and hospitality offer and tourist attractions. The Council has identified 
considerable scope to further develop the established tourist destination of 
Knowsley Safari Park and to develop new facilities, for example connected with 
the historic heritage of Prescot and the borough 's extensive Green Infrastructure 
network.  
5.29 The Counci l's Economic Regeneration Strategy identifies that, in addition to 
supporting the growth of business and job opportunities, it is crucially important to 
provide policy interventions which help Knowsley residents to access the job 
opportunities which exist.  These measures include improving the accessibility of 
employment areas from areas where people live, and also implementing initiatives 
which provide training and support attainment levels of residents.  
Location and Types of Employment  
5.30 Policy CS 4 will focu s new employment investment into existing and new 
employment locations. A key priority will be to enhance the quality, effectiveness 
and accessibility of existing employment areas particularly Knowsley Industrial 
Park. The Council has published a comprehen sive regeneration framework for 
Knowsley Industrial Park, the planning and land use aspects of which will b e 
implemented through Policy CS 11: Principal Regeneration Area – Knowsley  
Industrial and Business Parks . Planning mechanisms in cluding the Council's 
compulsory purchase powers will be used as and when necessary within available

Page 62 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
resources to implement the regeneration of Knowsley Industrial Park and other 
existing employment areas, as appropriate.  
5.31 Chapter 3 : Vision and Objectives  identified the need to address barriers to 
employment and raise attainment levels. Land use and development interventions 
will be used to support this, including support for training and educational 
initiatives and us e of legal agreements with developers to encourage use of Local 
Labour in Construction initiatives. The sustainability of the rural economy and 
tourism sectors are also important, including major tourist attractions at Knowsley 
Hall and Knowsley Safari Par k. There is potential for a more detailed policy focus 
as part of the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies document to 
support the appropriate diversification and development of these aspects of the 
Knowsley economy.  
Scale of Development f or Employment Uses  
5.32 The Joint Employment Land and Premises Study81 identified future employment 
land requirements in Halton, Knowsley, Sefton and West Lancashire. The 
consultants assessed different methods for predicting employment land 
requirements. Their p referred approach was based on historic development trends 
and, taking account of business requirements and economic conditions, included 
an additional buffer to accommodate potential increased delivery in the future. The 
Liverpool City Region ‘Overview St udy’82 subsequently assessed the different 
methods used by  eight local authorities across the City Region in their 
employment land studies. That study was undertaken in part to ensure 
consistency across the City Region as a whole in the assessment of future  needs.  
5.33 The findings of these studies, together with an updated evidence base and 
assessment of different future scenarios have been used by the Council to define 
the requirement for employment land development  in Policy CS 4. Over the plan 
period from 2010  to 2028 the Council considers there to be a need for a minimum 
of 164 hectares of employment land . Achieving this  requirement requires the 
release of some G reen Belt land (see Policy SUE1  for further details).

5.34 The employment land requirement will be closely monitored through annually 
published Monitoring Reports to assess delivery performance, ensure a sufficient 
range and choice of sites to attract investment and identify any changes in 
circumstances over the plan period.  
5.35 A key component of the requirement will be the need to maintain an adequate 
choice of sites for developers (by site size, location and type) which is available 
and deliverable for employment use. This requirement will be monitored in 
accordance with Appendix D . 
Sequential Approach to the Location of Main Town Centre Employment Uses  
5.36 Town and district centres are considered to be the most suitable location for main 
town centre employ ment uses, including offices. This is because they are the most 
suitable locations based upon public transport accessibility and strategic road links  
 
Page 64 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
to support employment uses which generate a large amount of traffic, together 
with the additional benefits  of increasing the viability and vita lity of town centres. 
Policy CS 4 therefore requires applications for main town centre uses to be located 
in town centres as a first preference, with ‘edge of centre ’ locations being 
considered if a suitable town centre site is not available. If a suitable town centre 
or ‘edge of centre ’ site is not available, ‘out of centre ’ locations will be considered. 
For proposals which are outside existing centres, preference will be given to 
locations which are accessible by a choi ce of transport in accordance with Policy 
CS7. Office uses which can only be located in ‘out of centre ’ locations should be 
directed towards accessible locations in Knowsley's employment areas as a first 
preference, before other ‘out o f centre ’ locations are considered.  
Safeguarding of Existing Employment Land  
5.37 Policy CS 4 also reflects a need to safeguard most existing employment locations 
from changes of use to other uses. This is with the exception of a small part of 
Huyton Business Pa rk and in South Prescot, where the Council considers there to 
be scope to allow some of the land to be changed to residential use. The Council 
considers that the remaining employment areas should be safeguarded to meet 
employment needs, particularly as man y locations (e.g. Knowsley Industrial Park) 
are of a nature where change to residential use would not be appropriate due to 
the existence of hazardous installations and an inappropriate environment for 
housing purposes. In this regard, new employment devel opment is also prioritised 
in areas that have the least potential for negative impact upon the health and 
wellbeing of local residents.

Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 65 Policy CS 5: Green Belt  
5.38 As established in Chapter 2 : Knowsley – The Place , approximate ly half of 
Knowsley's land area is designated as Green Belt. The approach towards the 
future of the Green Belt is therefore one of the most important issues tackled in the 
Knowsley Local Plan. This m atter is addressed in Policy CS5 and in Policies SUE1 
and SUE 2 –SUE2c. 
Policy CS5  
Green Belt  
New Development in the Green Belt  
1) Inappropriate development will not be permitted in the Green Belt except in 
very special circumstances in which it has been demonstrated that the harm to 
the Gree n Belt (including any harm to its openness, purposes or to its visual 
and recreational amenities) would be clearly outweighed by other 
considerations.  
Major Previously Developed Sites in the Green Belt  
2) Major Previously Developed Sites in the Green Belt w ill be identified in the 
Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.  
3) Limited infilling and redevelopment of Major Previously Developed Sites in the 
Green Belt is considered appropriate provided it would not have a greater 
impact upon the opennes s of the Green Belt and the purposes of including land 
within it.  
Review of Green Belt Boundaries to meet future development needs  
4) A number of locations (identified as Sustainable Urban Extensions and 
safeguarded land) have been removed from the Green Be lt to accommodate 
development needs up to and beyond 2028. Guidance concerning the 
development of these locations is set out in Policies SUE1 , SUE2 , SUE2a , 
SUE2b  and SUE2c .

History of the Green Belt in Knowsley and Merseyside  
5.39 The areas designated as Green Belt in Knowsley form part  of the Merseyside 
Green Belt, originally established by the Merseyside Green Belt Local Plan 
(adopted in 1983). The Green Belt boundaries across Merseyside (including in 
Knowsley) were drawn tightly around the existing urban area and have been 
subject to only relatively minor changes subsequently. Since 1983 the Merseyside 
Green Belt has played a valuable role, for example by maintaining separation 
between existing urban areas and promoting regeneration.  
5.40 Policy CS 5 establishes that, in accordance with the NPPF , inappropriate forms of 
development will continue to be resisted in the Green Belt.  
Purposes of the Green Belt and Inappropriate Development  
5.41 The NPPF  states that the fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban 
sprawl by keeping land perm anently open, and that a key attribute of land in the 
Green Belt is its openness. It also sets out the five purposes of including land in 
the Green Belt, which are:  
1. To check unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas;  
2. To prevent neighbouring towns f rom merging into one another;  
3. To assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;  
4. To preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and  
5. To assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and 
other urb an land.  
5.42 National planning policy includes  a general presumption against permitting 
inappropriate development within the Green Belt. In this context, ‘inappropriate 
development ’ includes all new buildings except those which (in summary) are 
required for: a griculture and forestry; outdoor sport, outdoor recreation and 
cemeteries; the limited extension or alteration, or replacement, of existing 
buildings; limited infilling in villages or the partial or complete redevelopment of  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 67 previously developed sites. A m ore complete definition of inappropriate 
development is set out in the NPPF . The over -riding principle is that new 
development in the Green Belt should preserve the openness of the Green Belt 
and reflect the purposes of its designation.  
Previously Develope d Sites within the Green Belt  
5.43 The Council wishes to allow appropriate future development within previously 
developed sites in the Green Belt provided the openness of the Green Belt is 
preserved. Such sites vary widely in type and size and smaller sites wil l not be 
identified specifically on the Policies Map. However a number of previously 
developed sites in Knowsley's Green Belt including Kings Business Park and 
several sites used for operational needs by utility companies are of a major scale. 
The Council intends to identify these major sites in the Local Plan: Site Allocations 
and Development Policies, which may also include detailed policy guidance 
regarding new development within them.  
The Need for a Review of Green Belt Boundaries  
5.44 National planning policy requires that Green Belt boundaries (once set) should be 
permanent. However, where exceptional circumstances exist (e.g. to 
accommodate sufficient land to meet development requirements) local authorities 
may review the boundaries when preparing developm ent plans, in conjunction with 
neighbouring authorities as appropriate.  
5.45 Knowsley's development requirements for housing and employment develo pment 
are outlined in Policy CS 3: Housing Supply, Delivery and Distribution  and Policy 
CS4: Economy and Employment  respectively. The Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment83 and the Joint Employment Land and Premises Study 
concluded that there is not enough suitable land for housing and employment 
development within the existing urban areas of Knowsley to meet development 
requirements until 2028. The Liverpool City Region Housing and Economic 
Development Evidence Base Overview Study84 assessed all housing and 
employment evidence collated by individual districts within the Liverpool City 
Region. The study aimed to determine whether districts had sufficient land to meet 
housing and employment growth requirements in the longer term. The Study 
confirmed that whilst in headline terms there is a balance of supply for housing 
and employment land across the City Region including surpluses in Liverpool and 
Wirral, there are significant shortages in Knowsley, Sefton and West Lancashire 
which will need to be addressed.  
5.46 Taking account of the Overview Study, the nature of the linkages in  housing 
markets and travel to work areas, and the need to ensure delivery of an 
                                            
83 Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment – 2012 Update (Knowsley Council, 2012)  
84 Liverpool City Region Housing and Economic Development Evidence Base Overview Stud y 
(GVA Grimley, 2011)   
 
Page 68 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
appropriate supply of sites throughout the Plan period, the Council has removed a 
number of Sustainable Urban Extensions from the Green Belt to meet 
development needs.  
5.47 The Cou ncil's evidence base85 explores a number of alternatives to Green Belt 
release including:  
 Releasing urban greenspace for development; Building at higher densities;  
 Transferring some of the borough 's development requirements to neighbouring 
districts; and  
 Remodelling and/ or intensified development within Principal Regeneration Areas.  
5.48 While additional housing and employment land supply has been identified from 
some of these sources, there is still a requirement for changes to Knowsley's 
Green Belt boundaries in order to identify a supply of housing and employment 
land up to 2028. Furthermore, the Council's Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment suggests that without reviewing the Green Belt boundary, Knowsley 
would be unable to maintain a 5 -year ‘deliverable ’ supply of housing land86 beyond 
the short to medium term.  
5.49 In the context of employment land, Green Belt release is required specifically to 
address Knowsley’s overall development requirements up to 2028 and beyond. 
The immediate release of Sustaina ble Urban Extensions is necessary to provide 
an improved range, choice and quality of sites to address specific employment 
needs. These include provision for a high quality business park (as a successor to 
Kings Business Park, which is almost fully develop ed) and large scale distribution 
and logistics.  
5.50 National planning policy also requires that, in reviewing the Green Belt boundaries, 
the Council should consider a timescale beyond the length of the plan, i.e. beyond 
2028. This requirement aims to ensure th e revised Green Belt boundaries will 
endure, and to prevent further incremental amendments over this longer period.

Employment Growth in Knowsley’ Technical Report, the Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment, and Joint Employment Land and Premises St udy

Page 69 Policy CS 6: Town Centres and Retail Strategy  
5.51 The NPPF  requires the Knowsley Local Plan to define a network and hierarchy of 
town, district  and local centres, including the role of each centre, and the level of 
development required to meet the needs of their catchment areas. The hierarchy 
is intended to be resilient to anticipated future economic changes, with new 
development focused in exist ing centres (as opposed to out of centre locations) in 
accordance with a sequential approach and appropriate to the anticipated role of 
each centre.  
Policy CS6  
Town Centres and Retail Strategy  
Knowsley’s Hierarchy of Centres  
1) In order to enhance the vital ity and viability of Knowsley's centres and maintain 
appropriate local service provision, the following hierarchy shall apply:  
a) Huyton , Kirkby  and Prescot Town Centres  will enhance their equal role in 
providing comparison and convenience shopping. This will  be 
supplemented by a complementary mix of leisure, health, residential, 
education, cultural, employment, service uses and complementary evening 
and night time uses.  
b) Halewoo d (Ravenscourt) , Liverpool Road /Page Moss  and Stockbridge 
Village  will retain a di strict centre role providing a local shopping function to 
complement the town centres, mainly focused on convenience shopping 
and services appropriate to local needs.  
c) Local Centres87 will provide local shopping and service provision of an 
appropriate scale relative to the size and function of each centre.  
2) Proposals for retail and other ‘main town centre uses ’ outside the above 
centres will only be permitted if they would complement regeneration 
opportunities, avoid significant impact upon the viability and v itality of the town, 
district and local centres, and comply with the sequential test in Policy CS4 : 
Economy and Employment . 
3) The boundaries of all the centres within the hierarchy (including primary 
shopping areas, and primary/ secondar y frontages, as appropriate), together 
with any potential development opportunities and associated development 
policies will be defined in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development 
Policies document.  
                                            
87 As defined in Appendix B: Detailed Definitions  of this document   
 
Page 70 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Comparison Goods Shopping  
4) New comparison goods shopping will be broadly distributed and phased as set 
out in Table 5.2: Indicative Distribution of Capacity for New Comparison Retail 
Floorspace 2012 –2028  and Table 5.3: Indicative Phasing of Development of 
New Comparison Retail Floors pace 2012 –2028  and will support the priorities in 
each centre as set out below:  
a) Kirkby Town Centre  – the delivery of significant retail -led regeneration 
opportunities in and around the town centre in accordan ce with Policy 
CS10: Principal Regeneration Area – Kirkby Town Centre . 
b) Prescot Town Centre  – to complement regeneration priorities within the 
existing centre and to improve linkage to Cables Retail Pa rk in accordance 
with Policy CS 14 Principal Regeneration Area – Prescot Town Centre . 
c) Huyton Town Centre  – to complement regeneration opportunities within 
the existing centre, including opportunities for remodelling and refocusing 
the retail density and mix of uses.  
d) District and Local Centres  – to deliver regeneration opportunities of an 
appropriate scale to the role and function of each centre.  
Convenience Goods Shopping  
5) New convenience retail floorspace should be broadly distributed as set out in 
Table 5.4: Indicative Distribution of Capacity for Convenience Retail 
Floorspace 2012 –2028 , to address existing gaps in provision and deliver 
regeneration opportunities proportionate to the scale and catchment of each 
centre identifi ed. Within Kirkby Town Centre  this development shall be 
completed at the earliest opportunity. Proposals for convenience retail 
floorspace in Knowsley's other centres shall:  
a) Address the potential need for new or restructured local centres to support 
regene ration priorities within Knowsley Industrial Park , North Huyton  and 
Tower Hill  in Kirkby; and  
b) Support local needs, including sustainable provision where appropriate 
within areas of new development in locations removed from the Green Belt, 
in accordance wit h Policy CS5 : Green Belt . 
Delivery and Monitoring  
6) The preferred distribution and phasing of new retail floorspace in  Table 5.2: 
Indicative Distribution of Capacity for New Comparison Retail Floorspace 
2012 –2028 , Table 5.3: Indicative Phasing of Development of New Comparison 
Retail Floors pace 2012 –2028  and Table 5.4: Indicative Distribution of Capacity 
for Convenience Retail Floorspace 2012 –2028  are indicative and will be 
subject to review during the plan period informed by the Council's Monitoring 
Reports to reflect changes in retail need and capacity.

Hierarchy of Centres  
5.52 Policy CS 6 seeks to retain the established retail hierarchy within Knowsley. This is 
based upon the Knowsley Town Centres and Shopping Study88 which identified a 
distinction between existing town centres, district centres and local centres in 
terms of their scale, function and catchment areas where localised needs are 
served. The definitions of town centre, district centre and local centre are provided 
within Appendix B : Detailed Definitions . 
5.53 Knowsley's town centres occupy equal status due to their separate catchment 
areas which serve local retail and service needs. Each town centre is currently 
retaining a low proportion of shopping expenditure from their local area and no 
single centre is capable of attaining a dominant position to provide suitable 
customer choice for local comparison retail needs. The poor performance of 
Knowsley's town centres emphasises the need for their improvement as locations 
for sh opping, leisure and other main town centre uses to support sustainable 
economic growth, by ensuring a diverse local offer which complements larger 
centres in the Liverpool City Region (primarily Liverpool and St. Helens ). 
5.54 Existing district centres have no realistic opportunity or need to obtain equal status 
with the three town centres. In particular, the recent implementation of planning 
permissions at Halewood (Ravenscourt) and Stockbridge Village intend to 
consolidate their existing status in the long ter m relative to identified need, rather 
than offering scope for significant expansion of scale and function.  
5.55 Policy CS 6 also categorises the small centres into major and medium sized local 
centres, and minor parades on the basis of current size, number of ex isting local

2010)

needs operators and potential to consolidate their position relative to catchment 
area. The detailed sub categorisation is provided within Appendix B : Detailed 
Definitions , with further detailed crite ria for new development in these centres to 
be provided in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies 
document as appropriate.  
5.56 Proposals for retail development or other town centre uses in an ‘edge of centre ’ 
or ‘out of centre ’ location will  not be considered appropriate to provide or 
disaggregate the delivery of suggested ranges of retail floorspace during the plan 
period, unless acceptable justification is provided in accordance with the 
sequential approach to town c entre uses set out in Policy CS 4: Economy and 
Employment . Justification should include evidence of an absence of suitable, 
available and viable sites in town, district or local centres, before ‘edge of centre ’ 
then ‘out of centre ’ locations could be considere d suitable. In these circumstances, 
preference will be given to sites which are well connected to town centres, and 
where sufficient flexibility has been demonstrated in terms of format and scale. An 
impact assessment will also be required if the developme nt exceeds 2,500 sq.m. 
(or any locally set threshold defined in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and 
Development Policies document). Impact assessments will be expected to assess 
for example the effects of the scheme on the viability or vitality of any est ablished 
town, district or local centres.  
Comparison Retail  
5.57 Due to the current poor performance of Knowsley’s three existing town centres 
identified in the Knowsley Town Centres and Shopping Study, there is a need for 
additional comparison floorspace prima rily focused in Huyton, Kirkby and Prescot. 
The anticipated scale and distribution of this need is based on increased levels of 
expenditure retention in Knowsley centres ranging from a 'moderate' increase (a 
10% rise) to a 'significant' increase (a 15% ris e). 
5.58 Planning for new retail development towards the upper increase threshold where 
possible is necessary to enhance the viability and vitality of Huyton, Kirkby and 
Prescot during the plan period until 2028. This will ensure that the scale and 
function of Knowsley's town centres remain proportionate and consistent with their 
role at the heart of large suburban communities. However the upper level of 
growth remains an aspiration which may not be achievable beyond initial 
regeneration priorities given the ext ent of new retail development required in 
Kirkby to meet the lower threshold, constraints to large scale remodelling in both 
Huyton and Prescot, and the presence of Cables Retail Park. It is therefore 
considered appropriate to initially plan for a more con servative baseline 
improvement of a 10 percentage point increase, but include flexibility for additional 
growth during the plan period.  
5.59 To enhance the performance, function and individuality of Knowsley's town and 
district centres, a varied distribution of  new development is necessary to address 
deficiencies, support regeneration opportunities and assist improvements to  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 73 existing design and layouts. The indicative distribution relating to need and 
opportunity is provided in  Table 5.2, including extant permissions which have not 
commenced development.  
Table 5.2: Indicative Distribution of Capacity for New Comparison Retail 
Floorspace 2012 –2028  
Location  Floorspace Range (gross internal)  
Huyton Town Centre  4,100 sq.m –6,800 sq.m  
Kirkby Town Centre  24,600 sq.m –31,400 sq.m  
Prescot Town Centre  4,100 sq.m –6,800 sq.m  
Unallocated Reserve for Hierarchy of Centres  3,710 sq.m –7,310 sq.m  
 
5.60 The release of the unallocated reserve to supplement the ra nge of floorspace 
allocated to town centres, as opposed to district or local centres, will remain 
dependent on impact considerations relative to neighbouring centres and updated 
catchment needs assessment to respond to the effect of any preceding in -centre  
development during the plan period. The catchment area for a proposed 
development should not be significantly larger than the centre within which it is 
located.  
5.61 An outline planning application for a comprehensive phased re -development of 
Kirkby Town Centr e, including a new supermarket and expansion to the south of 
Cherryfield Drive, was approved in 2011 (planning application reference: 
10/00505/OUT). The detailed requirements which support the retail led 
regeneration within Kirkby are set out in Policy CS10 : Principal Regeneration Area 
– Kirkby  Town Centre . In view of the existing regeneration needs and opportunities 
within Kirkby, the projected phased release of the new comparison retail 
floorspace is expected to be higher in the earl y part of the plan period as set out in 
Table 5.3 to accommodate the anticipated timescale of development.  
Table 5.3: Indicative Phasing of Development of New Comparison Retail 
Floors pace 2012 –2028  
Five Year Period  Floorspace Range (gross internal)  
2012 –2017  21,900 sq.m –31,390 sq.m  
2018 –2022  9,130 sq.m –13,080 sq.m  
2023 –2028  5,480 sq.m –7,840 sq.m  
Total (2012 –2028)  36,510 sq.m –52,310 sq.m  
 
5.62 Table 5.3 provides indicative measures against which to monitor ongoing delivery 
of retail development over the plan period. The indicative phasing of development 
illustrates a front loading of identified need to accommodate existing commitments. 
It is not however intended to restrict other opportunities for delivery of sustainable  
 
Page 74 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
retail growth that positively contribute to the viability and vitality of Knowsley’s 
town, district and local centres at the earliest opportunity. Performance monitoring 
of delive ry relative to up to date evidence relating to needs, together with the 
indicative capacity ranges, distribution to centres and phasing schedule will be 
managed through the Council's Monitoring Reports in accordance with the policy 
delivery mechanisms set out at Appendix D . 
5.63 A need for additional convenience retail floorspace was also identified by the 
Knowsley Town Centres and Shopping Study based upon scenarios for increased 
expenditure retention ranging from a 'mo derate' increase of 8% to a 'significant' 
increase of 14%.  
5.64 The majority of need for new convenience retail floorspace arises in the early part 
of the plan period up to 2017, due to unacceptably low levels of expenditure 
retention and an uneven quality of p rovision, including the absence of a major 
foodstore in Kirkby Town Centre. This removes the need for indicative phasing of 
convenience retail over the plan period, noting that this centre has an extant 
planning permission. The indicative distribution is p rovided in Table 5.4, including 
extant permissions which have not commenced development and an unallocated 
reserve to support other sustainable opportunities to improve provision relative to 
local needs.  
Table 5.4: Indicative Distribution of Capacity for Convenience Retail 
Floorspace 2012 –2028  
Location  Floorspace Range (gross internal)  
Kirkby Town Centre  4,750 sq.m –7,000 sq.m  
Unallocated Reserve to Support Local Needs  1,430 sq.m –5,380 sq.m  
 
5.65 Convenience retail within the latter part of the plan period should be focused upon 
modernisation and replacement of existing facilities within the main centres rather 
than addressing a specific need for new facilities or an increa se in convenience 
floorspace, with a lower proportion of convenience floorspace disaggregated at an 
appropriate scale to enhance local provision necessary to support housing growth 
and/or regeneration priorities.  
Leisure Uses  
5.66 The leisure sector is dynamic , changing and operator -led. Forecast growth in 
expenditure on leisure services is anticipated to be distributed to a wide range of 
activities, with no single activity capturing a significant market share. The Council 
will encourage investment in leisure d evelopment provided it conforms to the 
sequential and impact tests within the NPPF , therefore no indicative target sectors 
or floorspace capacities are inc luded in Policy CS 6.

Page 75 Primary Shopping Areas  
5.67 The broad locations of Primary Shopping Areas in Knowsley 's Town Ce ntres are 
identified as follows:  
 Huyton Town Centre : Derby  Road, Cavendish Walk and immediate surroundings;  
 Kirkby Town Centre:  St. Chad's Parade and immediate surroundings ; and  
 Prescot Town Centre : Eccleston Street and immediate surroundings . 
5.68 The specific boundaries of primary shopping areas (including primary and 
secondary frontages where appropriate) together with associated development 
policies, will be defined in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development 
Policies document.    
 
Page 76 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Policy CS7:  Transport Networks  
5.69 A key aspect of the Knowsley Local Plan will be to support a sustainable transport 
system and geographical pattern of development which minimises the need to 
travel and will help grow the borough ’s economy, ensuring that jobs, shops and  
services are accessible to all, leading to a lesser reliance on the car for travel. This 
will help to improve the environment and the health and wellbeing of residents.  
Policy CS7  
Transport Networks  
Overall Transport Strategy  
1) Planning powers and other i nterventions will be used to support a sustainable 
and integrated transport system that will:  
a) Support the economy by facilitating efficient movement of people and goods 
within the borough  and linking to Liverpool City Centre, the Port of 
Liverpool, Liverpo ol John Lennon Airport and other destinations in the 
surrounding area;  
b) Help meet the development needs of the borough  through to 2028;  
c) Ensure people can get to where they need to by a choice of walking, cycling 
and public transport;  
d) Enhance road safety;

Achieving Sustainable Transport  
5.70 The NPPF acknowledges tha t transport policies have an important role to play in 
facilitating sustainable development and in contributing to wider sustainability and 
health objectives. Local Plans are required to give people a real choice about how 
they travel. They should where po ssible support a pattern of development which 
facilitates the use of sustainable modes of transport. Sites and routes which could 
be critical in developing infrastructure that will widen transport choice should be 
identified and protected.  
5.71 The NPPF also st ates that local authorities should work with neighbouring 
authorities and transport providers to develop strategies for the provision of viable 
infrastructure necessary to support sustainable development. This includes large 
scale facilities such as rail f reight interchanges and transport investment 
necessary to support strategies for the growth of ports, airports or other major 
generators of travel demand.  
5.72 In addition, the Government's Delivering a Sustainable Transport System89 sets a 
number of goals for t he future transport system, including supporting economic 
competitiveness and growth, reducing emissions attributable to transport, 
contributing to health outcomes, promoting greater equality of opportunity, and 
improving quality of life and the environmen t. Policy CS7 seeks to contribute to 
these objectives, through its broad transport strategy and content relating to the

Third Merseyside Local Transport Plan  
5.73 The Th ird Merseysid e Local Transport Plan (LTP3)90 provides a strategy and 
delivery programme of transport investment and service improvements up to 2024. 
Its vision is to provide:  
‘A City Region, committed to a low carbon future which has a transport network 
and mobility culture which positively contributes to a thriving economy and the 
health and well being of its citizens and where sustainable travel is the option of 
choice. ’ 
5.74 A local implementation plan to support the LTP3 has been produced by the 
Council. LTP3  includes the principles of the Liverpool City Region Low Emission 
Strategy (LES). Merseytravel are currently investigating the feasibility of a 
framework by which financial contributions from developers can be used to fund 
infrastructure. Policy CS7 will help to achieve these objectives and will support the 
regeneration and sustainability objectives of the Local Plan.  
5.75 The strategic transport schemes and p rogrammes outlined in Policy CS 7 accord 
with LTP3 priorities identified on a sub -regional basis. These include longer term 
safeguarded schemes and priorities for which there is not yet any clear delivery 
mechanism. They have been included in order to retain the long term flexibility of 
the schemes and to protect them from development which may prejudice the ir 
eventual implementation.  
Ensuring a Choice of Travel and Local Parking Standards  
5.76 The NPPF advises that developments which generate significant movement are 
located where the need to travel will be minimised and the use of sustainable 
transport modes can  be maximised. All developments that generate significant 
amounts of movement should be supported by a Transport Statement or Transport 
Assessment and should be required to provide a Travel Plan. The Ensuring a 
Choice of Travel SPD for Knowsley was adopted  in advance of the Local Plan. It is 
consistent with the NPPF and the  approach outlined in Policy CS 7. Generally the 
SPD encourages larger development to be located in more accessible areas and 
expects developments to promote walking, cycling, and public t ransport. Where a 
development is not able to meet minimum accessibility criteria, developers may be 
required to make a contribution to deal with the specific issues connected with the 
development.

(Merseyside Integrated Transport Authority, 2011)   
 
Page 80 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
5.77 The Ensuring a Choice of Travel SPD also includes local par king standards for 
each type and size of development. It outlines when proposed development will 
require a Transport Assessment or Transport Statement and/ or a Travel Plan to be 
submitted. The SPD may be reviewed in the future to ensure that it conforms to 
the Local Plan.  
Aviation Safeguarding  
5.78 Safeguarding Zones around airports and aerodromes are established by the 
Secretary of State and defined by safeguar ding maps issued by the Civil Aviation 
Authority (CAA). They define certain types of development that by reason of their 
height, attraction to birds or inclusion of, or effect on, aviation activity will require 
prior consultation with the airport or aerodr ome operator. A number of 
safeguarding areas for Liverpool John Lennon Airport relate to land wi thin 
Knowsley, including a 30km consultation zone for wind turbine development.  
   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 81 Policy CS 8: Green Infrastructure  
5.79 Green Infrastructure planning has emerged in the last five years as an effective 
way to comprehensively manage the natural environment to safeguard landscape 
and vital ecosystem services providing a wide range of benefits to society, 
supporting sustainable growth. As the benefits and linkages of Gree n 
Infrastructure are not constrained by local authority boundaries, it is important that 
Knowsley supports and contributes to the sub -regional planning of Green 
Infrastructure to maximise benefits for the borough  and its surrounding areas.  
Policy CS8  
Green  Infrastructure  
Maintenance and Enhancement of Knowsley's Existing Green Infrastructure  
1) Knowsley's existing Green Infrastructure and its beneficial functions will be 
protected, managed and/ or enhanced, primarily to:  
a) Ensure more attractive and cleaner re sidential neighbourhoods;  
b) Sustain and promote biodiversity (including designated sites, priority 
habitats and protected and endangered species) in accordance with 
importance and contribution to ecological networks;  
c) Preserve the character and function of hi storic environments and valued 
landscapes;  
d) Mitigate the effects of climate change and flood risk;  
e) Mitigate air, water and noise pollution;  
f) Provide local opportunities for sport, recreation and allotments; and  
g) Provide sustainable transport linkages between residential neighbourhoods 
and easy access to employment and services.  
2) To achieve the above, planning powers and other interventions will be used to:  
a) Protect and enhance strategicall y important areas of greenspace;  
b) Ensure an appropriate quantity and improv ed quality of locally important 
open spaces, including outdoor sports provision (and ancillary facilities of 
appropriate scale);  
c) Promote effective movement of wildlife through a network of strategic green 
links, by protecting, maintaining and improving exi sting and new open 
spaces, water courses (including water quality) and biodiversity assets;  
d) Protect, enhance and/ or introduce biodiversity into existing areas of Green 
Infrastructure, through integration into the design of new development and 
public realm  projects;  
e) Improve accessibility for communities to greenspace offering leisure and 
recreation opportunities;  
f) Protect and where possible improve green paths and cycleways linking 
residential areas, existing strategic areas of greenspace, employment 
locatio ns, local community services and leisure facilities;  
g) Work in partnership with other districts and relevant bodies at a landscape 
scale to minimise the impact of development upon Knowsley's existing  
 
Page 82 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
biodiversity and geological assets, and sustain the protec tion afforded to 
internationally important sites, including supporting habitat, for biodiversity 
outside of the borough ; and  
h) Deliver new integrated and functional Green Infrastructure that helps to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as sustainable drainage 
systems, carbon capture and storage, soft landscaping and green roofs.  
3) Site allocations for greenspace will be identified in the Local Plan: Site 
Allocations and Development Policies  document , with further guidance set out 
in the Developer Contrib utions Supplementary Planning Document or future 
Supplementary Planning Document as appropriate.  
Strategic Green Links  
4) Knowsley's strategically important green links are:  
a) Alt Corridor (Huyton) – stretching from Huyton Village through South Alt 
Park, Alt Park, Alt Meadows and into Stockbridge Village;  
b) Valley Corridor (Kirkby) – stretching through Valley Meadow, St. Chad's 
Park, Millbrook Park, Millennium Green and Mill Dam;  
c) Whiston to Cronton Corridor – stretching through Cronton, Stadt Moers 
Park and Whis ton Greenway;  
d) Halewood Triangle – Halewood Park linkage with the Trans -Pennine Trail 
and to the national cycle network;  
e) M57 Green Belt Corridor; and  
f) Knowsley Hall Estate – including Knowsley Safari Park and Local Wildlife 
Sites.  
Green Infrastructure withi n the Liverpool City Region  
5) Knowsley Council will work with partners to help deliver local and sub -regional 
programmes, initiatives and strategies to enhance Green Infrastructure.  
Approach to Green Infrastructure and New Development  
6) New development must  be served by Green Infrastructure to meet the needs of 
residents and the local environment, in a manner which will:  
a) Contribute to the creation of a high quality residential environment;  
b) Provide access to high quality open space for leisure and recreationa l 
purposes;  
c) Seek to protect, maintain and where possible enhance biodiversity within 
and around new developments according to their designation and 
significance to provide space for nature; and  
d) Provide adequate mitigation and/ or, as a last resort, compensation for 
Green Infrastructure or biodiversity loss, in circumstances where harm 
resulting from the development is otherwise unavoidable.

Functions and Benefits of Green Infrastructure  
5.80 Knowsley's existing integrated network of open spaces and water bodies within 
and around the borough 's towns and villages provides a range of benefits in terms 
of biodiversity, climate change adaptation, education, local economy and 
increased property values. It also contributes to health and well being (including 
allowing people to interact with the natu ral environment to promote mental 
wellbeing), historic character, land and water management, landscape value, 
linkages between places, outdoor recreation, sport and leisure, public accessibility, 
quality of place, rural enterprise, tourism and waste manage ment.  
5.81 The Council actively conserves and manages Green Infrastructure to enhance its 
quality, connectivity and accessibility, and to create new areas where needed. The 
general approach towards Green Infrastructure is supported by national 
guidance91 which r ecognises the need to maintain and enhance the ‘green and 
blue infrastructure ’ – trees, plants, absorbent surfaces, streams, ponds and rivers. 
This helps to mitigate climate change, promote biodiversity and prevent flooding. 
Furthermore new development in Knowsley will require improvements to the 
Green Infrastructure network, both to meet the needs of residents and to 
counteract the effects of new hard infrastructure (roads, sewers and utilities etc). 
Policy CS8 (in conjunction with Policy CS21 : Greenspaces and Trees ) will help 
secure these improvements.

5.82 Many of Knowsley's greenspaces perform secondary Green Infrastructure 
functions and are extremely important for the local community as locations for 
sporting, recreational and other com munity uses. They also have a valuable role in 
improving the borough ’s natural and built environment. The spaces also include 72 
sites designated as Local Wildlife Sites (LWS) or Local Geological Sites (LGS). 
These designations are non -statutory but reflec t the locally important nature 
conservation interest within the sites and are supplemented by other designations 
which include Priority Habitats. Acornfield Plantation Local Nature Reserve (LNR) 
is Knowsley's only national statutory designation at present and there are no 
existing international designations.  
Green Infrastructure Opportunities  
5.83 The Green Infrastructure resource within Knowsley faces a number of challenges 
including:  
 Uneven distribution of Green Infrastructure between different parts of Knowsl ey, 
particularly in urban areas;  
 The spaces differ significantly in scale, quality and diversity, ranging from sites of  
sub-regional significance such as the Knowsley Hall Estate, to small pockets of 
surplus amenity green space in residential areas;  
 An abs ence of local identity and local ownership of many greenspaces;  
 Limited good quality green corridor provision in the borough , providing 
opportunities for walking and cycling;  
 Limited availability of sites within some urban areas to provide opportunities fo r 
new open spaces, and  
 There is a need to improve the water quality in many  of Knowsley’s water bodies92. 
5.84 Evidence relating to the other functions of Green Infrastructure in Knowsley and 
the wider area (including its contribution to health and wellbeing) is  developing 
through the Liverpool City Region  Green Infrastructure Framework93. This was  
finalised during 2014  and informs the approach to the designation of strategic 
Green Infrastructure within Knowsley, to reflect the increased benefits of an 
integrated approach, whereby multiple individual locations and sites within existing 
greenspace typologies offer greater cumulative value when comprehensively 
considered. In effect, strategic areas within Knowsley are the green links which 
integrate townships and com munities. However any proposed improvements to 
access and enhanced recreation opportunities should avoid detrimental impact 
upon the potential for alternative Green Infrastructure functions of important sites, 
including areas of natural conservation value and/or sites including important 
species and habitats.  
                                            
92 The Eu ropean Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) , available online via 
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water -framework/index_en.html , requires all surface water 
bodies to achieve good ecological status or good ecological potential by 2027

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 85 5.85 The Council's Green Space Strategy 2010 –201494 aims to protect and enhance all 
types of greenspace. This is supplemented by the Playing Pitch Assessment and 
Strategy 2012 and the Greenspace Audit 2012 whic h identify all spaces of public 
benefit in the borough . These documents highlight the areas of the borough  facing 
the greatest quantitative need for different types of greenspace and the areas 
where spaces need to be improved in quality and made more acces sible. This will 
inform the local delivery strategy and any subsequent site allocations, which will 
be identified in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies. This will 
ensure appropriate investment in and management of the diverse range o f 
greenspaces in Knowsley, including formal sports pitches and parks, informal 
open spaces, children's play areas, allotments, wildlife habitats and corridors.  
5.86 Further detail on the proposed approach towards greensp aces is set out in Policy 
CS21: Greenspaces and Trees . This sets minimum standards for the quality, 
quantity and accessibility of different forms of greenspace in Knowsley's urban 
areas.  
Natural Assets and Biodiversity  
5.87 The key priorities for natural assets and geology in the  Liverpool City Region are:  
 To manage the natural assets better – to protect the integrity of nature sites of 
international importance, and to protect the city region’s nature and geodiversity 
assets; and  
 To make sure there is no net loss of these natural assets and to extend and 
enhance the city region’s Ecological Network and natural assets.  
5.88 Many natural assets occur at a landscape scale and cross local authority 
boundaries. Neighbouring authorities in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and 
Cheshire are curre ntly preparing Ecological Networks, which will allow a more 
integrated approach between Knowsley and adjacent areas. The Liverpool City 
Region authorities are currently preparing evidence relating to their shared 
Ecological Network which once agreed will i dentify strategic and district priorities 
for habitat creation and enhancement at a landscape scale.  
5.89 Knowsley’s natural assets include the designated nature sites and priority habitats 
which will form part of the Liverpool City Region Ecological Network on ce agreed. 
The hierarchy of designated sites is:  
a) Sites of international nature importance;  
b) Sites of national n ature and geological importance;  and 
c) Sites of local nature and geological importance.  
5.90 The Council will not support schemes that will lead  to adverse effects on nationally 
or internationally important wildlife sites, either alone or in combination with other 
projects and plans. This includes supporting habitat for species that are 
                                            
94 Knowsley Green Space Strategy 2010 –2014 ( Knowsley Council , 2010)   
 
Page 86 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
designation features of internationally important sites. Any scheme which would be 
likely to significantly affect a European site, either alone or in combination with 
other plans and projects, will be subject to an assessment under Part 6 of the 
Habitat Regulations at project application stage. If it cannot be assur ed that there 
would be no adverse effects on site integrity, permission will be refused unless the 
proposal satisfies the 'no alternatives' and 'Imperative Reasons of Over -Riding 
Public Interest' tests of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulation s 
2010 (as amended), under which appropriate compensatory measures will need to 
be secured.  
5.91 In some circums tances, adequate mitigation and /or compensation for biodiversity 
loss may be acceptable but incapable of being provided within the application site.  
In such cases where appropriate, priority will be given to equivalent off site 
opportunities for such mitigation or, as a last resort, compensation. Such 
opportunities shall be prioritised in the following order:  
 Firstly sites in the immediate locality of  and/or within any Core Biodiversity Area (to 
be defined as part of the Liverpool City Region Ecological Network) near to the 
application site;  
 Secondly, sites in a Nature Improvement Area identified within the borough  (to be 
defined as part of the Liverpool C ity Region Ecological Network); and lastly  
 Sites in a Nature Improvement Area identified outside the borough  (to be defined 
as part of the Liverpool City Region Ecological Network) . 
Sub-Regional Management Plans, Programmes and Strategies  
5.92 Existing programm es and strategies such as the Liverpool City Region Ecological 
Framework will help maintain and improve the function of Green Infrastructure in 
Knowsley, including important sites for biodiversity inside and outside the borough . 
A balanced approach is requ ired to manage recreational impacts relating to 
sensitive sites and encourage use of the wider Green Infrastructure network where 
it is less sensitive to recreational pressure. This is because the provision or use of 
Green Infrastructure which links to int ernationally important sites and supporting 
habitat sites outside of Knowsley (such as Natura 2000 sites), could result in 
disturbance to designated features within these sites if not appropriately managed.  
5.93 Management plans which support the protection of internationally important sites 
for biodiversity within the wider Liverpool City Region are those which pertain to 
Mersey Estuary Special Protection Area (SPA)/ Ramsar, Ribble & Alt Estuaries 
SPA/ Ramsar, Liverpool Bay SPA, Mersey Narrows and North Wirral Foreshore 
SPA/ Ramsar, Sefton Coast Special Area of Conservati on (SAC), Dee Estuary 
SPA/ SAC/Ramsar and Martin Mere SPA/ Ramsar. Strategies and development 
proposals in Knowsley must mitigate any potential impacts such as: disturbance to 
qualifying bird s pecies (from recreational pressure and other sources); 
deterioration in water quality; deterioration in air quality; and loss of supporting 
habitat.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 5 Spatial Strategy  
Page 87 5.94 The types of management plans which will need to be considered and supported 
by Knowsley (together with sur rounding districts) are likely to include European 
Marine Site Management Schemes, the North West River Basin Management 
Plan and location specific management plans. These will include those relating to 
locally important water bodies such as the River Alt,  Croxteth/ Knowsley Brook and 
Simonswood Brook, Ditton Brook, Dog Clog Brook, Mill Brook and Prescot 
(Logwood) Brook.   
 Area Policies 
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 91 6 Area Priorities  
6.1 This chapter sets out the spatial priorities and policies for each of Knowsley's 
communities, reflecting th e contribution that each can make to the overall 
development of the borough . The chapter splits the borough  into the same four 
areas as defined in  Chapter 2: Knowsley – The Place . These are:  
 Huyton and Stockbridge Village;  
 Kirkby;  
 Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village; and  
 Halewood.  
6.2 The priorities, which are not listed in order of preference and are not exhaustive, 
reflect the steps that are needed to create successful suburban towns and 
villages. They address the  range of issues and opportunities affecting each area, 
including their linkages with Liverpool and the rest of the Liverpool City Region. 
They also identify what the Council considers needs to happen in each area to 
support the vision and objectives for K nowsley as a whole as set out in Chapter  3: 
Vision and Objectives . 
6.3 To address the priorities, significant change and development will be needed in 
specific areas. The areas of greatest need and opportunity for compre hensive 
change in Knowsley’s current urban  areas are defined in Policy CS1: Spatial 
Strategy for Knowsley  as Principal Regeneration Areas. The following policies will 
guide the nature and scale of change in each of these areas:  
 Policy CS9: Principal Regeneration Area – North  Huyton and Stockbridge Village  
 Policy CS 10: Principal Regeneration Area – Kirkby  Town Centre  
 Policy CS 11: Principal Regeneration Area – Knowsley  Industrial and Business 
Parks  
 Policy CS 12: Principal Regeneration Area  – Tower  Hill 
 Policy CS 13: Principal Regeneration Area – South  Prescot  
 Policy CS 14: Principal Regeneration Area – Prescot  Town Centre  
6.4 In addition to the Principal Regeneration Areas, Policy CS1 : Spatial Strategy for 
Knowsley  and Policy CS2: Development Principles  encourage appropriate 
regeneration and improvement initiatives in other areas, particularly where there 
are significant levels of deprivation. This applies in parts of Kirkby, e.g. Northwood, 
Westvale and S outhdene and in smaller pockets elsewhere in the borough . The 
Council will support the use of available funding to regenerate and enhance these 
areas including neighbourhood management initiatives, improvements to public 
realm, public service provision (su ch as schooling and health care) and 
improvements to the housing stock.  
6.5 The area priorities and associated Principal Regeneration Areas are listed in the 
subsequent sub -sections and illustrated in four maps (one for each area), which 
complement Map 5.1: Knowsley Key Diagram  and identify how the priorities 
highlighted will impact on each area. The priorities listed for each area also refer to

the proposed Sustainable Urban Extensions on which further detail is set out in 
Chapter 7. 
Huyton and Stockbridge Village  
6.6 Huyton and Stockbridge Village are located in the centre of the borough  and with a 
combined population of 56,200 comprise the largest of the borough ’s urban areas. 
The built up a rea of Huyton is suburban in character and contiguous with the 
suburbs of Liverpool to the west. To the north and south there is countryside, with 
the M57 to the east.  
6.7 The existing key issues for Huyton and Stockbridge Village are as follows:  
 High levels o f deprivation in North Huyton and Stockbridge Village, including 
health inequalities, low life expectancy, worklessness, low edu cational attainment, 
and crime;  
 An unbalanced housing market, with very high proportions of social rented stock in 
North Huyton and Stockbridge Village, in contrast with affordability issues in South 
Huyton;  
 Important employment areas such as Huyton and Kings Business Parks provide 
office and manufacturing accommodation, but have limited available space for new 
employment developme nt; 
 Huyton Town Centre, the main administration centre for Knowsley, is under 
performing in terms of its retail function, limited evening economy and requires 
environmental enhancement;  
 A broader range of retail and services are required to satisfy local n eeds and 
address vacancy in Stockbridge Village District Centre and Huyton's local centres;  
 Public transport links require improvement, particularly around Stockbridge Village, 
together with a broader requirement to develop sustainable transport infrastruc ture 
to encourage walking and cycling;  
 The need to protect and enhance environmental and historic assets, such as the 
25 Listed Buildings (including the Grade II* Church of St. Michaels) and the  four 
Conservation Areas; and  
 Large areas of greenspace, parti cularly in North Huyton and Stockbridge Village, 
which are considered to be poor quality and offer li mited value to local residents.  
6.8 The area priorities listed below reflect the opportunities related to this area which 
are addressed by the policies within the Core Strategy.  
Huyton and Stockbridge Village  
 To re -balance the housing market to meet local needs and contribute to 
those of the wider Liverpool City Region through comprehensive housing -
led regeneration in North Huyton and Stockbridge Village and ta rgeted 
release of sites in South Huyton to provide a diverse range of affordable 
and market sector housing (in accordance with Policy CS9 : Principal 
Regeneration Area – North  Huyton and Stockbridge Village ).  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 93  To strengthen the existing successful employment locations at Huyton and 
Kings Business Parks including the delivery of further employment 
development within these areas.  
 To review the Green Belt boundary to meet development needs (in 
accordance with Policies CS5 : Green Belt , SUE1 : Sustainable Urban 
Extensions and Safeguarded Land  and SUE2a: Sustainable Urban 
Extension – Knowsley  Lane, Huyton ) at: 
 Knowsley Lane, to the north of Huyton (for mixed housing and 
employment uses); and  
 Edenhurst Avenue, to the south west of Huyton (for housing).  
 To enhance Huyton Town Centre, with appropriate retail uses focused 
within the Derby Road /Cavendish Walk primary shopping area, 
environmental enhancements and a broader mix of evening, leisure and 
other service uses encouraged primarily in other parts of the town centre.  
 To further improve Stockbridge Village District Centre, in combination w ith 
wider regeneration proposals for the Stockbridge area.  
 To support shopping and service provision of an appropriate scale relative 
to the size and function of local centres within Huyton.  
 To deliver enhanced and sustainable transport connectivity betwee n 
residential neighbourhoods and employment uses at Kings and Huyton 
Business Parks and linking to the wider transport network within the City 
Region.  
 To recognise the role, character and distinctiveness of the area's pockets of 
historically important town scape through protection and enhancement of 
historic assets.  
 To improve the quality and accessibility of existing local greenspace, and 
strengthen the role and value of the strategic Green Infrastructure network, 
including Stadt Moers Park and the Alt Corr idor, and improve other areas of 
environmental importance.

Policy CS9: Principal Regeneration Area – North  Huyton and 
Stockbridge  Village  
6.9 Policy CS 9 is intended to del iver significant change and new development to 
address the high levels of deprivation in two of the most vulnerable areas of 
Knowsley, with particular focus on addressing the existing unbalanced housing 
market.  
Policy CS9  
Principal Regeneration Area – North Huyton and Stockbridge 
Village  
1) The comprehensive regeneration of North Huyton and Stockbridge Village will 
be supported, to be carried out in an integrated manner across the two areas. 
Subject to appropriate master planning exercise(s), new development should 
provide (in no order of priority):  
a) New housing development in North Huyton and Stockbridge Village, of a 
range of types suitable for local needs, which will selectively replace 
existing unpopular stock and re -balance the housing offer;  
b) Enhanced desi gn quality and site layout providing improved integration with 
surrounding areas;  
c) An improved Stockbridge Village centre, including new leisure, community, 
education and training facilities, small scale employment and local retail

6.10 The policy seeks to create sustainable and mixed communities with a wide range 
of good quality h omes which meet local needs, through a cohesive approach 
covering both North Huyton and Stockbridge Village.  
North Huyton  
6.11 Under the former Government's National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, 
North Huyton was designated as a New Deal for Communities ( NDC) area. The 
programme for this area, which ran from 2001 to 2011 included the estates of 
Hillside, Woolfall Heath, Finch House and Fincham and was delivered by a 
community based Partnership Board. It combined physical development with 
social projects an d focused on tackling unemployment, poor educational 
attainment, ill health, inadequate housing stock and high levels of crime. 
Milestones completed to date include:  
 The demolition of nearly 1,200 unsuitable or unpopular dwellings;  
 The adoption of the Nort h Huyton Action Area SPD to guide regeneration of the 
area by the Council in 2007; and   
 
Page 96 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
 Grant of outline planning permission in 2007 for 1,450 new homes, which will be 
better suite d to meeting local needs.  
6.12 Although the period of NDC funding has ended, the s cheme is progressing and the 
continuation of the programme and the wider regeneration of the area remain a 
commitment for the Council. The Council considers that the gross number of 
dwelling completions could potentially be increased from 1,450. This refle cts the 
potential to increase the density of the development and ensure that the policy 
framework is sufficiently flexible to deliver a viable housing development which 
meets future market needs and which can underpin the necessary investment in 
community facilities and infrastructure. The master planning of the area should 
take into account requirements for additional infrastructure, flood management, 
high quality design and public open space requirement.  
Stockbridge Village  
6.13 Many of the issues which led t o the designation of North Huyton as an NDC area, 
such as concentrations of deprivation and unpopular housing stock can be found 
in the neighbouring residential area of Stockbridge Village. The district centre for 
Stockbridge Village, which had become rund own and suffered problems such as 
high vacancy rates has been comprehensively redeveloped, under a planning 
permiss ion granted in 2010, to provide : 
 a supermarket;  
 a swimming pool, gym and leisure facilities;  
 a learning resource centre (primary school and c ommunity facilities);  
 a refurbished health clinic;  
 a Police access point; and  
 enhanced public realm and open space.  
6.14 Under Policy CS 9, the Council will also support new development proposals to 
regenerate the residential areas which surround Stockbridge Vi llage district centre. 
Further details will be set out in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development 
Policies document and/ or a revision to the North Huyton Action Area SPD.  
Accessibility  
6.15 Close to this Principal Regeneration Area are two successful employment areas at 
Kings and Huyton Business Parks. Despite the presence of these, the third 
Merseyside Local Transport Plan (LTP3)95 highlighted that there are high levels of 
commuting to surrounding areas and that access to employment from Huyton is 
one of the borough's key accessibility issues. Although the majority of the 
regeneration within the Principal Regeneration Area is housing -led, skills and 
access to employment are key issues which should also be addressed.

Regeneration Area, its proposed development could help tackle deprivation, re -
balance the housing m arket and create jobs to serve North Huyton and 
Stockbridge Village.    
 
Page 98 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Kirkby  
6.17 Kirkby is located in the north of the borough  and, with a population of 41,200, is 
the second largest settl ement in Knowsley. It is a free -standing town separated 
from Liverpool t o the west by a narrow strip of Green Belt.  
6.18 The existing key issues for Kirkby are as follows:  
 High levels of deprivation exist across most of Kirkby, including health inequalities, 
low life expectancy, worklessness, low educational attainment, and high le vels of 
crime;  
 An unbalanced housing market, with high concentrations of social housing and a 
limited choice of housing types;  
 Strategically important employment areas such as Knowsley Industrial and 
Business Parks provide a range of employment opportuniti es, but require 
improvements to enhance economic performance and upgrade accessibility  from 
surrounding areas;  
 Kirkby Town Centre is under performing in terms of its retail function and requires 
environmental enhancement;  
 An enhanced range of retail and se rvices are required to improve the performance 
of Kirkby's local centres in providing for local needs;  
 Public transport links require improvement, particularly around Kirkby Town 
Centre, Kirkby Industrial Park and to health care services (e.g. Whiston Hosp ital), 
together with a broader requirement to develop sustainable transport infrastructure 
to encourage walking and cycling;  
 The need to protect and enhance environmental and historic assets, such as the  
five Conservation Areas in Kirkby, including South P ark Road which is considered 
to be at risk, together with the 24 Listed Buildings in the area (including the Grade 
II* St. Chad's Church); and  
 Large areas of greenspace, particularly in Tower Hill, which are considered to be 
poor quality and offer limited value to local residents.  
6.19 The area priorities listed below reflect the opportunities related to this area which 
are addressed by the policies within the Core Strategy.  
Kirkby  
 To improve the quality, choice and affordability of housing to meet local 
needs,  with priority being given to comprehensive housing -led regeneration 
in Tower Hill (in accordance with Policy CS12 : Principal Regeneration Area 
– Tower  Hill), and further targeted provision appropriate to needs and 
opportunities in No rthwood, Westvale and Southdene to provide a diverse 
range of affordable and market sector housing;  
 To maximise the role of Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks as a 
strategic employment location for the Liverpool City Region, including 
delivery of new e mployment development prioritising existing employment 
allocations and previously developed sites with associated access  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 99 improvements and linkages to other areas of Kirkby (in accordance with 
Policy CS11 : Principal Regeneration Area – Knowsley Industrial and 
Business Parks ); 
 To review the Green Belt boundary to meet development needs (in 
accordance with Policy CS5 : Green Belt  and SUE1 : Sustainable Urban 
Extensions and Safeguarded Land ) at: 
 Land at Bank Lane (for housing); and  
 Land to the east of Knowsley Industrial Park (for employment uses).  
 To deliver retail -led regeneration in Kirkby Town Centre, focused around the 
primary shopping area (St. Chad’s Parade) and expansion of the town 
centre to  the south, to ensure it provides the focal point for high quality 
shopping, recreation, employment, education and leisure facilitie s (in 
accordance with Policy CS 10: Principal Regeneration Area – Kirkby Town 
Centre ); 
 To enhance trans port links between residential neighbourhoods and Kirkby 
Town Centre and Knowsley Industrial Park, and between Kirkby and other 
places in the Liverpool City Region. This may (subject to funding) include 
construction of a rail interchange/ park and ride at Headbolt Lane;  
 To recognise the role and character of the area's heritage value through 
protection and enhancement of heritage assets; and  
 To improve the quality and accessibility of Kirkby's local greenspaces and 
improve other areas of environmental impo rtance, whilst strengthening the 
role and value of the strategic Green Infrastructure network, including the 
Valley Corridor green link, to provide a range of well -used multi -functional 
areas incorporating attractive walking and cycling provision linking d ifferent 
parts of Kirkby.

Page 101 Policy CS 10 
Principal Regene ration Area – Kirkby Town Centre  
1) Comprehensive regeneration will be supported to enhance the viability and 
vitality of Kirkby Town Centre by (in no order of priority):  
a) Encouraging a wider mix of town centre uses, services and facilities, 
including new com parison and convenience retail floorspace, key services, 
residential, employment uses, cultural and leisure facilities, and 
enhancements to the evening economy and existing market;  
b) Directing new retail development and other town centre uses toward the 
existing town centre, particularly in the primary shopping area comprising 
St. Chad's Parade and its immediate surroundings; and  
c) If necessary to create sufficient capacity for retail -led regeneration, 
designation of land to the south of Cherryfield Drive to pe rmit expansion of 
the town centre and primary shopping area.  
2) Improved facilities for sustainable transport serving the town centre will be 
supported, including:  
a) Improvements to Kirkby bus station and public transport interchange 
facilities; and  
b) Public real m enhancements, including creation of new footpaths and cycle 
routes to improve circulation within Kirkby Town Centre, and link with other 
areas of Kirkby including via strategic green links.  
3) The boundaries of the expanded town centre and primary shopping area will be 
defined in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies, with 
further guidance to follow through a Development Brief or Supplementary 
Planning Document, if appropriate.

Delivery of Town Centre Uses, Services and Facilities  
6.21 The Knowsley Town Centres and Shopping Study96 has identified a requirement 
for further retail development in Kirkby Town Centre, comprising additional 
comparison fl oorspace together with a major new superstore during the plan 
period. This reflects the need for new retail uses in a scheme of sufficient ‘critical 
mass ’ to ensure confidence amongst investors and potential new operators. Due 
to restrictions in the amount  of land available within the current town centre, the 
required scale of development necessitates strategic expansion of the town 
centre, with land immediately to the south of the town centre offering the most 
appropriate area for expansion.  
6.22 Future develop ment should follow a balanced approach which maintains footfall 
levels in the primary shopping area focused in St. Chad's Parade and the existing 
market. In this regard, an expansion of the primary shopping area is intended to 
include a section of Cherryfi eld Drive to integrate the existing town centre with the 
expansion area to the south and ensure accessibility/ linkages which are beneficial 
to the viability and vitality of the existing town centre. Outline planning permission 
for a mixed use development to comprehensively regenerate Kirkby Town Centre 
including retail expansion to the south of Cherryfield Drive was granted in 2011. If 
this development south of Cherryfield Drive is not built, any future proposal 
involving town centre expansion will be required to justify such expansion by 
satisfying the s equential test within Policy CS 4 and na tional policy.  
6.23 Smaller scale proposals which provide leisure, employment, educational and/ or 
residential components, including above ground floor retail, leisure or other 
facilities, which complement the overall regeneration priorities of the town centre, 
will be encourag ed in accordance with Policy CS 6: Town Centres and Re tail 
Strategy . 
Accessibility  
6.24 Potential improvements to the transport network in Kirkby (suc h as those defined 
in Policy CS 7: Transport Networks  will need to be integrated into the design of 
new development in Kirkby Town Centre. Kirkb y Town Centre is also close to 
strategic green links, particularly the Valley Corridor to the west. There is potential 
to better integrate these Green infrastructure assets by creating new footpaths and 
cycle r outes to improve accessibility.

Business Parks  
6.25 Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks comprise the largest mainly industrial 
area within the Liverpool City Region, and the second largest in the North West 
region. They have been ident ified as a key employment location where significant 
change and new development is required to improve the economic performance of 
the area.  
Policy CS11  
Principal Regeneration Area – Knowsley Industrial and Business 
Parks

Remodelling of Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks  
6.26 The Joint Employment Land and Premises study98 identifies scope to remodel 
parts of Knowsley Industrial Park through new development to maximise job 
opportunities and contribute to  Knowsley's employment land requirement. A 
strategic framework for the regeneration of the area99 was completed on behalf the 
Council and North West Development Agency in 2011. This document:  
 Assessed the current physical condition of Knowsley Industrial Pa rk and its 
infrastructure;  
 Identified the suitability of the Park to meet the future requirements of industrial 
and business uses;  
 Examined potential for the development of a defined location for renewable and 
low carbon energy production and storage (Gree n Energy Park);  
 Assessed issues and opportunities for the Park deriving from key City Region 
assets e.g. the Liverpool SuperPort (including Liverpool John Lennon Airport);  
 Developed a new vision for Knowsley Industrial Park to meet the needs of regional 
growth sectors and maximise the Park's potential as a regionally significant 
employment site;

Page 105  Proposed ways to make better use of the space available, maximising the 
potential for increased busines s space, including offices; and  
 Outlined a 15 year developmen t framework and implementation strategy for the 
future development and management of the Park.  
6.27 Key conclusions from the study (which form the basis for future intervention) 
include:  
 Current development opportunities within the Parks are limited, but the ag eing 
stock of buildings and obsolete layouts in some areas present opportunities to 
meet changing economic demands and help meet Knowsley's need for 
employment land;  
 A need to improve the infrastructure of the Parks to meet investor and occupier 
needs, and  enhance their image and branding to attract high value investment, 
particularly within growth sectors;  
 The Parks currently provide 27% of jobs in Knowsley, and this position needs to 
be maintained and enhanced, to help reduce deprivation particularly in K irkby;  
 Planning policy needs to recognise the sub -regional and regional role of the Parks;  
 Intervention is required at existing gateways to the Parks to create a positive ‘first 
impression’ and identity, and expand the business p ark environment northwards ; 
and 
 A local service centre of an appropriate scale needs to be developed to serve the 
needs of the workforce, comprising retail and leisure uses on South Boundary 
Road, subject to proposals meeting planning pol icy on such uses (see Policy CS 6: 
Town Centres and Retail Strategy ) with regard to impact on existing centres 
elsewhere.  
6.28 Further detail, including site allocations and other guidance will be set out in the 
Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies and/ or area specif ic SPD.  
Gateway Locations  
6.29 Development in ‘gateway ’ locations should have regard t o the requirements of 
Policy CS 19: Design Quality and Accessibility in New Development . The provision 
of Class B1 ‘business ’ uses within ‘gateway ’ locati ons is subject to compliance 
with the s equential approach in Policy CS 4: Economy and Employment . 
6.30 One of the ‘gateway locations ’ identified in Policy CS11 is at A580 (East) /Coopers 
Lane. This area is being removed from the Green Belt to form a Sustainable Urban 
Extension. This will enable employment uses to be developed which should 
complement the regeneration of the remainder of the Industrial and Business 
Parks. Further d etails concerning this Sustainable Urban Extension are set out in 
Chapter 7: Sustainable Urban Extensions  and Safeguarded Land . 
Priority Zone for Renewable, Low Carbon and Decentralised Energy  
6.31 The ‘Delivering a New Future for Knowsley Industrial Park: Strategic Framework ’ 
document also identified potential scope for Knowsley Industrial Park to become a  
 
Page 106 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Green Energy Park/ Hub. This would support a strong renewable energy business 
sector within Knowsley, encourage growth of existing businesses and help attract 
more businesses from this sector into the borough. In this context, the reference to 
decentralised energy in Policy  CS11 does not imply that this location is suitable for 
Energy from Waste (EfW) schemes. Any proposals for this type of use would need 
to comply with specific criteria set out in the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste 
Local Plan.  
Accessibility  
6.32 Strategic inf rastructure improvements (such as the Knowsley Rail Freight 
Terminal) and other potential enhancements to the transport network, inclu ding 
those defined in Policy CS 7: Transport Networks ) should be integrated into the 
design of new dev elopment in Knowsley and Industrial Business Parks. New 
development should prioritise improved links with Kirkby Town Centre, together 
with accessibilit y to the road and rail network.  
6.33 Knowsley Industrial Park contains a number of green and open spaces, not ably 
Charley Wood and Acornfield Plantation. There is scope to enhance the use of 
these and other Green Infrastructure assets through the creation of new footpaths 
and cycle routes to improve circulation and accessibility. These sites provide 
opportunities  to enhance the amenity of users of the Industrial Park and to 
contribute to an improved appearance and perception of the Park. This is provided 
the value for biodiversity associated to the status of Charley Wood and Acornfield 
Plantation as Local Wildlife  Sites is not compromised.  
Policy CS12: Principal Regeneration Area – Tower  Hill 
6.34 To meet the priorities for Kirkby, a specific policy for Tower Hill is required. This is 
intended to deliver significant change and new development to address the high 
levels of deprivation in one of the most vulnerable areas of Knowsley, with 
particular focus on addressing the existing unbalanced housing market.  
Policy CS12  
Principal Regeneration Area – Tower Hill  
1) Comprehensive redevelopment and improvement of the Tower Hill Principal 
Regeneration Area, will be facilitated, including (in no order of priority):  
a) New housing development, to provide a wider choice of housing 
accommodation to meet local housing needs;  
b) Enhanced design quality and site layout providing improved integ ration with 
surrounding areas and Kirkby Town Centre;  
c) Small scale enhancements to retail, employment, leisure, education, health 
and community facilities, appropriate to the scale and function of a local 
centre to complement that of Kirkby Town Centre;  
d) Public realm enhancements as a key feature of Green Infrastructure 
focused upon significant improvements to quality, accessibility and  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 107 integration with new development;  
e) Infrastructure improvements, including enhanced public transport provision 
and maximising opportunities for walking and cycling to create accessible 
linkages in Tower Hill and linking to surrounding areas; and  
f) Flexibility to integrate and safeguard the potential delivery of a new 
transport interchange, including a new rail station and Park and Ride to the 
south of Headbolt Lane.  
2) The boundary of the Principal Regeneration Area will be identified in the Local 
Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies, with further guidance in a 
revision to the existing Supplementary Planning Document.

Regeneration of Tower Hill  
6.35 The comprehensive regeneration of Tower Hill is one of the Council’s key 
commitments comprising at least 300 new dwellings, wit h potential for uplift 
subject to a master planning exercise. This reflects the potential to increase the 
density of the development and ensure that the policy framework is sufficiently 
flexible to deliver a viable housing development which meets future ma rket 
demands and which can underpin the necessary investment in community facilities 
and infrastructure. The master planning of the area should take account of 
requirements for additional infrastructure, flood management, high quality design 
and public ope n space requirements. Policy CS 12 seeks to:  
 Achieve a wide choice of high quality homes (both affordable and market housing); 
Widen opportunities for home ownership;  
 Ensure high quality housing for those who cannot afford market housing, in 
particular thos e who are vulnerable or in need;  
 Improve affordability across the housing market (including by incr easing the 
housing supply); and   
 
Page 108 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
 Create sustainable, inclusive, mixed communities.  
6.36 The primary drivers of change will include:  
 Improvements to existing urban quality by remodelling and restructuring of the 
layout of the estate to enhance accessibility and integration with surrounding 
areas;  
 Creation of new Green Infrastructure and improvements to the quality of open 
spaces to utilise their full potential value as a community resource (particularly the 
large central open space area); and  
 Prioritising opportunities for sustainable transport provision.  
6.37 Revisions to the Tower Hill (Kirkby) Action Area SPD will be prepared, as 
appropriate.  
6.38 Under the policies in Chapter 7: Sustainable Urban Extensions and Safeguarded 
Land , land immediately to the west of the Principal Regeneration Area off Bank 
Lane is being released from the Green Belt. Although this area is outside Tower  
Hill, its proposed development could help tackle deprivation and re -balance the 
housing market in the area.  
Access to Community Facilities  
6.39 A comprehensive scheme should include a range of community facilities, as some 
areas of Tower Hill lack suitable ac cess to local service provision, and key 
services such as the local shops and health facilities are not currently in the same 
location. Any retail would need to be of a small scale and designed to only meet 
the needs of the Tower Hill area, to avoid causin g harm to the viability and vitality 
of higher order centres, particularly Kirkby Town Centre.  
Enhancement of Public Realm  
6.40 The successful and comprehensive regeneration of the area offers the opportunity 
to address the disjointed nature of existing residen tial areas and greenspaces, by 
providing layout and public realm enhancements, infrastructure improvements and 
new footpaths and cycle routes.  
Transport and Accessibility  
6.41 Land at Headbolt Lane (just to the south of Tower Hill) has previously been 
allocated  as a proposed rail station and park and ride facility. This scheme is 
retained in the Third Merseyside Local Transport Plan (LTP3), supported by the 
recommendations of the Network Rail Strategic Development Plan. A new station 
in this location would signi ficantly enhance the public transport accessibility of 
Tower Hill and the northern section of Knowsley Industrial Park, whilst the addition 
of a Park and Ride facility at the station could attract people who usually drive into 
Liverpool from surrounding co mmunities, thus reducing the impact on the wider 
highway network during peak hour periods.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 109 6.42 Whilst the funding for the new station and park and ride are not currently secured, 
suitable flexibility should be maintained in the design and layout of any new 
development to successfully integrate the new station irrespective of its date of 
implementation. The design and layout of new development should also take 
account of opportunities for smaller scale improvements to the accessibility of the 
area.    
 
Page 110 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Prescot, Whi ston, Cronton and Knowsley Village  
6.43 The Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village area has a population of 
27,900 and is located in the centre of the borough  to the east of Huyton. The town 
of Prescot is physically linked to Whiston, and both adjoin St. Helens  to the east. 
Knowsley Village and Cronton are attractive rural villages located to the north and 
south respectively of Prescot /Whiston. The urban areas are tightly constrained by 
areas designated as Green Belt.  
6.44 The existing key issues for Prescot , Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village are as 
follows:  
 Affordability of housing in the more affluent parts of these towns and villages;  
 The need to improve employment opportunities in South Prescot and enhance 
accessibility to other nearby employment area s; 
 Prescot Town Centre is under performing in terms of its retail function and requires 
environmental enhancement to better capitalise upon its unique heritage value and 
improve linkages to Cables Retail Park located on the edge of the centre;  
 An enhanced range of retail and services are required to improve the performance 
of local centres in Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village to provide for 
local needs; Public transport links require improvement, particularly around 
Knowsley Village, and there is a broader need to develop sustainable transport 
infrastructure to encourage walking and cycling;  
 Shortages of good quality greenspace in parts of Prescot and Whiston; and  
 The need to protect and enhance environmental and historic assets, such as the 
46 Listed Buildings (including the Grade I St. Mary’s  Church), the historic 
Knowsley Hall and Knowsley Park (Grade II* listed), and the  three Conservation 
Areas within the locality, particularly Prescot Town Centre which is considered to 
be at risk.  
6.45 The area priorities listed below reflect the opportunities related to this area which 
are addressed by the policies within the Core Strategy.  
Prescot, Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village  
 To regenerate Prescot Town Centre, improving the mix of high quality 
shoppi ng, recreation, employment, community and leisure facilities, by 
consolidating the primary shopping area on Eccleston Street and integrating 
Cables Retail Park more effectively with the town centre, including improved 
linkages on Sewell Street (in accordan ce with Policy CS14 : Principal 
Regeneration Area – Prescot Town Centr e); 
 To capitalise on the area's unique heritage by preserving, protecting and 
enhancing historic assets, particularly in Prescot Town Centre, Cronton and 
Knowsley Vi llage;  
 To improve the quality, choice and affordability of housing and accessible 
employment development to meet local needs, with an initial focus on the 
significant development and regeneration opportunities in South Prescot (in  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 6 Area Priorities  
Page 111 accordance with Policy CS13 : Principal Regeneration Area – South 
Prescot ); 
 To review the Green Belt boundary to meet development needs (in 
accordance with Policies CS 5: Green Belt , SUE1: Sustainable Urban 
Extensions  and Safeguarded Land , and SUE2c: Sustainable Urban 
Extensions – South Whiston and Land to the South of the M62 ) at: 
 Land to the north west of Prescot (for housing);  
 Land at Carr Lane, to the west of Prescot (for housing);  
 Land to t he south of Whiston (for housing);  
 Land at Knowsley Village (for longer term housing); and  
 Land south of the M62 (for employment uses).  
 To enhance links between individual communities and facilities and job 
opportunities in Prescot Town Centre, Knowsley Sa fari Park, Whiston 
Hospital, Huyton Business Park, Kings Business Park and Knowsley 
Industrial and Business Parks, and in the wider Liverpool City Region;  
 To improve the quantity, quality and accessibility of local greenspaces, and 
improve other environmen tally important areas, whilst strengthening the role 
and value of the Green Infrastructure network, including the Whiston to 
Cronton Corridor strategic green link and Stadt Moers Park, to provide well -
used multi -functional areas incorporating attractive wa lking and cycling 
provision; and  
 To recognise the historic and recreational significance and contribution of 
the Knowsley Hall Estate and Knowsley Safari Park at a local and sub -
regional level and ensure appropriate support for complementary 
development of  an appropriate scale at this location.

Comprehensive Redevelopment of South Prescot  
6.47 The South Prescot Principal Regeneration Area comprises a large area previously 
occupied for cable manufacturing and re lated uses, which was allocated for 
employment uses in the Knowsley Replacement Unitary Development Plan 
(2006). Part of the area has been recently redeveloped to provide the South 
Prescot Business Park. However much of the remainder of the area is current ly 
vacant. It is considered appropriate to review the use for which this location is 
allocated, noting that the Joint Employment Land and Premises study and the 
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment101 suggest the area could be 
developed for either housing and/ or employment uses.  
6.48 Although there is need for employment development to meet Knowsley's 
requirements, the Council is aware of the slow take up of the employment 
allocation on this site in recent years, and the considerable need which exists f or 
more land for housing development. These factors suggest that continuation of the 
previous policy approach of solely promoting employment development in this 
location could undermine the reasonable prospect of the land being redeveloped 
during the plan period. Therefore, consideration of the role that alternative uses 
(including residential development) may perform as a catalyst for employment 
delivery is necessary. This should be progressed via a flexible policy and master 
planned approach to mixed use development focused on employment and 
residential development. This is noting that a proportional split of these uses can 
address identified local and borough -wide needs in both sectors.  
6.49 Outline planning permission for a mixed use development to comprehens ively 
regenerate South Prescot was granted in 2012.  
6.50 Land to the south of Carr Lane (adjoining the north western fringes of this Principal 
Regeneration Ar ea) is identified in Policy SUE 1 as having been removed from the 
Green Belt to me et future needs for development. The development of this area 
will be expected to integrate effectively with the redevelopment of the adjacent 
former industrial land off Carr Lane.  
Enhancement of Public Realm and Accessibility  
6.51 The Council considers there t o be a need to improve linkages between existing 
greenspaces in the area. The successful and comprehensive regeneration of the 
area should offer opportunities to address this issue for example by enhancing the 
Whiston to Cronton green link through provisio n of new footpaths and cycle routes.  
6.52 Strategic infrastructure improvements and potential enhancements to the transport 
network (such as those defined in Policy CS7 : Transport Networks ) will need to be 
integrated into the design of any new development in South Prescot. These should

Policy CS14: Principal Regeneration Area – Prescot  Town Centre  
6.53 Prescot Town Centre is in need of intervention and invest ment to ensure it fully 
utilises the potential of its heritage assets, appropriately serves the needs of its 
local catchment and competes effectively with neighbouring centres. Policy CS14 
seeks to address existing deficiencies in the retail performance of  the centre and 
promote diversification of uses, services and facilities.  
Policy CS14  
Principal Regeneration Area – Prescot Town Centre  
1) The future viability and vitality of Prescot Town Centre will be supported by (in 
no order of priority):  
a) Encouraging a wider mix of town centre uses, services and facilities in 
areas surrounding Eccleston Street, including key services, residential, 
employment uses, cultural and leisure facilities to create a distinctive 
identity and a complementary evening economy;  
b) Direct ing new retail development and other town centre uses towards 
Prescot Town Centre to ensure a healthy and balanced offer, with priority 
given to intensifying the retail function in a consolidated primary shopping 
area in the area of Eccleston Street and su rrounding streets;  
c) Improving linkages and integration between Cables Retail Park and the 
existing town centre, including appropriate new town centre development 
along Sewell Street, and extending the designated town centre boundary in 
this direction; and  
d) Using the historic assets of the town centre and surrounding areas, and the 
recreational potential of Knowsley Safari Park, to maximise tourism and 
cultural opportunities.  
2) Restructuring of retail provision within Cables Retail Park will be supported 
where t his would:  
a) Improve design quality and layout; and  
b) Improve linkages to Eccleston Street.  
3) Improved facilities for sustainable transport will be supported, particularly 
between Eccleston Street, Cables Retail Park and South Prescot to enhance 
accessibility an d connectivity to the full range of key local services.  
4) The boundaries of the town centre and primary shopping area will be defined in 
the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.

Historic Significance and Local Distinctiveness  
6.54 Prescot Town Centre is Knowsley's oldest and the only centre with a significant 
number of buildings dating from the 18th and 19th cen turies. Prescot Town Centre 
has a unique character arising from its history and much of the existing town 
centre, including the main pedestrian shopping area along Eccleston Street, which 
is designated as a Conservation Area. These historic assets give the  potential to 
create a strong and positive character and image. However, at present, a large 
number of buildings in the town centre are in a poor state of repair and the Prescot 
Shopping Centre, completed in 1988, suffers from a high level of vacancy.  
Enha ncing the Viability and Vitality of Prescot Town Centre  
6.55 Policy CS14 aims to focus new retail development in Eccleston Street and its 
immediate surroundings. The anticipated delivery of new comparison floorspace is 
slightly below the significant increase in  expenditure retention for Prescot Town 
Centre recommended in the Knowsley Town Centres and Shopping Study, but 
satisfies the minimum range set out within Policy CS6 : Town Centres and Retail 
Strategy . This is noting a need to be realis tic regarding the available site 
opportunities and ability of the development industry to deliver a significant scale 
and diverse range of comparison retail floorspace within the historic footprint of 
Prescot Town Centre. It is therefore beneficial to prom ote a lower scale of retail 
growth, to enhance the range of other town centre uses, particularly the food and 
drink offer (both during the day and in the evenings).  
6.56 Diversification of uses will be encouraged in the town centre outside the primary 
shopping area to enhance the range of key services and facilities available. The 
objective will be to strengthen the distinct identity of the town centre, particularly 
where units may be less commercially attractive for retail and therefore flexible 
consideration o f alternative uses is required. Other appropriate uses for the town 
centre may include additional leisure, education, employment, health and 
residential uses.

Page 117 Cables Retail Park  
6.57 Cables Retail Park, completed in 2000, is located just outside the current sou thern 
boundary of the town centre, and is the only retail park in Knowsley. It contains a 
food superstore and a range of non -food retail warehousing units. Planning 
permissions for expansion of the retail park were granted in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  
6.58 The Counc il considers Cables Retail Park to have scope for appropriate 
remodelling and renewal of units within the retail park. This could enable units to 
be provided of a different scale and format than those capable of being provided in 
the town centre itself. An y future expansion of the retail park is constrained by the 
barriers provided by the A57, Steley Way and Sewell Street highway network. 
Therefore, the priority for any future development should be restructuring of retail 
floorspace with improvements to lay out and design quality.  
Improved Linkages between Prescot Town Centre and Cables Retail Park  
6.59 When considered together, Prescot Town Centre and Cables Retail Park have the 
highest current expenditure retention of any of Knowsley's three town centres for 
comparison retail and the second highest for convenience retail (prior to the 
implementation of  current planning consents)102. A specific priority is therefore to 
spread the commercial success of the retail park towards the town centre by 
improving linkages bet ween the two locations. Extending the town centre 
boundary towards Cables Retail Park will better reflect the overall retail function of 
the town centre and retail park. To support this the Council will encourage the 
development of the Sewell Street corrid or for town centre uses to improve linkages 
between Eccleston Street and Cables Retail Park.  
6.60 The Sewell Street corridor is the least constrained area in terms of topography, 
existing land uses and heritage value between the existing town centre and 
Cables Retail Park. There may however be other opportunities to improve the 
linkage and accessibility of Prescot Town Centre from Cables Retail Park via 
Station Road. Although this may not be deliverable during the plan period, 
flexibility is retained in Policy CS 6 to ensure that remodelling incorporating Station 
Road would not be constrained during the plan period.  
Enhancement of Public Realm and Accessibility  
6.61 Strategic infrastructure improvements and potential enhancements to the transport 
network in Prescot (such as those defined in Policy CS7 : Transport Networks ) will 
need to be integrated into the design of any new development in and around 
Prescot Town Centre. This should include improved accessibility for pedestrians , 
connectivity between Eccleston Street, Cables Retail Park and South Prescot, and 
access to the wider road and rail network.

Tourism and Visitor Attractions  
6.62 The Liverpool City Region Tourism Strategy103 sets out a strategy for enhancing 
the tourism offer of  the City Region, including use of heritage assets. Policy CS14 
promotes these aims in Prescot, by supporting improved connections within the 
town centre and to surrounding areas such as the visitor attractions at Knowsley 
Safari Park. Enhancement of these  tourism assets and links will enhance the 
vitality and viability of the centre.

Page 119 Halewood  
6.63 With a population of 20,100, Halewood is the smallest of the borough ’s township 
areas. It is located in the south of Knowsley, has a mainly suburban character and 
is contiguous with the suburbs of Liverpool to the west. To the north and east are 
areas of countryside, which include the attractive rural village of Tarbock and 
substantial amounts of rural (mostly agricultural) land.  
6.64 The existing key issues for Halewood a re as follows:  
 Localised concentrations of deprivation, particularly in the south of Halewood, and 
a low life expectancy, particularly for females;  
 A need for a mixed and balanced housing offer to reflect the local needs arising 
from concentrations of soci al housing and contrasting issues of affordability 
particularly in the north of Halewood;  
 A need to improve local employment opportunities for local residents including 
supporting the existing Jaguar Land Rover employment site in South Halewood 
and improvi ng accessibility to other nearby employment areas, such as South 
Liverpool and Liverpool John Lennon Airport;  
 A need to consolidate the vitality and viability of Ravenscourt District Centre, 
taking account of recently completed regeneration activity, to en sure that its retail 
function and performance continues to meet the needs of Halewood's residents.  
 A broader range of retail and services are required in Halewood's local centres to 
provide for local needs;  
 The isolated nature of the settlement relative to  other parts of Knowsley 
necessitates improved public transport links, particularly to employment and health 
care services, together with a broader requirement to develop sustainable 
transport infrastructure to encourage walking and cycling;  
 The need to pr otect and enhance environmental and historic assets, such as the 
six Listed Buildings (including those within Tarbock) and three  Conservation 
Areas; and  
 Localised shorta ges of good quality greenspace.  
6.65 The area priorities listed below reflect the opportunit ies related to this area which 
are addressed by the policies within the Core Strategy.  
Halewood  
 To provide an appropriate range of new residential development in 
Halewood, including affordable housing to meet local housing needs;  
 To safeguard existing emp loyment areas, including the regionally significant 
Jaguar Land Rover plant, and to expand this key employment location 
where appropriate;  
 To review the Green Belt boundary to meet development needs for housing 
development (in accordance with Policies CS5 : Green Belt , SUE1 : 
Sustainable Urban Extension s and Safeguarded Land  and SUE2b : 
Sustainable Urban Extension – East of Halewood ) at two locations to the  
 
Page 120 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
east of Halewood;  
 To re -develop and en hance Ravenscourt District Centre as the focal point 
for Halewood, including appropriate retail facilities, community service 
provision and a public transport interchange;  
 To enhance connections between Halewood's housing areas and the rest of 
Knowsley and  the wider Liverpool City Region, including to the significant 
employment opportunities in South Halewood and South Liverpool, and 
health care facilities such as Whiston Hospital, via an efficient and 
sustainable local transport system;  
 To support the expa nsion of Liverpool John Lennon Airport, including the 
proposed Eastern Access Transport Corridor, subject to appropriate 
infrastructure improvements and required mitigation measures, including 
works to  the A5300/ A562 junction;  
 To protect and enhance the historic character and heritage assets within 
Halewood, and the rural settlement of Tarbock Village; and  
 To improve the quantity, quality and/ or accessibility of existing local 
greenspace and to mainta in and enhance the Green Infrastructure network 
and areas of environmental importance in Halewood, including the 
Halewood Triangle strategic green link.

Chapter 7 Sustainable Urban Extensions a nd Safeguarded Land  
Page 121 7 Sustainable Urban Extensions and S afeguarded Land  
7.1 This chapter builds on earlier chapters by setting out policies for Sustainable 
Urban Extensions and Safeguarded Land, which include:  
 Policy SUE 1: Sustainable Urban Extensions and Safeguarded Land  
 Policy SUE2 : Sustainable Urban Extensions – Development  Principles  
 Policy SUE2a : Sustainable Urban Ext ension – Knowsley Lane, Huyton  
 Policy SUE2b : Sustainable Urb an Extension – East of Halewood  
 Policy SUE2c: Sustainable Urban Extension – South o f Whiston and Land South 
of M62  
Policy SUE 1: Sustainab le Urban Extensions and Safeguarded Land  
7.2 As referred to in Policy CS5  and its supporting text, it has been necessary to 
undertake a review of Green Belt boundaries to identify sufficient land to meet 
Knowsley's development needs up to and beyond 2028. To meet these 
requirements a range of Sustainable Urban Extensions have been removed from 
the Green Belt. This matter is addressed by Policies SUE1, SUE2  and SUE2a  to 
SUE2c. 
Policy SUE1  
Sustaina ble Urban Extensions and Safeguarded Land  
1) 9 sites (referred to as Sustainable Urban Extensions) have been removed from 
the Green Belt and are allocated to provide additional land to meet 
development requirements up to 2028 and beyond. These sites and thei r 
proposed  primary uses are listed below:  
a) Bank Lane, Kirkby (residential)  
b) East of Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks, Kirkby (employment)  
c) Knowsley Lane, Huyton (residential and employment)  
d) Edenhurst Avenue, Huyton (residential)  
e) Land bounded by A58, Pre scot (residential)  
f) Carr Lane, Prescot (residential)  
g) East of Halewood (residential)  
h) South of Whiston (residential)  
i) Land South of M62 (employment and country park)  
2) Land at Knowsley Village has also been removed from the Green Belt but has 
been identified as ‘safeguarded land ’. This site is not allocated for development 
at the present time.  
3) Revisions to Green Belt boundaries to accommodate the Sustainable Urban 
Extensions and safeguarded land referred to in sections 1 and 2 above (and 
which ensure that the rev ised boundaries in these locations follow clearly 
defined physical features) are defined by the Policies Map (see Sustainable 
Urban Extension Allocation Profiles at Appendix E ). Any detailed Green Belt 
boundary changes elsewhere in the borough  will be defined by the Local Plan:  
 
Page 122 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Site Allocations and Development Policies.  
4) Guidance concerning the development of these locations is set out in Policies 
SUE2  and SUE2a to SUE2c . 
5) Proposals for d evelopment in areas falling outside the Sustainable Urban 
Extensions defined above and that will remain in the Green Belt shall be 
subject to the requirements of Policy CS5 .

7.3 To ensure a consistent approach to identifying sites for release from the Green  
Belt, Knowsley and Sefton Councils have undertaken a joint Green Belt study104 
while West Lancashire Borough Council has progr essed a Green Belt Study with a 
similar methodology. These studies aim to ensure that the most appropriate 
locations are chosen to accommodate development needs. This shared approach 
ensured that the Local Plans for each of the three districts identify suf ficient land 
for development as required by national policy.  
7.4 The Green Belt Study has been supplemented by the Green Belt Technical 
Report. This report assessed a range of Green Belt locations identified by the 
Green Belt Study as having potential for deve lopment. Based on a breadth of 
evidence105 the report recommends that the most sustainable and appropriate of 
these locations are released to meet development needs. These locations are 
referred to as either Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) or Safeguarded  Land.

Chapter 7 Sustainable Urban Extensions a nd Safeguarded Land  
Page 123 Development Capacity and Indicative Developable Area  
7.5 The estimated development capacity of each Sustainable Urban Extension is 
indicated within their allocation profiles (see Appendix E ). 
7.6 There are always uncertainties ove r the rate at which proposed development 
locations will be delivered and their ultimate development capacity. The Council 
has therefore identified sufficient locations to cater for current development 
requirements identified by the evidence base, including  ‘headroom ’ to allow a 
degree of flexibility, which will be subject to ongoing monitoring up to 2028. It also 
identifies a ‘safeguarded location ’ which is likely to be required for development 
after that date.  
7.7 While the locations identified are the most su itable taking account of the five 
purposes of including land in the Green Belt, some are also subject to varying 
degrees of other constraint. These include local designations such as 
Conservation Areas, Local Wildlife Sites (LWS) and Local Geological Sites  (LGS) 
affecting parts of some locations. Most of the land within the sites is unaffected by 
flood risk. However, the estimated capacity of some of the locations has been 
adjusted to take account of the extent of Flood Zones 2 and 3 which affect parts of 
some of the sites. Development outside the indicative developable area and within 
Flood Zones 2 and 3 will need to satisfy the Exception and/ or Sequential Tests 
depending on the proposed land use for the site in question. Further details on this 
issue are set out in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and in Policy CS24 : 
Managing Flood Risk . 
7.8 Detailed assessments and capacities for each location are set out in the evidence 
base, and further information on the Council's approach to Green  Belt release is 
set out in the ‘Green Belt ’ and ‘Sustainable Urban Extensions ’ Technical Reports.  
Safeguarded Land  
7.9 The safeguarded land at Knowsley Village is not allocated for development before 
2028. Planning permission for development in this location will only be granted 
following a future review of the Local Plan.  
7.10 The extent of Local Wildlife Site (LWS) 40 Knowsley Park has been amended to 
reflect updated evidence regarding its ecological value.  This LWS lies adjacent to 
the eastern and southern bound aries of the safeguarded land. This change is 
reflected on the Policies Map.  
Green Belt Boundaries and Policies Map  
7.11 The Sustainable Urban Exten sions highlighted in Policy SUE 1 have been removed 
from the Green Belt and allocated for development. The boundar ies of the sites 
which are included in updates to the Policies Map are contained within the SUE 
Allocation Profiles (see Appendix E ).  
 
Page 124 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
7.12 In addition to the Green Belt Study, the Council has completed a Detailed Green 
Belt Boundary R eview106, to identify smaller anomalies in the Green Belt 
boundary. Detailed boundary changes, where they directly relate to a Sustainable 
Urban Extension, are incorporated into the new Green Belt boundaries for the 
Sustainable Urban Extensions and Safeguard ed Land on the Policies Map. 
Detailed boundary changes elsewhere in the borough will be identified by the 
Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.

Page 125 Policy SUE2: Sustainable Urban Extensions – Development  Principles  
7.13 Due to the strategic contri bution Sustainable Urban Extensions can make to the 
Local Plan’s objectives it is essential that the release of Sustainable Urban 
Extensions enables the Council to maintain a consistent rate of housing and 
employment delivery. It is also important that the se areas are developed to a high 
quality.  
7.14 Policies SUE 2 and SUE2a –SUE2c inclusive set out the Council's expectations 
regarding how these Sustainable Urban Extensions will be developed.  
Policy SUE2  
Sustainable Urban Extensions – Deve lopment Principles  
Application of the Development Principles  
1) Development within the Sustainable Urban Extensions must (in no order of 
priority):  
a) deliver sustainable development;  
b) demonstrate a comprehensive approach to the development of the relevant 
Sustainable Urban Extension and to infrastructure provision (including, 
subject to the requirements of Policy CS27 : Planning and Paying for 
Infrastructure , provision of an appropriate proportion of financial and/ or ‘in 
kind’ contributio ns towards strategic and/ or local infrastructure required to 
enable the comprehensive development of the sites);  
c) be of a high design quality which enhances local distinctiveness and identity 
(incorporating localised design features where appropriate) and  provides 
high levels of physical and visual integration and connectivity with adjacent 
urban development (see Policy CS19 : Design Quality and Accessibility in 
New Development ); 
d) be carried out in accordance with the development princi ples and using any 
appropriate development assessment tools as required by Policy CS2 : 
Development Principles ;  
e) deliver development (including the principal uses defined in Policy SUE 1: 
Sustainable Urban Extensions ) which will help to meet borough -wide and 
local needs;  
f) include appropriate provision for public open space (POS), walking and 
cycling routes as part of the Green Infrastructure network integrating with 
existing POS, recreational assets and areas of ecolo gical value (see Policy 
CS8: Green Infrastructure  and Policy CS21: Greenspaces and Trees );  
g) provide good transport linkages within the relevant Sustainable Urban 
Extension and with surrounding areas (see Policy CS7 : Transport 
Networks ); 
h) Protect or enhance historic and architectural assets where appropriate (see 
Policy CS20 : Managing the  Borough’s Historic Environment ); 
i) Address flood risk by locating development in areas of  low probability of 
flooding and including flood mitigation measures where necessary (see  
 
Page 126 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Policy CS24 : Flood Risk ); and  
j) Provide a clearly defined edge to the developed area.  
Site-specific Requirements  
2) Indicative considerations appli cable to the sustainable development of each 
SUE are listed at Appendix E : Sustainable Urba n Extension Allocation Profiles .  
3) For each of the locations referred to in Policies SUE2a to SUE2c ) (Knowsley 
Lane,  Huyton; East of Halewood; and South of Whiston and Land South of 
M62), the Council will prepare a Supplementary Planning Document, which will 
provide a proposed spatial development framework for the site together with 
further details of development and in frastructure requirements.  
4) Proposals for development within each of these locations will only be granted 
planning permission where they are consistent with a single detailed master 
plan for the whole of the Sustainable Urban Extension which is approved by  
the Council.  The master plan should accord with development plan policy and 
any associated Supplementary Planning Document and may be submitted prior 
to or with the application. Planning permissions must be linked to any 
necessary legal agreements for the  improvement, provision, management and 
maintenance of infrastructure, services and facilities, open spaces and other 
matters necessary to make the development acceptable and which facilitate 
comprehensive delivery of all phases of development within the S ustainable 
Urban Extension in accordance with the single detailed master plan.

Sustainable Development within Sustainable Urban Extensions  
7.15 The Sustainable Urban Extensions in conjunction  with urban sites have the 
potential to deliver the required levels of new development up to 2028. These sites 
present significant development opportunities and it is essential that a  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 7 Sustainable Urban Extensions a nd Safeguarded Land  
Page 127 comprehensive approach is taken to their delivery, which maximises their  
contribution to sustainable development, is of a high design quality and enables an 
efficient use of infrastructure. New development within the Sustainable Urban 
Extensions should deliver the principal uses defined in Policy SUE1  in a manner 
which will help meet borough -wide needs and also take account of any local needs 
(such as in relation to the mix of housing) in the township or community area within 
which the site is located.  
Release of Sustainable Urban Extensions  
7.16 To enable hous ing and employment to be delivered at a consistent rate and to 
ensure that Knowsley's short term development needs can be met, the 
Sustainable Urban Extensions are released from the Green Belt on adoption of the 
Plan. Some employment sites have policy trig gers restricting their use to specific 
target sectors and/ or identified needs. The sites are allocated for housing and/ or 
employment development as illustrated on the Policies Map (see Appendix E: 
Sustainable Urban Extensions and Safeguarded Land Allocation Profiles ).  
Master Planning  
7.17 To facilitate the development of the three largest and most complex Sustainable 
Urban Extensions (at Knowsley Lane, Huyton; East Halewood, and South Whiston 
and land south of M62), further policy guidanc e is provided within Policies SUE2a 
to SUE2c. The Council is also preparing Supplementary Planning Documents for 
these sites which will provide further guidance including a spatial development 
framework for each site.  
7.18 All planning applications within these three Sustainable Urban Exte nsions should 
be consistent with a single comprehensive master plan for the site which shows 
how the principles set out in any Supplementary Planning Document which has 
been adopted by the Council will be delivered. The master plan for each 
Sustainable Urb an Extension should demonstrate appropriate evidence of 
stakeholder involvement and consultation and provide a comprehensive phased 
approach to the development of the Sustainable Urban Extension as a whole. The 
Council will also require a comprehensive app roach to the provision of any 
developer contributions towards infrastructure requirements required to enable the 
overall development of these Sustainable Urban Extensions.  
7.19 In the case of the smaller Sustainable Urban Extensions (i.e. those not mentioned 
in paragraph 7.17 above ) the Council does not intend to prepare Supplementary 
Planning Documents. Planning applications in these locations will however need to 
demonstrate a comprehensive approach to delivery o f development within the site 
and to the provision of any necessary infrastructure or developer contributions.  
Further Site -specific Guidance  
7.20 Further guidance for the development of each SUE is contained within their 
Allocation Profile (see Appendix E ).   
 
Page 128 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Policy SUE 2a: Sustainable Urban Extension – Knowsley  Lane, Huyton  
7.21 The Knowsley Lane, Huyton Sustainable Urban Extension is allocated on land 
between North Huyton and the M57 to the north. The site is approximately 40 
hectares in g ross area.  
Policy SUE2a  
Sustainable Urban Extension – Knowsley Lane, Huyton  
Overall Development Strategy  
1) The comprehensive development of Land at Knowsley Lane, Huyton will be 
suppor ted. The site is allocated for:  
a) New housing development (in the central part of the site) comprising 
approximately 100 dwellings, to provide a wider choice of housing in 
conjunction with the wider North Huyton and Stockbridge Village Principal 
Regeneration Area (see Policy CS 9); 
b) New employment development  (in the eastern part of the site) comprising at 
least 16 hectares of Business Uses (Use Class B1) or other appropriate 
employment uses within the Liverpool City Region key economic sectors, 
unless such provision is no longer required based upon evidence of  up to 
date employmen t land requirements and supply;  and 
c) Public open space comprising outdoor sporting provision and associated 
amenity space in the western part of the site (see Policy CS21 ). 
2) The employment uses referred to in criter ion 1b) must be of a nature which 
would not cause detriment to the amenity of nearby residents. Any employment 
uses which fall within the definition of town centre uses as defined in Policy 
CS4 must be subject to the application of the  sequential and impact tests.  
Specific Development Requirements  
3) In addition to meeting the generic guidance in Policy SUE2 , development 
within this site should deliver (in no order of priority):  
a) Appropriate highways access together  with a well connected internal road 
system and traffic mitigation measures;  
b) Gateway enhancement and associated high quality design at the eastern 
side of the site adjacent to the M57; and  
c) Appropriate interface distances between the mix of uses within the site and 
to existing residential areas at Knowsley Lane and George Hale Avenue to 
maintain a good standard of amenity.  
4) Further details of these requirements will be set out in the Supplementary 
Planning Document for this site referred to in Policy SUE2 .

Developability and Constraints  
7.22 The Council considers that, based on an assessment of its physical and planning 
constraints, the land at Knowsley Lane, Huyton, has an indicativ e development 
capacity of approximately 100 dwellings and 16 hectares of employment land. The 
area of the site west of George Hale Avenue has been excluded from the 
developable area as it is used for outdoor sports provision and is required to meet 
the Cou ncil's standards for this use. This area of the site would otherwise be 
appropriate for housing development.  
Neighbouring Regeneration Areas  
7.23 The Knowsley Lane site is on the edge of the North Huyton and Stockbridge 
Village Principal Regeneration Area, as  defined in Policy CS9 . Due to the high 
levels of deprivation in North Huyton and Stockbridge Village and the Council's on 
going commitment to the regeneration of these areas, the development of the 
Knowsley Lane site will need to comp lement and effectively integrate with the re -
development of these wider areas.  
Employment Uses  
7.24 Policy SUE 2a specifies that at least 16 hectares of the Knowsley Lane site should 
be reserved for employment uses to provide a sustainable business park 
environ ment to supplement the existing provision nearby at Kings Business Park 
and meet identified sector needs. Development proposals which would lead to 
employment land provision being below this amount will not be permitted unless it 
can be demonstrated that s uch provision is no longer required having regard to the 
Council’s most up to date Monitoring Report and evidence base. Employment 
development within the site should be limited to Business uses (within Use Class 
B1) and other appropriate employment uses wi thin the Liverpool City Region key 
economic sectors (as listed at paragraph 5.28) provided that these are compatible 
with nearby residential development. Uses within the LCR key economic sectors 
that are classif ied as ‘main town centre uses ’ will be subject to the sequential and 
impact tests as appropriate.    
 
Page 130 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Policy SUE 2b: Sustainable Urban Extension – East of Halewood  
7.25 The East of Halewood Sustainable Urban Extension is allocated on two parcels of 
land to the east  of Baileys Lane and Greensbridge Lane. The two sites jointly 
cover approximately 82 hectares in gross area.  
Policy SUE2b  
Sustainable Urban Extension – East of Halewood  
Overall D evelopment Strategy  
1) The comprehensive development of the land East of Halewo od will be 
suppor ted. The site is allocated for:  
a) New residential development comprising approximately 1,100 dwellings, to 
provide a wider choice of housing; and  
b) Public open space including flood storage and mitigation measures 
adjacent to Ditton Brook nort h of the Liverpool –Manchester railway line. 
Flood mitigation should be deliver ed in accordance with Policy CS 24: Flood 
Risk and any future site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
Specific Development Requirements  
2) In addition to meeting  the generic guidance in Policy SUE 2, proposals for 
residential development of the land East of Halewood should deliver (in no 
order of priority):  
a) Safe and convenient highways access for the site together with a well 
connected interna l road system and traffic mitigation measures, including

generation in the wider area;  
b) Provision for public transport, walking and cycling, which enhance linkages 
within the area and s urrounding areas including linkages to Halewood 
District Centre, Spo rts Centre and Railway Station;  
c) Key infrastructure and services to meet needs arising from the site and/ or

Developability and Constraints  
7.26 The ‘Green Bel t’ and ‘Sustainable Urban Extension ’ Technical Reports assess the 
physical and planning constraints relating to the East of Halewood Sustainable 
Urban Extension and identify an indicative development capacity of approximately 
1,100 dwellings to be develope d up to 2028.  
7.27 An existing RSPCA facility and associated area near the south end of the site (off 
Higher Road) has been excluded from the developable area as it is not available 
for development. This area would otherwise be suitable for further housing 
development. An existing school and associated public open space near the 
centre of the site is also not currently available for development. Any 
redevelopment of the site will need to consider local requirements for education 
and public open space provision as well as meet all the other requirements of a 
high quality development set out in Policies SUE2  and SUE2b). This must also 
include appropriate flood risk mitigation measures at the north end of the site 
adjacent to Ditton Brook, and  a comprehensive assessment of all other 
infrastructure requirements needed to serve the site. A key requirement will be to 
provide good quality linkages by public transport, walking and cycling to the 
Halewood district centre and sports centre from the si te.

Policy SUE2c: Sustainable Urban Extension – South  of Whiston and 
Land South of M62  
7.28 The South Whiston and Land South of M62 Sustainable Urban Extension is 
allocated on land to either side of the M62 and covers approximately 187 hectares 
in total gross area. This is the largest Sustainable Urban Extension identified in the 
Core Strategy107. 
Policy SUE2c  
Sustainable Urban Extension – South of Whiston and Land South 
of M62  
Overall development strategy  
1) The comprehensive development of Land South of Whiston and Land South of 
the M62 will be supported. The si tes are allocated for:  
a) New housing development (north of the M62) comprising approximately 
1,500 dwellings, to pro vide a wider choice of housing;  
b) New employment development (south of the M62) comprising at  least 22.5 
hectares of logistics, storage and distribution uses (within Use Class B8) or 
other appropriate employment uses within the Liverpool City  Region key 
economic sectors subject to application of the sequential and impact tests 
(where required unde r Policy CS4 ); and  
c) A country park within the broad extent of the former Cronton Colliery  
including public open space and the creation of associated footpaths, cycle 
ways and bridleways.  
Specific Development Requirements  
2) In addition t o meeting the generic guidance in Policy SUE2 , proposals for 
residential and/ or employment development at South Whiston and Land South 
of the M62 should del iver (in no order of priority):  
a) Safe and convenient highways access for the s ites together with a well 
connected internal road system and traffic mitigation measures, including 
any measures needed to address the impact of the development on traff ic 
generation in the wider area;  
b) Provision for public transport, walking and cycling, w hich enhance linkages 
within the area and surrounding areas including linkages to the former 
mineral railway line linking Cronton Colliery and Stadt Moers Park and to 
Whiston railway station;  
c) Public Open Space (POS) within a wider Green Infrastructure netw ork 
                                            
107 Although these sites have been removed from the Green Belt as separate allocations by Policy 
SUE1 (and in Appendix E), their strategic importance to the district combined with the shared 
infrastructure requirements which will arise from developm ent means that they have been dealt 
with as a single Sustainable Urban Extension by Policies SUE2 and SUE2c.

Page 133 integrating with existing POS, recreational assets, areas of ecological value 
and the Whiston to Cronton strategic green link (see Policy CS8: Green 
Infrastructure ); and  
d) Key infrastructure and services, including consideration of r equirements for  
new local retail provision and a primary school of appropriate scale to meet 
needs arising from the site, and/ or appropriate financial contributions to 
meet these needs off -site.

Deve lopability and Constraints  
7.29 The Green Belt and Sustainable Urban Extensions Technical Reports assess the 
physical and planning constraints affecting the South Whiston and land south of 
M62 Sustainable Urban Extension. The reports identify an indicative deve lopment 
capacity of approximately 1,500 dwellings at South of Whiston and 22.5 hectares 
of employment land at Land South of M62. These capacity estimates take account 
of constraints within the site allocation including Local Wildlife and Geological 
Sites. The extent of these designations and the findings of up to date ecological 
assessments will be considered by the master planning process.  
7.30 The north eastern part of the land South of Whiston includes Fox’s Bank Lane 
Cemetery and a wider area with scope for use as expansion land for the cemetery 
(part of which already has planning permission for this use). All the cemetery 
expansion land has currently been excluded from the indicative developable area 
although the extent of the potential future cemetery expan sion will be reviewed in 
the Council’s proposed Supplementary Planning Document. There may be scope 
for the indicative dwelling capacity to be increased as a result. The detailed master 
plan for this Sustainable Urban Extension must also take account of th e potential 
need for off site highway and other transport improvements, additional schooling 
capacity, local shopping needs and other infrastructure needs connected with a 
developme nt of this scale on this site.   
 
Page 134 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
7.31 The Council will support proposals for a Cou ntry Park within the broad extent of 
the former Cronton Colliery, proposals for which should integrate effectively with 
adjacent employment development and provide good quality public access and 
permeability.  
Employment Uses  
7.32 A small area between Windy Arbo r Road and Windy Arbor Brow has been 
excluded from the indicative developable area although may be suitable for 
employment development. Further details in relation to this issue will be set out in 
the proposed Supplementary Planning Document.  
7.33 Policy SUE 2c specifies that at least 22.5 hectares of employment land be provided 
on land to the South of the M62 as this aligns with the indicative developable area 
identified as suitable to meet identified sector needs. Delivery of employment land 
provision above thi s amount will be supported, where it can be demonstrated that 
this would contribute to meeting the needs of Liverpool City Region key economic 
sectors (as identified in paragraph 5.28, subject to the application  of sequential 
and impact tests for ‘main town centre uses ’ as appropriate) and would be 
compatible with development of a Country Park within the former colliery. The 
Council’s proposed Supplementary Planning Document will consider the 
implications of mixe d uses within this part of the site in further detail.  
  
 Thematic Policies and Delivery 
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 8 Balancing the Housing Market  
Page 137 8 Balancing the Housing Market  
8.1 This chapter builds upon earlier chapters by setting out more detailed policies 
which aim to re -balance Knowsley's housing market so that i t better caters for 
people who live in the borough  or who wish to do so. The chapter contains four 
policies:  
 Policy CS15: Delivering Affordable Housing  
 Policy CS16: Specialist and Supported Accommodation  
 Policy CS17: Housing Sizes and Design Standards  
 Policy CS18: Accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople  
Policy CS15: Delivering Affordable Housing  
8.2 There are established issues regarding the affordability of housing in Knowsley, 
based on the difficulties faced by many local household ers in buying or renting a 
dwelling which suits their needs. These difficulties are associated with low income 
levels (relative to the cost of housing) and the difficulty that some householders 
face in obtaining housing finance. Therefore, there is a need to seek to deliver, as 
well as a better choice of market housing, additional affordable housing solutions 
within the borough . 
8.3 The terms ‘affordable housing ’, ‘social rented housing ’ and ‘intermediate housing ’ 
are defined in Appendix B : Detailed Definitions . 
Policy CS15  
Delivering Affordable Housing  
Affordable Housing provision  
1) Within all proposed market sector housing developments which have a 
capacity of 15 dwellings or more, a minimum provision of affordable ho using 
will be sought as follows: 10% on sites within the current urban area; and 25% 
on sites identified as Sustainable Urban Extensions within Policies SUE1 to 
SUE2c . The application of these requirements will be subject to the follo wing:  
a) A lower proportion of affordable housing will only be permitted where it is 
clearly demonstrated that affordable housing provision is being maximised 
within the development and that achieving provision at the levels set out 
above would render the dev elopment not economically viable ( in 
accordance with Policy CS27 ); 
b) Affordable housing should be provided on site and must be fully integrated 
with and not distinguishable from market housing provided. It must be 
demonstrated that affo rdable housing will be secured and deliver ed 
alongside the market housing;  
c) In exceptional circumstances where on -site provision is not suitable or 
feasible, the Council will accept off site provision or a financial contribution 
in lieu of provision;   
 
Page 138 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
d) Demons trable sub -division of adjoining sites, manipulation of site layouts 
and/or building at lower densities to avoid compliance with the requirement 
for affordable housing prov ision will be not be acceptable;  
e) The tenure of affordable housing provided will be informed by evidenc e 
regarding local housing needs;  
f) All new affordable housing delivered through this policy should include 
provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households or 
for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative a fforda ble housing provision; 
and 
g) The size and design of new affordable housing provided should comply with 
Policy CS17 : Housing Sizes and Design Standards . 
Securing Affordable Housing Contributions  
2) The Council will seek in -kind or financi al contributions from developers to 
secure affordable housing provision, through an appropriate legal agreement or 
other mechanism as appropriate. Further details are set out in Policy CS27 : 
Planning and Paying for New Infrastructure , a proposed Developer 
Contributions Supplementary Planning Document and/ or a Community 
Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule.  
Partnership Working with Registered Providers  
3) The Council will work with Registered Providers and other agencies to provide 
new affordable housing developments, using available public sector funding 
streams. Support will be given to Registered Providers in making the most 
efficient use of housing stock and land holdings, by supporting renewal 
initiatives and addressing issues of housing vacancy, under - and over -
occupation.

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 8 Balancing the Housing Market  
Page 139 Housing Affordability  
8.4 Knowsley's housing market is mixed, and includes a range of both market and 
affordable housing. However, available evidence clearly demons trates that the 
affordability of housing for local people is an issue in the borough , alongside the 
need for additional homes across all sectors. Policy CS3 : Housing Supply, 
Delivery and Distribution  seeks to secure overall housing gro wth, a nd is 
complemented by Policy CS 15, which seeks to ensure that a sufficient component 
of this housing growth is affordable, through the operation of a developer 
contri bution policy for this purpose.  
8.5 Policy CS 15 has been set with regard to evidence of the scale of affordable 
housing need108 and to ensure that the required level of affordable housing is set 
at an appropriate level so as not to detrimentally affect the economic viability of 
market housing schemes109. This evidence suggests that there is gener ally a 
higher level of development viability in the proposed Sustainable Urb an 
Extensions (see Policies SUE1 to SUE 2c) than in existing urban areas. Policy 
CS15 therefore sets a variable target of 10% or 25% affordable housing provisi on 
according to which of these types of site are involved in specific cases.  
Delivery and Viability  
8.6 The policy also enables the target to be varied in circumstances where the 
developer can demonstrate, with clear and transparent evidence, that meeting the 
target would render the specific development economically unviable. The policy 
has been set with regard to borough -wide economic viability. Any proposals to 
relax the 25% or 10% requirements set out in the policy will need to be justified 
having regard to specific and independently verifiable evidence concerning the 
viability of the development proposal. Similarly, the developer will need to 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances in the instance that off -site or financial 
rather than on -site provisions are s ought. Such circumstances will need to be set 
out clearly in relation to development -specific constraints and/ or economic viability. 
This is in order that the affordable housing provided is mixed with the market 
housing, thereby meeting plan objectives ar ound the provision of balanced and 
sustainable res idential communities. Policy CS 27: Planning an d Paying for New 
Infrastructure  sets out in more detail how developer contributions will operate 
within the borough . This will be suppleme nted by a Developer Contributions SPD 
and/or a Community Infrast ructure Levy Charging Schedule.  
8.7 The Council will scrutinise planning applications to ensure that developers have 
not taken deliberate steps to avoid c ompliance with Policy CS 15. Such steps may

include sub -division of development site s, such that the number of dwellings within 
each parcel falls below the policy threshold, or manipulation of site layouts to 
reduce the number of dwellings which would normally have been provided.  
Affordable Housing Tenure  
8.8 The Council's evidence base indic ates that the tenures of affordable housing 
should be mixed in order to meet local housing needs . In general terms the 
evidence110 currently shows a need across Knowsley for a tenure split of 75% 
affordable rent and 25% intermediate housing.  
8.9 This position wi ll be updated with regard to findings of monitoring processes, 
newly emerging evidence regarding local housing needs, or to reflect the 
emergence of new types of affordable housing products. When assessing 
proposals within which affordable housing is being  sought on or off site the Council 
will apply a tenure split which is based on the latest evidence of need and is 
consistent with the objective of re -balancing the housing stock. The Council may 
also consider the extent to which the net amount of affordabl e housing that can 
viably be delivered is affected by the tenure mix of housing that is to be provided.  
8.10 When affordable housing is proposed to be delivered in connection with market 
housing developments, the Council will normally seek a legal agreement to ensure 
that the affordable housing provided  remains at an affordable price for future 
eligible households or that any subsidy is recycled for alternative affordable 
housing provision.  
8.11 Policy CS 15 complies with the Council's Housing Strategy111, Empty Homes 
Strategy and other supporting strategies.

Page 141 Policy CS 16: Specialist and Supported Accommodation  
8.12 In Knowsley, there is an established shortage of housing which is available to 
meet the needs of those who require specialist or supported accommodation. This 
is particularly important when considering the likely changing housing needs up to 
2028, including the very significant projected increase in the numbers of older 
people requiring housing in Knowsley.  
8.13 A definition of what is meant by ‘specialist and supporte d accommodation ’ is given 
in Appendix B : Detailed Definitions . 
Policy CS16  
Specialist and Supported Accommodation  
1) To meet the needs of households requiring specialist housing or supported 
accommodation, the Counc il will work with partners to:  
a) Make better use of the current housing stock through improvements to its 
quality, remodelling or replacing existing accom modation to meet changing 
needs;  
b) Support non -accommodation based interventions, intended to achieve 
sustainab le independence for individuals; and  
c) Develop integrated social well -being, housing and planning strategies which 
seek to holistically address specialist housing needs and demands.  
2) The Council will provide or support the provision of new specialist and  
supported residential accommodation, which will:  
a) Be located in an appropriate environment, near to highways and public 
transport links and local amenities;  
b) Feature ease of access for those with mobility, p hysical or sensory 
disabilities;  
c) Facilitate opport unities to align residential facilities with health and social 
care services  
d) Be well -designed and attractive, in compliance with Policy CS19 : Design 
Quality and A ccessibility in New Development  and takes account of 
consultation with r elevant community groups and/ or potential occupiers; and  
e) Feature an appropriate mix of tenures, including affordable and market 
units.

Delivery of Specialist and  Supported Accommodation  
8.14 National planning policy identifies the need to recognise the specific housing 
requirements of older people and different groups in creating mixed and 
sustainable communities.  
8.15 The Knowsley Strategic Housing Market Assessment identi fies that Knowsley's 
housing market requires re -balancing to better meet the needs and demands of 
those living in Knowsley. It indicates that the significant anticipated growth in the 
population aged over 65 in Knowsley will have major impacts on demands f or 
appropriate housing and support services for this age group. As a consequence, 
there is a need to provide appropriate housing, including bungalows, and specialist 
housing like sheltered housing and supported or extra care housing.  
8.16 In some cases, where i t is not possible to provide new accommodation, this may 
mean adopting a flexible approach to altering and/ or extending existing properties. 
In addition, it is recognised that non -accommodation based interventions may 
present the most favourable solution for those requiring specialist housing, 
including the potential for joined up activities between the Council and its partners, 
which may assist those with specialist needs to remain in their existing homes.  
   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 8 Balancing the Housing Market  
Page 143 Policy CS 17: Housing Sizes and Design Standards  
8.17 Knowsley has a wide range of existing housing, but this may not always meet the 
needs of existing or newly forming households, due to the unsuitability of the type 
or size of housing. In order to better provide for those living in, or seeking to live in 
Knowsley, there is a need to address existing imbalances.  
Policy CS17  
Housing Sizes and Design Standards  
Achieving a Mix of Housing Sizes  
1) An appropriate mix of dwelling sizes will be sought across the borough , having 
regard to evidence of local housing ne eds and the monitoring of housing 
completions (see Table 8.1: Mix of dwelling sizes for new housing in 
Knowsley ). 
2) For individual residential developments of 15 dwellings or more, developers 
must demonstrate how the ir scheme contributes to the re -balancing of 
Knowsley's housing market in terms of the size of dwellings provided.  
3) For smaller residential developments, a mix of housing sizes should be 
provided which complement the overall mix available in the area.  
Resi dential Design Standards  
4) All new residential development in Knowsley will be encouraged to comply with 
the following design standards (or equivalent replacement standard):  
a) Building for Life standards;  
b) Lifetime Homes design criteria; and  
c) Specific design an d sustainability guidance in Policy CS19 : Design Quality 
and A ccessibility in New Development , Policy CS22: Sustainable and Low 
Carbon Development  and relevant Supplementary Planning Documents112.

8.18 Reflecting national planning policy, Policy CS17 seeks to provide balanced and 
mixed residential communities , with an appropriate mix of housing sizes and 
types, to better meet a range of housing needs and demands, across different 
tenures. Policy CS17 also emphasises the need for new residential development 
to be of a high quality in terms of design standards a nd sustainability.  
Housing Sizes  
8.19 The Council's evidence base113 has assessed the existing housing stock in the 
borough  and made recommendations about the types and sizes of housing that 
need to be delivered across the plan period, in order to re -balance the housing 
market. The findings of the evidence are set out in Table 8.1.

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 8 Balancing the Housing Market  
Page 145 8.20 Through the planning application process, new residential developments will need 
to demonstrate how the size of dwellings provided contributes towards re -
balancing the housing market across the borough , and that the mix of sizes is 
suitable for the locality of the development. This should be undertaken with regard 
to the available and up -to-date evidence114. Policy CS 17 seeks to maintain 
flexibility so that new residential development can respond to the particular 
characteristics of a development site, and a range of different types of residential 
development schemes (e.g. family houses, apartments, sheltered housing 
schemes) can be reasonably accounted for.  
Residential Design  
8.21 More information regarding the desig n standards listed in Po licy CS 17 is given 
below. These standards may be replaced during the plan period; the Council will 
take into account any revisions to the standards, and if necessary, adapt its 
approach by reviewing this policy or providing supplementary guidance in a futu re 
Local Plan document or SPD.  
8.22 Building for Life: Building for Life represents the industry standard for well -
designed homes and neighbourhoods, endorsed by Government. In 2013, an 
updated Building for Life scheme was launched by the Home Builders Federati on, 
Design for Homes and Cabe at the Design Council, known as ‘Building for Life 12 ’. 
This scheme includes twelve criteria which are rated for each development using a 
traffic light system. ‘Amber ’ and ‘red’ outcomes indicate that the scheme will need 
to be changed, whilst a ‘green ’ outcome indicates that the criteria have been fully 
met. If it is agreed between the developer, stakeholders and the Council that all 
criteria have been met the scheme will be eligible for Building for Life 12 ‘Diamond 
status ’. The Council supports the undertaking of Building for Life 12 and the 
meeting of all 12 criteria will be encouraged.  
8.23 Lifetime Homes: The Lifetime Homes design criteria115 are widely recognised by 
local authorities, developers and partners and provide a mechan ism to ensure that 
new housing development is suitable for the changing needs of individuals and 
families over the course of a lifetime. The Lifetime Homes standard is awarded to 
schemes which meet all sixteen of the Lifetime Homes design criteria. This 
approach will ensure that accommodation for older people is flexible enough to 
respond to accessibility needs for the less mobile.

Policy CS 18: Accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers and 
Travelling  Showpeople  
8.24 Available evidence indicates an established n eed within the Liverpool City Region 
for additional accommodation for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
communities116. In accordance with national policy, the accommodation of these 
groups should be addressed as part of planning for new resident ial development.  
Policy CS18  
Accommodation for Gypsie s and Travellers and 
Travelling  Showpeople  
Development of Sites  
1) Proposals for the development of sites for the accommodation of Gypsies, 
Travellers or Travelling Showpeople will need to demonstrate the  following, 
which will apply equally to sites for permanent or transit use:  
a) An appropriate site design and layout, including sufficient space for marked 
pitches, parking, on -site facilities, amenity space and internal circulation, in 
accordance with nation al guidance117; 
b) Suitability of the site in terms of accessibility, including vehicular and 
pedestrian access;  
c) Ease of access to local centres, health services, education facilities, public 
transport nodes and employment opportunities;  
d) Availability of a suffi cient level of supporting physical infrastructure, 
including ensuring the site can be served by adequate electricity, water, 
sewerage and other utilities connections;  
e) Suitability of physical environmental conditions for site occupation, including 
ground co nditions and minimised flood risk;  
f) Ability to maintain or improve local environmental quality and character, 
including landscape character and (where applicable) consistency with the 
purposes of including land within the Green Belt; and  
g) Compatibility of si te occupation with surrounding land uses.  
2) The relative attractiveness of locations for travelling communities, including 
proximity to existing sites and extended family households, the availability of 
alternative accommodation, and the ability to co -exist with existing settled 
communities, will be considered. It will also need to be demonstrated that the 
site can be appropriately managed and maintained throughout the period of its 
occupation.  
3) Sites for the accommodation for Travelling Showpeople should also  account for

4) The Council's approach to planning for Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling 
Show People will capitalise on opportunities to work with other Council service 
areas and partners to provide integrated support for such communities.  
Identifying Sites  
5) The Council will establish the level of need for a site or sites in Knowsley for 
the accommodation of Gypsies and Travellers and/ or Travelling Showpeople 
with reference to up -to-date evidence. Due consideration will be given to the 
size of the site(s) required and the number of pitches which will need to be 
accom modated, with reference to the available evidence of need and demand 
for new accommodation, and any appropriate viability issues. In line with 
national policy, the target for accommodation to be provided, including 
appropriate five year requirements, and t he location of any site(s) required to 
meet the target will be identified in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and 
Development Policies, using the criteria in this policy for guidance.

Accommodation for Gypsies,  Travellers or Travelling Showpeople  
8.25 National planning policy118 requires local authorities to plan positively for the needs 
of Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople communitie s. The central aim 
of Policy CS 18 is to ensure that travelling communities  occupy sites which are 
sustainable and meet their needs in terms of access to physical, social and 
community infrastructure.

Page 148 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Identification and Development of Sites  
8.26 There are currently no authorised sites for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation in 
Knowsley.  The most recent available local evidence119 concluded that a number of 
pitches across the Liverpool City Region, including a comparatively small number 
within Knowsley, would be required to meet longer term needs for Gy psies and 
Travellers. Policy CS 18 reco gnises that responding to an up -to-date and accurate 
evidence base which is supported by travelling communities is a critical element of 
planning to meet such needs.  
8.27 The Council will therefore maintain an up -to-date evidence base on this matter, 
accounting  for evidence previously collected through the Merseyside GTAA, 
regionally collated evidence120, and also for any newly collected evidence about 
the need and demand for accommodation in Knowsley. The Council will then 
finalise its approach to planning for tr avelling communities, including setting plan 
period and five year pitch targets, and if appropriate, outline the size of site(s) 
which will be required, in line with national policy. Should the need for a site or 
sites be identified, this will be allocated  within a subsequent Local Plan document, 
using the criteria in  Policy CS 18 to identify an appropriate location(s). Particular 
emphasis will be placed on ensuring that any proposed site is viable in terms of 
size and location and that it would be attractiv e to travelling communities, and 
hence deliverable in planning terms.  
8.28 Outside this process, Policy CS 18 primarily sets local criteria for consideration of 
any planning applications for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
accommodation that may b e lodged with the Council, to be considered alongside 
national policy on this matter.

Chapter 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
Page 149 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
9.1 This chapter builds upon the vision, objectives and policies presented in earlier 
chapters and aims to promote a better quality of place to att ract and retain 
residents and businesses and promote the creation of attractive, sustainable 
neighbourhoods. The chapter contains three policies:  
 CS 19: Design Quality and Accessibility in New Development  
 CS 20: Managing the Borough's Heritage  
 CS 21: Urba n Greenspaces  
Policy CS 19: Design Quality and Accessibility in New Development  
9.2 The Vision (as set out in Chapter 3 : Vision and Objectives ) aims to ensure that 
Knowsley has successful suburban townships which provide a sense of place and 
community. There is considerable scope for new development to improve the 
quality of place and character within Knowsley, by promoting attractive design of 
new buildings and spaces.  
Policy CS19  
Design Quality and Accessibility in New D evelopment  
1) To enhance the local distinctiveness, identity and accessibility of places, new 
development within Knowsley will be expected to:  
a) Respond to and integrate positive characteristics of immediate 
surroundings, including local materials, scale, mass , form, layout, alignment 
and density of the existing built environment;  
b) Complement and enhance (where possible), existing landscape, 
topography, Green Infrastructure; and features of local importance and 
historic interest;  
c) Consider provision of landmark b uildings and additional detailing at and 
adjacent to main gateways, movement corridors, town centres and strategic 
regeneration opportunities;  
d) Create spaces and places as a focal point, accommodating social 
interaction and active lifestyles, including prov ision and integration of high 
quality public realm and open spaces, public art (as appropriate); and 
landscaping which promotes biodiversity and integrates existing local 
habitats;  
e) Provide safe, secure and convenient routes for movement (including 
signage) , with priority for walking, cycling and public transport, to meet the 
access needs of all users, particularly pedestrians, cyclists, less mobile 
people and the elderly;  
f) Integrate effectively with existing development and link to existing shopping 
and serv ice provision; and  
g) Demonstrate community engagement during the design phase of major 
development proposals.  
2) To maintain a good standard of amenity for all existing and future occupants of  
 
Page 150 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
land and buildings, development proposals will be required to:  
a) Avoid  unacceptable impacts on existing residents, business occupiers, and 
future occupiers;  
b) Minimise crime, fear of crime and anti -social behaviour, including good 
levels of natural surveillance and security; and  
c) Accommodate future maintenance and long term man agement 
requirements.  
3) To address the challenges of climate change and future changes in social, 
economic and environmental priorities, new development should integrate:  
a) Sustainable design principles, with regard to Policy CS17 : Housing  Sizes 
and Design Standards  and Policy CS22 : Sustainable and Low Carbon 
Development  as appropriate;  
b) Biodiversity (in accordance with Policy CS8 );  
c) Flood risk mitigation (in accordance with Policy CS24 );  
d) Waste recycling; and  
e) Energy and resource efficiency.  
4) Further guidance on these issues will be provided in the Local Plan: Site 
Allocations and Development Policies document and Supplementary Planning 
Documents as appropriate.

Enhancing Local Distinctiveness, Identity and Accessibility  
9.3 In order to enhance Knowsley's existing built and natural environment, improve 
local distinctiveness and make areas more attractive, sustainable, safer and better 
connected, it is necessary to establish high standards of design and accessibility. 
A positive image for Knowsley is vital to encoura ge investment and to improve  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
Page 151 quality of life for residents. Image is strongly  influenced by buildings, spaces and 
cultural landmarks with the approach seeking to reflect positive characteristics of 
immediate surroundings including the importance of respond ing to, complementing 
and integrating views and scenery, particularly of natural landscapes.  
9.4 The general principles within the policy seek to ensure that new development 
enhances the ‘quality of place ’ in Knowsley. Identifying specific priority areas will 
allow the Council to encourage the most innovative and creative designs in areas 
that have the greatest impact in raising the image of Knowsley and attracting new 
residents and investment. Raising the design quality of key gateways, town 
centres and transp ort corridors will improve the area for residents, visitors and 
potential investors by providing a more positive and welcoming impression.  
9.5 National planning policy also seeks to ensure that new development is easily 
accessible by a choice of walking, cycli ng and public transport, appropriate to the 
scale and type of development proposed. This can be managed either through 
choice of location for new development or developers agreeing to manage 
transport for their scheme in the most efficient way, including a ppropriate funding 
contributions towards improvements to the transport network. Transport 
Assessments and Green Travel plans are examples of information that may be 
required as part of a planning application to achieve this objective.  
Protecting Local Amen ity 
9.6 The design of new development should avoid unacceptable impacts which affect 
the amenity and living conditions of occupiers of buildings. Such effects can 
include generation of noise, light and air pollution and harmful overbearing and 
loss of privacy through overlooking.  
9.7 Good quality design helps to reduce crime and the fear of crime and thereby 
promote vibrant, safe and cohesive communities in which people will want to live . 
The requirements of Policy CS 19 complement principles in ‘Secured by  Design ’ – 
a police initiative to encourage the building industry to create a safer and more 
secure environment by appropriate design of new development121. 
9.8 The effective internal and external design of buildings, including orientation, layout 
of rooms, appropriate d rainage, position of windows and use of appropriate 
materials can reduce the need for future maintenance and the burden of long term 
management.  
Addressing the Challenges of Climate Change and Social, Economic and 
Environmental Priorities  
9.9 The policy approa ch to design quality and accessibility in new development is 
supported by Government policy and guidance. As part of this, the Council 
                                            
121 For more details see http://www.securedbydesign.com/   
 
Page 152 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
encourages the use of national accredited standards, i ncluding ‘Building for Life ’122 
and the ‘Lifetime Homes Standard ’123, (see also Policy CS 17: Housing Sizes and 
Design Standards  and Policy CS 22: Sustainable and Low Carbon Development ). 
Separate sustainable design standards are encouraged for non -residenti al 
buildings through BREEAM124. 
9.10 In addition, the design of development will be expected to support and integrate 
biodiversity enhancements, flood risk mitigation, energy /resource efficiency and 
waste recycling require ments, to accord with Policy CS 8: Green Infrast ructure , 
Policy CS 24: Managing Flood Risk  and Policy CS 26: Waste Management . 
Additional Guidance  
9.11 The Council will set out further guidance on design issues in proposed SPDs 
including that on Design Quality in Ne w Development and through a review of the 
current ‘Ensuring a Choice of Travel ’ SPD (adopted in 2010). These will define 
gateways and movement corridors, which are not identified specifically in the Local 
Plan Core Strategy. Maintaining a strategic design policy and then establishing 
more detailed design criteria for local character areas via SPDs ensures flexibility 
for innovative solutions to adapt to local characteris tics and varying circumstances.

Chapter 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
Page 153 Policy CS 20: Managing the Borough's Historic Environme nt 
9.12 Effective protection of Knowsley's historic buildings and conservation areas is 
important, as these contribute to quality of place, local distinctiveness, and a 
greater understanding of the past and provide an opportunity to promote 
Knowsley’s historic environment.  
Policy CS20  
Managing the Borough's Historic Environment  
1) Development proposals in Knowsley should preserve or enhance the 
borough ’s historic and architectural assets, including Listed Buildings, 
Conservation Areas, Historic Parks and Gardens a nd archaeological remains, 
together with other local areas, buildings and structures of historic importance. 
The Council will:  
a) Require preservation of the local distinctiveness and character of historic 
assets through sensitive design of new development, i ncluding appropriate 
integration with their setting and immediate landscape;  
b) Prevent demolition and/ or development which would result in substantial 
harm or the  loss of a designated historic asset or its setting , unless the 
proposal would result in substa ntial public benefits which clearly outweigh 
the harm or loss;  
c) Where a development proposal will result in less than substantial harm to a 
designated heritage asset  or its setting , assess such harm against the 
benefits of the proposal;  
d) Facilitate long term  conservation and enhancement of local assets and 
areas of historic importance, including through the preparation of 
Conservation Area Management Plans.  
2) The re -use of vacant and underused historic assets will be encouraged, with 
favourable consideration gi ven, where appropriate, to proposals which will:  
a) Enable a use for a purpose sympathetic to its conservation;  
b) Retain or introduce public access; and  
c) Enhance the importance of the asset for local tourism, leisure or the 
economy.  
3) Development proposals on site s which include, or are considered to have the 
potential to include, heritage assets or comprising archaeological interest, 
should be accompanied by a heritage impact statement.  
4) Locally important historic assets which are not subject to statutory designati on 
will be identified in a local list and will be afforded consideration in the decision 
making process.

Preserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment  
9.13 In dealing with new development proposals, the Council frequently needs to strike 
a balance between the protection of the built heritage and the need to allow 
original architecture and buildings that meet the needs of  modern businesses and 
residents. National planning policy establishes a presumption in favour of 
conserving designated heritage assets (such as Listed Buildings, Conservation 
Areas, Historic Parks and Gardens) and that the more significant the designated 
heritage asset is, the greater the presumption in favour of its conservation should 
be. 
9.14 Policy CS 20 intends to secure appropriate integration of development with 
Knowsley's heritage assets and provide a positive approach to their future 
management to safeg uard their preservation. This approach will support the area 
priorities identified for: 'Huyton and Stockbridge Village'; 'Kirkby'; 'Prescot, 
Whiston, Cronton and Knowsley Village'; and 'Halewood' and supplement the 
more general guida nce in Policy CS 19: Design Quality and A ccessibility in New 
Development  (whic h applies to all developments).  
Conservation Areas  
9.15 The designation of an area as a Conservation Area ensures that important local 
buildings are protected from unauthorised demolit ion and that new development is 
expected to integrate appropriately with the special character of the area, even if 
previous unsympathetic developments exist. The general presumption is always in 
favour of the preservation of buildings or structures that m ake a positive 
contribution to the character and appearance of a Conservation Area. This 
approach is not intended to prevent change or development, but to ensure that 
where change does take place, it helps to preserve or enhance the special 
character of th e area. The Council's 15 Conservation Area Appraisals undertaken 
in 2005 (identified in Chapter 2 : Knowsley – The Place ) are subject to potential  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
Page 155 review125. These will be used to develop more detailed Conservation Area 
Manage ment Plans and proposals for a five year period within a Historic 
Environment Strategy. This approach would define different types of intervention 
and management for each area and thereby strengthen their local distinctiveness. 
It will also  help address th e issues which have led to two of the areas (Prescot 
Town Centre and South Park Road, Kirkby) being considered to be ‘at risk ’ and 
provide a review of statutory listings and designations. This will include a review of 
existing Conservation Area boundaries.  
Listed Buildings  
9.16 Designation of a building or other structure as a Listed Building means that 
consent is required for its demolition, or for any works of alteration or extension, 
either internal or external which would affect its special interest. The Cou ncil will 
take positive action to secure the retention, repair, maintenance and continued use 
of Listed Buildings and ensure new buildings within the curtilage of, or close to, a 
Listed Building respect its setting and immediate landscape. Listed Buildings  are 
important to Knowsley's historic and cultural heritage and once lost, cannot be 
replaced. Knowsley's Listed Buildings (see Chapter 2 : Knowsley – The Place  and 
Chapter 6: Area Priorities ) are considered to have a special architectural and/ or 
historical character that is worthy of preservation. Although none of the Listed 
Buildings in Knowsley are on the national buildings at risk register and there are 
currently no designated ancient monuments, the intention of Po licy CS 20 is to 
ensure tha t provisions are in place to manage any change in circumstance of 
existing heritage assets, together with any additional designations which may be 
identified during the plan period.  
Historic Parks and Gardens  
9.17 Parts of the Knowsley Hall Estate and Croxteth Park also form an important part of 
Knowsley’s heritage, being included on the English Heritage Register of Parks and 
Garden s, and are covered by Policy CS 20. All development within  or close to 
these areas will be expected to be carefully designed and site d so as to avoid 
harm to their special character.  
Historic Environment Strategy, Local Listing and Archaeology  
9.18 The Historic Environment Strategy is intended to include a comprehensive 
assessment of historic and architectural assets in the area and their se ttings 
including their historical significance, physical status, opportunities for 
enhancement and expansion, and contribution to the delivery of other sustainable 
development objectives. This includes consideration of the potential to identify new 
sites o f historic or archaeologi cal interest to which Policy CS 20 will apply, with the 
                                            
125 At the time  of adoption, Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans had been 
updated for Prescot Town Centre (2012), The Orchard (2014), Victoria Road and Huyton Church 
Road, and Roby (both 2015).   
 
Page 156 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
process intended to inform designations within the Local Plan: Site Allocations and 
Development Policies.  
9.19 Other important areas and historic buildings and structures in Knowsle y are also 
valuable to local distinctiveness and character, despite falling outside of national 
statutory designations, and therefore the policy ensures an appropriate approach 
with an expectation that their character will be integrated with new developmen t. 
The Council will support this approach by producing a local list of buildings which 
are important in a local context because of their contribution to the area’s 
character, with supplementary policy guidance provided via the Design Quality and 
New Develo pment SPD.  
9.20 Knowsley contains a number of important archaeological remains which are 
important historical assets. New development should take into account the need to 
preserve or record archaeological remains. Where evidence suggests that 
development could  affect archaeological remains, the developer will be required to 
arrange investigations to assess their character,  condition and extent. In the event, 
that remains are identified as of specific importance, the developer may be 
required to design the devel opment to enable preservation in -situ, or if appropriate 
arrange for the excavation, recording, analysis and reporting of the remains.

9.21 Knowsley's Green Space Strategy126 provides the fo llowing vision for 
greenspaces:  
‘A linked, preserved and enhanced network of good quality greenspaces that 
excite and inspire communities and contribute towards the creation of vibrant, 
healthy and sustainable neighbourhoods acro ss Knowsley.’  
9.22 An appropriate quantity of diverse, accessible an d high quality open and 
greenspaces can contribute significantly to people's quality of life, the overall 
achievement of prosperous, vibrant and sustainable neighbourhoods and 
enhancement of Knowsley's image. Open and greenspaces have a key role in the 
protection of the environment, providing habitats for flora and fauna, and 
enhancing the health and wellbeing of communities by encouraging physical 
activity and exercise.  
Policy CS21  
Greenspaces and Trees  
Greenspace protection  
1) In supporting the wider Green  Infrastructure functions of urban greenspace in 
accordance with Policy CS8 , the Council will provide and maintain quantitative, 
qualitative and accessibility standards for different types of public open space.  
2) New development which wo uld result in the loss of urban greenspace, will not 
be permitted unless at least one of the following criteria are met:  
a) A surplus of provision for all types of greenspace would be maintained 
relative to local standards;  
b) The land is considered unsuitable i n terms of size, location or character to 
prevent or address individual deficiencies of different types of greenspace 
relative to local standards;  
c) Appropriate mitigation is provided through replacement facilities of at least 
an equal quantity, quality and accessibility;  
d) The development is required to improve greenspace provision or for 
ancillary facilities to support sport or recreation; or  
e) Where the proposal relates to the loss of indoor or outdoor sports provision, 
and there is no evidence of future or co ntinuing need for sports use, or 
alternatively only land incapable of forming a playing pitch or sporting facility 
is affected and its release accords with either clause 2 )a) or 2)b). 
3) Irrespective of whether criteria in 2 ) are met, unless the benefits of a  proposal 
clearly outweigh the loss of urban greenspace, development will be resisted 
where it would significantly harm any existing or potential special qualities of

a) Visual amenity;  
b) Residential amenity;  
c) Biodiversity and  environmental benefits;  
d) Historical, cultural or community value;  
e) Recreational benefits; or  
f) Physical and/ or visual linkages between adjoining urban greenspaces.  
Local Greenspace Standards  
4) The quantitative and accessibility standards for the provision of public open 
spaces within Substantial Residential Areas are set out in Table 9.1: 
Substantial Residential Area (SRA)  Standards for Greenspace Quantity and 
Accessibility  for the following greenspace typologies:  
a) Park and Garden;  
b) Amenity Greenspace;  
c) Provision for Children and Young People; and  
d) Allotments.  
5) The Council's quantitative standards for Outdoor Sports Provision are set out in 
Table 9.2: Community Area Standards  for Outdoor Sports Provision Quantity 
and Accessibility  and seek to maintain an appropriate range of sites and 
address quantitative needs for individual sports at a Community Area level.  
6) The Council will keep the standards of provision referred to above under review 
and if necessary publish revised standards in a future Local Plan document or 
Supplementary Planning  Document.  
Accessible and Quality Greenspaces  
7) The Council will support improvements to existing and new areas of 
greenspace in accordance with best practice standards127, to achieve the 
following requirements:  
a) Accessible, safe and secure locations for all members of the community to 
use; 
b) Clean and well maintained facilities, equipment and open spaces; and  
c) Conservation of natural features, wildlife, fauna, landscapes, buildings and 
other structural features, as appropriate.  
8) When considering proposals for new  residential development, the Council will 
seek enhancements to greenspaces via on -site provision, new off site provision 
or enhancement of existing off site provision through developer contributions 
secured by legal agreement in accordance with Policy CS27 : Planning an d 
Paying for New Infrastructure , the Developer Contributions Supplementary

Local Green Spaces  
9) Any Local Green Spaces Designat ions which are formally designated will be 
identified in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies or future 
Neighbourhood Plans (if applicable). This designation will only be used where 
the greenspace concerned is:  
a) Reasonably close to the community it serves;  
b) Demonstrably special to a local community and holds a particular local 
significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, 
recreational value (including as a playing field), tranquillity or richness of its 
wildlife;  and 
c) Local in character and not an extensive tract of land.  
Enhancement of Natural and Semi -Natural Greenspace and Tree Protection  
10) The Council will encourage proposals for new development to incorporate:  
a) Retention of existing trees, woodland, vegetation and other habitat features 
which offer a positive contribution to the local environment in terms of visual 
amenity, recreation value or biodiversity/ wildlife interest;  
b) Appropriate planting of trees, other soft landscaping and installation of 
habitat features for the benefit of biodiversity; and  
c) Adequate replacement provision where tree loss is unavoidable, comprising 
two additional trees for every tre e lost and taking account of species and 
size.

Greenspace Protection  
9.23 Polic y CS 21 reflects the importance of protecting and conserving greenspaces to 
meet local requirements for quantity, quality and accessibility which satisfy both 
current and future needs for residents and visitors. Greenspaces vary widely in 
type, size and val ue to the community, and smaller sites may not be identified 
specifically on the Council's Policies Map. All sites (irrespective of size) are 
identified in the Council's Greenspaces Audit, which is updated on a regular basis 
to assis t in decision making. P olicy CS 21 applies to all greenspaces identified in 
the Audit. However the Council will not seek to impose a definitive presumption 
against the development of urban greenspace. This is noting that there are areas 
of surplus provision relative to current st andards where there could be 
opportunities for new development to address other regen eration development 
priorities.  
9.24 The location and nature of any replacement facilities whi ch are required under 
Policy CS 21 should be informed by existing performance again st local standards. 
This assessment will inform whether they should be of the same nature as those 
that may be lost. Replacement facilities should always be of the same value to the 
community and ‘fit for purpose ’. For example, the replacement of playing p itches 
with artificial turf pitches may provide m ore games to be played per year /season, 
but may not be as adaptable for league play by the same number of sports.  
Local Greenspace Standards  
9.25 Councils are required by national policy to identify specific needs and quantitative 
or qualitative deficits or surpluses of open space, sports an d recreational facilities 
in their areas, to inform an effective strategy at a local level. In accordance with 
available evidence (see below), Policy CS 21 focuses resources towards upgrades 
to the quality and accessibility of provision (including public ri ghts of way) to meet 
local needs and the identification of any surplus land that may be suitable to meet 
other development needs.  
9.26 The calculation and assessment methodology which the Council will use to 
implement Policy CS 21 is based on Substantial Residen tial Areas (SRAs) and  
Community Areas (CAs), as identified in the proposed Developer Contributions 
SPD. The Council's Greenspaces Audit128 and Playing P itch Assessment and 
Strategy129 highlight the areas in the borough  facing the greatest quantitative need 
for different types of greenspaces and outdoor sports provision, together with 
those areas where the spaces need to be improved in quality or made more 
accessible. These studies informed the revisions to existing standards within Table 
9.1: Substantial Residential Area (SRA)  Standards for Greenspace Quantity and 
Accessibility  and Table 9.2: Community Area Standards  for Outdoor Sports 
Provision Quantity and Accessibility  below. They also informed updated priorities

Local Green Spaces  
9.28 Under the NPPF, Councils and local communities may formally designate areas as 
Local G reen Spaces. To be designated, areas must be regarded as being of 
special importance. Following designation, Local Green Spaces will be protected 
from development, other than in very special circumstances. Any designations of 
this type would need to be ide ntified in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and 
Development Policies or any future Neighbourhood Plans which are proposed (as 
appropriate). The Local Green Space designation will not be appropriate for most 
green areas or open space, as any proposed design ation for this purpose should 
only be made if:  
 the greenspace is in reasonably close proximity to the community that it serves;  
 the green area is demonstrably special to a local community and holds a 
particularly local significance, for example, because of  its beauty, historic 
significance, recreational value (including as a playing field), tranquillity or richness 
of its wildlife; and  
 the green area concerned is local in character and is not an extensive tract of land.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 9 Promoting Quality of Place  
Page 163 Natural and Semi -Natural Greenspace  
9.29 Natural England advises in their Accessible Natural Green Space Standard 
(ANGSt)130 that no person should live more than 300m from their nearest area of 
natural green space of at least two hectares in size. However the Council has no 
quantity, quality and acc essibility standards for this typology, as a significant 
amount of natural greenspace in the urban areas of the borough  serves a dual 
purpose with other existing typologies of greenspace (particularly parks and 
gardens) reflecting the multiple functions of  greenspace. Adequate provision for 
the protection and enhancement of natural and semi -natural greenspace is 
encompassed wit hin Policy CS 8, which covers the wider concept of Green 
Infrastructure.  
Tree Protection  
9.30 Trees and woodland are important to the quality of Knowsley's environment and 
can provide a natural measure to assist the mitigation of air pollution, noise 
pollution and the risk of flooding. Some trees and woodlands are afforded statutory 
protection by Tree Preservation Orders  (TPOs) issued under the Town and 
Country Planning (Tree Preservation)(England) Regulations 2012. Policy CS21, in 
conjunction with Policy CS8 : Green Infrastructure  will ensure that appropriate 
consideration is given to the protection o r enhancement of tree coverage on 
development sites, irrespective of whether the trees are statutorily protected.  
9.31 Consultation with the Forestry Commission is required where development 
proposals contain or are likely to affect Ancient Semi Natural woodlan ds or 
Plantations on Ancient Woodland sites. This includes proposals where any part of 
the development site is within 500 metres of an ancient semi -natural woodland or 
ancient replanted woodland, and where the development involves erecting new 
buildings, o r extending the footprint of existing buildings.

Chapter 10 Caring for Knowsley  
Page 165 10 Caring for Knowsley  
10.1 This chapter aims to ensure that Knowsley develops in a way which promotes a 
low carbon future, makes efficient use of the borough 's natural and minerals 
resources, and enables sustainab le management of waste. The chapter contains 
five policies as follows:  
 Policy CS 22: Sustainable and Low Carbon Development  
 Policy CS 23: Renewable and Low Carbon Infrastructure  
 Polic y CS 24: Managing Flood Risk  
 Policy CS 25: Management of Mineral Resources  
 Policy CS 26: Waste Management  
Policy CS 22: Sustainable and Low Carbon Development  
10.2 It is important that Knowsley's development needs up to 2028 are delivered in a 
sustainable manner, so that the link between carbon emissions and growth is 
broken and the borough 's vulnerable communities are protected from fuel poverty. 
Policy CS22 aims to achieve this by encouraging provision of appropriate 
renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure, and increasing energy efficiency 
through sustainable construction techni ques.  
Policy CS22  
Sustainable and Low Carbon Development  
Sustainable Construction Principles  
1) New development will be required to meet high standards of sustainable 
design and construction and minimise carbon emissions. This should be 
achieved by:  
a) Designi ng new buildings for flexible uses throughout their lifetime;  
b) Avoiding the creation of adverse local climate conditions by using natural 
systems to avoid internal overheating and excessive heat generation;  
c) Ensuring developments are comfortable and safe for  users;  
d) Making the most effective and sustainable use of water, aggregates and 
other resources;  
e) Limiting energy use by incorporating high standards of insulation, heat 
retention, natural ventilation and passive solar techniques;  
f) Landscaping (including meas ures such as green walls or roofs) to create 
shelter and reduce any heat island effect;  
g) Using sustainable materials from local suppliers where possible;  
h) Supplying energy efficiently and incorporating decentralised energy 
systems, using renewable and low ca rbon energy where feasible;  
i) Managing flood risk, including through the use of Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS) and flood resilient design for infrastructure and property; 
and 
j) Promoting sustainable waste practices in new and existing developments.   
 
Page 166 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Low C arbon Development, Community Energy Fund and Allowable 
Solutions  
2) Government targets for carbon reduction in new development are expected to 
be implemented through updates to the Building Regulations. Where it is not 
technically feasible or economically vi able to meet the requirements on site, 
contributions to the Council's Community Energy Fund may be accepted as 
one of a range of options under the Government's proposed ‘Allowable 
Solutions ’ mechanism. The Fund will be used to support carbon reduction 
initiatives in Knowsley and potentially the wider Liverpool City Region.  
Sustainable Construction Targets  
3) Local targets for sustainability in relation to specific development areas or sites 
may be outlined in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.  
Priority Zones and Decentralised Energy Networks  
4) Knowsley Industrial Park and Knowsley Business Park are identified as a 
‘Priority Zone ’. Within this area the Council and its partners will facilitate 
renewable and low carbon infrastructure by ( subject to feasibility) requiring new 
development to:  
a) Make provision for connection to an existing or planned decentralised 
energy network; and  
b) Be designed to enable future connectivity in terms of proposed site layout, 
infrastructure and heating provision , including consideration of connections 
at a later date or phase.  
5) Subject to opportunity and need, additional ‘Priority Zones ’ may be identified in 
the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.

The Need to Reduce Carbon Emissions  
10.3 The Planning Act 2008 emphasises the need for diversity in the nation's energy 
supply and the key role to be played in this by generation of renewable and low 
carbon energy. The Act also requires Local Plans to include policies that 
contribute to climate change adaptation and mi tigation. Policy CS 22 also supports 
policies for sustainable development and carbon reduction set down in the NPPF.  
10.4 The Liverpool City Region local authorities aim to reduce carbon emissions and 
recognise the economic opportunities presented by the t ransition toward a low 
carbon economy. This is demonstrated by the commitment of the Local Enterprise 
Partnership (LEP) which highlights developing a low carbon economy as a key 
element of achieving susta ined economic growth. Policy CS 22 supports these 
aspirations.  
Low Carbon Development and Carbon Compliance  
10.5 The Govern ment document ‘Plan for Growth ’131 sets out a timetable for the 
delivery of zero carbon development via a series of incremental changes to the 
national Building Regulations. Building Regulation s (Part L) cover carbon 
emissions from energy use through heating, fixed lighting and hot water (known as 
regulated energy). The regulations do not cover energy use from cooking or other 
plug-in electrical appliances (known as unregulated energy).  
10.6 Policy C S22 is consistent with the Government's planned programme for ensuring 
that new development is zero carbon. The policy adheres to the principles of 
                                            
131 The Plan for Growth (HM Treasury and Depart ment for Business and Innovation and Skills, 
2011)   
 
Page 168 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
carbon compliance, which are viewed by the Government as being key to reducing 
carbon emissions. Under the C arbon Compliance Pyramid, carbon emissions will 
be reduced as a first priority by minimising energy demand through an energy 
efficient approach to building design. This is followed by the use of low or zero 
carbon technologies for on -site energy generation  and connected heat systems. 
These first two steps together are referred to as Carbon Compliance. Any 
remaining carbon emissions which cannot be managed on -site are likely to be 
capable of being mitigated through the Government's proposed Allowable 
Solutio ns mechanism, under which developers would contribute towards off site 
delivery of carbon reduction measures.  
Figure 10.1: Carbon Compliance Pyramid  
 
Sustainable Construction  
10.7 The Government launched a ‘Hou sing Standards Review’ consultation in August 
2013 which sought views on ways to reduce the degree of variation in housing 
design guidance, codes and standards at the local level. Many of these design 
aspects are expected to be covered by future updates to  Building Regulations. 
Depending on the detail of these changes the Council will either completely rely on 
Building Regulations to deliver sustainable design or (where compatible with the 
Government’s approach) consider the need for some aspects to be defi ned by 
local policies in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies. Any 
local policies which are developed are likely to relate to aspects of design which 
are not covered by the Building Regulations.  Allowable

Page 169 10.8 The Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Lo cal Plan132 proposes that specific 
BREEAM targets will apply to proposals for waste management facilities.  
Renewable and Low Carbon Energy  
10.9 Policy CS22 has been informed by evidence base studies prepared for the 
Liverpool City Region133 and for Knowsley134. These  studies assess opportunities 
for new renewable and local carbon infrastructure, and identify the potential for 
Energy Networks, focused on existing and proposed high users of energy and/ or 
heat within Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks.  
10.10  In certain circumstances, Energy from Waste (EfW) plants can provide waste heat 
and/or electricity to the wholesale or retail markets and form a part of a 
decentra lised energy network. Policy CS 22 do es not highlight EfW as a potential 
solution for decentralised networks within the ‘Priority Zone ’ at Knowsley Industrial 
and Business Parks. This is in line with the evidence base and because the 
Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan (see Policy CS26: Waste 
Management ) has highlighted a surplus provision of consented EfW facilities 
within the Liverpool City Region against evidenced needs. Proposals for EfW 
facilities will be assessed against the criteria based policies in the M erseyside and 
Halton Waste Local Plan.  
10.11  The approach in Policy CS 22 will facilitate delivery of low carbon infrastructure and 
of wider regeneration in Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks (see Policy 
CS11 : Principal Regeneration Area – Knowsley  Industrial and Business Parks  for 
further details). Additional ‘Priority Zones ’ may be identified by a subsequent 
planning document as appropriate.  
Community Energy Fund  
10.12  The Council's ‘Community Energy Fund ’ may be used to deliver a range of ca rbon 
reduction projects. Developers who are unable to meet the proposed targets for 
‘zero carbon ’ development through on site measures in line with the Building 
Regulations will have the option to make contributions to the fund as one of a 
range of options  under the Government's proposed ‘Allowable Solutions ’ 
mechanism. The scale of contributions to the Fund will have regard to the

10.13  It is important that the borough  positively encourages and accommodates 
renewable energy generation. However, some renewable energy installations may 
conflict with planning policie s such as those aiming to protect the openness and 
use of the land in the Green Belt and the character and setting of urban 
neighbourhoods. Policy CS 23 will balance these considerations and help 
Knowsley to contribute to national targets for renewable ener gy generation.  
Policy CS23  
Renewable and Low Carbon Infrastructure  
1) The Council will support proposals that will produce and distribute 
decentralised, low carbon and renewable energy, provided that they do not 
cause significant harm (in terms of their num ber, scale, siting or cumulative 
impacts) to:  
a) Natural resources, biodiversity, geodiversity, water and air quality and, 
landscape character;  
b) Aviation and transport safety;  
c) Historical and cultural assets;  
d) Public amenity and living conditions; or  
e) Openness an d amenity of the Green Belt, except in very special 
circumstances.  
2) Proposals must be accompanied by information that shows how the local 
environment will be protected, and how the site will be restored when energy 
production ends. Proposals resulting in an  unacceptable impact must be 
mitigated by appropriate measures agreed by the Council.

Delivery of Renewable and Low Carbon Infrastructure  
10.14  As stated in Policy CS22 : Sustain able and Low Carbon Development , Knowsley 
Industrial and Business Parks are proposed to form a ‘Priority Zone ’ for renewable 
and low carbon infrastructure, including decentralised energy networks. 
Governm ent policy states that where areas of potential are identified, this should 
not stifle proposals coming forward outside these areas taking into account 
environmental, social and economic co nstraints. Therefore, Policy CS 23 identifies 
criteria which will be  applied to proposals for renewable and low carbon 
infrastructure throughout the borough , irrespective of whether they fall within the 
‘Priority Zone ’. 
10.15  Policy CS 23 will apply to all types of renewable and low carbon technology , with 
the exception of wind t urbines. Policies relating to the development of wind 
turbines will be included within the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development 
Policies document. Before adoption of that document, wind turbine proposals will 
be considered against relevant national  policy including the Government’s Written 
Ministerial Statement on this issue, made on 18 June 2015135. The Written 
Ministerial Statement advises that local planning authorities should only grant 
planning permission for proposals including one or more wind turbines if: the 
proposed development site is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy 
development in a Local or Neighbourhood Plan; and, following consultation, it can 
be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by affected local communi ties 
have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has their backing .

Page 173 Policy CS24: Managing Flood Risk  
10.16  Climate change has the potential to increase flood risk by raising sea levels and 
leading to a greater occurrence of extreme rainfall events. Th e Local Plan is 
required to take account of these risks and set out policies for managing surface 
water and promoting the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS).  
Policy CS24  
Managing Flood Risk  
1) New development that may cause an unacceptable risk of fl ooding on the site 
or elsewhere will not be permitted.  
2) New development should preferably be located in areas of low probability of 
flooding. New development in areas of medium or high flood risk will only be 
permitted if evidence has been submitted demonst rating that the development 
could not be practicably located in an area of lower flood risk and if applicable 
the ‘exception test ’ has been complied with, in accordance with national 
guidance.  
3) All development which is within or otherwise affects an area of  flood risk or is 
larger than one hectare  in size shall be accompanied by a site -specific Flood 
Risk Assessment (FRA).  
4) New development shall include flood mitigation measures, where necessary, to 
manage flood risk associated with or caused by the developm ent. These 
measures shall be derived from the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), 
relevant FRA(s) or a local strategy for flood risk management, and:  
a) Be designed to contribute to the biodiversity of the borough  unless it can be 
demonstrated that this w ould not be technically feasible;  
b) Incorporate a Sustainable Drainage System;  
c) Be fully described in the planning application; and  
d) Be funded by the developer, including long term maintenance.  
5) The drainage of new development shall be designed to reduce surfac e water 
run-off rates to those associated with a green -field site by treating it at its 
source. The chosen method of implementation should take account of site size, 
ground contamination or conditions, and potential damage to adjacent 
buildings or sites.  
6) Further guidance on these issues will be provided in a proposed 
Supplementary Planning Document.

Addressing Flood Ris k 
10.17  National legislation, including the Flood and Water Management Act (2010) seeks 
to address the risk of flooding and water scarcity, both of which are expected to 
increase as a result of climate change. The Act will help local authorities to tackle 
flood risk in partnership with the Environment Agency and other stakeholders. This 
will build on earlier legislation, including the Flood Risk Regulations 2009 under 
which Councils must develop Preliminary Flood Risk Assessments (PFRAs). The 
Council's PFRA repor t was approved by the Environment Agency in October 2011.  
10.18  According to the guidelines set by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, Knowsley 
does not have a nationally significant flood risk. The Council is developing a local 
flood risk strategy that will asses s the risks of flooding so that investment in risk 
management can be prioritised and communities can be helped to recover more 
quickly and effectively after incidents. The Flood and Water Management Act also 
requires the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems  (SuDS ) by removing the 
automatic right to connect new development to sewers and providing for Local 
Authorities to adopt SuDS.  
Sustainability and Adaptation to Climate Change  
10.19  European policies, the NPPF and other Government guidance136 encourage new 
develop ment to be sustainable, taking into account the impacts of climate change. 
National planning guidance also advises local authorities to take likely changes to 
the climate into account when selecting land for development, using a partnership 
approach which appraises the level of risk, and manages and reduces any risks 
which are identified.

 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 10 Caring for Knowsley  
Page 175 10.20  To appraise flood risks, national policy requires Councils to undertake Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessments (SFRAs), which provide information at the local (but not 
site spec ific) level regarding flooding issues which affect the area. Knowsley and 
Sefton Councils undertook a joint SFRA137 in 2009 which identified areas of flood 
risk from all sources across the two  borough s. The study, and subsequently 
published Environment Agenc y Flood Maps, suggest that relatively small areas of 
Knowsley are at risk of fluvial flooding. The most significant risks are alongside 
Ditton Brook and the River Alt. These and the other main locations at risk are 
listed in  Table 10.1. 
Table 10.1: Broad Areas Identified at Risk of Fluvial Flooding  
The River Alt  
Croxteth Brook  
Watercourse at Bowring Park  
Knowsley Brook  
Kirkby Brook  
Logwood Mill Brook  
 
10.21  The majority of the land at greatest risk of flooding (Flood Zone 3) is within the 
Green Belt and is therefore unlikely to be developed unless identified as a 
Sustainable Urban Extension in Policies SUE1 to SUE2c . Although some of these 
locations for Green Belt release are partially within or adjacent to areas of flood 
risk, the indicative development capacities required to develop these sites in 
accordance with Policies SUE 1 to SUE2c  assume no development takes place 
within Flood Zones 2 an d 3. Further detail regarding this issue is pr ovided in 
Policies SUE1 to SUE 2c and their supporting text.  
10.22  The Knowsley and Sefton SFRA also highlights the risks posed by surface water 
in Knowsley. All development can contribute to pro blems though surface water 
‘run-off’ into the sewer system.  
10.23  The Knowsley and Sefton SFRA is a hybrid of a ‘Level 1 ’ assessment, providing a 
broad assessment of flood risk across the study area, and a ‘Level 2 ’ assessment 
providing further detail in relatio n to specific development locations which were 
identified at the time. A further ‘Level 2 ’ SFRA138 has been undertaken to assess 
sites which are proposed to be brought forward for new development up to 2028. It 
examined sites in greater detail, and recommend ed whether the ‘exception test ’ 
should be applied to justify sites being allocated for development. For sites which 
are only partly covered by higher flood risk, the study identified the development

whether the site is in Flood Zone 3a or Flood Zone 3b (Functional Floodplain).  
Sustainable Drainage Systems  
10.24  Sustainable Drainage Systems ( ‘SuDS ’) are now the expected way to manage 
surface water and can be used on any site. These  features include green roofs, 
soft landscaping, permeable surfaces and/ or water storage ponds. Policy CS 24 
will complement Part H of the Building Regulations 2010 and national legislation 
by requiring the use of SuDS on all sites. Further guidance on the  Council's 
requirements concerning the use of SuDS will be set out in the ‘Design Quality in 
New Development ’ or other SPD as appropriate.

Page 177 Policy CS 25: Management of Mineral Resources  
10.25  There has been a long history of minerals extraction in Knowsley. Alth ough many 
of these operations have ceased, some resources remain, including clay used in 
brick manufacture and coal. As a Minerals Planning Authority (MPA), the Council 
is required by national policy to assess the potential for future extraction of 
mineral s within its area, and to plan for the management of minerals resources.  
Policy CS25  
Management of Mineral Resources  
Ensuring a Supply of Minerals  
1) The Council will facilitate a steady and adequate supply of minerals to ensure 
that the borough  contributes  to meeting sub -regional needs139. 
2) Minerals Safeguarding Areas ( ‘MSAs ’) for mineral resources of national and 
local importance will be identified in the Local Plan: Site Allocations and 
Development Policies and shown on the Policies Map. The purpose of such 
MSAs will be to ensure that such resources are not needlessly sterilised by 
non-mineral development whilst not creating a presumption that resources 
defined will be worked.  
Minimising the Need for Mineral Extraction  
3) In considering planning applications f or new development140, the Council will 
seek to ensure that:  
a) A proportion of construction aggregates are from recycled or secondary 
sources;  
b) Resource efficient design and construction methods are used;  
c) Construction and demolition wastes are managed sustainab ly in 
accordance with the waste hierarchy; and  
d) Minerals are transported in a sustainable way and treated on -site where 
possible.  
                                            
139 For mineral apportionment purposes, Knowsley forms part of a sub -region with Greater 
Manchester, Halton, Warrington and the other Merseyside authorities .

engineering schemes such as new roads .  
 
Page 178 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Proposals for Minerals Extraction  
4) Proposals for extraction of minerals and recycling of aggregates will be 
required to comply  with criteria to be set out within the Local Plan: Site 
Allocations and Development Policies, which will ensure that the impacts of 
such developments are controlled and managed effectively. In considering 
such proposals the Council will give positive weig ht to any evidenced need for 
the mineral at a national or regional level.

Efficient Use of Natural Resources  
10.26  National planning policy recognises the important role minerals play in the context 
of economic prosperity and quality of life. A central component of this is the 
creation of sustainable communities which use natural resources prudently, 
through efficient use of non -renewable resources and the use or re -use of existing 
resources.  
10.27  A Local Aggregates Assessment (2013) has been prepared for the Greater 
Manchester, Merseyside, Halton and Warrington area. The LAA indicates that land 
banks for crushed rock (15.9 yrs) and sand and gravel (12.4 yrs) in the sub -region 
are sufficient to satisfy policy requirements (10 yrs and  seven yrs respectively). 
The main findings for Knowsley are that:  
 Knowsley has no active or dormant aggregate extraction sites and no resources of 
primary aggregate material;  
 Knowsley is a net i mporter of aggregate material (as is the sub -region as a whole); 
and 
 Knowsley’s main means of contributing to the supply of aggregate is by promoting 
resource efficiency and the use of secondary and recycled materials.  
The Local Aggregates Assessment will be updated periodically and any changes 
to the above will be reported in the Council’s Monitoring Reports.

Chapter 10 Caring for Knowsley  
Page 179 Mineral Safeguarding  
10.28  The NPPF advises that Councils should identify potentially viable mineral deposits 
and suitable policy mechanisms to support min erals planning. In order to protect 
important mineral deposits, the Council may define Mineral Safeguarding Areas 
(MSAs). The purpose of an MSA is not to automatically prevent other forms of 
development, but to ensure that mineral resources are adequately and effectively 
considered in planning decisions which could affect their potential future 
extraction.  
10.29  Guidance on how to identify MSAs has been produced by the British Geological 
Survey141. In order to identify potential MSAs in Knowsley, the Council will u se 
evidence including the Merseyside Mineral Resource Study142, British Geological 
Survey (BGS) mapping and the Coal Authority's surface coal resource maps.  
10.30  The Merseyside Minerals Study (2008) identified and assessed the current 
minerals resources across Me rseyside. The study recommended that an area 
including Cronton Clay Pit, where clay extraction is currently taking place, and 
adjacent land should be safeguarded by the identification of a MSA. Planning 
consent was granted for this operation in 1991. Cront on Clay Pit has also been 
highlighted by the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan as a proposed 
location for continued landfill with inert waste, which is dependant on the prior 
extraction of the clay resource.  
10.31  There are also un -worked coal resourc es in parts of Knowsley, although there is 
little evidence at present about the viability of future extraction of these.  
Mineral Extraction  
10.32  Proposals for minerals extraction can have a significant effect on the environment 
of the surrounding area and the a menity levels of nearby residents. Criteria to 
determine planning applications for such uses (which are currently set in Policy 
MW2 of the UDP) will be reviewed and potentially revised in the proposed Local 
Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies.

Policy CS 26: Waste Management  
10.33  European legislation and Government targets, increasing levels of waste 
generation, and public pressure for improved levels of environmental protection all 
drive the need for changes in the approach to managing waste. In par ticular, the 
local authorities in the Liverpool City Region have identified a need to reduce their 
reliance on land -filling of waste, by providing alternative facilities for recycling, 
reprocessing, treatment and disposal.  
Policy CS26  
Waste Management  
1) The Council will promote sustainable forms of waste management in 
accordance with the waste hierarchy. As set out in the Merseyside and Halton 
Joint Waste Local Plan, it will work to:  
a) Identify and safeguard (where appropriate) waste management sites in 
approp riate locations;  
b) Ensure that the borough  contributes to meeting the identified sub -regional 
waste management needs;  
c) Encourage good design in new development in order to minimise waste, 
promote the use of reclaimed and recycled materials and to facilitate t he 
collection and recycling of waste;  
d) Encourage the sustainable transport of waste and promote use of site 
waste management plans; and  
e) Ensure that waste management facilities are developed whilst minimising 
any negative impacts on the environment and commu nities of the borough .

Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan  
10.34  Government policy and EU legislation advises that, g iven the nature of the waste 
management industry, Councils (particularly those within City regions or  
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 10 Caring for Knowsley  
Page 181 metropolitan areas) should work jointly where possible to prepare joint waste 
related planning documents, including evidence gathering and policy developm ent. 
Agreement was reached in 2005 between Knowsley Council, the other Merseyside 
Councils and Halton Council to prepare a joint Waste Local Plan (formerly known 
as the ‘Waste DPD ’) for the Liverpool City Region area. The Merseyside and 
Halton Joint Waste Local Plan has been prepared by Merseyside Environmental 
Advisory Service (MEAS), and promotes sustainable waste management for all 
waste streams across the six constituent districts. Decisions regarding planning for 
new waste management facilities should comply with policies in the Waste Local 
Plan and Policy CS26.  
The Waste Hierarchy  
10.35  The Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan allocates an appropriate mix of 
sites across the sub -region, to maximise the potential to drive waste management 
up the hiera rchy. It also facilitates the development of a sustainable and modern 
waste management network, which supports mitigates and adapts to climate 
change, in line with  Figure 10.2.

Sub-Regional Waste Management  
10.36  A central aim of the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan is to support 
net self -sufficiency of waste management within the sub -region. Based on a robust 
needs assessment and new facility fore casts, the Waste Local Plan identifies:  
 19 proposed site allocations for built waste management facilities, four of which 
are in Knowsley. These include one sub -regional site (of more than 8 hectares) at 
the northern end of Knowsley Industrial Park and thr ee smaller sites; and  
 Proposed  sites for landfill of which one (to be used for inert waste only) is in 
Knowsley, at Cronton Clay Pit.  
10.37  The location of these site allocations and the waste management uses they have 
been identified as suitable to accommodate,  are outlined in the Waste Local Plan 
and its supporting documents. Merseyside and Halton has more consented 
capacity for Energy for Waste (EfW) facilities than the identified need of the sub -
region. Whilst a proportion of this capacity has been allocated to other sub -regions 
via commercial contract, much of it can be used to treat waste arising within the 
Merseyside sub -region. Therefore the Joint Waste Local Plan does not allocate 
sites for EfW uses, relying instead on existing consents and operational fa cilities 
and a criteria -based policy to meet the needs of the sub -region.

Chapter 11 Delivering Infrastructure  
Policy CS 27: Planning for and Paying for New Infrastructure  
11.5 In Knowsley there is a wide network of existing infrastructure, which it is important 
to safeguard, maintain and, where appropriate, improve. This will ensure that 
residents, businesses and visitors are served by sufficient infrastructure to meet 
their needs. New infrastructure will also be required to support new developmen t, 
particularly within parts of the borough  which will undergo major change during the 
plan period. This can include the provision of new infrastructure, and/ or investment 
in existing infrastructure to cope with additional demand.  
11.6 Infrastructure may also need to be replaced or repaired during its operational 
lifetime, and the need to provide new or replacement infrastructure may also result 
in innovation in infrastructure provision; this is particularly relevant for energy 
production and digital infrastruc ture provision. It will be necessary for local delivery 
partners to work closely together in ensuring that a sufficient level of infrastructure 
provision is available.  
11.7 Since almost all development has some impact on the need for infrastructure, 
services an d amenities, or benefits from it, such development should contribute 
towards the cost of its provision. Hence, it is appropriate for the Council to set out 
the mechanisms by which developer contributions will be sought to help meet the 
costs of new infrast ructure.  
Policy CS27  
Planning and Paying for New Infrastructure  
Infrastructure Provision Principles  
1) Knowsley's communities will be supported by an appropriate range of 
infrastructure, including any additional infrastructure which is required as a 
result  of new development. New development will be required to support, as 
appropriate:  
a) Safeguarding of existing infrastructure;  
b) Maintenance and improvement of existing infrastructure;  
c) Replacement of inadequate infrastructure; and  
d) Provision of new infrastructure . 
2) Proposals for new development will be required to demonstrate that any 
negative impacts that the development may have on the improvement, 
replacement or provision of new infrastructure will be avoided and/ or 
appropriately mitigated as part of the planning process.  
3) Proposals for new development must have regard to the Knowsley 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan, insofar as this is appropriate to the scale and 
nature of the development.   
 
Page 186 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Developer Contributions  
4) New development will be expected (where necessary given the scale and 
nature of the proposal) to:  
a) Demonstrate compliance with Local Plan policies which specifically require 
developer contributions;  
b) Provide additional on -site or directly ancillary infrastruc ture as required to 
make the development acceptable in planning terms. This may include in -
kind provision of infrastructure and/ or financial contributions; and  
c) Provide financial contributions towards the provision of strategic 
infrastructure to support local communities together with borough -wide and 
other strategic development requirements. Such contributions may be 
secured throu gh set charges or infrastructure tariffs to be introduced by the 
Council in other Local Plan documents and/ or a Community Infrastructure 
Levy Charging Schedule, as appropriate.  
Economic Viability  
5) Plan-level evidence regarding the economic viability of n ew development in 
Knowsley will be used to support the setting of any infrastructure charging or 
tariffs introduced by the Council.  
6) Where legal agreements are to be used to secure developer contributions in 
accordance with clause 4 ) of this policy, these could be subject to site specific 
negotiations regarding the impacts of the contributions on the economic 
viability of new development, where the policy permits this as an option. Where 
a developer believes that meeting policy requirements in relation to d eveloper 
contributions would place development at risk, the developer will be required to 
submit development -specific economic viability evidence to support this 
position. Such evidence must clearly account for site -specific circumstances 
and costs and mus t be undertaken objectively and transparently, in order that it 
can be scrutinised by the Council.  
7) Where the Council is satisfied that viability evidence demonstrates that a 
developer is unable to fully fund all of the developer contributions sought, the 
Council will make a balanced assessment of whether planning permission 
should be granted notwithstanding that not all the contributions sought can be 
fully provided. In such cases contributions sought will be prioritised in the 
following order having regard  to the advice in Table 11.2: 
a) Firstly, contributions which are essential for public safety or to achieve a 
minimum acceptable level of design quality;  
b) Secondly, developer contributions which are necessary to addres s a local 
infrastructure requirement or deficiency that would be caused or 
exacerbated by the development;  
c) Thirdly, any remaining developer contributions except those in clause d) 
below;   
 
Page 187 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  January 2016  
Chapter 11 Delivering Infrastructure  
d) Finally, those contributions which have the status of being ‘encourag ed’ by 
the Council’s planning policies.  
8) Further guidance about the Council’s approach will be provided in the Local 
Plan: Site Allocations and Development Policies document and a 
Supplementary Planning Document.

Infrastructure Delivery Plan  
11.8 Core Strategies must consider the importance of infrastruc ture planning in relation 
to the delivery of the overall spatial strategy. National policy indicates that 
infrastructure planning should allow for a reflexive relationship between plan 
preparation and the preparation of the investment plans and strategies of 
infrastructure providers, including across the public and private sector. 
Infrastructure planning should also include consideration of funding and phasing of 
infrastructure delivery, together with contingency planning where appropriate. The 
Council has engaged with  this process through Policy CS 27 and through the 
preparation of the Knowsley Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP).  
11.9 The Core Strategy plan period is to 2028, and it is appropriate to account for a 
similar time period within the IDP. While it is p ossible to identify clear short to 
medium term infrastructure priorities, long term infrastructure planning is likely to 
be lacking in detail, due to uncertainty around future project planning and funding. 
Therefore, the Knowsley IDP will be subject to reg ular review and will be updated 
with new projects and priorities, as appropriate, throughout the plan period. Such 
updates will be carried out in consultation with stakeholders and proposed revision  
 
Page 188 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
will be made subject to public consultation . The latest v ersion of the Knowsley IDP 
is available on the Council's website144. 
11.10  The Knowsley IDP has also been prepared with regard to the context of sub -
regional infrastructure planning, in consultation with key partners. This recognises 
that some items of strategic i nfrastructure are significant to the development of 
more than one district, including where infrastructure crosses local authority 
boundaries or where infrastructure enables or supports development across a 
wide area.  
11.11  Where appropriate to the scale and nat ure of development, the Council will expect 
proposals for new development to have regard to the content of the IDP. This will 
include developments which require substantial infrastructure investment to come 
forward, or those which substantially affect exis ting or planned infrastructure 
featured in the IDP.  
Developer Contributions  
11.12  To support new development, developers must provide in -kind or financial 
contributions towards local and strategic infrastructure. The Local Plan Core 
Strategy contains a number of  policies which specifically require developer 
contributions.  These are:  
 Policy CS7: Transport Networks  
 Policy CS15: Delivering Affordable Housing  
 Policy CS17: Housing Sizes and Design Standards  
 Policy CS19: Design Quality and Accessibility in New Developm ent  
 Policy CS21: Greenspaces and Trees  
 Policy CS22: Sustainable and Low Carbon Development  
 Policy CS27: Planning and Paying for New Infrastructure  
11.13  Each of these policies sets out the requirements which must be met to secure 
appropriate infrastructure pro vision over the plan period. Sufficient flexi bility is 
provided by Policy CS 27 so that any additional infrastructure requirements, not 
covered by the above policies, but integral to ensuring that development remains 
acceptable in planning terms relative to  site specific circumstances, can be 
delivered through developer contributions. The Council expects that these 
requirements will be negotiated between the Council and the developer through 
the planning application process, having regard to the relevant leg al and 
regulatory tests (see paragraphs 11.20  to 11.22 ).  
11.14  Policy CS27 also ensures that during the plan period, recognition is given to the 
cumulative impact of devel opment on a range of infrastructure. This includes 
strategic infrastructure which serves more than one development. The option is 
maintained for the Council to use infrastructure tariffs to achieve developer 
                                            
144 Available online via http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/localplan

Chapter 11 Delivering Infrastructure  
contributions towards this, to be determined thr ough subsequent Local Plan or 
other documents.  
11.15  Legislation and national policy enables developer contributions to be collected 
through a variety of methods, including:  
 Formal legal agreements between the developer and the Council (such as Section 
106 Agree ments or Unilateral Undertakings, under the Town and Country Planning 
Act 1990) and;  
 Infrastructure tariffs (such as the Community Infrastructure Levy, also known as 
‘CIL’, introduced through the Planning Act 2008).  
11.16  Legal agreements can be used only for de velopment -specific infrastructure 
requirements, as linked to the appropriate legal tests. Legal agreements also have 
the option for case -by-case negotiation, between the Council and the developer. 
Conversely, the CIL system creates the option for a standar d infrastructure tariff 
system, centred upon an adopted Charging Schedule.  
Community Infrastructure Levy  
11.17  The introduction of a CIL Charging Schedule must be based on a sound and up -
to-date adopted Local Plan and on robust economic viability evidence, which  
dictates the level at which a charge could be set without prejudicing the financial 
viability of development. The introduction of a CIL charge must also be clearly 
linked to the IDP, which needs to demonstrate an ‘infrastructure funding gap ’ 
towards which  a CIL charge could contribute. In accordance with this, the Council 
has collated evidence145 which indicates that there may be scope in terms of 
economic viability to feasibly introduce a CIL Charging Schedule in Knowsley. 
However, this evidence indicates t hat the application of the CIL in Knowsley would 
need to be carefully and sensitively set in order that it would not harm the 
deliverability of some categories of development in selected locations. The 
collation of evidence has accounted for the range of o ther policy requirements and 
developer contributions sought within the Local Plan Core Strategy, which could 
apply outside of the scope of the CIL (i.e. delivered through legal agreements), 
ensuring a comprehensive view of the impact of all developer contr ibutions 
attributable to Local Plan policies.  
11.18  The approach of Policy CS 27 reflects this commitment, whilst recognising the 
need for contingency arrangements while the Council develops its detailed 
approach to the mechanisms of collecting developer contribu tions, including 
whether to pursue the adoption of a CIL Charging Schedule. The policy wording 
recognises that legal agreements are likely to still have a role in securing provision 
of development -specific infrastructure. If a CIL is adopted in Knowsley, i t would be 
a standard, non -negotiable schedule of tariffs, and would work alongside the other 
                                            
145 Knowsley Economic Viability Assessment (Keppie Massie, 2012)   
 
Page 190 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
policy requirements within the Core Strategy, as set out above. It would also be 
reviewed on a regular basis.  
Legal Agreements & Economic Viability  
11.19  Evidence withi n the Knowsley Economic Viability Assessment indicates that the 
development viability in Knowsley can be challenging across different 
development types and different locations. The Council has sought to maintain 
flexibility within the plan, and recognises that seeking the full range of developer 
contributions may render development unviable in some circumstances. The 
Council therefore recognises that where developer obligations are sought through 
legal agreements, there is often scope for negotiation betwee n the Council and the 
developer.  
11.20  In such cases, the Council considers that the onus should be on developers to 
prove that meeting set policy requirements would place development at risk, and 
that exceptional circumstances exist for the developer contributi on requirements to 
be varied. The developer will therefore be required to submit development -specific 
viability evidence to support their position, accounting for site -specific 
circumstances and costs, which the Council will then scrutinise. If the Council  is 
satisfied that this evidence clearly demonstrates that not all the contributions 
sought by the Council can be fully met, it will undertake a balanced assessment of 
whether planning permission should still be granted. This process will take account 
of the presumption in favour of sustainable development set by national policy. 
Where the Council is minded to grant permission in these circumstances any 
reduction in the specific categories of developer contribution sought will take

Regional Economic Strategy (RES)  
Prepared by the former Regional Development Agencies, these set out each 
region’s economic plans, with frameworks for regional, sub -regional and local 
action, and relied on public and private partners for delivery.  
Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS)  
The Regional Spatial Strategy152 was the regional planning strategy for the North 
West, from its publication in 2008 until May 20 13, when it was formally revoked by 
the Government. The RSS informed the preparation of Local Development 
Documents, Local Transport Plans and regional and sub -regional strategies and 
programmes.  
Regional Strategy (RS)  
The document which was due to replace  the Regional Spatial Strategy and the 
Regional Economic Strategy, forming the overarching development strategy for 
the region. The emerging Regional Strategy for the Northwest was called RS2010, 
however, work on this document was cancelled in mid -2010. Th e resulting 
evidence and framework has been made available, including ‘Future Northwest ’, a 
document containing agreed shared priorities for the region.  
Registered Provider (of Social Housing)  
Independent, not -for-profit private sector organisations provid ing social housing.

Page A-15 in the environment – from the wind, the fall of water, the movement of the oceans, 
the sun and from bioma ss and deep geothermal heat. Low carbon technologies 
are those that can help reduce emissions (compared to conventional use of fossil 
fuels).  
Safeguarded Land  
Comprises areas and sites which may be required to serve development needs in 
the longer term, i. e. beyond the end of the plan period (post 2028). Safeguarded 
land should be genuinely capable of development when needed and be where 
future development would be an efficient use of land, well integrated with existing 
development.  
Scheduled Monument  
A nat ionally important historic building or structure or archaeological site, given 
protection against detrimental and unauthorised change. When designated, 
Scheduled Monuments are added to the schedule (which has been kept since 
1882) of monuments whose preser vation is given priority over other land uses. 
Scheduled Monuments are also sometimes referred to as ‘Scheduled Ancient 
Monuments ’. 
Shared Ownership  
An arrangement where the ownership of a property is shared, usually between a 
Registered Social Landlord (R SL) and a private purchaser.

stakeholders in the production of all documents within the Local Plan, and when 
determining planning applications.   
 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Page A-16 Strategic Environmental Assessmen t (SEA)  
European Directive 2001/42/EC (the SEA Directive) requires a formal 
environmental assessment of certain plans and programmes which are likely to 
have significant effects on the environment, known as Strategic Environmental 
Assessment. To meet the r equirements of the directive, a body must prepare an 
environmental report in which the likely significant effects on the environment of 
implementing the plan or programme, and reasonable alternatives taking into 
account the objectives and geographical scop e of the plan, are identified, 
described and evaluated. For the Knowsley Local Plan, this is incorporated in the 
Sustainability Appraisal.  
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA)  
A document which is normally produced by a local planning authority in 
consult ation with the Environment Agency, and which forms the basis for 
preparing appropriate policies for flood risk management at the local level.  
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)  
A systematic assessment of the availability of land which i s developable and 
deliverable for new housing within an area. The assessment includes a ‘Call for 
Sites’ where the public can promote sites as being suitable for housing 
development and an appraisal of deliverability by a panel of developers and 
Registered  Social Landlords active in the local market.  
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
A study across an identified largely ‘self contained’ housing market to assess how 
the market operates and is likely to operate in the future. A SHMA assesses past, 
current and future trends in housing type and tenure, household size, and housing 
need, and of the housing needs of specific groups with particular requirements. It 
is important to engage sub -regional partners and other key stakeholders involved 
in the local  housing market when preparing a SHMA.  
Strategic Objective (SO)  
Within the Local Plan: Core Strategy, there are a range of Strategic Objectives, 
which set the overall aims and goals of the plan. The Local Plan aims to deliver 
these objectives.  
Substantial Residential Area (SRA)  
A residential area that should, in order to provide a satisfactory r esidential 
environment, be self -sufficient in public open space. The overall proportion of open 
space within these areas is measured as a surplus or deficit relative  to population 
in accordance with adopted standards. Maps defining the existing boundaries of 
the SRAs will be set out in the Developer Contributions SPD.   
 Knowsley Local Plan:  Core Strategy  Januar y 2016  
Appendix A  Glossary  
Page A-17 Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  
A planning policy document which provides supplementary informa tion in respect 
of the policies contained in the Local Plan, and which focus on particular issues or 
places. They are subject to consultation, but are not subject to an independent 
examination.  
Sustainability Appraisal (SA)  
An assessment of the economic, e nvironmental and social effects of a plan from 
the outset of the preparation process to allow decisions to be made that accord 
with sustainable development. For the  Knowsley  Local Plan,  this covers  the 
requirements  of Strategic Environmental Assessment.  
Sustainable Communities  
Places where people want to live and work, now and in the future. They meet the 
needs of existing and future residents, are sensitive to their environment, and 
contribute to a high quality of life. They are safe and inclusive, well pl anned, built 
and run, and offer equality of opportunity and good services for all.  
Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS)  
Local Strategic Partnerships were required to produce a Sustainable Community 
Strategy for their area, to create a long -term vision to t ackle local needs. 
Knowsley's Local Plan Core Strategy has been drafted to assist in delivery of the 
vision set out in the Knowsley Sustai nable Community Strategy 2008 –2023, 
known as ‘the Borough of Choice ’. 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)  
These system s provide an alternative to the traditional methods of dealing with 
water drainage, aiming to mimic the natural movement of water from a 
development, slowing run -off, reducing flood risk, improving water quality and 
potentially providing attractive feature s. 
Sustainable Urban Extensions  (SUEs)  
Areas which are being removed from the Green Belt to accommodate Knowsley’s 
needs for new housing and employment development up to 2028 and beyond. 
Sustainable Urban Extensions are areas which are capable of developme nt when 
needed and to provide for an efficient use of infrastructure and land which is well 
integrated with existing development.  
Transport Assessment (TA)  
A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport issues relating to 
a proposed develop ment. It identifies what measures will be required to improve  
 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Page A-18 accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the 
car such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures will need to 
be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development.  
Travel Plan  
A long -term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to deliver 
sustainable transport objectives through action which is articulated in a document 
that is regularly reviewed.  
Unitary Development Plan (UDP)  
A statutory planning policy document which unitary authorities had to prepare 
under the Planning Act 1990. The Knowsley Replacement Unitary Development 
Plan153 was adopted in 2006, and the majority of its policies were saved in 2009. 
The UDP set out a wide range of strategic and detailed policies, and included a 
Proposals Map identifying site allocations and designations for various land uses. 
The policies within the Replacement Unitary Development Plan will be replaced by 
polici es within Local Plan documents.  
Use Classes Order  
The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and subsequent 
amendments, group a number of land uses into categories or ‘Use Classes’. 
Changes of use within the same Use Class or between certain di fferent Use 
Classes as set out in the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) are 
normally deemed to have consent and do not in most cases require specific 
planning permission.  
Vitality and Viability (Town Centres)  
Terms used to assess the health of a t own centre or other centre as measured by 
a number of indicators, such as the overall floorspace for retail and leisure, 
diversity of uses, range of goods that are sold, retailer representation, expenditure 
retention, rental values, level of vacancies, ped estrian ‘footfall ’ figures, etc.  
Waste Hierarchy  
A framework that has become a cornerstone of sustainable waste management, 
setting out the order in which options for waste management should be considered 
based on environmental impact.  
Zero Carbon  
Meaning no net increase in carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the energy 
used in occupying building, including space heating, hot water, cooking, lights and

Appendix B Detailed Definitions  
B Detailed Definitions  
Housing Definitions  
Definitions of housing tenures are adapted from Annex 2 of the NPPF154 and from 
the Homes and Communities Agency website155. 
Affordable Housing  
Social rented, affordable rented and i ntermediate housing, provided to eligible 
households whose needs are not met by the market. Eligibility is determined with 
regard to local incomes and local house prices. Affordable housing should include 
provisions to remain at an affordable price for fut ure eligible households or for the 
subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.  
Social rented housing is owned by local authorities and private registered 
providers (as defined in section 80 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008) , for 
which guideline target rents are determined through the national rent regime. It 
may also be owned by other persons and provided under equivalent rental 
arrangements to the above, as agreed with the local authority or with the Homes 
and Communities A gency.  
Affordable rented housing is let by local authorities or private registered providers 
of social housing to households who are eligible for social rented housing. 
Affordable Rent is subject to rent controls that require a rent of no more than 80% 
of the local market rent (including service charges, where applicable).  
Intermediate housing is homes for sale and rent provided at a cost above social 
rent, but below market levels subject to the criteria in the Affordable Housing 
definition above. These can  include shared equity (shared ownership and equity 
loans), other low cost homes for sale and intermediate rent, but not affordable 
rented housing.  
Homes that do not meet the above definition of affordable housing, such as ‘low 
cost market ’ housing, may no t be considered as affordable housing for planning 
purposes.  
Windfall housing  
Sites which have not been specifically identified as available in the Local Plan 
process (i.e. In Monitoring Reports or evidence base documents such as the 
Strategic Housing Land  Availability Assessment).

 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Page B-2 Specialist and Supported Accommodation  
Accommodation designed or designated specifically to meet the needs of older 
and/or vulnerable people, as follows:  
Older people are defined as people over retirement age, including the acti ve, 
newly -retired through to the very frail elderly, whose housing needs can 
encompass accessible, adaptable general needs housing for those looking to 
downsize from family housing and the full range of retirement and specialised 
housing for those with sup port or care needs. Accommodation  for older people 
includes all housing which is specially designed or designated for older people; for 
example, sheltered housing, extra care housing, registered care homes, retirement 
housing or clusters of bungalows solel y let to older people.  
Vulnerable people are defined as homeless families with support needs; offenders 
and people at risk of offending; people with alcohol problems; people with drug 
problem; people with HIV or AIDS; people with learning disabilities; peo ple with 
physical or sensory disabilities; people with mental health problems; refugees; 
rough sleepers; single homeless people with support needs; teenage parents; 
people at risk of domestic violence; young people at risk; and young people 
leaving care. T his vulnerability covers a wide range and levels of need and not all 
vulnerable people need supported housing - for many, remaining in their own or 
their family home with support may be the best solution. Some people may require 
on-going support and care i n permanent supported housing accommodation, 
whereas for others the need for support may be for a limited period requiring 
tailored services that may be only for a few months or perhaps up to two years in 
order to support residents into more independent li ving, a settled lifestyle, 
education, training and employment. Accommodation for vulnerable people 
includes all housing which is specially designed or designated to meet the 
particular requirements of these groups.  
Travellers Definitions  
Definitions of tra velling communities are taken from Annex 1 of the government's 
planning guidance for traveller sites156, as referred to in Policy CS18 . 
Gypsies and Travellers  
Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including suc h 
persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ 
educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily or 
permanently, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling 
showpeople or circus people trave lling together as such.

Travelling Show People  
Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding fairs, circuses or shows 
(whether or not travelling together as such). This includes such persons who on 
the grounds of their own or their family’s or d ependants’ more localised pattern of 
trading, educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily 
or permanently, but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as defined above.  
Pitch/ plot 
A pitch on a ‘gypsy and traveller ’ site and ‘plot’ mean s a pitch on a ‘travelling 
showpeople ’ site (often called a ‘yard’). This terminology differentiates between 
residential pitches for ‘gypsies and travellers ’ and mixed -use plots for ‘travelling 
showpeople ’, which may/ will need to incorporate space or to b e split to allow for 
the storage of equipment.

Edge of centre  
For retail purposes, a location that is well connected and up to 300 metres  from 
the primary shopping area. For all other main town centre uses, a location within 
300 metres of a centre boundary. For office development, this includes locations 
outside the centre but within 500 metres of a public transport interchange. In 
determin ing whether a site falls within the definition of edge of centre, account 
should be taken of local circumstances.

Appendix C Schedule of UDP Policies to be Replaced  
C Schedule of UDP Policies to be Replaced  
This appendix lists the policies of the Knowsley Replacement Unitary 
Development Plan (UDP) currently ‘saved ’ under transitional arrangements, which 
are del eted on adoption of this Local Plan Core Strategy document and those 
which will continue to be ‘saved ’ beyond that point.  
Background  
The UDP was adopted in June 2006, and its policies were automatically ‘saved ’ for 
an initial  three year period under transi tional arrangements to the revised planning 
system. In 2009, the Secretary of State issued a ‘saving direction ’ under which 78 
(i.e. all but four) of the UDP policies continued to be ‘saved ’. In 2013,  three of the 
remaining UDP policies were replaced by th e Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste 
Local Plan.  
75 UDP policies therefore remain in place as part of the adopted development 
plan prior to the adoption of the Knowsley Local Plan: Core Strategy.  
The Schedules  
Table  C.1 lists the U DP policies, their titles and (for those that will lapse on 
adoption of this Core Strategy) the Local Plan Core Strategy policies which will 
replace them. Table C.2 shows the same information, but organised by Core 
Strategy policy  number. For all UDP Policies to be deleted on adoption of the Core 
Strategy, the supporting text accompanying these policies in the UDP is also 
deleted.  
In Table  C.1, where a UDP policy has been struck through, this indicates tha t the 
policy was not ‘saved ’ beyond the initial  three year period and therefore lapsed in 
2009. These policies include UDP P olicies H1: Strategic Housing Land 
Requirements and Supply; S3: Huyton Town Centre; S8: Location of Development 
of Town Centre Uses;  and T4: Major Transport Schemes.  
Proposals Map /Policies Map  
The adopted UDP is accompanied by a Proposals Map. Under the Town and 
Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 the term 
‘Proposals Map ’ has been replaced by ‘Policies Map ’. Revisions to the adopted 
Policies Map were formally agreed when the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste 
Local Plan was adopted in July 2013. Further revisions to the Policies Map are 
being made on adoption of the Core Strategy, to reflect new site allocations  and 
revisions to the Green Belt boundary within the Sustainable Urban Extensions 
(see details in Policies SUE1 to SUE2c  and Appendix E ). 
In instances where the Policies Map links to a deleted UDP policy, th en the Core 
Strategy policy which will replace the UDP policy will apply to the related allocation 
or designation on the Policies Map once the Core Strategy is adopted.   
 Knowsley Local Plan: Core Str ategy  January 2016  
Page C-2 When the Council prepares the Local Plan: Site Allocations and Development 
Policies doc ument in the future it will publish a new Policies Map covering the 
whole borough . This is likely to include the revisions to the Map introduced by the 
Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan and this Local Plan: Core Strategy 
as well as the review an d where necessary updating of the land use designations 
and site allocations in other areas. At this stage it is considered unlikely that this 
will contain further significant changes to Green Belt boundaries beyond a tidying 
up of existing boundaries as r eferred to in Policy SUE1 .

E Sustainable Urban E xtensions and Safeguarded Land – 
Allocations  Profiles  
This appendix contains site plans showing the extent of each location identified as 
a Sustainable Urban Extension or Safeguarded Land (see Policies SUE1 , SUE2 
and SUE2a to SUE2c) 
The plans should be read in conjunction with the Council’s Policies Map as 
modified on adoption of the Local Plan: Core Strategy which shows further 
planning designations and allocations applicable to each locati on. 
Each Allocation profile identifies the location's gross size (hectares), primary 
proposed use(s) and notional development capacity. Each plan is of a different 
scale due to the differing sizes of each site.  
The profiles also identify the key planning c onstraints and opportunities applicable 
to each location. The list provided is not exhaustive, and other considerations are 
likely to apply to each location. The guidance provided should be read in 
conjunction with Local Plan policies, Supplementary Planni ng Documents and t he 
Policies Map as appropriate.
