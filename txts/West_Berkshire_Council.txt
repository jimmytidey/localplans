In strategic planning terms the Eastern Area (as set out in the Core Strategy) is small and difficult to plan for in
isolation. Combining with the East Kennet Valley area in the LPR gives more flexibility in spatial planning terms for
futuredevelopment.

North  Wessex  Downs AONB
The North Wessex Downs  Area of Outstanding  Natural  Beauty (AONB)  will have appropriate  and sustainable  
growth that conserves  and enhances  its special  landscape  qualities.  Development  will be required  to respond  
positively  to the local context, conserving  and enhancing  local distinctiveness,  sense of place  and setting of the 
AONB. The strong sense of remoteness, tranquillity  and dark night skies, particularly  on the open  downland,  
should  be preserved.  The conservation  and enhancement  of the natural  beauty of the landscape  will be the 
primary consideration  in the assessment of all development  proposals.
Development  in the North Wessex Downs  will be required  to support its local communities  and rural economy  
in a manner  commensurate  with the statutory status of the AONB  as a nationally  valued  landscape.  Planning  
permission  will be refused for major development  in the AONB  except in exceptional  circumstances, and where  
it can be demonstrated  to be in the public  interest.
In determining what constitutes major development, the  Council will consider whether the development, by  reason 
of its scale, character or nature, has the potential  to have a significant  adverse  impact on the landscape  and 
scenic beauty of the AONB. This will include  the consideration  of the individual  characteristics  of a proposal  and 
its context and the impact of cumulative  development.
If an application  is deemed  to be major development  then further consideration  will take account of:

refused planning  permission  by the Council,  especially  when  the Office for Nuclear  Regulation  (ONR) and/or 
Ministry of Defence  (MoD) have advised  against  that development  and/or object.
The ONR will be consulted  on applications  for new development  in the DEPZ, Outer Consultation  Zone (OCZ)
(12) and any other consultation  zone as detailed  on ONR website  which  meets the consultation  criteria described
in the table below  (as may be amended  by the ONR from time to time).
For development  proposals  in the DEPZ and OCZ for each of AWE’s sites, consideration  will be given  as to how 
the proposed  development  would  impact on the AWE Off-Site Emergency  Plan and supporting  documents.

Flood  Risk
Flood zones are defined  in Planning  Practice Guidance  (PPG) and the Council's  Level  1 Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA) (18). Within Flood Zones 2 and 3 (and also on sites of 1 hectare or more in size, and in other 
circumstances  as set out in the NPPF, the sequential  approach  will be strictly applied  across the District. 
Development  within  areas of flood risk from any source of flooding,  including  areas with a history of fluvial, 
groundwater  or surface water flooding  will only be supported  if it is demonstrated  that it is located  and designed  
to ensure  that flood risk from all sources of flooding  is acceptable  in planning  terms, and there are no suitable  
and available  sites at a lower  flood risk.
A sequential  test is needed  for all development  in all areas of flooding  unless:

Policy SP7
Design Quality
New development  will be required  to strengthen a sense of place  through  high quality  locally  distinctive  design  
and place  shaping.  This will enable  healthy  place  making, creating  places  that are better for people,  taking 
opportunities  available  for conserving  and enhancing  the character, appearance  and quality  of an area and the 
way it functions.
Development  proposals  will be expected  to show how they have responded  positively  to both national  and local 
design  guidance.  At a national  level this includes  the characteristics  of a well-designed  place  as set out in the 
National  Design  Guide (2021), or as superseded,  and at a local level, this includes  neighbourhood  plans  
and relevant community planning documents that identify the local character and distinctiveness of an area which 
is valued  by local communities.

5.54Development proposals likely to affect the significance of a designated or non-designated heritage asset, or
its setting, are required to demonstrate a thorough understanding of context, the significance of the asset and any
potential impacts on that significance through the preparation of a proportionate heritage statement. This should be

there is archaeological potential, pre-determination field evaluation may be necessary. As a minimum the West
BerkshireHistoricEnvironmentRecordshouldbeconsulted.
5.55Heritage assets rarely prevent development schemes where their significance has been properly assessed
and understood from the outset. Indeed, the most successful schemes often arise from this understanding and an
appreciation of the social, cultural, economic, and environmental value that can be gained from their retention,
sympathetic re-use and successful integration. Preserving embodied energy through the re-use and adaption of
existinghistoricbuildingsforexample,canbemoresustainablethanconstructingnewbuildings.Proposalsforenergy
saving measures should be designed with the knowledge and understanding of the building's significance. Getting
the balance right and avoiding unintended consequences, is best done with a holistic 'whole building' approach in
accordance with the current guidance from Historic England. This helps to highlight and resolve uncertainties and
reconcile conflicting aims, ensuring that energy efficient measures are suitable, robust, well integrated, properly
coordinatedandsustainable.

Green Infrastructure
The Council  will strengthen  both local and strategic green  infrastructure (GI) assets across the District. This 
will be achieved  by protecting  and enhancing  existing  GI assets and linkages  and adding  to the local network 
for the benefit of both the natural  environment  and the health  and wellbeing  of the community. This policy  will 
be considered  in conjunction  with other policies  in the LPR affecting the status and provision  of GI in the District.
Depending  on their location,  nature and scale, development  proposals  should:
a. Protectand/orenhanceexistingGIandthefunctionsthisperforms,
b. CreateadditionalGIwhichisintegratedintotheoveralldevelopmentdesignfromtheoutset;and

Approach to housing delivery
Policy SP12
Approach  to Housing  Delivery
Provision  will be made for 8,721 to 9,146 net additional  homes in West Berkshire  for the period  1 April 2022  to 
31 March 2039; 513 to 538 dwellings  per annum. The target figure of 538 dwellings  per annum  does not 
constitute a ceiling  or cap to development.
New homes will be located  in accordance  with Policy SP1: Spatial  Strategy, Policy SP3: Settlement hierarchy  
and Policy DM1: Development  in the Countryside.
There should  be no net losses from the existing  stock of homes in West Berkshire. Existing homes should  be 
retained  in residential  use (or replaced  at least in equal  numbers, normally  on the proposed  site), unless  there 
is a reasoned  justification  in the form of a benefit to the wider  community for a change  of use. Developments  
should  utilise  opportunities  to make better use of the existing  housing  stock.

Housing need and the housing requirement
6.1TheNPPFstatesthat “todeterminetheminimumnumberofhomesneeded,strategicpoliciesshouldbeinformed
by a local housing needs assessment, conducted using the standard method in national planning guidance – unless
exceptionalcircumstancesjustifyanalternativeapproach….Anyneedsthatcannotbemetwithinneighbouringareas
should also be taken into account in establishing the amount of housing to be planned for ”.
6.2Details of the standard method for calculating the local housing need figure (LHN) are set out in the Housing
andEconomicNeedsAssessmentsectionofthePlanningPracticeGuidance(PPG). Usingthe2014-basedhousehold

6.3TheLHNisnotnecessarilythesameasthehousingrequirement,andthePPGoutlinescircumstanceswhere
it may be appropriate to plan for a higher number. These include, but are not limited to, situations where increases
in housing need are likely to exceed past trends. This can include unmet needs from adjoining authorities, strategic
infrastructure requirements that are likely to drive an increase in the local housing needs, and growth strategies for

work. The Berkshire (including SouthBucks)StrategicHousingMarketAssessment (SHMA,February2016)found
that West Berkshire has a strong functional relationship with Wokingham Borough, Reading Borough and Bracknell

Assessment of the availability, suitability and viability of individual sites has taken place through the Housingand
Economic LandAvailability Assessment (HELAA) and further technical and sustainability assessments have been
undertaken. Sites proposed for allocation are detailed in Policies SP13 - 15 and provide additional housing supply
on newly allocated sites of some 1,720 homes. This includes the strategic allocation at North East Thatcham for

North  East Thatcham Strategic Site Allocation
Land  as shown  on the Policies  Map is allocated  for a sustainable  low carbon, urban  extension  comprising  of 
distinct neighbourhoods  defined  by their landscape  and connected  and contributing  to Thatcham, and woven  
through  with natural  habitats and links. The site will be masterplanned  and delivered  as a whole  to achieve  a 
comprehensive  development.  The provision  of all infrastructure, services, open  space and facilities  will be timely 
and co-ordinated.  The Thatcham Strategic Growth Study provides  guiding  principles  for the delivery  of the site 
therefore proposals  will demonstrate  that these guiding  principles  have been  positively  responded  to.
Homes
The site is to be allocated  for approximately  1,500 dwellings  which  will be completed  within  the period  of the 
plan. These dwellings  will comprise  of a housing  mix which  complies  with the housing  mix contained  in Table 3 
of Policy SP18. In addition  at least:

Policy SP18
Housing  Type and Mix
Residential  development  will contribute  to the delivery  of an appropriate  mix of dwelling  tenures, types and sizes 
to meet the existing  and future housing  needs  of all sectors of the community, including  those with specialist  
requirements.
Residential  developments  should  provide  a mix of unit sizes. All developments,  including  conversions,  of 10 or 
more dwellings  (gross) will provide  a mix of dwelling  sizes reflecting  the requirements  of Table 3 in the supporting  
text to this policy, or any more recent evidence  published  by the Council.
In determining  any variation  from this mix, the Council  will have regard  to:

If a lower provision of affordable housing is sought in exceptional circumstances, a review mechanism will be
required to ensure that if viability improves during the lifetime of the development project, additional affordable

assist in protecting these employment sites, the Council will explore additional measures to provide protection for
example through planning conditions/planning obligations restricting permitted development rights on new office
development.
7.6The Council’s evidence confirms that the market signals are generally not sufficient to trigger new build office
development on a speculative basis. It is evident from the ELR and the SA/SEA that the Plan is unable to make
provision to meet the District’s office requirements over the plan period to 2039. The Council has positively sought
opportunitiestomeettheofficerequirementfortheDistrictbyundertakingnumerousCallforSites,soughttodeliver

7.10The ELR is clear that the industrial requirement of 91,109sqm is a minimum and therefore the regeneration
of the London Road Industrial Estate (LRIE) will provide flexibility to the figures in the later part of the plan period.
The redevelopment and regeneration of the LRIE is a long held vision of the Council and a recent decision by the

ThealeintheeastwhichisconnectedtotheReadingmarket,andNewburyandThatchaminthecentreoftheDistrict.
The demand for office space in Newbury town centre is predominantly for smaller units with larger requirements
focusing on the out of town stock, however large amounts of office accommodation has been lost to residential in
recent years through permitted development rights. Outside of Theale and Newbury the office market has a local
focus. Since the Covid 19 pandemic began the economy has experienced a weakened office market, with fallen
demand and strong signs that companies are releasing/rationalising space and not taking on new space. However,

units (up to 5,000sqm) which sees the most take up activity. Whilst there is demand for larger B8 distribution and
logistics this tends to be at the motorway junctions. Occupiers across all building sizes range from local to national
businesses and covering a wide variety of business activity with no specific sector driving demand. The Covid19
pandemichasstrengthenedtheindustrialmarketfurther,withcontinuedstrongdemand.
7.14As a result the ELR recommends safeguarding existing employment sites. West Berkshire has a number of
designated employment areas (DEA) which are specific locations across the District designated for business
uses/development providing a range of sites and locations to promote sustainable economic growth. The District’s
DEAs contribute significantly to the supply of employment land and provide opportunities for regeneration and

Infrastructure Requirements and Delivery
New development  will be supported  where  it contributes  to the delivery  of infrastructure to support the overall  
spatial  strategy of West Berkshire. This includes  making  contributions  to the delivery  of all relevant  infrastructure 
projects included  in the IDP in the form of financial  contributions  or on site provision.  Infrastructure, facilities  and 
services both on and off site, that are necessary  to make the development  acceptable,  will be supported  if 
provided  at the appropriate  stage.
The Council will collaborate with other strategic policy  making authorities  to ensure that administrative boundaries 
do
 not restrict  the delivery  of the most appropriate  infrastructure response.
To ensure  that communities  and business  are able to function and grow in a sustainable  and effective manner, 
within  the context of the Council’s declared  local climate emergency, the Council  will work with infrastructure 
providers  and stakeholders,  agencies  and organisations  and funding  providers,  to identify requirements  for and 
enable  the delivery  of infrastructure and services for new development  and infrastructure development  in its own 
right.
The Council  will seek to protect, co-ordinate  and, where  appropriate,  improve  services and facilities  that provide  
a key function in the operation  of existing  communities  and protecting  environmental  quality. The loss of existing  
infrastructure will only be supported  if a suitable  alternative  can be provided  or it can be demonstrated  that the 
infrastructure is no longer  required  to meet the needs  of the community.
The key strategic and local infrastructure schemes required to facilitate new development and  secure the  delivery 
of development  within  this plan will be linked  to the phasing  of new development.  Phasing  and specific 
infrastructure requirements  are set out within  the Infrastructure Delivery  Plan (IDP).

and settlement hierarchy for West Berkshire is set out in Policies SP1 and SP3. The policies seek to accommodate

thatonlyappropriatelimiteddevelopmentinthecountrysidewillbeallowed.

Separation of Settlements around Newbury and Thatcham
In order to prevent the coalescence of  Newbury and Thatcham and to maintain the  separate identity of the distinct 
settlements around  both towns, the following  gaps between  settlements have been  identified  and are outlined  
on the Policies  Map:
a. LandbetweenNewburyandDonnington

9.8The overarching spatial strategy for the LPR set out in Policy SP1 focuses development on Newbury and
Thatcham. Thispressurefordevelopmenthasthepotentialtoleadtothelossoftheseparateanddistinctidentityof
both settlements and the settlements surrounding them through coalescence. This could either be by physically or
perceptually reducing the gaps between them or by introducing an increase of activity which has an urbanising
effect. The visual break and sense of openness between these settlements is very important in maintaining the
separate identity of individual communities and the Council considers it important that the integrity of this openness
ismaintained.
9.9AnAppropriate Countryside Designation Study(2022) was therefore undertaken of the countryside around
Newbury and Thatcham to help determine whether a specific planning designation was needed to safeguard the
unique characters and separate identities of the individual settlements. This concluded that should the Council

Health and Wellbeing
Development  proposals  will be required  to promote, support and enhance  positive  mental and physical  health  
and wellbeing  and thus contribute  to reducing  health  inequalities.  Where any potential  adverse  impacts are 
identified,  they will need  to be addressed  and mitigated  in an appropriate  manner.
Proposals  for major development,  or other development  likely  to have a potentially  significant  health  impact in 
relation  to either its use and/or location,  should  be accompanied  by a fit for purpose  Health  Impact Assessment 
(HIA)  in accordance  with the current guidance(39) from Public  Health  England.  The level of information  required  
should  be proportionate  to the scale and nature of the development  proposed.  Development  proposals  should  
demonstrate  how the conclusions  of the HIA have been  taken into account in the design  of the scheme.
Development  that would  have an unacceptable  impact on the health  or wellbeing  of existing  or new communities  
will not be permitted.

10.45Light pollution (also known as obtrusive light) is caused by excessive artificial light being directed into the

requirement of the WFD to prevent a deterioration in class of individual containments. The ‘Weser Ruling’ by the
European Court of Justice in 2015 specified that individual projects should not be permitted where they may cause
a deterioration of the status of a water body. If a water body is already at the lowest status ‘bad’, any impairment of

Water Resources  and Waste Water
Development  will be required  to minimise  water use and aim to be water-neutral  as far as practicable  by 
incorporating appropriate water efficiency and water recycling measures. A  collaborative approach  is encouraged 
between  the
 Council,  statutory agencies,  water companies  and site promoters/developers  to promote innovation  
in water efficiency and re-use within  and outside  of dwellings  and commercial  buildings,  including  demand  
reduction to  improve longer term water resilience. Liaison with other local  authorities  is expected where  relevant.
Development will  be required to be designed to  be water efficient and reduce water  consumption. Refurbishments 
and
 other non-domestic  development  will be expected  to meet BREEAM water-efficiency credits. All new 
residential  developments  (including  replacement  dwellings)  will meet the Building  Regulation  optional  higher  
water efficiency standard  of 110 litres per person  per day, as set out in Building  Regulations  part G2. Planning  
conditions  will be applied  to new residential  development  to ensure  that the water efficiency standards  are met.
New or replacement  non-residential  development  of 1000sqm  gross floor area or more will meet BREEAM 
‘excellent’  standards  for water consumption  (with at least a 40% improvement  in water consumption  against  the 
baseline  performance  of the building),  unless  demonstrated  not to be practicable.
Both of the above  apply  unless  it can be demonstrated  that it would  not be feasible  on technical  or viability  
grounds.  Where subsequent  national  standards  exceed  those set out above, the new national  standards  will be 
applied.
Development  proposals  should  satisfactorily demonstrate  the following  criteria:
a. Thereisadequatewatersupplyandwastewatertreatmentinfrastructurecapacityresourcesareavailable,

10.105Inclusion on the register does not provide statutory protection, nor does it imply any additional powers to
control development. However, the historic interest of a park or garden is a material planning consideration when
determining planning applications within or adjoining registered parks and gardens. The NPPF makes clear that
substantial harm to or loss of grade II Registered Parks and Gardens should be exceptional and for grade II* and
gradeIRegisteredParksandGardensitshouldbewhollyexceptional.

10.107 The policy emphasises that a holistic approach will be taken to understanding the potential impact of

10.111Since 1995 Historic England has compiled a Register of Historic Battlefields, designated because of their
special historic interest; they are designated heritage assets of the highest significance. Inclusion on the Register

Trees, Woodland  and Hedgerows
Development  which  conserves  and enhances  trees, woodland  and hedgerows  will be supported.
Development  proposals  should  be accompanied  by an appropriate  Arboricultural  Survey, Arboricultural  Impact 
Assessment and/or an Arboricultural  Method Statement. Proposals  will be expected  to clearly  demonstrate  that 
wherever  possible  existing  trees, woodland  and hedgerows  have been  incorporated  into the design  and layout 
of a scheme from the outset. Where this cannot be achieved  the onus is on the applicant  to justify the loss of 
trees and/or other features as part of the proposals.
The loss or deterioration  of protected trees, groups  of trees, woodland  or important hedgerows  will only be 
permitted in exceptional  circumstances  and in accordance  with the relevant  legislation,  policy  and good  practice 
recommendations. Where protected  trees are subject to felling, a replacement of an appropriate number, species 
and size in an appropriate  location  will be required.
Ancient woodland,  ancient  and veteran trees and ancient  hedgerows  are irreplaceable  habitats. Development  
resulting  in their loss or deterioration  will be considered  in accordance  with Policy SP11. The scale and quality  
of the compensation  measures  required  will be commensurate  to the loss or deterioration  of the irreplaceable  
habitat.
Development  proposals  which  could  potentially  result in the loss of ancient  wood  pasture; or trees, woodlands  
and hedgerows  located  within  historic parks and gardens  will be considered  in accordance  with policy  DM13, 
for those within Registered Parks and Gardens, or Policy DM12 for  those forming part of non-designated heritage 
assets.
Where loss or damage  of non-protected  trees, woodland  or hedgerows  is unavoidable,  appropriate  replacement  
or compensation  planting  including  appropriate  measures  to secure their long term maintenance  will be required.
Development proposals will  provide appropriate  protection for  retained trees, woodland  and hedgerows in advance 
of any work on site to prevent damage  to root systems and to take account of future sustainable  growth.
Where appropriate,  suitable  opportunities  should  be identified  and incorporated  for the restoration  and planting  
of new trees, woodland  and hedgerows.  New planting  should:
a. Besuitableforthesiteconditions;
b. Useappropriatetreepitsizesandsoilvolumes;
c. Usenativespecieswhereverappropriate;

Self and Custom-build  Housing
The Council  is supportive  in principle  of schemes which  will provide  a diverse  mix of housing  and cater for new 
and emerging  housing  models  and innovative  products, including  self-build  and custom-build  products.
Applications for self and custom-build developments will  need to demonstrate high-quality design and  be sensitive 
to the characteristics  of the local area.
Where appropriate, the  Council will work with developers, registered providers, landowners  and relevant individuals  
or
 groups  to address  identified  local requirements  for self and custom-build  homes as identified  in the West 
Berkshire  self and custom-build  register.

Designated Employment Areas
Designated  Employment  Areas (DEA),  as defined  on the Policies  Map and listed in Appendix  4, are specific 
locations  designated  for business  uses (office,  industry, storage and distribution).  These areas are safeguarded  
for such uses and for the role they play in meeting  the future economic  needs  of the District.
The redevelopment  and regeneration  of land within  DEAs to provide  additional  business  development  that meets 
the needs  of the District will be supported.
Proposals  for appropriate  alternative  employment  generating  uses which  support and compliment  the primary 
function of DEAs will be considered  favourably, subject to the application  of the sequential  test if required.
New office proposals  located  within  a DEA will not be required  to satisfy  the sequential  test.
Development  which  either individually  or cumulatively  would  undermine  the integrity or function of the DEA will 
not be permitted.

gallops, staff and owners. A small yard could range in size from 10 to 40 horses and could work with as few as six

Transport Infrastructure
Proposals  for new development  will be expected  to demonstrate  the type and level of travel activity likely  to be 
generated. In order to assist in tackling the  climate emergency, this travel activity will be expected to be minimised 
by the design  of developments  that support low levels  of travel with a focus on local journeys  that can be made 
sustainably. Developments  will be required  to be supported  through  a range  of infrastructure associated  with 
different transport modes. New development  will only be supported  where  the relevant  transport infrastructure 
is delivered  in a timely manner. Where required,  new developed  will be expected  to make a  contribution  to the 
provision  or improvement  of a range  of transport infrastructure. This transport infrastructure will specifically, but 
not exclusively, include  the following:
a. Connectionsandimprovementstolocalpedestrian,cycleandequestriannetworks,includingaccessto

Parking
Parking  provision  in association  with development  will be required  to ensure  that all modes have the facilities  
they require  and that the balance  of provision  of these facilities  between  different modes reflects the need  for 
travel activity to minimise  carbon  emissions  and environmental  harm.
Cycle and motorcycle parking  should  be provided  in accordance  with the Council’s ‘Cycling  and Motorcycling  
Advice and Standards  for New Development’.  This sets out design  standards  and expected  levels  of provision  
for different types of development.
Electric vehicle  charging  points will be required  to be installed  for all development  in line with requirements  of 
the English  Building  Regulations  as a minimum. These charging  points may vary from communal  points where  
there are shared  parking  areas in non-residential  developments  or for developments  of flats, to individual  points 
associated  with houses. Details  of how these charging  points should  be delivered  and where  there are 
opportunities to  go beyond the  minimum standards  are set out in the Council’s guidance ‘Electric Vehicle Charging 
Points for new development’.  This must be taken into account when  planning  new development.
Non-residential parking
In addition  to cycle and motorcycle parking  and adequate  provision  of spaces for electric vehicles  to plug-in,  
priority should be  given to provision for  other ultra-low emission vehicles, car sharing spaces and  car club vehicles.
The
 level of vehicular  parking  required  will be judged  on a case by case basis and will take account of:
a. Theaccessibilityofthedevelopment;
b. Thetype,mixanduseofdevelopment;
c. Theavailabilityofandopportunitiesforpublictransport;

Travel Planning
Travel planning  measures  will be required  to be implemented  in relation  to be implemented  in relation  to most 
non-residential  developments  where  a Transport Assessment is required  as set out in Policy SP23.
For residential  developments  of 60 or more dwellings  travel plan measures  will be required  to be implemented.  
Where appropriate,  any development  below  60 dwellings  may be requested  to implement  travel planning  
measures. The judgement  regarding  the need  for travel planning  measures  lies with the Council  and will take 
into account any relevant  specific local circumstances.
Residential developments of 10 or more dwellings will be required to provide new  residents with a travel information  
pack containing  relevant  details  to inform residents  of their travel choices  and encourage  sustainable  travel.
Where developments  are required  to develop  travel plan measures, it is expected  that necessary  targets will be 
set to restrict  single  occupancy  vehicle  journeys  and to increase  sustainable  travel, and undertake  regular  
monitoring  and reporting  in line with the requirements  of the Council.

LocalPlanReview2022-2039ProposedSubmissionAppendix 2 Settlement Boundary Review
Review of settlement boundaries
As part of our Local Plan Review (LPR), we have undertaken a review of the settlement boundaries across
the District. Settlementboundariesare a longestablishedplanningtool.They identifythe main builtup area
of a settlement within which development is considered acceptable in principle, subject to other policy
considerations.Whileallowingfordevelopment,settlementboundariesprotectthecharacterofasettlement
and prevent unrestricted growth into the countryside. They create a level of certainty about whether or not
the principle of development is likely to be acceptable.
The settlement boundary review criteria set out the general principles followed when defining a boundary
and give guidance as to what would usually be included and what would usually be excluded.
Settlement Boundary Review Criteria
TheCounciltookalandscapeledapproachtothedrawingofsettlementboundaries.

Plans.
If successful with a ‘yes’ vote at referendum, a NP will become part of the statutory development plan for the area.
This means that it will be used to determine planning applications. This statutory status gives neighbourhood plans
farmoreweightthansomeotherlocaldocuments,suchasparishplans,communityplansandvillagedesignstatements.
Further details about neighbourhood planning can be found on the Council’s neighbourhood planning resources
webpage: https://info.westberks.gov .uk/neighbourhoodplanning
What is the relationship between neighbourhood plans and Local Plans?
A neighbourhood plan sits within a framework of statutory planning and development documents. Neighbourhood
plans should support the delivery of strategic policies contained within Local Plans, and should shape and direct
development that is outside of these strategic policies. One of the Basic Conditions for neighbourhood plans is that
they are in general conformity with the strategic policies in a local plan, which sit above neighbourhood plans in the
framework.
There is no definitive definition of strategic policies, but essentially they are those which set out an overall strategy
forthepattern,scaleandqualityofdevelopment.ThestrategicpoliciesintheLPRhavetheprefix‘SP’.
The role of NDPs in decision-making
Once a plan is adopted, it carries the same weight as other development plan policies, and the policies it contains
take precedence over existing non-strategic policies in a Local Plan covering the neighbourhood area, where they
conflict;unlesstheyaresupersededbystrategicornon-strategicpoliciesthatareadoptedsubsequently.

for supply of housing will not be considered ‘out-of-date’ in line with NPPF paragraph 14 in areas with an adopted

AffordablehousingisdefinedintheNPPFas: Affordablehousing
Housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the market
(including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or
is for essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the
following definitions:
a.Affordablehousingforrent: meetsallofthefollowingconditions:(a)the
rent is set in accordance with the government’s rent policy for Social Rent
or Affordable Rent, or is at least 20% below local market rents (including
servicechargeswhereapplicable);(b)thelandlordisaregisteredprovider,
except where it is included as part of a Build to Rent scheme (in which
case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and (c) it includes
provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households,
orforthesubsidytoberecycledforalternativeaffordablehousingprovision.
For Build to Rent schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be
the normal form of affordable housing provision (and, in this context, is
known as Affordable Private Rent).
b.Starter homes : is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and
Planning Act 2016 and any secondary legislation made under these
sections. The definition of a starter home should reflect the meaning set
out in statute and any such secondary legislation at the time of
plan-preparationordecision-making.Wheresecondarylegislationhasthe
effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home to
those with a particular maximum level of household income, those
restrictions should be used.
c.Discounted market sales housing : is that sold at a discount of at least
20%belowlocalmarketvalue.Eligibilityisdeterminedwithregardtolocal
incomes and local house prices. Provisions should be in place to ensure
housing remains at a discount for future eligible households.
d.Other affordable routes to home ownership : is housing provided for
sale that provides a route to ownership for those who could not achieve
homeownershipthroughthemarket.Itincludessharedownership,relevant
equityloans,otherlowcosthomesforsale(atapriceequivalenttoatleast
20%belowlocalmarketvalue)andrenttobuy(whichincludesaperiodof
intermediate rent). Where public grant funding is provided, there should
be provisions for the homes to remain at an affordable price for future
eligible households, or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative
affordable housing provision, or refunded to government or the relevant
authority specified in the funding agreement.
