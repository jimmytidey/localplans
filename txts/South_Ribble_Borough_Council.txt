ContentsIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local PlanOur Councils have a long track record of working together to improve the quality 
of life of the residents of Central Lancashire. As a partnership, we are looking for your views and ideas about the new Central Lancashire Local Plan, which will shape the future of the Central Lancashire area over the next 15 years. In that time, the population will grow. We need to ensure that we provide sufficient facilities to accommodate this growth. But we need to ensure that development coming forward is sustainable and addresses the impacts and challenges of climate change.We need your help to decide what type of homes, jobs and community facilities will be needed and where they should go. We also need to think about how enough school places, critical services and leisure facilities can be provided. Other challenges include making sure that our town and city centres are attractive and vibrant, and getting around needs to be made easier and healthier. Central Lancashire also contains a number of special places which need protecting.
So, we need your ideas about when and where homes, services and facilities 
should be located, and when they should be provided. We need to know what you think the key priorities are for our area. We are looking forward to hearing what you think and thank you for your interest in the future of our area.

Why do we need to review our existing policies?How you can respond to this consultationThe plan-making processWhat happens next?IntroductionIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local PlanWhat is this consultation about?
1.
 W
e need your help to make sure we have a plan for Central Lancashire 
that creates good quality places to live, work and relax over the next 15 years. People need good quality homes and these can improve the health of communities. We need you to tell us how we can improve our area for future generations and reduce the impacts of climate change by being carbon neutral by 2030. 
2.
 W
e want to find out how you think people’s quality of life can be improved. 
How do we encourage people to use their car less and make walking and 
cycling everyday choices? Without your ideas we cannot create a plan that meets the needs of local people and businesses.
Why do we need to review our existing policies?
3.
 W
e need to have a Local Plan in place that is up to date and in line with 
national planning policy. The existing Core Strategy and 3 councils’ Local Plans were all adopted before recent changes were introduced. They changed how we deal with issues like the number of homes we need to provide; how we protect and improve the environment and managing climate change.
4.
 So, we need to cr
eate a plan that guides development and ensures that 
we deliver the right number of homes, jobs and infrastructure our communities 
need. It also means development will take place in the right places and is sustainable. 5.
  T o deliver this it makes sense to have one Local Plan for the 3 councils 
which will include all policies required to guide development over the next15 years.
6.
 Once the new Local Plan is adopted, any Neighbourhood Planning bodies
 
will need to consider whether their Local Neighbourhood Plans need to be 
updated. There are currently three Neighbourhood Plans in Central Lancashire which are:

What are we aiming to achieve?
16.
 W
e need to develop a vision for the Local Plan which sets out how we want 
to see the area grow and evolve over the next 15 years. This will be different for everyone, but common themes will be shared by all. We need a vision which reflects that changes will happen, and we want to manage that to achieve the best outcome for Central Lancashire.
Our Vision for Central Lancashire is:
By 2036 Central Lancashire will lead sustainable development in the region. It will make the most of its economic, cultural, heritage and natural assets and be at the forefront of tackling and adapting to the impacts and challenges of climate change. Recognising this, the councils will seek to be carbon neutral by 2030. 
The areas of Preston, Chorley and South Ribble will continue to benefit from a 
growing economy and be attractive to both new and existing investors and visitors,
	
taking
	
advantage
	
of
	
retail,
	
heritage,
	
education
	
and
	
high-quality
	
city
	
and	
town
	
centres.
	
Its
	
cutting-edge
	
technology
	
and
	
engineering
	
sectors,
	
including
	
the	
aer
ospace industry, will continue to invest in the success of their businesses 
in the area, and this will continue to enhance our region’s economy. Skills and education attainment will continue to improve, made possible by high quality education offered across the area and the continued success of UCLAN. Central Lancashire will continue to thrive on its creativity and entrepreneurial flair and offer opportunities for graduates which will help to retain these skills to drive a flourishing globally connected economy.Connections will improve access across Central Lancashire by prioritising sustainable transport including walking and cycling to link town and city centres with their wider areas, alongside other destinations. Overall, Central Lancashire will be a place where people and businesses thrive and a place where people will want to work, live and visit.
New development will take place in a manner that mitigates against and 
adapts to the cause and impacts of climate change. It will take account of flood risk, be energy efficient and of high design quality, championing outstanding new architecture, making efficient use of resources and enabling waste prevention. It will respect and where appropriate reinforce local character and the relationships between buildings and their wider surroundings. Central Lancashire will be served by efficient infrastructure including transportation, utilities and communications.
Preston’s strategic role will be fulfilled as a regional city and a major economic 
driver for Central Lancashire and its surrounding areas, providing high quality retail, cultural and entertainment offer. Preston will continue to operate as a successful regional centre and a place where people choose to live and work, providing opportunities for both rural and city centre living. 
Chorley will continue to provide opportunities for enterprise to thrive and 
businesses to grow building on past success. It will continue to make the most of its natural assets through links to open countryside and outstanding parks; providing attractive, prosperous and welcoming places to live. Vision & ObjectivesCentral Lancashire Local Plan | Issues & OptionsSouth Ribble will continue to boost economic growth and draw on the 
success of the area’s diverse economic offer. The importance of its Green links between its discreet towns and villages will be enhanced, as well as improved accessibility
	
to
	
the
	
surrounding
	
areas
	
promoting
	
better
	
health
	
and
	
well-being.
The residential neighbourhoods of Preston, Chorley and South Ribble will be attractive places to live, reflecting their individual historic and cultural heritage and enhancing their local distinctiveness. Our communities will continue to recognise and welcome the diversity within them, with residents living in high quality and well designed, low carbon housing with a balance of housing types and tenures provided. Our Local centres will serve as vibrant and accessible focal points for communities, providing a range of shops, experiences, community
	
services
	
and
	
facilities
	
to
	
meet
	
the
	
day-to-day
	
needs
	
of
	
residents 	
as well as pr
oviding opportunities to enhance and develop small business and 
protecting the character of rural villages. In Preston those most in need of a suitable home will be the priority, and the economic environment in the City will be harnessed to ensure prosperity for everyone through a commitment to community wealth building. Neighbourhoods across Central Lancashire 
will be safe, clean and sustainable with healthy, highly skilled and diverse communities. Residents will have easy access to public services, good jobs and decent, high quality affordable homes. Proposed Central Lancashire Local Plan Objectives17.
 These ar
e our proposed objectives for delivering our vision for Central 
Lancashire. They will run throughout our policies and shall be the basis of how we will measure our success as we implement our Plan for the three boroughs.

3) How can we make sure the homes we plan for meet the needs of everybody?3.1. Providing new homes is an important issue for us all. The type and quality 
of homes that are available can have a direct impact on the local community and the health of our residents. Central Lancashire will offer homes that enable communities to thrive; where young people can stay in the community where they grew up, when they want to rent or buy their own home. Likewise, older people can stay at home for longer, as their homes are designed to be easily accessible and adaptable. Affordable housing is a key priority, delivering new homes for social or affordable rent is essential to tackling inequality and improving the life chances of those who fall into homelessness, including young people and children.
3.2. Central Lancashire is a diverse area, with a mix of urban and rural parts 
and whilst we are a single housing market area, with people moving across our
	
boundaries,
	
we
	
are
	
three
	
distinct
	
boroughs.
	
For
	
this
	
reason,
	
there
	
may	
occasionally be a need for dif
ferent approaches, for example when looking at 
the density of new homes or types provided, or where we locate development. In addition, we also need to consider how small sites can come forward for development.
The number of homes
3.3. The method used to work out how many homes are needed in a local authority area changed recently with the government introducing the ‘standard housing method’ which uses a set formula. 3.4. It is likely that the number of homes we must deliver for this plan period of
	
2021-2036
	
will
	
be
	
different
	
to
	
our
	
existing
	
policy.
	
This
	
currently
	
requires
	
the	
thr
ee authorities to deliver a total of 1,341 homes a year, over the plan period1.
3.5. The formula for the standard housing method means that the actual number of dwellings required changes annually, in line with population changes and the ratio of income to house price changes. At the time of producing this document, the figures were:
Preston Chorley South Ribble
Homes Per Year

The government see these as a starting point for the planning process 
rather than a compulsory target but consider that it is only in exceptional circumstances that a different method could be used. Therefore, as a starting point, 1,033 houses would need to be provided every year across Central Lancashire,
	
which
	
over
	
the
	
15-year
	
plan
	
period
	
would
	
be
	
15,495
	
houses.	
The thr
ee councils are still looking into the number of homes we need in Central 
Lancashire and how these will be spread across Preston, Chorley and South Ribble. We will have more information about this when we next consult with our communities.Open Countryside etc.) for development. 
3.9. National policy sets out a very clear framework as to the strict criteria to be 
applied when deciding to allocate sites within the Green Belt, so our starting point must be to look at whether additional housing can be accommodated on brownfield land.
3.10.
	
Over
	
half
	
(50.2%)
	
of
	
Central
	
Lancashire
	
is
	
designated
	
as
	
Green
	
Belt,	
with Chorley having the highest pr
oportion of land covered by the designation. 
The designation restricts the type of development which can take place 
and generally requires special circumstances to be demonstrated where development is proposed. 
3.11. It will be for a future consultation to determine if and when there is a need 
to consider looking at sites within the Green Belt.
Meeting the housing needs of particular groups
3.12. Students, older people and Gypsy and Travellers are some of the specific groups
	
we
	
must
	
consider
	
and
	
plan
	
housing
	
for,
	
as
	
part
	
of
	
plan-making.
		
We
	
are	
curr
ently gathering evidence as to what we need to do to ensure the needs of all 
groups are considered in our new Local Plan.
3.13. Preston City Council has recently published a study into student 
accommodation in the City, which finds that the supply of purpose built accommodation significantly outstrips demand. It is also the case that the University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) is not currently planning for future growth in student numbers. As a result, the Council has produced a policy note with
	
the
	
intention
	
of
	
requiring
	
any
	
applications
	
for
	
more
	
purpose-built
	
student	
accommodation outside of the campus ar
ea to fully demonstrate that there is 
sufficient demand.What happens if we do not have enough land?3.8.
	
We
	
are
	
at
	
a
	
very
	
early
	
stage
	
of
	
preparing

Plan and ther
efore it is too early to say if we will be proposing to suggest or 
allocate sites within the Green Belt, (or Sites of Scientific Interest (SSSIs) or  >>Distribution of homes
3.7. Preston, Chorley and South Ribble Councils have agreed to work together to agree where new homes are needed, taking account of things like investment in roads and employment sites, and locations where new jobs can be created. 5)	Do	you	think	the	Local	Plan	should	plan	for	the	minimum 	number	of	homes

e if it can? 4) How can the Local Plan ensure enough homes are provided so everyone has 
somewhere to live?
6) Where do you think new homes should be provided in Central Lancashire? Please be as specific as you wish. 18
Delivering HomesIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plan3.14. Going forward there are various options which could be pursued in the 
Local Plan to deal with this issue.
3.15. A Study into the requirements of Gypsy and Travellers has also been 
produced. This identifies a need for a replacement site for the unauthorised site in Preston. The majority of the provision required can be catered for by the progression of existing sites. However, one site in Preston, at Rosemary Lane (PR4
	
0HF)
	
is
	
unauthorised.
	
If
	
this
	
site
	
were
	
to
	
be
	
authorised,
	
then
	
that
	
would	
mean that a r
eplacement site elsewhere in Preston would be able to be much 
smaller.   7)	Do	you	think	there	should	be	no	new	purpose-built 	student	accommodation
in Pr
eston?3.16. The Study also says that there is a need for a facility to accommodate communities travelling through the area, and this could be within any of the three authorities. This would be a “Transit Site”, which allows communities to stay temporarily on a site for a period of up to three months.
10) Should the existing unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller site at Rosemary Lane in 
Preston be authorised for use by Gypsies and Travellers, or should a larger site be found somewhere else?8)	Do	you	think	we	should	identify	a	student	zone,	centred	around	the	UCLAN	
campus,
	
where
	
new
	
purpose-built
	
student
	
accommodation
	
could
	
be
	
built
	
and	
r
esist it elsewhere?
9) Or do you think there is another way this can be dealt with?11) If a larger site should be found, where do you think it should be?
12) Wher e could a transit site be located?

Employment,Education and SkillsIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plan4.1.   Central Lancashire has a thriving economy and excellent higher education 
facilities, along with nationally important industries. Preston is the largest centre of population, work and town centre uses in Central Lancashire, and Preston city centre is the key driver of the Central Lancashire economy. These characteristics, together with general performance against overall quality of life indicators, along with strong access to key public transport hubs and the strategic road network; attract new businesses, talent and investment in the area. The Local Plan will assist in creating the conditions for our economy to continue to grow. It will do this by encouraging businesses of all types and sizes to establish, thrive and grow in Central Lancashire; and those businesses will invest in jobs, education, skills and development at sustainable locations. The Local Plan will include flexibility to help our high streets to evolve and adapt to challenging times.
4.2.   Our high streets should better reflect changing aspirations and needs, 
and be enhanced as vibrant, attractive places to live, work and relax within a high quality environment and public realm. Central Lancashire has a business survival

. 
Central Lancashire contains a number of internationally competitive businesses which act as a means of attracting new businesses and investment in the area. These are from sectors including: aerospace; digital; IT; health and advanced engineering and manufacturing sectors; energy and creative and business support industries. These are sectors which we need to support, develop and help to expand to contribute to meeting the government’s Grand Challenges of the UK Industrial Strategy. Employment land4.3.   To help understand what is needed a Central Lancashire Employment Land Study Update (2019) has been prepared. This looks at the existing supply of employment land against future predicted requirements.  
4.4.   The Study Update identifies that each authority requires additional land for 
local needs to 2036. The amount of land required is:

locations, to be marketed primarily to companies outside of Central Lancashire 
and, in the case of the Enterprise Zone, to specific sectors outside Lancashire. Therefore, they are distinct from the established local supply, because they are meeting a separate strategic requirement. This means that local needs cannot be met by these sites.
4.6.   Preston City Centre and Inner East Preston comprise the Central Preston 
Strategic Location, which is one of the main locations in Central Lancashire where major economic growth and investment is focused.21

and enhance linkages with economic development to encourage investment and development. This will generate jobs, apprenticeship and training opportunities and community wealth building at all levels. In order to attract employers and ensure continued economic growth in Central Lancashire and for people to access higher skilled jobs, the skills gap will need to be addressed.22
Economic growthIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plandoes not recommend the designation of primary and secondary frontages in 
Preston. The study recommends a minor boundary extension to local centres at New Hall Lane, Plungington Road and Ribbleton Avenue to include additional shops, and a minor contraction of the centre at Ribbleton Lane to exclude a small cluster of vacancies. 
It also assessed Broughton Village Centre and Northway Village Centre, which 
are
	
centres
	
identified
	
in
	
the

Plan, as at most performing the function of neighbourhood centr

a formal boundary is not suggested for these centres because they are not recommended for inclusion in the Central Lancashire retail hierarchy and their small scale and limited function is below that of the local centres in Preston.

Town centres
4.16.   City/town/local centres are at the heart of community life and play a key role in shaping people’s perceptions of an area. Attractive, vibrant and prosperous centres can be the key to attracting growth and investment into the wider area. Equally, declining centres can have the opposite effect.
4.17.   Updated retail and leisure studies have been prepared for Central 
Lancashire and these will inform the policies to be developed. The studies include proposed amendments to the boundaries of city/town/local centres, based on the findings of detailed centre health checks

secondary frontages are not included, to encourage a more positive and flexible 
approach to planning for the future of the town centre, due to the rapid changes taking place in the retail and leisure industries. There are proposed changes to a number of the district and local centre boundaries including the deallocation of four local centres as they are only providing limited retail, service and leisure facilities and are not performing their local centre function.  In all cases, residents still have access to amenities in proximity of these centres.
4.21. The changes proposed by the studies are attached as Annex 6.4.23. Our local centres should include provision for local shops, amongst other 
uses, in order to maintain their key function and role in the retail hierarchy and to contribute to shorter, more sustainable journeys. However, retail requires co-location

uses
	
to
	
sustain

centre
	
in
	
respect

etail, leisure and economic trends. Therefore, some flexibility will need 
to be allowed for to accommodate changes of use to alternative uses where appropriate. Policies will need to make clear which uses will be appropriate in principle in each type of centre and within each part of the city centre, whilst taking into consideration the current flexibility of the government’s use classes categories and that some modern business models are more fluid than this. Preston city centre needs to achieve a greater mix of evening leisure uses and has scope to increase its food and beverage offer. There are identified gaps in the provision of small convenience stores and for a food store to serve the Cottam Strategic location and North West Preston, which contain proposed centres that have not yet been delivered to support housing growth in these areas.

4.29.    The Retail and Leisure Studies for Preston, Chorley and South Ribble have proposed local impact assessment thresholds. These would apply to the information requirements for any proposals (including the formation of mezzanine floors) for/or which include retail and / or leisure developments which are not located within a defined centre boundary where:

4.30.   If the Central Lancashire Local Planning Authorities are in doubt as to which tier of centre in the hierarchy is likely to be most affected, or if the centres likely to be most affected are at different levels in the hierarchy, the lower threshold will be applied. The Council of the administrative area in which the proposal is located will be the sole arbiter in
	
deciding
	
which
	
threshold
	
to
	
apply,
	
and
	
this
	
should

development would impose an information requirement for relevant proposals which would be triggered by lower thresholds than the default 2,500sq.m. gross threshold set by government. This will increase the quality, level of detail and availability of relevant technical retail and leisure information for assessment for relevant proposals via the planning application process in Central Lancashire.

to continue to restrict cumulative development in the A use classes (A1, A2, A3, A4, 
A5 use) in this Quarter. It is proposed that where proposals are located in the Horrocks Quarter:
Any net increase in floorspace comprising uses falling within the categories of the 
A1, A2, A3, A4 and / or A5 use class shall not, individually or cumulatively, exceed 12,500 square metres gross, unless a sequential assessment demonstrates that proposals cannot be located in the Primary Shopping Area and an impact assessment demonstrates that the proposal has no significant adverse impact on the Primary Shopping Area.

How we TravelIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plan5.3.   The location and design of development can shape how we travel, and this new 
Central Lancashire Local Plan provides a great opportunity to really make a difference to wider issues around congestion; air quality; climate change and poor health, whilst also allowing us to explore and make use of new technologies.
5.4.   We will continue to work closely with Lancashire County Council and Highways 
England who are responsible for our roads in the preparation of the revised Local Transport Plan. This will ensure the Local Plan fits in with wider strategic aims for our County, and that Central Lancashire can grow as an economy and will continue to attract the investment we need to support our transport network. 
5.5.   National planning policy requires us to consider transport at the earliest stage.
This involves promoting sustainable options (such as cycling, walking and public transport) and ensuring the impacts of development, for example, on nearby roads or the local environment, are identified at an early stage and dealt with. 5.6.   We can reduce the need to travel if future developments have a mix of different uses and facilities (such as homes, shops, schools, and places of work) close to each other. This means that people have to spend less time in the car and have more time to enjoy life. It also promotes more active ways of getting around, which helps keep the air clean, with its health benefits and contributes to global issues of addressing climate change and managing resources.
Active travel including cycling and walking
5.7.   There is a need to increase the levels of cycling and walking to make them the natural choice for journeys, because it provides so many benefits both to our environment and to our health. In Lancashire, we have a target to double the number of people

Transport and How we Travel
5.1.   National planning policy provides a clear message that the transport system needs to be balanced in favour of sustainable options, which can have a positive impact on reducing the impacts of climate change.
5.2.   A better transport system gives people a real choice about how they travel. If 
developments have a mix of different uses which are close to each other, then people are less likely to have to travel to use them. Where people have to travel, they need to be able to easily access the public transport network. This means they have easy access to the employment, services and facilities available within Central Lancashire and beyond it as well. Improving the public transport system is very important so people have alternative options to using the car. Creating a safe, well connected environment will also mean people have the option to walk or cycle more.Central Lancashire Local Plan | Issues & OptionsReducing numbers of vehicles using the roads
5.9.   Restricting the numbers of vehicles on the road will reduce congestion and delay, as well as reducing carbon emissions and improve our air quality. A way of achieving this is locating significant development in areas which are or can be made sustainable, for example within existing communities or on their edge, although this can be easier in urban areas compared to rural areas.
5.10.   We can also look to increase the density of development which is close 
to public transport links such as rail and bus routes.
5.11.   Other ways of reducing the number of private vehicles using the roads 
are to reduce the amount of road space available to the them, and reallocating this to sustainable modes of transport, such as cycle and priority bus lanes; providing more park and ride facilities both for bus and rail users; generally reducing the amount of car parking; locating facilities close together to reduce the need to travel; prioritising jobs for local people to reduce commuting, and ensuring that bus/rail stations are pleasant, safe places.
Public transport5.14.   Public transport covers a range of different modes of travel and can 
have public and private sector involvement. However, public transport provision is unequal across Central Lancashire especially east to west connections, and services need improving particularly in rural areas, as well as where new development is taking place.  Voluntary and community initiatives can also help those who struggle to access public transport.
5.15.   To be considered a realistic alternative to the car, there needs to be fully 
integrated public transport system, with an investment in improving/maintaining good accessibility; connectivity; affordability; frequency; reliability; journey times; safety; facilities; attractiveness, and the public realm.5.13.   It is important that people who need to drive into our town and city 
centres can do so, but it is also important that we reduce the number of trips made by car by encouraging more people to travel more often on foot, by bike or on public transport. If facilities for walking and cycling and public transport services
	
improve,
	
more
	
people

Transport and How we TravelIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local PlanInfrastructure
5.16.   It is essential that the infrastructure (things like roads; paths; safe crossings; cycle parking; electric vehicle charge points, bus stops and train stations) needed to support new development is secured both at the right time and in the right place, to support new homes and economic growth.

& Well-beingIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plan6.1.   Central Lancashire faces challenges of a growing population (by over 
15,000
	
people
	
between
	
2018
	
and
	
2036)
	
and
	
an
	
ageing
	
population.
	
However,
	
life	
expectancy for some is declining which indicates health is worsening for them.
 
6.2.   Another challenge for Central Lancashire is that people living in the poorest neighbourhoods live shorter lives than those who live in the richest ones. These differences are known as health inequalities. Some of those living in poorer areas also spend more of their lives living with a disability. There are substantial variations in life expectancy across Central Lancashire. So, planning needs not only to support improvements to raise the general level of health, but also crucially it needs to reduce health inequalities between different areas.  
Obesity
6.3.   Obesity is a major issue facing both the UK and our area. Childhood obesity affects children from the most deprived areas disproportionately. Obesity is a serious issue because it can impact on mental health alongside serious and potentially
	
life-threatening
	
physical
	
illnesses.
	
The
	
issue
	
is
	
particularly

. Evidence shows links between greater exposure to takeaway food 
outlets and the likelihood of being overweight and obese.
6.4.  To tackle this issue Lancashire County Council’s Public Health Team 
(LCCPHT) recommend restrictions are placed on new hot food takeaways. Preston currently has an adopted Local Plan policy that applies a sequential Active design6.5.   LCCPHT also recommends that active design principles are incorporated into local planning policies. Active design is about designing and adapting where we live to encourage activity in our everyday lives. It aims to ensure that when environments and places are designed, they make physical activity the easiest and most practical option in everyday life. This will increase opportunities to lead 39) How can planning impr ove health and reduce health inequalities?test to hot food takeaway proposals (meaning they are only allowed if they do not undermine the range of facilities in a shopping area/centre). It also restricts their opening hours during the daytime where they are within 400 metres of a secondary school or sixth form college. The new Local Plan could bring forward a similar policy across Central Lancashire or if there is a more suitable approach, then we would be pleased to hear your views. LCCPHT also recommend providing opportunities to grow your own food, which has many social andhealth benefits.

Living conditions

which
	
has
	
wards
	
that
	
lie
	
within
	
the

efore, we need to think about how 
existing housing stock can be improved especially in deprived areas, whilst also ensuring that new housing is suitable and good quality for all. An example of

Community Facilities6.10.
 Our existing Local Plans seek to encourage the pr
ovision of new 
community facilities, as well as the protection of existing community facilities. But, in some cases, we have found this difficult to achieve. Community facilities often close for financial viability reasons, and when that facility has been closed for a significant period of time, it can be very difficult to resist planning applications for the loss of the use. A good example of this is the loss of public houses. Statistics suggest that approximately 17 public houses shut every week across the country.
6.11.
 Some Councils have policies in their Local Plans which pr
event a 
community facility, such as a public house, from being lost, unless there is an 
appropriate alternative facility within walking distance. Another option is for communities to seek the designation of facilities as an Asset of Community Value, which is defined by regulations as a building or other land which furthers the
	
social
	
well-being
	
or
	
social
	
interests
	
of
	
the
	
local
	
community.
	
However,
	
this	
does not necessarily mean a community facility will r
emain operational. It merely 
means that the premises in which it either currently or previously operated from Employment and income6.12.   Employment and income have a considerable impact on a person’s physical and mental health. Worse health and lower life expectancy are strongly

children
	
who

The
	
Marmot	
Review highlights the importance of getting people into work to r
educe health 
inequalities, but also that jobs need to be sustainable, amongst other things. Even if people are employed if their income is low, they can still be in poverty and suffer the social exclusion and increased health risks this poses.

 Pr

Waste management sustainabilityAir qualityNatural assetsDesign and the built and historic environmentClimate Change &
Resource ManagementIssues & Options | Central Lancashire Local Plan7.1.   The government is committed to protecting and enhancing our natural, 
built and historic environment. This includes making effective use of land; helping to improve biodiversity; using natural resources prudently; minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy. 
7.2.   Our Local Plan must address the impacts of climate change and shape 
areas to improve air quality and make them enjoyable places to live and visit. This is why Central Lancashire is seeking to be carbon neutral by 2030 and reflects Preston & South Ribble Councils’ recent declaration of a Climate Emergency. The Local Plan can have a positive impact on climate change through a variety of actions, from helping people change their habits through to how we design and build areas, as well as encouraging businesses to be more sustainable.
Climate change
7.3.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have stated that:
 “It is now clear that the world has less than 11 years to switch away
 
 fr
om fossil fuels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change”.
7.4.   Therefore, it is clear that the issue of climate change is a global problem and one which planning alone cannot solve. However, the way in which we plan and build future infrastructure can help to reduce our impact. We need to reduce the carbon emissions from all forms of new development from new homes to new roads to help us achieve the Government’s target to reduce greenhouse gas
	
emissions

100%

Through

51) Is there anything else that the Local Plan can do to address Climate Change?Central Lancashire Local Plan | Issues & Options7.6.   Where Green Infrastructure is proposed, this can have multiple benefits. 
For
	
example,

reduce

urban
	
areas;

flooding
	
and	
pr
ovide opportunities for new biodiversity by using green roofs and green walls 
as part of new developments.
7.7.   An effective and relatively simple method of tackling climate change 
is tree and woodland planting. Research indicates that planting new trees is overwhelmingly more powerful than all the other climate change solutions proposed. Woodlands can help increase biodiversity; air filtration; carbon absorption and flood protection, amongst many others. Compared with an average
	
in
	
the
	
EU
	
of
	
about
	
35%

can
	
help
	
in	
exploring options for mor
e tree planting in various ways.Waste management sustainability7.8.   An important aspect of climate change management is the efficiency and sustainability of our waste management system. The Local Plan provides the opportunity to ensure waste and recycling collections remain safe and sustainable for the future. With further development proposed in the years to come, the Local Plan should reflect and respond to the increasing burden on the public sector. It should also ensure residents continue to receive an adequate service that is efficient and reduces its environmental impact where possible. It is likely more recyclable materials will have to be collected separately by Local Authorities over the coming years, and planning policy could play a role in how this can be achieved.
7.9.   The provision of waste containers to new properties is something that is 
often the responsibility of the homeowner as there is no policy requirement for developers to arrange and pay for this prior to handover.
7.10.  The Local Plan could address this issue, by encouraging developers 
to pay for and arrange, the provision and delivery of waste and recycling containers to new properties. In this way deliveries can be arranged in blocks to multiple properties on the same site in a single visit. This approach removes the onus to arrange the provision and the cost burden from the new resident. It also simplifies the delivery and removes unnecessary vehicle trips whilst reducing the overall carbon footprint.40

quality as well as providing ways of adapting to the impacts of climate change.7.26.   The Local Plan has a role to create policies which will influence how development takes place across Central Lancashire whilst ensuring that we can still protect and enhance the natural environment and recognise the potential for improvements in biodiversity through all new developments. The improvements in biodiversity will need to be measurable and new developments which impact on existing biodiversity will be expected to assess whether a measurable improvement (referred to as net gain) in biodiversity can be delivered through the proposed development, on and off site, before permission can be granted.
Design and the built and historic environment
7.27.   Central Lancashire has a rich and varied built environment, which includes landscapes, sites, structures and buried remains of significant historic and archaeological interest. Central Lancashire contains 1,397 Listed Buildings/Structures as well as a number of locally listed buildings, 14 registered parks and gardens and 27 Conservation Areas. The Local Plan will need to continue to protect these.

and
	
how
	
this
	
fits
	
into
	
the

environment is therefore an important issue for planning. If historic buildings/

8.1.	 To 	identify	our	future	development 	needs	and	growth	potential 	we	
need to establish the br

8.2.	 We
	
are

reviewing
	
how
	
much
	
land
	
we
	
need
	
for
	
new

e we should be 
considering development. Population is predicted to continue to grow across 
Central Lancashire and we need new homes for everybody. 
8.3.	 However,
	
much
	
of
	
the
	
land
	
in
	
Central
	
Lancashire
	
is
	
subject
	
to
	
a
	
variety	
of constraints, such as open space and Gr

development can go.8.4.	 National

to
	
make
	
the
	
best

the
	
land	
in their ar

benefits; maximising the use of brownfield land in settlements; supporting the 
development
	
of
	
under-utilised

and

the type and location of sites that are available, and restrictions on what can be

potential to come forward as sites for housing and economic land, by considering 
their likely availability, suitability, and achievability, as well as how identified constraints can be addressed. The purpose of the SHELAA is to provide an evidence base to inform the Local Plan, but it is important to note that it does not allocate sites to be developed.

Marmot)
	
to
	
propose	
the
	
most
	
effective
	
evidence-based
	
strategies
	
for
	
reducing
	
health
	
inequalities
	
in	
England.
National Policy:
National policy r
egarding planning sets out the Government’s planning policies 
for England and how they should be applied. This is contained in the National Planning
	
Policy
	
Framework
	
and
	
Planning
	
Practice
	
Guidance.
Natura 2000 sites:Nature protection areas which together form a network of sites in the European Union.
	
The
	
network
	
of
	
sites
	
has
	
been
	
selected
	
to
	
ensure
	
the
	
long-term
	
survival	
of Eur
ope’s most valuable and threatened species and habitats. It includes both 
areas of land and sea.
Neighbourhood Plan:
A document prepared by a local community which shapes the development and growth of their local area, and forms part of the development plan.60Issues & Options | Central Lancashire Local PlanGlossary
Neighbourhood Planning Body:
An organisation which leads neighbourhood planning in an area and can be a parish or town council, a neighbourhood forum of a community organisation.
Open Countryside:
The area outside of any settlement with a defined settlement boundary which does not fall within the Green Belt.
Preferred Options:
The second main consultation stage in the process of producing a Local Plan which sets out the preferred option for development of an area. Views will be sought on the first full draft of the Local Plan.
Previously Developed Land:
Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure. 
This excludes: land that is or was last occupied by agricultural or forestry 
buildings; land that has been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal by landfill, where provision for restoration has been made through development
	
management
	
procedures;
	
land
	
in
	
built-up
	
areas
	
such
	
as
	
residential 	
gar
dens, parks, recreation grounds and allotments; and land that was previously 
developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended into the landscape.Primary frontage:Buildings fronting a street likely to include a high proportion of retail uses, which may include food, drinks, clothing and household goods.
Primary shopping area:
Defined
	
area
	
where
	
retail
	
development
	
is
	
concentrated.
Retail Impact Assessment:An assessment of a) the impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private investment in a centre or centres in the catchment area of the proposal; and b) the impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability, including local consumer choice and trade in the town centre and the wider retail catchment (as applicable to the scale and nature of the scheme).
Safeguarded Land:
Safeguarded Land comprises areas and sites which may be required to serve development needs in the longer term, i.e. well beyond the plan period. It should be genuinely capable of development when needed.
Secondary frontage:
Buildings fronting a street, which compared to a primary frontage are likely to provide greater opportunities for a diversity of uses such as restaurants, cinemas and businesses.
Socioeconomic:
Relating to the interaction of social and economic factors.61Central Lancashire Local Plan | Issues & OptionsGlossary
Standard Method:
This is a way of calculating the minimum number of homes expected tobe planned for in an area that addresses household growth and historicunder-supply.
Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment:
An assessment of land availability which identifies a future supply of land which is suitable, available and achievable for housing and economic development uses over the plan period.
Threshold (Locally Set):
A limit applied to proposals for town centre uses, above which they wouldhave to undertake a test of their impact on town centres.
Town Centre Uses: 
Retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment and more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas,
	
restaurants,
	
drive-through
	
restaurants,
	
bars
	
and
	
pubs,
	
nightclubs, 	
casinos, health and fitness centr
es, indoor bowling centres and bingo halls); 
offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities)
Use Classes:
Land and buildings are used for a variety of purposes and these uses canbe defined into different types. The legal basis for this is set out in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes)
	
Order
	
1987,
	
which
	
has
	
been
	
amended,
	
along
	
with
	
law
	
created
	
by
	
the	
courts (known as case law).
 
Most
	
Use
	
classes
	
fall
	
into
	
4
	
main
	
classes,
	
Classes
	
A,
	
B,
	
C
	
&
	
D.
	
These
	
are
	
further	
subdivided.
	
For
	
example,
	
in
	
terms
	
of
	
business
	
and
	
industrial
	
activities
	
there	
ar

uses,
	
B2
	
general
	
industrial
	
use
	
and
	
B8
	
storage
	
or
	
distribution. 	
B1 is further subdivided into B1(a): Offices, B1(b): Pr
emises for Research and 
Development
	
and
	
B1(c):
	
Industrial
	
processes
	
which
	
“can”
	
take
	
place
	
within
	
a	
r
esidential area without damaging the “amenity of that area”. Some uses do not 
fall within these classes and are known as “sui generis”.
