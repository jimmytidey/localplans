 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
9 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 WHAT IS A LOCAL PLAN ? 
 
1.1.1  A local plan is a document which sets out planning policies and proposals 
for new development.  Local plans are prepared by the Local Planning 
Authority (LPA), which is usually the local Council. The  National  Planning  
Policy  Framework  (NPPF)  states that the pla nning system should be 
genuinely plan -led. Succinct and up -to-date plans should provide a positive 
vision for the future of each area and a framework for addressing housing 
needs and other economic, social and environmental priorities.  It is a legal 
requir ement that l ocal plans are monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure 
that they are kept up -to-date.  
 
1.1.2  The draft Local Plan sets out Gosport Borough Council’s planning strategy 
for the Borough covering the period to 2038. It identifies key proposals, 
alloca tes land for development and sets out detailed policies which the 
Borough Council will use to d etermine planning applications.  
 
1.1.3  It has been prepared under the  planning system introduced under the 
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 as amended by the Planning 
Act 2008, the Localism Act 2011 and the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 
as well as the Town and Country Planning (Local Plan) (England) 
Regulations 2012. It is produced  in accordance  with the Government ’s 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPP F) (20 21) and the Planning 
Practice Guidance (PPG). It has also considered the relevant implications of 
the Government’s South Inshore and Offshore Marine Plan (July 2018)1. 
 
1.1.4  It also  takes account of the sub -regional evidence prepared by the 
Partnership fo r South Hampshire (PfSH)2 of which Gosport Borough Council 
is a partner.  Evidence includes its Spatial Position Statement (June 2016)3 
and the emerging evidence to prepar e a new spatial strategy which will form 
the basis of a multi -lateral Statement of Common Ground.  
 
1.1.5  The Local Plan has also been informed by the work associated by the 
Solent Local Enterprise Partnership including the Gosport Infrastructure 
Investment Plan.  Other relevant strategies of note include the existing and 
emerging Local Transpor t Plan prepared by Hampshire County Council.  
 
1.2 THE LOCAL PLAN PROCES S 
 
1.2.1  This version of the Local Plan is an initial draft of the Plan (often referred to 
as the Regulation 18) and is subject to  public consultation. Once comments 
are analysed and the  relevant amendments made to the document it i s 
subject to a fu rther round of consul tation. This version is known as the 
Publication Plan (or Regulation 19 ve rsion) and is subject to a form al 6 week

3 www.push.gov.uk/work/planning -and-infrastructure/push -position -statement/   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
10 consultation  period.  Once the LPA has finished preparing and consulting on 
a local plan it must be submitted to the Secretary of State who will appoint 
an Inspector to carry out an independent E xamination  in Public (EiP) . This 
process is dealt with by the Planning Inspectorate  (PINS).  An indicative 
timetable of these stages is set out in the Council’s Local Development 
Scheme (LDS)4. 
 
1.2.2  The examination will assess whether the plan has been prepared in 
accordance with legal and procedural requirements and if it is ‘sound ’. The 
current four tests of soundness are set  out in the  NPPF.  
 
1.2.3  The Inspector will consider the evidence provided by the LPA to support the 
plan and any representations which have been put forward by local people 
and other interested parties. In most cases the examination will include 
hearing session s which are held in public. At the end of the examination the 
Inspector will send a report to the LPA recommending whether or not they 
can adopt the plan. In most cases the report will recommend some changes 
(‘modifications’) that are necessary to allow th e plan to be adopted. In 
carrying out the examination, the Inspector will be conscious of the ben efits 
of having a robust and up -to-date plan adopted as quickly as possible and 
will apply the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality.  
 
1.2.4  Despite the above established process there is currently uncertainty 
regarding the Local Plan process as i n August 2020 the Government 
published its White Paper ‘Planning for the Future’ with consultation closing 
on 29 October 2020. The proposed changes to the plannin g system are 
significant and are likely to impact how the LPA undertakes its planning 
services in the future.  In summary, the White Paper considers a number of 
wide-ranging reforms including:  
 
 A new standard method for determining housing figures for each local 
authority ; 
 A streamlined local plan system with an emphasis on zoning and 
design codes which will be prepared in 30 months and sanctions on 
those local authorities that do not meet this timetable ; 
 Removal of  the Duty to Cooperate between l ocal authorities in plan -
making ; 
 Stream lined development management  processes.  
 
1.2.5  The Council has  a number of concerns with these proposals  and has 
objected to the Planning White Paper5. However, this  Local Plan  
consultation document nonetheless takes account of the White Paper by 
identifying areas in the Borough for future growth (Regeneration Areas), 
renewal (other urban areas) and protection (countryside and urban open 
spaces).

11 1.3 KEY CONSIDERATIONS F OR THIS LOCAL PLAN  
 
1.3.1  This Local Plan has been prepared in the most unprecedented of 
circumstances with the COVID -19 global pandemic  and the acute economic 
fall-out. The Local Plan sets out policies which aim to stimulate the 
economy, safeguard community interests and encourage  it to flourish, and 
protect and enhance the environment.  
 
1.3.2  It is recognised that the community as a whole and large numbers of 
individuals have been through an extremely difficult time. Businesses have 
been significantly affected  and community services hav e been stretched to 
their limits.  
 
1.3.3  In addition to this , the new world outside of the European Union  will bring its 
own uncertainties  in both opportunities and challenges.  
 
1.3.4  This Local Plan will also need to consider some other changes that have 
occurred since the current Local Plan (2011 -2029) was adopted in 2015 
including:  
 
 The Government’s legal  requirement that the UK will be producing net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 ; 
 The Planning White Paper6 (as mentioned above) and the Devolution 
White Paper ; 
 The Government’s revision of the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPP F) and associated Planning Practic e Guidance (PPG) which has 
wide-ranging implication s on numerous issues including housing, 
employment and the environment;  
 The Government’s standard  metho d for determining local housing need 
and the associated sanctions which largely supersedes previous work 
for determining housing numbers in the Borough and wider sub -region;  
 The Government’s announcement in November 2016 of the release of 
key Ministry of D efence sites in the Borough, with the Blockhouse site 
due to be released by 2020 (now  anticipated  2023 ) and HMS Sultan by 
2026  (now at least 2029)  which will have major implications for the 
Borough;  
 Other Government announcements and initiatives such as:  
o the requirement for biodiversity net gain ; 
o new petrol and diesel cars will no longer be sold after 203 0. 
 
 The Council’s own ambitions to explore new initiatives and planning 
policies:  
o to improve the health and wellbeing of local residents;  
o to address the impacts of climate change.  
 The Government’s recent and proposed changes to permitted 
development rights which have planning policy implications.

12 1.4 WHAT DOES THE LOCAL PLAN INCLUDE?  
 
1.4.1  In the remainder of this section t he Local Plan identifies the natio nal and 
sub-regional policy context and outlines the key issues  affecting the 
Borough.  This is followed b y an overarching Vision  and a set of Objectives  
which aim to deliver the vision and address  the issues set out . The policies 
and proposals of the Local Plan are included  as follows:  
 
 Development Strategy  and Strategic Policies  (Section 2) includes 
the overall Development  Strategy which details the overall level and 
location of growth  in the Borough over the period  to 2038 . It identifies 
strategic consideration s for development proposals . This section 
includes  a suite of strategic policies relating to regeneration, strategic 
open space, climate change, ecology, flood risk, health, design, 
heritage and infrastructure . 
 
 Strategic Development Sites ( Section 3) highlights the oppo rtunities 
relating to a number key Regeneration Areas  in the Borough  including 
the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre, Daedalus, Haslar Peninsula  
including Blockhouse , HMS Sultan and Rowner.  
 
 Other Allocation Sites (Section 4) includes details of the smaller 
allocations for residential , employment and other uses outside the main 
Regeneration Areas . 
 
 General Development Policies  (Section 5 ) includes a set of detailed 
policies relating to housing, employment , community and commercial 
uses, detailed design matters, and biodiversity, open sp ace and 
environmental considerations.  
 
 Implementation and Monitoring  (Section 6) details key delivery 
mechanisms and how each policy will be monitored. It  also sets out the 
triggers for further reviews.   
 
1.4.2  The Local Plan is  supported by a series of Background  Papers7 in order to 
provide  a more detailed assessment of:  
 
 Policy considerations (national, sub -regional and local);  
 Key evidence studies; and  
 The res ults of public consultation.  
 
1.4.3  The Local Plan is supported by a Sustainability Appraisal Report7 which 
incorporates a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which is a 
current Government requirement . The Report includes a  detailed 
assessment of options considered and how each policy has  been assessed 
against a range of social, economic and environmental criteria. The Local 
Plan is also being prepared alongside the Habitats Regulations Assessment

13 (HRA)8 which is required under the EU Habitat and Bird Directives , which 
have been transposed  in UK law through the Conservation of Habitats and 
Species Regulations 2017 (often referred to as the Habitats Regulations).  
The findings of this work will inform the policies on an iterative basis and will 
be fully incorporated in the next stage of the L ocal Plan process . 
 
1.4.4  In addition the Local Plan is supported by a number of specific evidence 
studies which are includ ed on the Local Plan evidence webpage8. Further 
evidence will be added or refreshed as part of the next stage of the Local 
Plan.  
 
1.4.5  At relevant points within the Local Plan a summary of key evidence, 
together with web links, is provided  in further information boxes . Supporting 
appendices are included at the end of this document.  
 
1.4.6  A glossary  of terms used in the Local Plan  and other planning documents 
produced by the Borough Council is available online:

1.5 NATIONAL AND REGIONA L CONTEXT  
Sustainable Development  
1.5.1  The pursuit of sustainable development is at the heart of the planning 
process. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) quotes the 
United Nations General Assembly in defining what this means  at a strategic 
level:  
 
“meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs”  
 
1.5.2  The aim of the Gosport Local Plan is to translate this high level objective 
into a meaningful and positive framework at the local level to inform decision 
making for the benefit of the Borough. This relates to both strategic issues, 
such as the amount of growth proposed, how it is distributed and how the 
Borough should move towards a lower carbon society, and through to more 
detailed issues such as housing design and protecting local heritage assets.  
 
1.5.3  Achieving sustainable development will mean that decision takers must look 
at all of the elements – economic, environmental and social - of sustainable 
development in arrivi ng at decisions. In all cases a balance of 
considerations is needed and it is accepted this will often lead to a variety of 
options being expressed. For example, in Gosport there is a fundamental 
balance to be struck between delivering new housing whilst r etaining 
employment land in the long -term. All this work should be done in 
collaboration with a range of stakeholders including local people, 
businesses and site promoters.

14 National Planning Policy Framework  
1.5.4  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) w as first published by the 
Government in March 2012 and has had several iterations since, most 
recently in July 2021 . The NPPF forms national planning policy, and whilst it 
is not part of the development plan, it is a significant material consideration 
in decision -taking and plan -making. T he NPPF is supported by the website -
based Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) which sets out detailed guidance.  
 
1.5.5  The importance of a plan -led system is a central feature of the NPPF. This 
key principle is supported by the ‘presumption in favour of sustainable 
development ’ which sets out that local plans should positively seek 
opportunities to meet the development needs of their area, and be 
sufficiently flexible to adapt to rapid change. Whilst the NPPF establishes a 
number of principles to guide both decision -making and the preparation of 
local plans, such as the requirement to meet an area’s housing needs as a 
minimum requirement, it is for the Local Plan to distil this into an appropriate 
long-term strategy for the Borough an d to prepare policies to guide and 
manage development effectively.  
 
1.5.6  Many of the national policies also incorporate international agreements and 
directives including the Habitats Regulations. The Local Plan does not 
repeat national policy and instead makes cross references to it and provides 
a local perspective on the implications of national policy. The Local Plan 
also refers to best practice guides produced by other relevant organisations.  
 
1.5.7  The National Planning Policy Framework (20 21) (NPPF)9 together wit h the 
Planning Practice Guidance10 provides a strong context in which to develop 
local policies that deliver sustainable development.  
Planning in South Hampshire  
1.5.8  South Hampshire has a dense and complex settlement pattern and 
accommodates a population of just over one million people focused on the 
two port cities of Portsmouth and Southampton which is surrounded by 
areas of high landscape value and sensitive habitats (see  Plan 1 ), with the 
New Forest National Park to the west, the South Downs National Park  to the 
north, the Chichester Harbour Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to the 
east and the Solent to the south.  
 
1.5.9  Sustainable development is a cross local authority boundary issue . The  
Localism Act 2011 places a duty on local planning authorities to co -operate 
with each other in the planning of their area.  In addition there is  a 
requirement to produce a Statement of Common  Ground with neighbouring 
authorities. In South Hampshire local authorities have set up the Partnership 
                                            
9 Details of the National Plann ing Policy Framework, Circulars and government guidance are included in the 
relevant Background Paper. The NPPF is published online: www.gov.uk/guidance/national -planning -policy -

15 for South Hampshire (PfSH)11 which provides a mechanism for the Borough 
Council to meet its duty to co -operate and deliver sustainable development. 
The Partnership produced a Spatial Position Statement in 201612 and is now 
working to prepare a new sub -regional strategy to cover the period to 2038 
and beyond.  This strategy will also inform a multi -lateral Statement of 
Common Ground.  
 
1.5.10  The sub-regional strategy  provides the focus for the authorities within South 
Hampshire to work collaboratively and plan in a consistent manner across 
the sub -region. The latest strategy and supporting evidence provides a 
policy framework to inform the policies and proposals of the Gosport 
Borough Local Plan 203 8. 
 
1.5.11  The Position Statement has four  key ambitions each supported by a number 
of spatial principles (se e Box 1 ). Further details of the provisions of the 
document are included in the relevant sections of the Local Plan.

17 1.5.12  The Spatial Position Statement also inclu des a number of key principles. 
These are:  
  
 A  – Cities/Urban Areas First : Maximising development potential within 
the cities and urban areas, minimising greenfield land take; whilst 
allowing some growth in rural areas to support local  communities and 
local services.  
 
 B – Public Transport : Focus development in locations which will 
provide the opportunity for travel by sustainable modes, and which can 
help to support strategic investment in improving public transport, 
walking and cycling . 
 
 C – New or Expanded Communities : Support the delivery of a balance 
of housing sites of different sizes, in order to support overall delivery 
rates.  
 
 D – Protecting and Enhancing Countryside Gaps : Locating 
developmen t in a way which creates a high quality pattern of town and 
countryside, maintaining the distinct identity and separation of key cities 
and towns, to avoid urban sprawl.  
 
 E – Protecting the Environment : Locating development to avoid and 
protect environmental designations.  These include for example 
international and national nature conservation designations; Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Bea uty; ancient woodland; floodzones; and urban 
green spaces.DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

19 1.6 GOSPORT PROFILE AND ISSUES  
 
1.6.1  This section identifies the key economic, environmental, and social 
characteristics of Gosport Borough and highlights the key issues which the 
Local Plan needs to address.  Further  information about Gosport Borough is 
kept up -to-date online in the Gosport Profile: 
www.gosport.gov.uk/gosportprof ile 
Location and Geography  
1.6.2  Covering  over 27.6 square kilometres (10 .6 square miles  or 2,761 
hectares )13, Gosport Borough is the twelfth smallest district in England and 
the smallest in Hampshire. The Borough sits on a peninsula adjacent to 
Fareham Borough a nd is surrounded on three sides by the Solent and 
Portsmouth Harbour, with 39 kilometres (24 miles) of coastline.  
 
1.6.3  There are two main settlements, Gosport and Lee -on-the-Solent, which are 
separated by the Alver Valley. The Borough is predominantly urban in 
character, with over 80% ‘built on’14. Space is at a premium so must be used 
effectively.

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
20 Population and Households  
1.6.4  The population of the Borough in  2011 was 82,600 people15, an increase of 
8.1% from 200116. The latest estimates in 20 20 show a population of 84,679 
people17. Long -term projections show a slight increase in the population of 
0.1% by 2038; an increase of only 95 people18. The Borough is densely 
populated with almost 33 people per hectare, nine times the England 
average at 3.7.  
 
1.6.5  There are approximately 37,500 households with an average household 
size of 2.3 people. The number of households increased by 13.1% between 
2001 and 2011 . By 2038, the number of households i s projected to increase 
by 4.4%; at the same time household size is  projected to decrease to 2.14 
people19. 
 
1.6.6  The population is ageing due largely to longer life expectanc y. The 
proportion of the population over 65 is projected to increase from 2 1% in 
2021 to 28 .5% in 203 818, this represents nearly  6,200 additional over 65s. 
The proportion living beyond 85 is projected  to increase  from 2.8% in 2021 
to 4.6% in 2038. At the same time the number aged under 16 is projected  to 
decrease from 1 9.3% in 202 1 to 16.8% in 203 8. The working age population 
(16-64) is projected to decrease from 61% in 202 1 to 55.7% in 203 8, 
representing a reduction of 4, 500 people.  
Economy and Employment  
1.6.7  Gosport’s legacy as a support base for the Royal Navy is evidenced by the 
naval heritage across the Borough. The decline of the military around 
Portsmouth  Harbour has led to a significant supply of brownfield land and 
each site has a mix of issues includin g contamination, historic buildings, and 
flood risk.  
 
1.6.8  There are approximately 27,000 jobs in Gosport Borough which has 
declined by 18% from 33,000 jobs in 2000, although an increase from 
24,000 jobs in 2012. In the Solent region, Gosport with a jobs densit y of 
0.52 stands out as recording the lowest jobs density in the Solent and South 
East England which falls significantly below the Solent LEP (0.80), but also 
ranks as the 13th lowest jobs density of all local authority areas in the UK20. 
Many of the Boroug hs residents now work in different locations. In 2011, 
52% of residents commuted outside the Borough for work, particularly along 
the A27 -M27 corridor in areas where the journey to work is predominantly 
by private car.

trainees and HM Forces (from MoD). A jobs density of 1.0 would mean there is one job for every resident aged 
16-64. DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
21 Transport  
1.6.9  Access to the peninsula is  via three road routes (the A32, Newgate Lane 
and Stubbington Lane) and a Bus Rapid Transit route. Gosport Town Centre 
is around 11km (7 miles) from the nearest motorway junction (J11 M27) with 
the northern extent of the Borough being 3km (2 miles) away. D espite road 
and transport improvements many people continue to travel out of the 
Borough for work by private car. Reducing out -commuting, congestion and 
car usage therefore remain key issues. Gosport is linked to Portsmouth and 
Portsmouth Harbour railway s tation by the Gosport Ferry. There is no 
railway station within Gosport Borough making it one of the largest towns in 
England with no rail service.  
Housing  
1.6.10  The need to provide sufficient housing that is affordable and well -designed 
is a vital matter for this plan.  In the year ending 2020, the median house 
price was £210,000 and the average house cost 6.64 times the average 
annual income21. However, this remains below the England average of 
£249,000 and South East average of £327,500, making the Borough a 
relatively affordable place to live compared to other parts of the region. The 
Borough is characterised by smaller properties with 59.6% comprising 
terraced housing or flats.  
 
1.6.11  Before the 2007 -08 economic downturn, there was a high number of 
housing completi ons in the Borough which outpaced housing requirements. 
Between 1996 and 2020 over 5,500 homes were built, many on previously 
developed land. Between 1996 and 2011 there was an average of 292 
dwellings completed every year. Over the past decade, the number  of new 
housing completions has reduced, largely due to wider national economic 
trends and the type of development land and its availability. Since 2011, an 
average of 130 dwellings were completed every year.  
Health and Wellbeing  
1.6.12  The Borough has a lower li fe expectancy compared to the Hampshire 
average. The average male lives 79.3 years and the average female 83.2 
years. There are five wards in the Borough which have areas within the top 
20% of areas in England experiencing health deprivation. 6 8.2% of adul ts 
(over 18) are classified as overweight or obese, significantly more than the 
Hampshire and national average. Recent stati stics show the Borough has 
the highest proportion of people who are classified as overweight or obese 
in the whole of Hampshire. The  prevalence of obesity in year 6 pupils is 
20.2%, in line with the national average, but 3rd highest out of the 
Hampshire districts.

22 Infrastructure and Facilities  
1.6.13  Good infrastructure to serve residents and meet the requirements of new 
development is vital ly important to delivering a sustainable community. This 
includes transport infrastructure, flood defences, community facilities such 
as health and education as well as improved leisure and cultural facilities.  
 
1.6.14  The Borough ’s centres provide a focus for many facilities and these must 
remain vibrant and viable. Gosport Town Centre is the princip al centre and 
there are two district centres at Lee -on-the-Solent and Stoke Road and 22 
smaller centres in the Borough’s neighbourhood s. The Plan aims  to promote 
diversity beyond retail and leisure to draw in people  to the centres . 
 
1.6.15  The enhancement of leisure and cultural facilities is an area where the Local 
Plan can deliver improvements. This includes protecting facilities such as 
Gosp ort Leisure Park and community halls, and ensuring developments 
deliver new spaces for residents and visitors. Gosport Borough has a good 
provision of museums and heritage facilities which offer an opportunity to 
explore  the Borough’s history, these includ e the Explosion Museum, the 
Submarine Museum, and the Gosport Discovery Centre.  
Flood Risk and Coastal  Erosion  
1.6.16  Gosport Borough faces significant flood risk from a variety of sources. A 
total of 363 hectares of land is within Flood Zones 2 and 3 representin g 14% 
of the total land area. Flood risk and the impacts of climate change are 
considered throughout the Plan, particularly given the predicted increases in 
the frequency and intensity of storms which will have implications for the 
Borough’s coastal defenc es. 
Quality  of the Environment  
1.6.17  Despite being densely developed the Borough benefits from attractive open 
spaces. The Alver Valley and Stokes Bay form the green heart of the 
Borough for residents and visitors alike. The seafront at Lee -on-the-Solent 
provide s an uninterrupted view across the Solent to the Isle of Wight.  
 
1.6.18  Gosport has a diverse range of biodiversity and geological assets which 
include internationally important Special Protection Areas (SPAs), Special 
Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Ramsar site s; nationally important Sites 
of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs); as well as locally important Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs). Gosport is an important 
location for feeding and roosting Brent Geese and wading birds.  
 
1.6.19  The quality of Gosport’s environment is reflected in its built heritage which 
relates closely to its naval and maritime associations. Key elements include 
a string of forts and other fortifications (such as Fort Blockhouse); buildings 
associated with supplying, supportin g and training the Royal Navy (such as 
Priddy’s Hard, Royal Clarence Yard and Daedalus); as well as the former 
military hospital on the Haslar peninsula. The Borough has 17 conservation 
areas covering 260 hectares of land , two Areas of Special Character,  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
23 approximately 540 Listed Buildings, and 13  Scheduled Ancient Monuments, 
two Listed  Parks and Gardens as well as many locally significant heritage 
assets .

  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
24 1.7 KEY ISSUES  
 
The Borough needs to adapt to, and mitigate the impacts of climate change and 
contribute to the national requirement of net zero carbon by 2050.  
 
Growth is constrained by the peninsula location and amount of land in active military 
use. Large areas, previously used by the MoD, require significant investment and are 
more complex to redevelop.  
 
The Borough has the lowest number of jobs for its population out of all its neighbours 
in the Solent, falling significantly below the South East and UK averages. This results 
in high levels of out -commuting by private car and significant traffic congestion.  
 
A substantial number of new homes are required. Housing can be too expensive for 
residents; these new homes need to suit their requirements and be designed to a 
high standard.  
 
New development and existing communities need the infrastructure required to make 
sure the people who live and work in the Borough can en joy their lives.  
 
The natural environment and diverse range of habitats and species need protection 
from the pressures of new development as well as  biodiversity enhance ments  so 
they can continue to be enjoyed by all.  
 
The rich historic built environment risks b eing eroded through insensitive 
development which fails to promote local distinctiveness.  It is therefore necessary to 
find suitable uses which preseves and enhances the significance of historic buildings 
and their setting.  
 
The Boroug h’s centres face significant competition from neighbouring areas and 
online shopping. They also risk becoming less attractive destinations.  
 
The low -lying geography and coastal location leave s the Borough vulnerable to flood 
risk. Flood defences and adap tation measures need to protect existing and new 
communities.  
 
Some residents have poorer health and experience greater inequalities than much of 
the region. The ability for people to have good health and wellbeing needs to be 
facilitated as far as possi ble. 
 
The needs of all ages of the population are changing. An ageing population means 
residents will require different services and facilities. At the same time, opportunities 
for young people and future generations need to be maximised.

1.8 A VISION OF GOSPORT IN 2038  
 
A sustainable and healthy environment, adapting well and  
mitigating the impacts of climate change  
 
 Gosport will be a Borough that continues to thrive in responding to significant 
social, environmental and economic challenges. The Borough will continue to 
be a great place to live and its people will remain its greatest asset, they will be 
healthier and l ive in a cleaner and greener environment. The overall aim of the 
Local Plan is to improve the quality of life for all residents.  
 
 Growth will not be at the expense of our environment. Development will 
enhance the environment and achieve a net gain in biod iversity. The planting 
of trees will boost biodiversity and internationally and nationally designated 
sites will be suitably protected and enhanced.  
 
 Proposals involving both new and existing buildings shall demonstrate how 
they have been designed to adapt  to and mitigate the impacts of climate 
change and flood risk. The Borough will be more energy and water efficient 
and use resources in a sustainable way. By 2050, we will reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions to ‘net -zero’, ending our contribution to global war ming.  
 
An enhanced sense of place and high quality  regenerated sites  
 Gosport will be regenerated by capitalising on its coastal location and unique 
heritage assets. Land historically used by the military will be reintegrated into 
the wider form and fabric of the Borough with new uses, routes and facilities. 
Historic naval and maritime  heritage assets will find new roles and be protected 
from inappropriate development.  
 
 Gosport Waterfront and the Haslar Peninsula will aim to be a world -class locale 
for marine industries and sailing, and be redeveloped to provide new mixed -
use neighbourhoods and marine employment.  
 
 The Town Centre will adapt to the changing needs of both residents and 
visitors and will  have a wider range of commercial and community uses a nd 
become more accessible to support its future prosperity. Daedalus , the Haslar 
Peninsula  and Rowner will continue their long -term regeneration to provide 
new employment, homes and facilities. The Alver Valley Country Park will 
continue to offer a country side haven for local residents and visitors and be 
enhanced with improved facilities and routes.  
 
A successful place where people choose to live and work  
 Gosport’s profile and reputation as a successful and attractive place to live and 
work will be enhanced. Waterfront living, superb beaches and easy access to 
high quality  open spaces will continue to afford people the benefits of a 
healthier life on their doorstep.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
26  Improvements in our built environment will improve our quality of life. The 
priorities are to provide new employment opportunities, with mixed -use 
neighbourhoods that provide new sustainable market and affordable homes 
and to improve accessibili ty. 
 
 Growth in the right kind of housing is a priority. The provision of new market 
and affordable homes will be focused on making the best possible use of 
previously developed land. New homes will be well-designed , come in a variety 
of sizes and forms, an d be built to nationally recognised standards.  
 
An economy making the most of its coastal location  
 The Borough’s economy will be strengthened and diversified in key sectors 
including marine engineering and tourism. Gosport will be an attractive location 
to set up, relocate and grow a business. The Borough will become a hub for 
marine and maritime activity, exploiting our unique natural geography and 
proximity to the Solent and Portsmouth Harbour.    
 
 We will have a larger employment base and broader range of  job opportunities 
for local residents and there will be a more balanced mix between working 
residents and jobs with less people having to out -commute. People will also 
have the skills that allow them to take advantage of the range of opportunities 
availab le. 
 
Reduced out -commuting and sustainable ways of getting around  
 Improvements to strategic infrastructure will open up access to the peninsula 
from public transport and the major road network.  
 
 Local connectivity will be improved and it will be easier to move around the 
Borough, particularly by walking, cycling and public transport. More of our 
coastline and waterfront spaces will be accessible.  
 
 The move away from petrol and diesel cars towards more efficient electric and 
other ultra -low emission vehicles  will be made easier by more charging points. 
The Bus Rapid Transit will be extended and will serve more of the Gosport 
Peninsula, reducing the need to travel by car.

2.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1.1  This section sets out the strategic policies which will help deliver the vision 
and objectives of the Local Plan.  The Borough will use these strategic 
policies to make decisions on all planning applications.  The section is 
organised  as follows:   
 
 Policy D1: Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change  – Given that 
climate change is the overriding challenge affecting all planning 
decisions over the plan period  and beyond , it is considered that this 
needs to be the overarching strategic policy which informs the rest of 
the document including the overall deve lopment strategy . 
 
 Policy D2: Development Strategy covers the overall approach to 
development in the Borough including key locational and land use 
considerations , and the quantum of development. This aim  is to 
deliver regeneration  within  the Borough by del ivering economic 
growth and meeting housing need s whilst protecting  the quality of the 
environment.  
 
2.1.2  Policies D3 to D12 are arranged around the following  strategic themes:  
 
 Urban Regeneration  Areas (D3) 
 Green Infrastructure Network  (D4) 
 The Local Ecological Network and Internationally and Nationally 
Important Sites (D5) 
 Gosport Strategic Open Spaces  (D6) 
 Flood Risk and Coastal Erosion (D7)  
 Health y Communities ( D8) 
 Design (D9) 
 Heritage Assets  (D10) 
 Securing  Infrastructure (D11) 
 Accessibili ty to New Development  (D12)

30 2.2 POLICY D1: ADAPTATIO N AND MITIGATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  
Introduction  
2.2.1  Climate change is the long -term shift in average weather patterns across the 
world. Since the mid -1800s humans have contributed to the relea se of 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which help to trap heat in the 
Earth’s atmosphere. This causes global temperatures to rise, resulting in 
long-term changes to the climate22. 
 
POLICY D1: ADAPTATIO N AND MITIGATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
1. The Boroug h Council is committed to achieving net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 and supporting the wider community in 
reaching this target through land use decisions. This overarching 
strategic objective will be delivered through the  following themes 
and policies:  
 
a) Promoting a sustainable pattern of development by d irecting  
growth  towards locations that reduce the need to travel and 
maximise the ability to make trips by sustainable modes of 
transport (Policies D2: Development Strategy, D3: Urban 
Regeneration  Areas  and D12: Accessibility  to New 
Development)  
 
b) Delivering higher densities of development on the most 
accessible sites (D3: Urban Regeneration  Areas  and H1: 
Sustainable Residential Neighbourhoods)  
 
c) Promoting sustainable design and construction methods in the 
built environment (Policy DE1: Sustainable Construction)  
 
d) Addressing flood risk and promoting sustainab le water 
management (Policy D7 : Flood Risk and Coastal Erosion  and 
LE13: Water Resources ) 
 
e) Enhancing green infrastructure and biodiversity (Policies D5 : 
The Local Ecological Network and Internationally and 
Nationally Important Sites and LE8: Securing Measureable 
Biodiversity Net Gain  and other nature conservation policies 
LE5-LE7)  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D1  
2.2.2  There is clear evidence to show that climate change is happening, with the 
average temperature of the Earth’s surface having risen by around 1oC 
since the pre -industrial period when large amounts of greenhouses gases 
began to be emitted. This increase in greenhouse gases is almost entirely 
                                            
22 www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate -change/what -is-climate -change   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
31 due to hum an activity, with the main sources being the burning of fossil 
fuels, agricultural and deforestation, and the manufacturing of products.23 
 
2.2.3  Climate change is likely to have many impacts upon the built environment 
including increasing the risk of overheating  and flooding. As a coastal town, 
this is of particular concern to Gosport. The UK Climate Change Risk 
Assessment 201724 provides a full list of the climate risks for the country, 
while the UK Climate Projections25 show  how the climate is likely to change . 
 
2.2.4  By reducing carbon emissions, the likely impacts of climate change can be 
lessened. Measures can also be taken to adapt to the likely impacts. The 
Climate Change Act 2008  (as amended 2019) legally  commits the UK to 
reduce its carbon emissions to net zero l evels by 2050, when compared to a 
1990 baseline. To achieve this it will require significant effort from all levels 
of government, communities, businesses and individuals.  
 
2.2.5  According to Government data, carbon dioxide emissions in Gosport have 
reduced by 45% between 2005 and 2019, from 368 ktCO 2eq to 202 
ktCO 2eq26. When considering the emissions covered by this data, Gosport's 
emissions as of 2019 are the lowest per capita in Hampshire and less than 
the majority of local authorities across the UK. This is a  strong starting 
position but is mostly the result of national policies, while eliminating the 
remaining emissions will require a concerted effort across the Borough, 
including from new developments.  
 
2.2.6  The Council is committed to reducing its own emissions to net zero by 2050 
or sooner, and assisting the wider community in reaching the same target. 
In February 2 020 the Council adopted its Climate Change Strategy 2020 -
2023 to show how this target will be achieved27. The strategy identified the 
following areas of focus which relate to the planning system:  
 
 promoting sustainable communities and low carbon lifestyles;  
 reducing flood risk and securing resilience to climate change;  
 encouraging higher environmental standards ; and  
 increasing green infrastructure and i mproving biodiversity.  
 
2.2.7  These objectives are addressed through this Climate Change policy and 
multiple other policies within this Local Plan  (including Policies D2, D3, D4, 
D5, D6, D7, D12, H1, DE1, LE8).

32 Directing development towards locations that redu ce the need to travel 
and maximise the ability to make trips by sustainable modes of 
transport (Point 1a of Policy D1)  
2.2.8  One of the core principles of sustainable development is ensuring that 
development is directed towards locations where the need for trave l is 
reduced. Given the compact nature of the Borough many locations within 
Gosport are accessible however it is important to ensure that balanced 
communities develop with a range of jobs, services and facilities, with the 
appropriate level of infrastruct ure to serve them. Policies D2: Development 
Strategy and D3 : Urban Regeneration  Areas  provide further guidance on 
selecting sustainable locations for development.  
 
2.2.9  Where travel is required, development should be designed to maximise 
sustainable modes of tra nsport; primarily walking and cycling, followed by 
public transport and car pools. Where travel by personal vehicles is 
required, the provision of electric charging points will help to ensure that 
emissions are lowered. Further deta ils can be found in Poli cies D11: 
Securing Infrastructure and D12 : Access ibility  to New Development.  
Delivering higher densities of development on the most accessible 
sites (Point 1b of Policy D1)  
2.2.10  With the scarce land resources in the Borough, it is important to make 
efficient an d effective  use of development sites to meet the significant need 
for new housing. Developing at higher densities in accessible locations will 
help create sustainable communities by reducing the need for travel and 
making local shops and services more viab le. 
 
2.2.11  Suitable areas for higher density development include the Town Centre and 
Waterfront locations and other r egeneration areas. Policies H1: Sustainable 
Residential Neighbourhoods  and D3: Urban Regeneration  Areas  provide 
further guidance on suitable development densities.  
Promoting sustainable design and construction methods in the built 
environment (Point 1c of Policy D1)  
2.2.12  The built environment contributes around 40% of the UK's carbon 
emissions28. Of this, approxi mately half of this is energy used in buildings, 
while around 3% is from the construction industry itself. In order to reach UK 
goals for the reduction of carbon emissions, and other environmental targets 
such as enhanced water efficiency, sustainable desi gn and construction 
methods will be required from a ll developments. Policy DE1: Sustainable 
Construction  provides guidance on how developments can achieve this.  
Addressing flood risk and promoting sustainable water management 
(Point 1d of Policy D1)  
2.2.13  As a c oastal town, the Borough faces significant flood risks which are likely 
to increase with climate change. Under Policy D 7: Flood Risk and Coastal 
                                            
28 www.ukgbc.org/climate -change    DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
33 Erosion developments are required to assess any potential flood risks, 
including future predictions, and provid e suitable mitigation measures.  
 
2.2.14  Amongst other measures this requires development to follow the sequential 
approach for site selection, ensuring that sewer and drainage infrastructure 
will be resilient, and incorporating Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), 
where appropriate.  
Enhancing green infrastructure and biodiversity  (Point 1e of Policy D1)  
2.2.15  Green infrastructure provides many multifunctional benefits including 
recreation and wellbeing opportunities, improved air, water and soil quality, 
and flood  and climate change mitigation. The planting of trees for example 
can help lock carbon, reducing levels within the atmosphere, while also 
providing increased shading to help regulate local temperature.  
 
2.2.16  In addition, green infrastructure can deliver biodive rsity benefits, including 
helping wildlife adapt to a changing climate. The Government’s 25 Year 
Environment Plan has a goal for the planning system to enhance and 
increase the provision of green infrastructure and help address falling 
wildlife levels, inc luding through development providing biodiversity net 
gains29. Further guidance can be found within Policies D5 : The Local 
Ecological Network  and Internationally and Nationally Important Sites  and 
LE8: Securing Measureable Biodiversity Net Gain  as well as o ther 
environmental policies within this Local Plan.

34 2.3 POLICY D2: DEVELOPME NT STRATEGY  
Introduction  
2.3.1  The Development  Strategy aims to deliver the overarching vision and 
objectives of the Local Plan (see Section 1.0) and  sets out the scale of 
development that is appropriate and sustainable for the Borough over the 
plan period to 203 8. It has been prepared having regard to the core planning 
principles set out in the Nat ional Planni ng Policy Framework 2021  (NPPF) . 
 
2.3.2  The Deve lopment Strategy provides an over arching framework for the more 
detailed policies of the Local Plan and establishes how much development 
should take place and where it should be located.  It outlines opportunities 
for development through the identification of three Urban Regeneration 
Areas and other key locations as well as establishing the principle that 
certain sites should be safeguarded for existing uses. This  is set out in the 
Key Diagram  (Plan 3) . 
 
2.3.3  The ‘how much development?’ aspect of the Development  Strategy is the 
result of significant collaborative work with the other  Partnership for South 
Hampshire ( PfSH ) local authorities  in the South Hampshire sub -region  and 
the Council’s own evidence studies . The Development  Strategy aims to 
ensure that local ec onomic, housing and community needs are addressed 
whilst fully taking account of environmental and design considerations. It 
recognises the general presumption in fa vour of sustainable development 
set out in the NPPF.  
 
2.3.4  The ‘where to locate development?’ part of the Development  Strategy has 
been largely determined by the availability of brownfield sites in the 
Borough, primarily as a result of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) legacy. The 
Borough Council considers that the id entified Regeneration Areas should be 
redeveloped to stimulate the local  economy and provide new homes.  
 
2.3.5  The Development  Strategy also sets out the locations where there is a 
presumption against development in order to protect the Borough’s precious 
natura l assets. The policy presumes against development outside of the 
urban area and promotes the use of sustainable brownfield land, which are 
generally of lesser environmental value. Key elements of the strategy are 
shown in  Plan 3 : Key Diagram for Gosport Bo rough . 
 
2.3.6  The Development Strategy is then followed by a series of strategic policies, 
in accordance with the N PPF, which outlines the Council’s  overarching 
approach to key issues including urban regeneration, strategic open spaces, 
climate change, the Local Ecological Network , flood risk, healthy 
communities, design, heritage and infrastructure.DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

36 POLICY D 2: DEVELOPMENT  STRATEGY  
 
1.  The Local Plan will make provision for the following over the period 
2021-2038: 
Employment:  90,000 sq.m. net additional floorspace30 
Housing:  3,500 net additional dwellings  
Town Centre 
Uses:   Reorganisation and development of town centre 
uses within existing Town Centres to enable the 
successful regeneration of sites  
 No additional retail floorspace required out of 
centre  
 
2. Development proposals will be permitted within the urban area (as 
defined on the Policies Map) provided that it accords with other 
policies in the Local Plan.   
 
3.  Brownfield land within the urban area of the Borough will be the 
priority for new development. New mixed -use development will be 
focused  within the following Regeneration Areas  in line with Policy 
D3: Urban Regeneration Areas:  
 
a) Harbour Regeneration Area  
b) Rowner and HMS Sultan Regeneration Area  
c) Daedalus Regeneration Area  
 
4. Other development allocations are detailed in the following policies 
and shown on the Policies Map:  
 
a) Policy A1: Enabling Allocations  
b) Policy A2: Housing  
b) Policy A3: Employment  
c) Policy A 4: Leisure, Community Uses and Open Spaces  
d) Policy A 5: Allotments  
e) Policy A6: Safeguarded Land for Transport Improvements  
 
5. The Borough Council will protect, and seek opportunities to 
enhance designated employment sites  for continued commercial 
use, community facilities and open spaces.   
 
6. Development will protect and take opportunities to enhance the 
Local Ecological Network and development likely to have an 
individual or cumulative adverse impact on internationally 
important habitats will not be permitted unless the necessary 
avoidance or mitigation measures have been secured  in line with 
Policy D5 : The Local Ecological Network  and Internationally and 
Nationally Important Sites .

37  
7. Development proposals which affect heritage assets will need to 
conserve, and where possible enhance them in a m anner 
appropriate to their significance  in line with Policy D10: Heritage 
Assets . 
 
8. Areas outside of the urban area will be safeguarded from 
development unless they are for appropriate recreational uses or 
development essential to the operational requirements of public 
and other essential services. Such exceptions will need to accord 
with Policy D 9: Design.  
 
9. The character and function of the Strategic Gap (as shown on the 
Policies Map) between Fareham, Gosport, Lee -on-the-Solent and 
Stubbington  will be preserved.  
 
10. The Alver Valley , Browndown , Lee Beach and Clifflands, and Stokes 
Bay area is identified as Strategic Open Space  in line with Policy 
D6: Gosport Strategic Open Spaces  for Green Infrastructur e and 
includes a Country Park.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D2 
Overall  Strategy  
2.3.7  The Development  Strategy is based on the PUSH (now PfSH) Spatial 
Position Statement (June 2016) and emerging evidence for the latest sub -
regional plan.  This places significant emphasis on the need to increase the 
economic performance of the sub -region31 by increasing jobs and 
productivity  as well as overall job density which is the lowest in South East 
England and one of the lowest in the country . This Statement closely 
matches the strategic needs of this Borough. Th is requires that sufficient 
land is made available for business premises and homes which need to be 
supported by the necessary transport infrastructure, services and 
community facilities.  
 
2.3.8  Deliverable options relating to the broad location of development a re limited 
in the Borough due to its small size and the built -up nature of the Borough 
as well as significant environmental considerations including internationally 
and nationally important habitats and areas identified as being subject to 
flood risk . Howe ver there are significant opportunities for the development of 
brownfield land within the Borough which can contribute to its regeneration.  
 
2.3.9  There is a need to provide more jobs  and training opportunities  in the 
Borough in order to provide a balanced commu nity and tackle deprivation, 
health inequalities, out -commuting and congestion issues. As such, 
employment land is a key element of the Borough’s Development  Strategy. 
                                            
31 South Hampshire includes the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton, and the districts of Eastleigh, East 
Hampshire (part), Fareham, Gosport, Havant, New Forest (part), Test Valley (part) and Winchester (part).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
38 The employment land will be required to offer a range of premises to meet a 
variety of b usiness needs including existing clusters such as advanced 
manufacturing and marine industries as well as emerging sectors including 
those linked to the green recovery following the economic and social 
consequences of the  COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
2.3.10  Brownfield sites will also be required to deliver sufficient housing to meet as 
far as possible the housing figure  identified by the Government’s standard 
method. This needs to be balanced with the need to provide sufficient land 
for employment and commerc ial floorspace, open space and community 
facilities to ensure that Gosport becomes more of a sustainable Borough. It 
will necessary to protect and enhance the quality of the local environment to 
ensure the Borough remains a place where people wish to live,  work and 
invest.  
 
2.3.11  In order to assist the deliver y of the Development  Strategy , three Urban 
Regeneration  Areas  (URAs)  have been identified, as shown on the Key 
Diagram, which will be integral for delivering the overall strategy. Within the 
URA’s are  Strate gic D evelopment Sites which are largely brownfield sites 
and they will play a major role in regenerating the Borough providing a 
range of uses. The detailed boundaries of these sites are shown on the 
Policies Map and further guidance is given in the overar ching Urban 
Regeneration Areas policy with supporting Strategic Development Site 
policies ( SDS) (see Policy D 3 and S S1-11). 
 
2.3.12  In addition Policy D 6: Gosport Strategic Open Spaces  sets out the Council’s 
policy in protecting and enhancing the strategic open spaces of the Alver 
Valley, Stokes Bay and Browndown.  
Quantum o f Development (Point 1 of Policy  D2) 
2.3.13  Employment:  The Council’s employment floorspace figure has been 
informed by th e Economic Development Needs Assessment and 
Employment Land Avai lability Assessment (EDNA/ELAA) (BE Group , 2019) 
commissioned by GBC to cover Gosport Borough and the Economic, 
Employment and Commercial Needs Study (Stantec/Vail Williams March 
2021) commiss ioned by PfSH covering the South Hampshire sub -region . 
 
2.3.14  During recent years  there have been unprecedented changes and 
challenges facing the British economy including the United Kingdom leaving 
the European Union and the economic shock associated with the COVID -19 
pandemic. This is likely to result in some unforeseen structural changes to 
the overall economy and consequently it is extremely difficult to forecast 
floorspace requirements over the next 15 -20 years and recognising that 
such forecasting can be c hallenging even  during  less volatile times. 
Consequently it will be important to review this work as trends become 
clearer. In the meantime there are a number of principles that remain 
applicable and form the basis for the overall planning strategy for the  area. 
The principles for determining the quantum of employment floorspace in the 
Borough are set out below:  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
39  
 Maximise available employment floorspace in the Borough to increase 
job density;  
 Consider the aspirational but realistic assessment of employment 
floorspace capacity in the Borough taking into account site availability 
and suitability;  
 Supplement this assessment with a reality check based on past trends 
and the latest economic forecasting ;  
 Recognise that these figures will be refreshed within five years as part 
of the next Local Plan review, and that these will have the benefit of 
understanding the full implications of COVID -19 and Brexit.  
 
2.3.15  Taking into account the overriding need to provide new employment 
opportunities in the Borough due the low employment density (one of the 
lowest in England and the lowest in the South East) with implications for out -
commuting, congestion and air pollution, it is necessary to consider 
maximising employment opportunities on available and suitable sites.  There 
is also need to consider using sites which will prove attractive for 
employment investment.  In Gosport given its cluster of maritime businesses 
and significant locational advantages for this sector there are a number of 
opportunities to utilise coastal sites with deep water access for marine 
employment  which is reflected in the Gosport Waterfront Strategic 
Development Site.  
 
2.3.16  Based on the Council’s evidence it is considered that a minimum of 90,000 
sq.m.  of employment floorspace in office and light industry (Us e class E(g)), 
general industry (B2) and/or storage and warehousing (B8) is an appropriate 
level of floorspace for the Borough over the Plan period taking into account 
the capacity on sites that can deliver new employment floorspace.  
 
2.3.17  For the purposes of t his policy the figure relates to E(g), B2 and B8 
floorspace32, although the Borough Council recognises the importance of 
providing other types of floorspace for employment uses (see also Policy 
E1: Employment Land). If opportunities arise for additional net  employment 
floorspace they should be taken in order to maximise the economic 
regeneration of Gosport and the wider sub -region.  
 
2.3.18  The Borough Council has identified  almost  85,000 sq.m.  of net additional 
employment floorspace (see Table 1) from a variety of sources including 
existing permissions, unused land within existing employment sites and 
proposed allocations.   
                                            
32 B1 includes offices, research and developmen t, and light industrial, B2 is general industrial and B8 is 
warehousing (in accordance with the Use Classes Order).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

41 2.3.19  In additional to the supply identified above it is very important to 
acknowledge the role of the HMS Sultan site (Policy SS10) which is the 
largest existing employment site in the Borough in terms of both numbers 
employed and in overall area. In November 2 016 the Government in its 
document ‘A Better Defence Estate’35 announced that it intended to release 
the HMS Sultan site in 2026. In February 2018 the Government made a 
further announcement36 stating that this release would take place no earlier 
than 2029. G iven the considerable uncertainty over the release of HMS 
Sultan and therefore the significant doubt over the deliverability of any re -
use of the land for employment during the Plan period the Council has 
proposed to maintain the position it held in the Go sport Borough Local Plan 
2011 -2029.  Consequently most of the western  HMS Sultan site has been 
identified as an employment priority site in order to ensure that if the site is 
released by the MoD it retains its role as a major employment site in the 
Borough . If in the meantime a firm timetable is reached on the release of the 
HMS Sultan site then this would trigger a partial review of the Local Plan.  
 
2.3.20  The Council will continue to lobby that the Base is retained as a major 
training base and will continue to e ncourage further training and 
employment opportunities for m ilitary personnel and civilians at HMS Sultan 
including the potential for additional civilian companies to utilise the site. As 
part of the Borough’s Heritage Action Zone status (see Box 12) the C ouncil, 
Historic England and the Base have been collaborating on a project to 
facilitate the re -use of  Fort Rowner  within the  HMS Sultan  site as a hi-tech 
employment site. At this stage there are a number of issues to resolve and 
therefore it hasn’t been i ncluded as part of the supply at this stage.  
 
2.3.21  The loss of Sultan would have a significant impact on the Gosport economy 
and consequently radical action, by both national and local agencies, would 
be required to deal with the aftermath . This could include  the designation of 
a new E nterprise Zone at the site to encourage significan t business 
investment at Sultan,  build ing upon the success of the Daedalus Enterprise 
Zone. Due to the importance of the HMS Sultan site for employment and the 
need to maintain an d increase employment density it will be necessary to 
retain a significant proportion of the site for employment generating uses. 
Further detail is included in Policy SS10 relating to HMS Sultan Strategic 
Development Site.  
 
2.3.22  It will also be important that o ther existing employment sites are 
safeguarded and where possible refurbished/redeveloped to meet modern 
business needs. Policy E1: Employment Land provides further details 
regarding such employment sites.

42 2.3.23  Housing:  The NPPF is clear that  to support the Go vernment’s objective of 
significantly boosting the supply of homes,  local planning authorities need to 
ensure that  local plans allow for a sufficient amount and variety of land to 
come forward where it is needed. To determine the minimum number of 
homes ne eded, the NPPF requires that strategic policies should be informed 
by a local housing need assessment, conducted using the standard method 
in national planning guidance – unless exceptional circumstances  justify an 
alternative approach which also reflects current and future demographic 
trends and market signals.  The NPPF  (2021 ) introduces the standard 
method for calculating the housing requirement for each local authority area.  
 
2.3.24  The standard method uses a formula to identify the minimum number of 
homes the Government expects to be planned for. The Government’s latest 
standard method for determining  Gosport Borough’s local housing 
requirement  is set out in Box 2 and highlights that the local housing 
requirement  is 5,576 homes between 2021  and 2038 which works out at 
328 homes every year.  The method  requires local authorities to use the 
2014 household projections rather than t he 2018 household projections.  
 
BOX 2: Government’s standard method for assessing local housing 
need  
Step 1 – Setting the baseline  
The Government requires local authorities to use national household growth 
projections (2014 -based) for the local authority  area to set the ‘baseline’. 
Using these projections, the projected average annual household growth 
over a 10 year period is calculated.  
2021: 38,397 households     2031: 41,216 households  
Growth: 2,819 households  
Average over 10 years: 281.9  
Step 2 – An adjustment to take account of affordability  
To take account of the affordability of homes in the area, the standard 
method makes an adjustment to the average annual projected household 
growth (as calculated in step 1). The most recent workplace -based 
affordability ratio is used. These ratios are calculated using house prices 
and workplace -based earnings.  
The precise formula is:  
 
The adjustment calculation uses the following figures:  
Gosport median house price: £2 10,000 (year ending Sep 20 20) 
Gosport median gross annual earnings (workplace -based): £ 31,639  (2020) 
Ratio: 6.64  
DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
43 The adjustment factor calculation is:  
((6.64 -4)/4) x 0.25 + 1 = 1.165 
 
Step 3 – Capping the level of any increase  
A cap can be applied which limits the increases in housing a local authority 
can face. This does not apply to Gosport Borough as the current Local Plan 
was adopted more than five years ago.  
Step 4 – cities and urban centres uplift  
A 35% uplift is applied for those urban local authorities in the top 20 cities 
and u rban centres list. This includes Southampton which is in the PfSH 
region. This does not apply to Gosport Borough.  
The local housing need for Gosport Borough  
The local housing need calculation is:  
Local housing need  = adjustment factor x projected household growth  
1.165 x 281.9 = 328.41  
Local housing need  = 328 dwellings per annum (5, 576 over plan 
period)  
 
2.3.25  In order to ascertain whether this level of housing is achievable in Gosport  
Borough  the Housing Supply Background Paper sets out the key eviden ce 
work relating to this matter which includes the findings of the Strategic 
Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA). This assessment has been 
formed by two specific ‘Call for Sites’ to landowners, agents and developers 
as well as ongoing dialogue wit h key public sector landowners in the 
Borough. As a result of this detailed research as well as considering past 
trends it is clear that the  standard method figure of  5,576 homes  is not 
achievable and instead a figure of approaching 3,500  homes  would be 
deliverable  within  the Borough. This would represent  206 dwellings per 
annum (dpa) (over a 17 year period  between 2021 and 2038 ) and would be 
an increase in the delivery rate when compared with the current Adopted 
Local Plan (GBLP 2011 -2029) which requires  170 dpa.  
 
2.3.26  It is clear that given the sites availab le, the Borough’s already built -up nature 
and various ecological and other environmental constraints as well as the 
need to provide a balanced community with sufficient employment 
opportunities that it wil l not be possible to provide a sufficient amount of land 
to accommodate 5,576 homes in the Borough.  This would currently mean 
that the Borough has an unmet need of 2,076  dwellings  (assuming a supply 
of 3,500 dwellings is achieved) . 
 
2.3.27  In accordance with the NPPF the Borough Council is working with its sub -
regional partners through PfSH to consider Strategic Development 
Opportunity Areas (SDOAs) to meet the unmet need of Gosport Borough as 
well as other local planning authority areas.  It is important that this  matter is DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
44 considered on a multi -lateral basis to determine the most sustainable and 
appropriate sites across the sub -region. The Borough Council has identified 
these fi gures to PfSH as part of the on going study and has not requested 
any single local autho rity to meet its unmet need until such time as the PfSH 
evidence has been reported.  
 
2.3.28  The Local Plan allocation of 3,500 dwellings will provide an achievable and 
realistic housing allocation , although it is recognised at this point in time 
there is a small shortfall  (as identified in Table 2). 
 
2.3.29  The Borough has long -recognised constraints on the availability of sites and 
limitations of highway infrastructure associated with its peninsula location. 
These constraints have been recognised at both sub -regional an d regional 
level and have informed previous higher -level development plans and the 
current South Hampshire Strategy. The Borough Council will continue to 
contribute towards the overall requirements by taking a positive approach 
towards new residential deve lopment. This will be in accordance with the 
presumption in favour of sustainable development set out in Policy D2 (Point 
2) of the Local Plan. Additional proposals would need to accord with the 
other policy objectives of the Local Plan to create a genuine  sustainable 
community.37 
 
2.3.30  The proposed housing allocation will significantly assist with meeting the 
needs of the local population and consequently issues such as affordability, 
tenure, size and special requirements will need to be fully addressed as part 
of this provision (see Policies H1 and H2). The proposed level of housing 
will also facilitate sites being developed for employment, commercial  and 
community uses which will stimulate economic development in the Borough. 
The proposed housing supply is incl uded in  Table 2 with the latest housing 
trajectory included in Appendix 2.

2.3.31  Retail and Town Centre Uses: The Council does not consider that any 
additional retail floorspace is required to meet needs in the Borough and 
consequently no quantum is set out in the Local Plan.  Ongoing retail trends 
such as online shopping have been exacerbated by the pandemic and has 
increased the number of vacant units  in Gosport Town Centre.  
Consequently as set out in Policy  C1: Centres , the Council will seek a DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
47 greater diversity of commercial and community uses at ground floor and 
therefore any new retail demand should be directed to these units wherever 
possible.  
 
2.3.32  This approach has been confirmed by the Council’s, Gosport Retail, Leisure 
and Tourism Study 20 19/20 produced by Lambert Smith Hampton which 
identifies no capacity to support new retail development in the Borough or its 
centres over the forecast period to 203 6 due to a number of reasons 
including  limited population growth, limited retained expenditure, and 
increased efficiency of existing retail floorspace.  
 
2.3.33  The study does recognise that the absence of capacity does not necessarily 
mean that there will be no m arket demand as operators may be driven to 
increase their catchment market share. The Study states where the Council 
is considering new retail floorspace then this should be directed to the 
centres first with the priority of reoccupying retail accommodatio n in the 
prime pitch (such as Gosport High Street) or as part of facilities to support 
new development.  
 
2.3.34  The Council recognises the role of retail and other town centre uses as part 
of the regeneration of sites and to improve the quality of place as well 
provide greater choice and competition and more opportunities for linked 
trips. Consequently new retail and other town centre uses will be directed 
primarily to the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre area where new 
commercial floorspace could include space  for restaurants and café and 
retail units to improve the quality of provision.  This would be on sites such 
as the Gosport Bus Station (see Policy  SS3) where commercial uses can 
make the most of the harbour setting, increase dwell time and retain 
expenditu re within the Borough. There may also be scope to reorganise 
commercial floorspace within the centre such as in the South Cross Street 
area. Consequently new space will be part of mixed -use regeneration 
schemes.  
 
2.3.35  In accordance with the principles of the NP PF and the findings of the 
Council’s evidence studies any new retail  and other town centre uses should 
be directed to Gosport Town Centre and where appropriate other centres in 
accordance with the retail hierarchy.  In addition there is some scope in 
certai n Urban Regeneration Areas in accordance with the policies set out in 
the Local Plan to meet local needs or form part of a comprehensive mixed -
use scheme which could include elements to support the visitor economy.  
The Council do not consider the need for any retail development outside of 
these areas.  
Location of Development (Points 2 -4 of Policy D2) 
2.3.36  In principle the Borough Council will presume in favour of development 
within the Urban Area Boundary, as defined on the Policies Map, providing 
proposals acco rd with  the other policies  set out in the Local Plan . 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
48 2.3.37  As outlined previously the Borough has significant areas of brownfield land 
as a result of its military legacy. Consequently the use of this land in the 
urban area is a key priority as it will regenerate underused sites, bringing 
back life to previously vibrant areas which provided employment and a 
variety of local facilities. Any such proposals for brownfield land would still 
need to take account of whether the site includes la nd of high enviro nmental 
value.  
 
2.3.38  Since 2003 94.5% of new dwellings in Gosp ort Borough have been built on 
Previously Developed Land. In many cases the re -use of brownfield sites in 
the Borough represents an opportunity to re -use historic buildings and such 
proposals add to the distinctive character of the Borough. The focus of 
development on brownfield sites also safeguards the finite resource of green 
open spaces in one of the most bu ilt-up areas in the South East.  
 
2.3.39  The Development  Strategy identifies a number of Urban Regeneration 
Areas  (URA’s)  which will be the focus for new development on brownfield 
sites. These are:  
 
 Harb our Regeneration Area (Policy D 3 and S S1-9); 
 Rowner and HMS Sultan Regeneration Area (Policy D 3 and S S10); 
and 
 Daedalus Rege neration Area (Policy D 3 and S S11) . 
 
2.3.40  The URA’s major development site allocations which have been identified 
on the Policies Map and detailed in each of the policies in Section 3.0. 
These sites are the main focus for development in the Borough and 
contribute significantly to the quantum of development identified in Point 1 of 
the Development  Strategy.  
 
2.3.41  In addition to these sites, new employment, housing, community, leisure 
facilities have been identified on non -strategic smaller sites outside of the 
Regeneration Areas (see Policies A1 -6). These will assist in the 
regeneration of the Borough, support economic growth and complement the 
development of the larger sites by providing additional homes, employment 
and facilities.  
Protecting and Improving Existing Sites (Point 5 of Policy D2) 
2.3.42  The Borough aims to ensure that high quality  and accessible employment 
sites (Policy E1), community facilities which includes health, care, 
education, leisure and cultural facilities (Policy C6), and open spaces (Policy 
LE1) are provided in the B orough with key existing facilities being protected 
and improved. The provision of such facilities will improve the quality of life 
of residents and deliver a more sustainable community including reducing 
the need to travel. These sites are identified on t he Policies Map38. The 
detailed criteria for determining planning applications in relation to sites that

policy also applies to these smaller sites as well as other facilities that have been developed since the 
preparation of this plan.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
49 have been protected in some way are contained in the respective poli cies 
set out in the Local Plan.  
The Local Ecological Network and the p rotection of i nternationally 
important habitats (Point 6 of Policy D2) 
2.3.43  The protection and enhancement o f the Local Ecological Network is one of 
the core principles of the Local Plan’s development strategy with further 
details set out in Policy D5  and nature conservation  policies later in the Plan 
(Policies LE5 -LE8). 
 
2.3.44  The Borough has a number of internationally important habitats and the 
Council has given consideration to the protection of these sites when 
formulating this version of the Local Plan . This includes  incorpor ating the 
principles established in evidence used to support the current GBLP 2011 -
2029 including the full Habitats Regulation s Assessment together with more 
recent work relating to recreational disturbance, air quality and nutrient 
neutrality.  
 
2.3.45  This Local  Plan will also be subject to its own assessment under the 
Habitats Regulations39 and a full assessment will be produced at the next 
Local Plan stage . The Habitats Regulation Assessment considers any 
potential impacts on internationally important habitats o r the species using 
such habitats in internationally important numbers. This also includes areas 
outside of designated sites known to be of importance to these species. The 
Council recognises that additional growth in the Borough, in -combination 
with growt h in neighbouring authorities, could, without appropriate 
management and mitigation, lead to adverse effects upon internationally 
important  sites and other site s that support their integrity.  
 
2.3.46  In order to prevent such effects, the Council will continue to work with other 
local authorities (including through PfSH) and relevant organisations to 
develop and implement a strategic approach to protecting internationally 
important sites from recreational pressure and other impacts of development 
including the need  to ensure residential developments are nutrient neutral to 
address the damaging impact of eutrophication on sensitive habitats. 
Further details are set out as part of Policy D5. 
 
2.3.47  The Council with its partners will, through ongoing monitoring40, scrutinise 
the effectiveness of the sub -regional approach to avoidance and mitigation 
of effects on European sites. It will adjust the rate, scale and distribution of 
development across the Borough to respond to the findings of new evidence 
where appropriate, in orde r to preserve the integrity of the European sites.

50 Areas outside of the Urban Area (Points 8-10 of Policy D2) 
2.3.48  Point 8 of the Development  Strategy aims to restrict most forms of 
development outside of the urban area as defined on the Policies Map in 
order to safeguard the remainin g limited areas of countryside.  
 
2.3.49  The Borough Council recognises that in certain instances there will be a 
need for particular types of development to be located outside of the Urban 
Area Boundary. The developers of such proposals w ill need to demonstrate 
the need for the development, the reasons why the development cannot be 
located within the urban area and why the particular site outside of the 
Urban Area Boundary has been chosen. Such exceptions must be 
integrated into the surrou nding environment in order to protect the open 
character of the urban fringe as well as its ecological and recreational value. 
Proposals that would diminish the function and the visual and physical 
character of the area will not be permitted.  
 
2.3.50  Outdoor recreational uses are considered appropriate outside of the urban 
area providing the proposal is in accordance with the criteria contained 
within the relevant policies of the Local Plan including the design criteria of 
Policy D8 and those policies relating to nature conservation interests. In 
certain instances it will be necessary for public authorities and statutory 
undertakers to carry out development relating to key public services such as 
energy, drinking water, drainage and communications. Each  application 
should be submitted with supporting justification demonstrating the need for 
the facility and that no alternative suitable site can be identified within the 
urban area. The policy also allows for development essential to MoD 
operations. All su ch development should again accord with the relevant 
policies of the Local Plan.  
 
2.3.51  A key strategic consideration is to retain a significant gap between Fareham , 
Gosport, Lee-on-the-Solent  and Stubbington in order to protect the identity 
of each settlement and ensure proposals do not physically and visually 
diminish these open areas.  The PfSH Spatial Position Statement enables 
Councils to identify st rategic countryside gaps of sub -regional significance in 
their local plans.  The Fareham , Gosport,  Lee-on-the-Solent  and Stubbington 
Strategic Gap has bee n a long -established gap of sub -regional importance . 
The local boundaries as defined on the Policies Map have been defined in 
cooperation with Fareham Borough Council to reflect the cross boundary 
extent of the ga p as part of the evidence studies for the current Adopted 
Local Plans for each authority . The Borough Council will work with partners 
to explore opp ortunities to enhance the multi functional benefits of this area 
as part of the wider PfS H Green Infrastructu re Strategy . 
 
2.3.52  The Alver Valley represents the main area of separation between Gosport 
and Lee -on-the-Solent. It is a former quarry and landfill site and has been 
identified as a part of the Borough’s Strategic Open Space and will be the 
main focus for gree n infrastructure in the Borough linking with the wider 
strategic and local open space network. The Alver Valley Country Park has 
been identified on the Policies Map with further details contained in Policy  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
51 D6: Gosport Strategic Open Spaces  and the Council’s Alver Valley Country 
Park Strategy (2014) . 
 
2.3.53  A number of recreation opportunities and visitor facilities have been 
developed in recent years including two new car parks, a major play area, 
extended BMX track, a new toilet facility with fo od and beverage facility and 
an enhanced network of paths and cycleways as well as a number of 
interpretation boards and welcome signs. A new garden centre with a café 
and toilet facility was grante d planning permission in 2020. There are a 
number of other  significant proposals for the Alver Valley which will create a 
fully functioning Country Park with improved visitor facilities. The site is also 
managed to enhance nature conservation interests on the site.  
 
2.3.54  The Alver Valley is already attracting increasi ng numbers of local visitors 
and has the potential to attract additional users.  This will potentially reduce 
the need to travel to such facilities outside of the Peninsula and ease 
pressure on more sensitive habitats in the sub-region . It will be necessary  to 
consider improving linkages between the urban area and the wider 
countryside beyond the Borough boundary as well improving access to local 
open spaces from residential areas.

52 2.4 POLICY D3: URBAN REG ENERATION AREAS  
Introduction  
2.4.1  Gosport has a key role as a location for urban regeneration in South 
Hampshire. This should be achieved through partnership working and 
positive planning which will encourage suitable new investment in 
employment, housing, infrastructure, facilities, herita ge assets and the 
public realm.  
 
2.4.2  In order to deliver urban regeneration in Gosport three major urban 
regeneration areas have been iden tified in the draft Local Plan  (see Plan 4) : 
 
 R1 Harbour Regeneration Area (HBRA)  
 R2 Rowner and HMS Sultan Regeneration Area (RSRA)  
 R3 Daedalus  Regeneration Area (DRA)  
 
2.4.3  Each of the three Regeneration Areas  has their own specific challenges and 
opportunities. As such, it is appropriate to set out for each a policy 
framework in the form of an overarching Urban Regeneration policy and a 
set of Strategic Development Site policies which identify  major developmen t 
opportunities and set out the key planning issues which sh ould be 
addressed in proposals.

the three urban Regeneration Areas  in the Gosport  Borough  Local Plan. The 
HBRA comprises three distinct sub -areas within which the main 
development opportunities are addressed in the set o f Strategic

 Gosport Waterfront  
 Gosport Town Centre  
 Haslar Peninsula  
 
Gosport Waterfront  
 
2.4.5  Gosport Waterfront (‘Waterfront’) is the coastal area on the western side of 
Portsmouth Harbour located between Priddy’s Hard to the north and 
Blockhouse Marina on the Haslar Peninsula. It includes areas characterised 
by marine employment and leisure uses and established residential 
neighbourhoods at Royal Clarence Yard and Priddy’s Hard. Gosport 
Waterfront includes two Strateg ic Development Site policies (S S1: Gosport 
Waterfront - Marine Employment and S S2: Gosport Waterfront - Mixed -use 
Redevelopment).  
 
Gosport Town Centre  
 
2.4.6  Gosport Town Centre (‘Town Centre’) includes the High Street, South 
Street, Bus Station and ferry pontoon, the predominantly residential areas 
centred on Clarence Road and Trinity Green, and the open spaces of 
Gosport Lines to the east and south. Gosport Town Centre includes one 
Strat egic Development Site policy (S S3: Gosport Town Centre).  
 
Haslar Peninsula  
 
2.4.7  The Haslar Peninsula (‘Haslar’) is separated from  the Waterfront and Town 
Centre by the saline Haslar Lake. Haslar is still predominantly under 
institutional ownership (including the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of 
Justice). It is comprised of mostly previously developed land and includes a 
set of nationally important heritage assets including Haslar Hospital, Haslar 
Barracks and Fort Blockhouse which taken together with the large range of 
military sites around Portsmouth Harbour are potentially  of international 
significance.  
 
2.4.8  Haslar includes six Stra tegic Development Site policies : 
 
 SS4: Blockhouse and Haslar Gunboat Sheds  
 SS5: Fort Blockhouse  
 SS6: Royal Haslar Hospital  
 SS7: Haslar Barracks  
 SS8: The Piggeries  
 SS9: Haslar Marine Technology Park  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
55 Rowner  and HMS S ultan  Regeneration  Area 
2.4.9  Rowner is an established residential estate built in the 1960s for the Ministry 
of Defence (MoD) and is located between the Alver Valley to the west and 
south, HMS Sultan to the east and established residential suburbs to the 
north. In the last 12 years Rowner has had a significant amount of 
regeneration with new community facilities, retail units and approximately 
700 new dwellings (a net gain of 200 units) which replaced lower quality 
housing.  This scheme is referred to as Alver Village.  
 
2.4.10  There are still some sizeable  outstanding areas where the quality and 
condition of buildings could be significantly improved as well as the 
opportunity to improve the layout of the development. It is considered that 
there is the potential for a second phase of regeneration to be initi ated 
during the plan period which would provide a significant number of new 
homes  and public realm improvements.  
 
2.4.11  HMS Sultan41 has a high value as a centre of excellence for engineering 
training for the defence industry and provides significant employment within 
the Borough. The Borough Council  strongly  supports its continued operation 
as one of the largest employers in the Borou gh. The Government 
determined in February 2019 that HMS Sultan will be released for 
development no earlier than 2029. If the site is released for redevelopment 
within the latter part of the plan period the Council will prioritise commercial 
(Class E(g), B2 and B8 uses) and community uses to assist the 
diversification an d renewal of the local economy.  
Daedalus  Regeneration Area 
2.4.12  The Daedalus  site is a former military base and lies to the north and north -
west of Lee -on-the-Solent. The site covers a total area of approximately 196 
hectares. The majority of the site, some 115.6 hectares, comprising the 
runways, lies within the Fareham Borough Council (FBC) administrative 
area. The remainder of the site, some 38 hectares, lies within the Borough 
of Gosport.  
 
2.4.13  The Daedalus  Waterfront area has a strong character and contains most of 
the built development on the site including a number of historic buildings, 
many of which are listed including the prominent Wardroom and Westcliffe 
House located close to the seafront. Th e new Local Plan offers an 
opportunity to reconsider what the residual parts of the Daedalus  site within 
Gosport could provide taking into account the planning consents granted 
since the adoption of the current Loca l Plan.

POLICY D 3: URBAN REGENERATION  AREAS  
 
1. The Council supports major regeneration and growth in the 
Borough’s three urban Regeneration Areas  and will work with the 
local community and key stakeholders to ensure that within these 
areas  proposals provide new exemplary urban communities 
delivered to the highest possible design standards through 
responsibly capitalising on its waterfront townscape, heritage 
assets and marine environment. The Council’s key objectives for 
the three urban Rege neration Areas  are to deliver:  
 
a) At least 2,600 new homes in the period up to 203 8 to 
contribute  towards meeting  local housing needs and enable 
local residents the opportunity to access affordable home to 
buy or rent;  
 
b) Sufficient suitable sites to assist the development and 
evolution of Gosport as a world -class global hub for marine 
and maritime economic activity and provide an overall 
broader range of job opportunities for local residents; and  
 
c) New physical, social and environmental infrastructure that 
meets the needs of all residents and visitors including 
improved access and permeability by connecting places 
through new or improved vehicular arrangements, pedestrian 
and cycle routes, and public transport infrastructure.  
 
2. All development proposals within the three Urban Regeneration 
Areas  should address the following key local issues in line with 
the relevant strategic policy and national planning guidance :  
 
a) Protect, enhance and find viable new uses for Gosport’s  
unique set of heritage assets;  
 
b) Avoid and reduce the risks from all sources of f looding and 
the impacts on coastal processes and ensure that flood risk is 
not increased elsewhere as a result;  
 
c) Protect the quality and status of internationally  and nationally 
important  sites  and where necessary pro vide suitable 
mitigation; and 
 
d) Suitably addre ss issues of land contamination.  
 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
57 EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D3 
2.4.14  The three urban Regeneration Areas  identified in the draft Local Plan 
represent an opportunity for significant new sustainable place -making and 
will provide the main focus for new development in the Borough in the plan 
period. If planned and designed sensitively and effectively in collaboration 
with local communities and sta keholders, the three urban Regeneration 
Areas  can create viable and vibrant development opportunity for a range of 
potential uses, ensuring best use of brownfield land and creating a platform 
for Gosport’s future prosperity. The Council will aim to involve  all sections of 
the community in the development of policies and proposals for the 
regeneration of the Borough and in planning decisions.  
 
2.4.15  Development in each of the Regeneration Areas  will need to respect and 
enhance the existing townscape context and he ritage assets both within and 
around the area. New public spaces should provide a meaningful 
contribution to the network of key pedestrian routes. Existing public spaces 
should be improved and be adaptable to provide recreational activity 
throughout the pl an period. Streets should also be seen as places rather 
than purely vehicular thoroughfares.  
 
2.4.16  High quality  new developments should be focused on the coastline, public 
spaces and creating places where people want to be and stay. High quality  
public spaces should also be multifunctional. As well as access, they can 
provide places for younger residents to play , and can address flood risk 
mitigation and biodiversity  enhancements  through good design. New 
development on the Haslar Peninsula and at  Daedalus  should take account 
of the local coastal microclimate when considering new spaces.  
 
2.4.17  All development should take full account of the Strategic Design Policy 
(Policy D8) and the Council’s comprehensive Design Guidance 
Supplementary Planning Documen t (SPD)  (February 2014). All 
development within the area demarcated in the Gosport Waterfront and 
Town Centre S PD42 (March 2018) should have regard to the SPD  and 
similarly the area covered by the Daedalus SPD  (September 2011) . Where 
applicable Conservation  Area Appraisals should also be considered.  
 
2.4.18  The S trategic Development Sites policies set out, where relevant, 
supporting design criteria which seeks to achieve enhancement to heritage 
assets in the HBRA in line with the relevant design guidance . This is 
particularly pertinent with regard to new development within the setting of 
Haslar Hospital, Blockhouse and the Haslar Gunboat Yards , Fort 
Blockhouse and Daedalus . 
 
2.4.19  Planning permission will not be granted for incremental development that 
would unacceptably hamper or reduce the development options for that 
wider area. This applies specifically to sites that would compromise the 
delivery of Blockhouse, Fort Blockhouse a nd the Haslar Gunboats Yards 
                                            
42 For reference, the Haslar Peninsula is outside the SPD area.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
58 which have a degree of interdependence, despite being in different 
ownership as of 2021 . Proposals for development of smaller sites in 
isolation must demonstrate that their implementation would not prejudice or 
unduly constrain  options for redevelopment of adjacent sites. This includes 
consideration of vehicular access, the location of built development and the 
mix of uses.  
Housing ( Point 1a of Policy D 3) 
2.4.20  Housing will be an important  form of new development in the three urban 
Regeneration Areas  in the plan period which in many cases will form part of 
mixed -use sites generating new employment and commercial opportunities. 
It is acknowledged at the sub -regional level43 that Gosport Borough has a 
notably more restricted supply of dev elopable land for additional housing 
than other local authorities in the South Hampshire area, given it is heavily 
built-up and constrained by an extensive coastline  with its sensitive habitats 
and potential flood risk . Each urban regeneration area nonethe less includes 
significant parcels of previously developed land with redevelopment 
potential which can contribute to meeting a proportion of the identifie d 
housing needs of the Borough.  
 
2.4.21  The emphasis in the urban Regeneration Areas  is on efficiently using land to 
deliver medium to higher density residential development that provides a 
significant proportion of the overall number of smaller dwellings identified as 
being needed in Gosport in the plan period. Within the Town Centre and  
Waterfront it is anticipated that the predominant residential typology 
provided will be flats. Within the Haslar Peninsula, Rowner and Daedalus  it 
is anticipated that there will be greater scope for providing a broader mix of 
residential typologies includ ing flats, family houses, age -restricted housing 
and residential care homes for people with needs.  
Local Economy ( Point  1b of Policy D3) 
2.4.22  The Harbour Regeneration Area  will be a focus for new employment 
development in the plan period. Marine related industr ies44 and the 
employment they provide are of particular importance to both the Borough 
and the wider South Hampshire sub -region.  Over the plan period it will be 
important to position Gosport as a market leader for marine services to 
attract more customers, high-tech light industry and bespoke boat and yacht 
maintenance facilities which attract a high skills base. The Waterfront also 
has the potential to further develop its sailing and yachting facilities and 
services, and tourism -related employment associate d with Gosport’s 
maritime heritage.  Policy SS1 covers the issue of marine employment in 
further detail.  
 
                                            
43 PUSH Spatial Position Statement June 2016 Paragraph 5.19  
44 The local marine cluster of businesses includes building and repairing boats, defence activities, water 
transport, equipment manufacturing and recreation, and niche support services geared towards the marine 
sector.   
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
59 2.4.23  It is therefore proposed to safeguard land with access to assets and facilities 
that serve this sector such as deep -water facilities, slipways, cranes,  
moorings and marinas for the express purpose of providing future 
opportunities for expansion of this crucial sector for the local economy. New 
marine employment floorspace within the Waterfront will be primarily 
focused at the Royal Clarence Yard Retained  Area and Blockhouse Marina 
on the Haslar Peninsula to make use of the previously developed land, 
existing marine infrastructure and deep water facilities at both sites.  
 
2.4.24  Gosport Town Centre will continue to play a key role in the local economy. 
The town c entre has a number of strengths and weaknesses. It benefits 
from a good range of retail stores including a large format Morrison’s store 
at the western end of the High Street. The High Street is pedestrianised, 
level and accessible and there is a wide rang e of parking options. Specific 
sites within the town centre, particularly along South Street, provide notable 
potential for regeneration including higher density housing and as such 
there is scope to significantly increase the number of people living withi n the 
town centre. There are also emerging opportunities to make significant 
areas of open space fully accessible  to the public.  
 
2.4.25  However, the range of shops in the town centre is limited and it does not 
attract many visitors from outside the Borough. The range of food and drink 
offers is lacking variety and there are, in common with many High Streets 
nationally, a number of vacant and/or boarded up units.  These trends 
including competition from internet shopping have been accelerated by the 
COVID -19 pandemic. The proximity to the larger centres of Fareham and 
Portsmouth provides significant competition, and associated leakage of 
spend, for comparison retail spend. As such, the Strategic Development Site 
policy sets out a more flexible approach than h itherto towards considering 
main town centre uses, as defined in national planning guidance, in addition 
to retail floorspace.  
 
2.4.26  The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) has clearly recognised the 
business opportunities at Daedalus  through the designat ion of an Enterprise 
Zone. The LEP’s Strategic Economic Plan recognises Daedalus  as a priority 
site and it has also been identified by PfSH as a Strategic Employment Site. 
As such, it is considered to have a significant role in delivering the total net 
additional employment floor space required for the South Hampshire 
Strategy.  
Infrastructure (Point 1c of Policy  D3) 
2.4.27  An Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been produced which outlines the 
types of infrastructure that should be planned for in conjunction wi th new 
development, with an indication of those organisations who will be 
responsible for the provision.  
 
2.4.28  Ensuring that all of the Harbour Regeneration Area  is readily accessible for 
all residents, employees and visitors is a key regeneration objective. Th e 
HBRA offers a number of opportunities to significantly improve non -DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
60 vehicular accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists. The aim is to create a 
fully permeable network of routes which help encourage pedestrian 
movements through the Waterfront, Town Centr e and Haslar and their 
respective built -up areas and open spaces. All new or improved existing 
access routes in the HBRA should be laid out to make it fully accessible for 
all people including those with disabilities, elderly people a nd those with 
younger children.  
Heritage Assets ( Point 2a of Policy D3) 
2.4.29  Gosport, in conjunction with Portsmouth, has arguably the finest collection 
of naval defences in the country dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries 
when British sea -power was often globally pre -eminent.  The defences of 
Priddy's Hard, along with the adjacent length of fortifications behind Royal 
Clarence Yard, are the best surviving lengths of 18th century fortificat ions 
around Portsmouth Harbour.  
 
2.4.30  Consequently the Urban Regeneration Areas have a number of 
Conservation Areas and a number of other significant heritage assets 
including listed buildings, Scheduled Ancient Monuments and locall y listed 
assets.  
 
2.4.31  The Waterfront and Town Centre has five Cons ervation Areas (High Street, 
Priddy’s Hard, St George’s Barracks North, St George’s Barracks  South and 
Royal Clarence Yard).  
 
2.4.32  Haslar has two Conservation Areas, Haslar Peninsula and Haslar Barracks, 
which include a number of nationally significant heritage  assets : 
 
 Fort Blockhouse, of which the core is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, 
has been home to a fortified tower since the Tudor period and is the 
historic home of the Royal Navy’s submarine fleet  and includes  
numerous Listed Buildings such as the Guard H ouse (Grade II*) and 
Police Barracks ( II*); 
 Haslar Hospital, a Grade II Registered Park and Garden, which was 
the first purpose -built naval hospital in England  and includes a number 
of Listed Buildings such as the Ward Blocks (II*) and the Chapel of St. 
Luke (II*) ; 
 Haslar Gunboat Yards  were a world first, constructed to home the 
Royal Navy’s gunboat fleet during the Crimean War  with the Gunboats 
Sheds themselves being Grade I Listed ; 
 Haslar Barracks, the only significant regimental infantry barracks’ 
comple x that survives in England relating to the threat of invasion in 
the years leading up to t he Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.  
 
2.4.33  The Daedalus Conservation Area was designated in November 1999 to 
ensure that all future development would preserve or enhance the historic 
and architectural character of the area. The site is primarily associated with 
the development of naval seaplanes by  the Royal Navy in the early 
twentieth century. The area retains many buildings of historic interest DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
61 spanning the last 120 years, including some Listed Grade II and therefore is 
considere d to be of national importance.  
 
2.4.34  Enhancing, or better revealing the s ignificance of heritage assets within the 
urban Regeneration Areas  should always be addressed in development 
proposals and may be achieved through positive planning which includes:  
 
 Removing an intrusive building or feature;  
 Replacement of a detrimental fe ature by a new and more harmonious 
one; 
 Restoring or revealing a lost historic feature or view;  
 Introducing a wholly new feature that adds to the public appreciation of 
the heritage asset;  
 Introducing new views, including glimpses or better framed view t hat 
add to the public experience of the asset; and  
 Improving public access to, or interpretation, of the heritage asset 
including its setting.  
 
2.4.35  The Strategic Development Site policies set out, where relevant, supporting 
design criteria which seeks to achieve enhancement to heritage assets. This 
is particularly pertinent with regard to new development within the setting 
the Haslar Hospital, Haslar Gunboat Yards, Fort Blockhouse , Haslar 
Barracks  and Daedalus . 
Flood Risk ( Point 2b of Policy D3) 
2.4.36  Significan t portions of the Harbour Regeneration Area are within areas 
identified flood risk areas. As such, development proposals will need to take 
account of the current and future flood risk addressing the impact of climate 
change45. The North Solent Shoreline Man agement Plan (2010) includes a 
‘hold the line’ policy for the coastline within the Waterfront and Haslar. This 
long-term policy up to 2115 ensures that there is an overarching intent to 
build or maintain coastal def ences along current alignments.  
 
2.4.37  The Council’s more detailed strategy on flood management is set out in the 
River Hamble to Portchester Coastal Flood and Erosion Risk Management 
Strategy (‘Coastal Strategy’)46. The Coastal Strategy sets out that the 
erosion risk is generally lower within Ports mouth Harbour due to its 
sheltered location but that there is however significant tidal flood risk in the 
Waterfront and Haslar  areas . The Coastal Strategy recommends new 
defences are implemented in priority areas in the HBRA. Specific flood risks 
associat ed with individual development sites are set out in the supporting 
information to the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD47. The Council 
has also prepared  an interim  Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA)  to 
accompany the Local Plan which will be refresh ed as new evidence 
emerges as part of the sub -regional SFRA currently being commissioned by

62 PfSH which takes into account the latest sea level projections as a result of 
climate change . 
 
2.4.38  The Council’s development strategy in areas of identified flood risk is that, in 
line with national planning guidance, where an area or site has been shown 
to have overriding sustainability benefits and the flood risk can be mitigated 
it can be possible to build in such areas. The HBRA has such overriding 
sustainability ben efits in terms of housing and employment regeneration that 
are not available els ewhere in the Borough.  
 
2.4.39  In preparing site specific Flood Risk Assessments (FRA) it is expected that 
development proposals will in line with Policy D7 and national planning 
guidance:  
 
 Follow the flood risk management hierarchy, avoiding areas at 
highest risk and locating higher vulnerability uses in areas of lowest 
risk on site, wherever possible;  
 Locate habitable rooms above the design flood level;  
 Provide a safe access and egre ss route wherever feasible; where this 
is not possible a safe refuge should be provided within the 
development;  
 Not increase flood risk elsewhere;  
 Incorporate flood resilience and resistance measures;  
 Remain structurally sound during the design flood event ; and  
 Demonstrate that residual risk can be managed to a safe level . 
 
2.4.40  In addition to this, new developments will be expected to play a key role in 
contributing towards the effective delivery of the Borough Council’s 
sustainable development objectives. In f lood risk terms this will be achieved 
through:  
 
 Providing a robust ‘front line’ defence as an integral part of the 
development where appropriate;  
 Safeguarding sufficient land in order to provide for future flood risk 
management where a front line defence is not appropriate or 
currently necessary; and  
 Safe refuge for residents above the flood levels at upper floors may 
be considered acceptable given the flood risk is predominantly tidal 
i.e. levels will reduce as the tide goes out. Flood risk evacuation 
plans may also be appropriate depending on Environment Agency 
advice relating to individual planning applications where relevant.  
 
2.4.41  Provision for new flood risk management measures must be delivered in an 
efficient and timely way and b e designed and maintained  to take into 
account the effects of climate change over the longer term using the most 
up-to-date available information. Flood risk management measures can 
include a range of hard and soft engineering solutions (or a combination of 
these) and include the redesign and/or replacement of existing flood 
defences (see  Policy D7). The Council collects a Community Infrastructure DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
63 Levy (CIL) on new development in the Borough and the strategic element of 
CIL may be used towards funding such infrastructure along (wit h other 
external funding sources). However the Council considers there may be 
some circumstances where it would be more appropriate to secure a site -
specific developer contribution for flood risk management infrastructure 
through a S106 planning obligation .  
 
2.4.42  Safe refuge for residents above the flood levels at upper floors may be 
considered acceptable given the floor risk is predominantly tidal i.e. levels 
will reduce as the tide goes out. Flood risk evacuation plans may also be 
appropriate depending on Env ironment Agency advice. In addition, at 
Haslar, all development proposals should , through their site-specific  FRA, 
address the condition of the existing Solent seawall defences and the risks 
of defence failure and potential overtopping o f sea defences.  
Internationally and nationally important sites (Point 2c of Policy D3) 
2.4.43  Development proposals should protect and take opportunities to enhance 
the Local Ecological Network and development likely to have an individual 
or cumulative adverse impact on internation ally important sites will not be 
permitted unless the necessary avoidance or mitigation measures can be 
secured in line with the NPPF and Policy D5.  
 
2.4.44  Parts of the Harbour and Daedalus Regeneration Areas are adjacent , or in 
close proximity, to internationally  and nationally  important habitats including 
the Portsmouth Harbou r Special Protection Area (SPA) , Ramsar Site , Site of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)  and the Solent and Dorset Coast SPA. As 
such, it will be necessary to assess proposals  for the sites in terms of their 
potential impact on the important habitats in-combination  with other 
proposals.  
 
2.4.45  The Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) for the 2015 Local Plan 
recognised that development on the Haslar Peninsula has the potential to 
have  a detrimental impact on these internationally important habitats. As 
such, it will be necessary to ensure proposals avoid and mitigate any 
adverse impacts. Various measures should be considered including those 
highlighted in the HRA Report as well as thos e identified as part of the 
Solent Disturbance and Mitigation Project  and work currently being 
undertaken to address the issue of nutrient neutrality . A HRA Screening 
Assessment accompanies this Local Plan consultation and the Council has 
commissioned a fu ll assessment which will inform the next version of the 
Local Plan.  
 
2.4.46  A project level HRA is likely to be required at the planning application stage 
depending on the location and nature of the proposal. It will be necessary to 
ensure that development does n ot have a detrimental impact on the features 
of internationally important  sites either alone or in-combination  with other 
plans and projects. Particular consideration will need to be given to the 
potential impact that development could have on the internat ional  sites and 
supportive features.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
64 2.4.47  The design of proposals including the scale, form, massing and layout of 
development shall be specifically designed to respond to nearby sensitive 
features (i.e. internationally important sites or Brent Goose and/or wad er 
feeding and roosting sites), through for example reduced or stepped building 
heights, to avoid displacing Brent Goose and/or waders as a result of 
reduced sight lines.  
 
2.4.48  In addition, where proposals could cause significant noise or air quality 
impacts or  create significant disturbance or intrusion during the demolition 
and construction phases, a Construction and Environmental Management 
Plan (CEMP) will be required to be submitted in line with Policy LE9 
(Pollution Control). Where appropriate these measur es will be expected to 
include assessments of vehicle movements associated with the construction 
site. 
Land Contamination (Point 2d of Policy D3 ) 
2.4.49  Reflecting Gosport’s industrial and military heritage there are areas of 
known or potential land contamination  within the identified urban 
Regeneration Areas. All proposals should therefore address Policy LE10 
(Contaminated and Unstable Land ) and relevant national policy guidance.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
65 2.5 POLICY D4: GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK  
Introduction  
2.5.1  Green infrastructure is a natural capital asset which can provide 
multi functional benefits at a range of scales to help meet national, sub -
regional and local objectives. According to the PGG48 this includes:  
 
 Building a strong, competitive economy  
 Achieving well -designed places  
 Promoting healthy and safe communities  
 Mitigating climate change, flooding and coastal change  
 Conserving and enhancing the natural environment  
 
2.5.2  The NPPF defines  green infrastructure (GI) as ‘a network of multifunctional  
green space, urban and rural, which  is capable of delivering a wide range of 
environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities’. Amongst 
other features this includes the Borough’s parks and gardens, including 
private gardens, large areas of open space such as the Alver Valley  and 
Stokes Bay, amenity green spaces, Public Rights of Way, green corridors 
and trees and hedgerows.  
 
POLICY D4: GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  NETWORK  
 
1. The Green Infrastructure Network (GIN) will specifically support the 
Borough in addressing climate change, improving biodiversity and 
creating healthier communities. The Borough aims to establish a 
comprehensive, high quality  and multifunctional network of  green 
infrastructure throughout Gosport and, where possible, link into 
the green infrastructure networks of neighbouring districts. The 
network will be formed from a wide variety of green and/or open 
features, including the countryside, parks, gardens, pu blic spaces, 
coastal fringes, watercourses, green verges and woodland.  
 
2. The GIN has the following overarchi ng objectives linked to the 
relevant Local Plan policies:  
 
 Contributing towards the mitigation of the local impacts of 
climate change (Policy D1);  
 Supporting the maintenance and enhancement of 
multifunctional green infrastructure ( Policy D4);  
 Protection and enhancement of the Local Ecological Network 
(Policy D5) ; 
 Enhancing local biodiversity through providing habitats for 
plants and animals, and corr idors for their movement ( Policies 
D5, LE5, LE6, LE7, LE8 ); 
 Mitigating the risks and impacts of flooding ( Policy D7 ); 
 Providing high quality  recreation and sporting facilities for all

66 through a range of o pen space s (Policy  D6 &  LE1) and 
facilitating access  to the countryside and coast, specifically 
long -distance routes including the Millennium Promenade, 
Solent Way, England Coast Path and the National Cycle Network 
(Policy LE4).  
 
3. The network will incorporate existing, enhanced and new green 
infrastructure. All developments should positively contribute, 
commensurate to their scale, to the improvement and expansion of 
the GIN by maximising as far as practicable:   
 
 The amount of green infrastructure on the site, whilst having 
regard to the development needs of the Borough;  
 The interconnectedness of green infrastructure within and 
around the site, and connections to the wider network, thereby 
helping to enhance key functions of the green infrastructure 
network;  
 The multi -functionality of any green infrastructure , whilst 
ensuring that it can properly fulfil its core functions; and  
 The quality of any green infrastructure, to ensure that it can 
meet its various functions as effectively as possible.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D4  
Overall approach (Point 1 of Policy D4) 
2.5.3  The Council will seek to develop a strategic Green Infrastructure Network 
(GIN) making use of all available green assets, and where possible linking 
up with cross -boundary networks in Fareh am and other surrounding areas.  
 
2.5.4  The Council is working with the Pa rtnership for South Hampshire (PfSH) to 
support and deliver a sub -regional green infrastructure network. This 
network is set out in the South Hampshire Green Infrastruct ure Strategy 
2017 -2034 (PfSH 2018)49 and the South Hampshire Green Infrastructure 
Implem entation Plan (PfSH 2019)50. The strategy promotes a variety of 
strategic projects including enhancements to the Alver Valley Country Park, 
water quality improvements and directing recreational pressure away from 
sensitive European sites. The Council will s upport the delivery of these 
strategic GI assets, including through securing developer contributions 
where appropriate.  
Overarching  objectives (Point 2 of Policy D4) 
2.5.5  The delivery of the GIN will link with a number of other policies within the 
Local Plan an d help to deliver its overarching objectives. Proposals should 
ensure they fully consider the requirements of these linked policies and take

67 advantage of opportunities to achieve multifunctional benefits from green 
infrastructure enhancements, where it doe s not harm other core objectiv es 
such as nature conservation.  
All developments should contribute towards the GIN (Point 3 of Policy 
D4) 
2.5.6  Opportunities to maintain and enhance the Borough’s GIN  need to be 
considered at the earliest stages of develo pment. The y should form  an 
integral part of a proposal and take into account existing natural assets as 
well as considering the most suitable locati ons and types of new provision.  
 
2.5.7  Measures should be commensurate to the scale of development proposed, 
and should prim arily be delivered through on -site infrastructure, however 
additional off -site provision may be approp riate in certain circumstances.  
 
2.5.8  On-site provision:  It will be necessary for schemes to indicate how the 
proposed development intends to protect and enhan ce the Borough’s GIN. 
On-site measures could include:  
 
 retaining existing natural features;  
 creation of areas managed for wildlife;  
 planting of street trees and hedges of indigenous species;  
 use of green roofs and walls;  
 linking new development to  existing and surrounding green 
infrastructure such as the Local Ecological Network (see Policy D5); 
 enhancing the quality and multi functionality of existing and 
surrounding green infrastructure; and 
 the use of  sustainable d rainage systems , where appropriate (see also 
Policy D7). 
 
2.5.9  Such measures will need to be appropriately managed and maintained for a 
period of 25 years and be secured by a Section 106 Agreement. In the case 
of sustainable drainage systems , a longer term management scheme wi ll be 
required as advised by the Environment Agency. It will be appropriate for 
some of these measures to be incorporated as part of the public open space 
standards outlined in Policy LE1 , where it can be shown that the measures 
have recreational value to the residents of the development.  
 
2.5.10  Off-site provision:  In some cases and particularly with larger 
developments, in addition to suitable on -site measures, it may be necessary 
to secure contributions towards the provision of off -site green infrastructure. 
The need for off -site provision will be informed by the latest evidence 
studies, DEFRA ’s Biodiversity Metric and/or advice from Natural England 
and the Environment Agency as part of the planning proposal consultation. 
Such provision may be necessary to mitig ate the impact of the development 
and could include:  
 
 avoidance and mitigation measures in relation to an identified effect on 
internationally/nationally important habitats;  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
68  ameliorating the impacts of climate change;  
 securing a measu reable biodiversity ne t gain;  
 flood alleviation measures (for example, land as sociated with a 
balancing pond).  
 
2.5.11  Developer contributions may be sought towards improving the Borough’s 
Local Ecological Network and the delivery of other strategic green 
infrastructure projects, such  as those listed within the latest PfSH strategies 
and other relevant strategies and evidence (see  Box 3 ). The enhancement, 
restoration and creation of new green infrastructure and its management will 
need to be informed by the latest evidence and strategi es.

2.5.12  Maintenance:  As part of new developments it will be important that green 
infrastructure is appropriately managed and maintained. Such pr ovision will 
need to  be considered at an early stage and factored into the design and 
implementation, balancing the costs with the benefits. Engagement with the 
local community can assist with management plans and tailoring provision 
to local needs.  Propos als should be accompanied with a suitable 
management plan and arrangements secured by legal agreement. In most 
cases the funding will need to be secured by a Section 106 rather than the 
Community Infrastructure Levy.  
Protecting the integrity of the GIN (Point 2 of Policy D11)  
2.5.13  It is important that the integrity of the GIN is retained. Development which 
harms the integrity of the network will not be permitted. Detailed 
development management policies relating to protecting important habitats 
and species are o utlined in Policies LE5 –LE7. 
 
2.5.14  A planning application which may affect a green infrastructure asset must be 
accompanied with an assessment of the importance of the relevant feature 
in terms of the various benefits GI can provide and what appropriate 
mitigat ion measures are being proposed. Consideration will therefore need 
to be given to the relevant green infrastructure in terms of the site itself and 
its contribution to the wider network. This includes assessing the following 
potential functions:

71 2.6 POLICY D5: THE LOCAL ECOLOGICAL  NETWORK AND 
INTERNATIONALLY AND NATIONALLY IMPORTANT  SITES  
Introduction  
2.6.1  This section relates to the preservation and enhancement of the Borough’s 
Local Ecological Network including its biodiversity  (see Box 4)  and habitats . 
The following policies should be read in conjunction with Policy D4: Green 
Infrastructure Network which sets out a range of appropriate multiple 
benefits that can be achieved as part of a green infrastructure network at a 
landscape and neighbourhood -scale. Policy D5 relate s more specifically to 
protected habitats and species as well as other important nature 
conservation features.  
 
BOX 4: What is biodiversity and its benefits?  
 
Biodiversity is the variety of life, including all plants, animals and their 
habitats. The protection and enhancement of biodiversity is a key factor in 
the achievement of sustainable development by safeguarding the natural 
systems that underpin human life.   
 
Natural processes that support biodiversity can assist with flood control, 
help to filter waste water, clean pollutants from the air and mitigate noise  
and the visual intrusion of development.  Biodiversity helps to mitigate the 
effects of climate change through locking -up carbon, increasing water 
storage capacity and providing shade within urban areas. It also contributes 
to our physical and mental healt h by providing relaxation, enjoyment and 
recreation opportunities. Nature conservation measures to protect 
biodiversity can be an important education resource which encourages 
respect for the environment.  
 
Local Context  
2.6.2  The Local Ecological Network (LEN)  of Gosport comprises international, 
national and locally designated sites of importance for biodiversity, local 
nature reserves, ancient woodlands and other priority habitats, veteran 
trees, important hedgerows, buffer zones, wildlife corridors and the stepping 
stones that connect them. Functionally linked land, sites identified as 
compensatory measures for adverse effects on biodiversity, areas identified 
for habitat restoration and creation, and sites with protected or notable 
species and their habitats also fall within the Local Ecological Network.  Sites 
could include playing fields, allotments, cemeteries, back gardens, hedges, 
landscaped areas, informal open space and former railway lines. Gosport’s 
natural assets contribute significantly to the qualit y of the environment an d 
to its distinctive character.  
 
2.6.3  There are a number of issues which affect the LEN and biodiversity and 
these are summarised in Box 5 below.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
72 BOX 5: Key issues relating to the  Local Ecological Network and 
biodiversity51 
 
Key issues primarily relate to the increased pressure on habitats and the 
species they support (particularly those of international and national 
importance) as outlined below.  
 
 Development growth in Gosport in-combination  with the proposed gr owth 
in South Hampshire and beyond with particular concerns relating to:  
 
- loss of habitat as a direct result of development (building on sites that 
are protected or important to the integrity of a particular habitat);  
- increased water consumption which has a potential impact on water 
levels on protected rivers in the sub -region;  
- capacity for dealing with additional wastewater and the potential 
consequences on water quality  including the impact of nutrients on 
sensitive habitats ; 
- increased air pollution parti cularly relating to increased traffic on 
sensitive species;  
- increased demands on recreational resources in the area which can 
potentially disturb sensitive species or even destroy habitats.  
 
 Climate change with a numbe r of consequences including sea -level rise 
which could result in the loss of important coastal habitats such as salt 
marshes and mudflats through the process of coastal squeeze.  
 
Other related issues include balancing increasing access to the natural 
enviro nment without harming it and improving the quality of life of residents 
by taking opportunities to enhance biodiversity across the Borough.  
 
 
2.6.4  The Borough Council’s role as the Local Planning Authority  is critical in 
safeguarding internationally, nationally and locally important sites as well as 
protected species and other features of nature conservation importance. 
The main designations  of the LEN are summarised below in  Box 6 , 
highlighted in Plan 6 and identified  in detail on the Policies Map.   
                                            
51 See Biodiversity and Geological Conservation Background Paper and evidence studies identified therein for 
further details.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
73 BOX 6: Summary of Nature Conservation Designations  
Internationally Important Sites  
The legal requirements for all designations are set out in the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  
Designation  Sites  
Special Protection Areas (SPA ) - SPAs 
are designated under the European 
Union Birds Directives and transposed 
into UK Law. This requires special 
measures to protect migratory, rare and 
vulnerable species of birds. SPAs  are 
particularly important for birds which 
depend on specialised or restricted 
habitats for breeding, feeding, wintering 
or migration.  
  Portsmouth Harbour Special 
Protection Area (SPA):  This includes 
a significant part of Portsmouth 
Harbour within the Borough including 
a number of creeks such as Frater, 
Forton, Haslar, Workhouse and 
Stoke Lakes.  Other parts of the SPA 
are within Fareham Borough and 
Portsmouth City.  
 Solent and Dorset Coa st Special 
Protection Area (SP A): This includes 
the Borough’s Solent and 
Portsmouth Harbour coastline 
including the creeks, and has been 
identified for its importance for 
feeding for various tern species.   
 
Special Area of Conservation (SAC ) - 
designated under the European Union 
Habitats Directive and transposed into 
UK Law which  protects important 
wildlife habitats and the rare or 
threatened plants and animals that they 
support.   
  Solent and Isle of Wight Special 
Area of Conservation (SAC):  This 
includes Gilkicker Lagoon within 
Gosport Borough. This is part of a 
larger designation which includes a 
series of saline lagoons around the 
Solent . 
 
Ramsar Sites - designated as wetlands 
of international importance under the 
1971 Ramsar Convention.  As a matter 
of policy, Ramsar sites in England  are 
protected as European sites. Where the 
sites are identified for waterfowl interest, 
the criteria are similar to those for SPAs.  
  Portsmouth Harbour Ramsar site : 
This covers  the same areas as the 
Portsmouth SPA but has additional 
features of interest.  
 Solent and Southampton Water 
Ramsar Site : This also includes the 
Gilkicker Lagoon, but is part of a 
much larger designation which 
includes a variety of habitats 
including saline  lagoons stretching 
from Hurst Spit in the New Forest to 
Gilkicke r 
 
Potential SPA,  Possible SAC and 
proposed Ramsar are sites on which 
Government has initiated public 
consultation on the scientific case for 
designation and  are given the same 
status as ful ly designated habitat sites 
(see Para 176 of the NPPF).  
 None at present  
 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
74 Nationally Important Sites  
Designation  Sites  
Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSI)  
 
Sites are designated and protected 
under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
1981, as amended by the Countryside 
and Rights of Way Act 2000 . There are five SSSIs in the Borough  
 Portsmouth Harbour  (also a Ramsar 
and SPA site) contains a number of 
important habitats including inter -
tidal mudflats and marshes which 
support internationally important 
wetland bird species;  
 Gilkicker Lag oon (also a Ramsar 
and SAC site) is a saline lagoon, 
which is a rare  habitat and supports 
specialised species including 
several national rarities;  
 Browndown Ranges  is an extensive 
shingle beach with extensive areas 
of rare grass heath habitat 
supporting specialised plants and 
invertebrates;  
 The Wildgrounds  is largely an acid 
oakwood, a type of habitat which 
was formerly widespread on coastal 
commons in Hampshire (the site is 
also a Local Nature Reserve);  
 Lee-on-the-Solent to Itchen Estuary  
includes the coastline at Lee -on-the-
Solent which is important for 
geological reasons, particularly for 
bird fossils.  
 
National Nature Reserve  None at present in the Borough  
 
 
Locally Important Sites 
Designation  Sites  
Sites of Important for Nature 
Conservation (SINCs) are identified by 
HBIC following an ecological 
assessment and are considered by the 
Local Sites Panel. The panel comprises 
representatives from Natural England, 
Hampshire County Council and the 
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife 
Trust for ratification, in accordance with 
local sites guidance issued b y DEFRA in 
2006 . 
 As at 1st April 2021 there are 39 SINCs 
ranging in size from  Bedenham (99ha)  
to a site within Fort Grange (0.17ha) . 
They include a range of habitats from 
moats to wooded areas.  
Local Nature Reserves - LNRs are a 
statutory designation made  by local 
authorities under Section 21 of the 
National Parks and Countryside Act There are two site in the Borough, both 
in the Alver Valley Country Park : 
 
 the Wildgrounds (also a SSSI)  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
75 1949 (as amended by the Local 
Government Act 1972).   
  West of the River Reserves.  
Undesignated sites  - may include 
important nature conservation features 
which from part of the LEN as well as 
internationally and nationally protected 
species or other important species (such 
as those recognised in a Biodiversity 
Action Pl an) (see also Policy  LE6-LE8) . 
 There are found across the Borough 
(see Local Ecological Network Plan) .

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
76 2.6.5  Policy D 5 sets out how development proposals will be considered in relation 
to the Local Ecological Network  including the strategically important 
internationally and national significant  habitats . More detailed biodiversity 
policies relating to other part of the LEN are included later in the Plan 
(Policies LE5 -LE8) . 
 
POLICY D5: THE LOCAL  ECOLOGICAL NETWORK A ND 
INTERNATIONALLY AND NATIONALLY IMPORTANT  SITES  
 
1. Developmen t which results in harm to the L ocal Ecological Network 
will not be permitted unless the need for, and benefits of the 
development outweighs the harm. If harm cannot be avoided 
measures which mitigate or compensate that harm will be required.  
Details are set out in the rele vant policies for the following:  
 
a) Internationally important habitats (see Habitats Regulations and 
Part 2 of this Policy) ; 
b) Nationally important habitats (see Part 3 of this Policy ); 
c) Locally designated nature conservation sites ( see Policy LE5); 
d) Protecting species and other features of nature conservation 
importance (see Policy LE6); 
e) Protecting tree, woodland and hedge coverage (See Policy LE7). 
 
In addition opportunities should be taken to enhance the Local 
Ecological Network including securing measureable biodiversity 
net gain (see Policy LE8 and the policies cited above) and 
improving connections between sites . 
 
2. The integrity of internationally i mportant sites will be subject to the 
highest level of protection as set out in the relevant international 
and national regulations , and development will need to take 
account of the following considerations : 
 
a) Development that will result in any adverse effect on the 
integrity of  a designated international site will not be permitted 
unless it can be demonstrated that:  
 
i) there are no alternatives to the proposal;  
ii) there are reasons of overriding public benefit/interest;  
iii) compensatory provision is secured; and  
iv) the Local Planning Authority  is satisfied that any necessary 
mitigation is secured such that in-combination  with other 
development there will be no adverse effects on the integrity 
of the designated sites.  
 
b) Development which has the potential to have an i mpact on a 
designated international site will be subject to a Habitats 
Regulation Assessment to determine the potential for likely 
significant effects.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
77  
c) All new residential development will be required to avoid or 
mitigate likely significant ‘alone’ and ‘ in-combination’ effects on 
internationally important habitats caused by recreational 
disturbance. In addition other forms of development52 may be 
required to mitigate recreational disturbance impacts.  Where 
these measures cannot be provided development prop osals will 
be refused, unless the applicant can demonstrate, subject to 
meeting the tests of the Habitats Regulations, there would not 
be a likely significant effect on the Solent SPAs.  
 
d) Proposals that have a detrimental impact on Brent goose and/or 
wader feeding and roosting sites that support the functionality 
and integrity of the internationally important designated sites 
will be refused unless it can be satisfactorily avoided and/or 
mitigated in accordance with the Solent Waders and Brent 
Goose Strategy .   
 
e) Proposals will need to demonstrate nutrient neutrality to avoid 
having a detrimental impact on the recognised features of the 
internationally important habitats . It is therefore necessary for 
developers  to submit a nutrient budget in line with the latest 
guidance and deliver nutrient neutral development through : 
 
i) Achieving a water efficiency target of 100 litres per person 
per day ; and  
ii) Prioritising on -site mitigation measures including the 
provision of green open space and SuDS, where appropriate ; 
and 
iii) Securing off -site strategic mitigation options, such as land 
offsetting, the creation of interceptor wetlands and 
enhancements to wastewater treatment works.  
 
3. Planning permission will not normally be grante d for development 
if it directly or indirectly harms a Site of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSI) and the following considerations  will need to be taken into 
account:   
 
a) Development that affects a SSSI will only be permitted where it 
has been demonstrated that:  
 
i) the objectives of the designated area and overall integrity 
would not be compromised; or  
ii) any significant adverse effects on the qualities for which the 
area has been designated are clearly outweighed by social 
and economic benefits of national impor tance.  
 
 
                                            
52 See provisions set out in paragraph of the justification text and within th e Solent Recreation Mitigation 
Strategy.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
78 b) In the exceptional circumstances where development that 
affects a SSSI is permitted the Borough Council will use 
conditions or planning obligations to ensure the protection of 
the site’s nature conservation interest and that any adverse 
impacts are appropriately mitigated for, with compensatory 
measures only used as a last resort.  
 
4. Applications for development which could impact the Local 
Ecological Network should include adequate and proportionate 
information to enable a proper assessment of the  implications 
taking into account the importance of the site in the designation 
hierarchy. They should also be supported by mitigation plans 
and/or compensation plans informed by the assessment of harm 
which would deliver a net gain for biodiversity (see P olicy LE 8) and 
which set out the long -term  management of any measures.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLICY  D5 
Overview  
2.6.6  The importance of local ecological networks (LEN) for biodiversity is 
recognised in the NPPF. It states that it is necessary to protect and enhance 
the natural environment including helping to improve biodiversity and 
promoting the establishment of coherent ecological networks that are more 
resilient to current and future pressures.  It also advises that plans should 
take a strategic approach to maintai ning and strengthening networks of 
habitats and green infrastructure and to plan across local authority 
boundaries. Policy D5 aims to ensure that ecological connectivity is a key 
consideration in achieving sustainable development.  
 
2.6.7  The NPPF requires that local plans should identify, map and safeguard 
components of local wildlife -rich habitats and wider ecological networks. 
This includes the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated 
sites, wildlife corridors and the stepping stones that con nect them, and 
areas identified by national and local partnerships for habitat management, 
enhancement, restoration or creation.  Plans should promote the 
conservation, restoration and enhancement of priority habitats, ecological 
networks and the protection  and recovery of priority species; and identify 
and pursue opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity. 
The elements of the Local Ecological Network for Gosport are defined in 
Policy D5 and form part of a larger network covering the wh ole of 
Hampshire  and beyond . Key terms included in Policy D5 are explained  in 
the online  glossary.  
 
2.6.8  The LEN is based on work undertaken by the Hampshire Biodiversity 
Information Centre (HBIC) on behalf of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight 
Local Nature Partnership (LNP) which includes local authorities and 
agencies such as the Environment Agency and Natural England. It has been 
informed by the environmental records held by HBIC.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
79  
2.6.9  A plan of the LEN has been produced by HBIC and will be regularly updated 
to take into account new survey information and changes to the network 
such as new designations and updated habitat mapping. A simplified 
version is available on the Council’s Policies Map webpage53. Not all the 
features are shown on the plan due to issues o f scale and consequently for 
more detailed information it will be necessary to consult with HBIC directly.  
 
2.6.10  The proposed LEN should not be viewed as a constraint to development 
and the policy and LEN plan must be read in conjunction with the other 
policies  in the Local Plan including the other nature conservation policies.   
The definition of the network can inform the development of initial proposals 
and highlight particular issues in respect of both on -site and off -site impacts 
and the potential for enhanc ement.  These can be taken into account when  
masterplanning and design ing schemes and can inform the scope for 
appropriate mitigation and compensation both on and off -site. 
Impact on the Local Ecological Network (Point  1 of Policy D5)  
2.6.11  It will be necessary t o ensure that development does not have a detrimental 
impact on the overall network.  The assessment of the impact of 
development will need to take account of the relationship of the proposed 
development to components of the LEN both in terms of its proximi ty, the 
proposed end use and the impact of that use on it. The impact of any 
construction activity would also need to be considered. Provisions for 
internationally and  nationally important habitats are set out later in this policy  
and provisions for locall y designated sites and protected species are 
considered further in Policies LE5, LE6 and LE7.  
 
2.6.12  All development should adhere to a core environmental planning principle 
called the mitigation hierarchy. Under this approach shown below, the 
starting point for  all development is to avoid harm, and only if not  possible , 
to progress through the options. Development which does not follow the 
mitigation hierarchy will be refused.  It should be noted that the mitigation  
hierarchy  is separate  from any consideration  under the Conservation  of 
Habitats  and Species  Regulations  2017.  
 
 Avoid: where possible habitat damage should be avoided ; 
 Minimise: Where possible habitat damage and loss should be 
minimised ; 
 Remediate: where possible any damaged or lost habitat should be 
restored ; 
 Compensate: As a last resort, damaged or lost habitat should be 
compensated for.  
 
2.6.13  The NPPF aims to facilitate development that makes a positive contribution 
in terms of reducing the fragmentation of wildlife sites and maximising the 
ecological lin kages between them.  Harm to the LEN can occur where:

 as a result of the development the quality of the existing ecological 
interest is diminished;  
 the extent of an existing nature conservation site, wildlife corridor or 
stepping stone is reduced;  and 
 deve lopment impedes the functioning of the ecological network i.e. the 
potential for movement for wildlife within or through the network is 
impacted.  
 
2.6.14  There are a number of ways in which the impact of development on the LEN 
can be mitigated and improvements t o it achieved including:  
 
 Through the careful design of layouts to facilitate the movement of 
wildlife;  
 The use of new landscape planting informed by local biodiversity 
priorities; and  
 Inclusion of specific building features such as green roofs, bat boxes,  
swift br icks and sparrow terraces.  
 
2.6.15  The LEN mapping contains an  opportunity  area layer  which  highlights  those  
areas  of the LEN which  have  the potential to be improved or managed in a 
way that can achieve biodiversity net gain.  
 
2.6.16  Where new green infrastructure assets are to be provided their design 
should consider how biodiversity can be incorporated without compromising 
their primary function . For example , if areas are intended for recreation 
purposes these may be easily managed to promote biodiv ersity without 
restricting the intended recreational provision.  
 
2.6.17  Allocations for development proposed in the Local Plan include specific 
measure s to enhance the LEN (see Policies SS1 -11 and A1 -A6). 
Internationally Important Habitats  (Point 2 of Policy D5)  
Overview  (2a and 2b of Policy D5 ) 
2.6.18  The Borough has five internationally important designations which are 
outlined on the Policies Map and summarised in Box 6 . 
 
2.6.19  In addition to the cross -boundary designations, the Borough Council is 
minded that development in the Borough in -combination with other 
developments in the sub -region may in certain circumstances have an effect 
on other international designations . An example is the Solen t and 
Southampton Water SPA which is adjacent to the Borough boundary at Hill 
Head within Fareham Borough. It will also be necessary to protect the 
integrity of these designations including the consideration of the effects of 
development on important sites outsid e the SPA and Ramsar site which  
support important populations of bird specie s such as Brent geese which 
may use a site for feeding and roosting.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
81 2.6.20  In relation to internationally important sites the Government’s Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 201754, which transposes the 
European Union Habitats Directive into national law, is of relevance . These 
are often referred to as the Habitats Regulations. It is now a requirement for 
each local planning authority to conduct a Habitats Regulatio n Assessment 
(HRA ) of relevant development plan documents . Policies and proposals in 
the Gosport Borough Local Plan in-combination  with other plans and 
programmes within the Borough and the sub -region (and beyond) will not be 
acceptable where there is the potential for an adverse impact on the 
features of an internationally important site. The  original HRA Report55 
which accompanied the current Adopted  Local Plan has helped inform the 
approach taken within this first version of the Local Plan toge ther with the 
Council’s ongo ing work in relation to recreational disturbance (Bird Aware 
Solent) and nutrient neutrality. A  HRA Sc reening Assessment accompanies 
this Local Plan  consultation and the Council has commissioned a full 
assessment which will inform the next version of the Local Plan .  
 
2.6.21  Developers should refer to the Habitat Regulations in instances where a 
proposal may impact upon the integrity of such sites. Policy D5 reinforces 
the significance of this issue and includes specific local considerations (such 
as recreational  disturbance and nutrient neutrality) and consequently 
developers will need to consider these matters at the earliest possible stage 
when preparing their proposals and provide sufficient information for the 
Local Planning Authority to undertake the appropr iate assessment.  
 
2.6.22  Any proposal which may have a significant effect upon a European site or a 
species protected by European legislation, either alone or in combination  
with other current proposals and projects, will need to be subject to an 
‘appropriate ass essment’  and is likely to require an Environmental Impact 
Assessment. The information provided by the developer  will enable the 
Local Planning Authority, with guidance from Natural England, to ascertain 
whether the proposal will have an adverse impact on t he nature 
conservation value of a site.  
Recreational Disturbance ( Point 2c of Policy D5) 
2.6.23  It is estimated that 60,000 new homes are planned around the Solent up to 
203456. Research has shown that these will lead to more people visiting the 
coast for recreati on which will potentially create additional disturbance to 
internationally protected birds of the SPAs and have a detrimental impact on 
their survival and breeding rates. In order to understand the issue of 
recreational disturbance and its potential impact  on internationally important 
habitats, extensive detailed research has been undertaken as part of the 
Solent Disturbance and Mitigation Project (SDMP).  This work was 
coordinated by the Solent Forum and has involved a number of 
organisations including Natu ral England, Environment Agency, all the local

the Conservation and Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) 
Regulations 1994.

56 Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy (Bird Aware Solent 2017)  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
82 authorities around the Solent, relevant harbour groups and the RSPB. The 
work has concluded that existing and new residential development is likely 
to have an adverse impact on protected bird species that use the 
internationally important sites as a result of recreational disturbance 
generated by local residents.  
 
2.6.24  Natural England57 have made it clear that the SDMP work represents the 
best available evidence and therefore avoidance and mitigation measures 
are req uired in order  to ensure a significant effect  arising from new housing 
development around the Solent, is avoided. It therefore expects that all 
residential development within a 5.6km ‘Zone of Influence’, which includes 
Gosport Borough in its entirety, cont ributes towards the avoidance and 
mitigation measures.  
 
2.6.25  As a result of this requirement the relevant authorities including GBC formed 
the Solent Recreation Mitigation Partnership (SRMP)  which uses the  name 
‘Bird Aware Solent’58 for its day to day work and public engagement.  
 
2.6.26  The SRMP has now produced the Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy  
(SRMS)58 which was endorsed by PUSH in December 2017 and approved 
by Gosport Borough Council in January 2018. The Strategy aims to prevent 
bird disturbance from recreational activity which it seeks to do through a 
series of management measures which actively encourage all coastal 
visito rs to enjoy their visits in a responsible manner rather than restricting 
access to the coast or preventing activities that take place there.  
 
2.6.27  The Strategy has been drafted to provide the necessary mitigation for 
planned new development up to 203459 with an in-perpetuity fund to 
continue to mitigate against the recreational impacts of this additional house 
building  for a further 80 years (2114).  The Strategy set s out the following:  
 
 An overview of the legislation;  
 The need for mitigation including an overvie w of the extensive 
research undertaken and its key findings;  
 The overall approach and benefits o f having a joint s trategy;  
 The mitigation measures;  
 Resources and funding;  
 Developer contributions; and  
 Implementation, governance and reporting . 
 
2.6.28  The Strategy deals with all new residential development  and in this context 
includes net new dwellings created through the sub -division of existing 
dwellings, second homes, dwellings to be used as holiday accommodation, 
self-contained student accommodation60 and new acc ommodation approved

taken due to particular characteristics as set out in the Strategy.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
83 through the  Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2015 , where provision is made to ensure that such 
proposals need to comply with the Habitats Regulations.  
 
2.6.29  The need for mitigation for the recreational impact of other types of 
residential accommodation such as residential accommodation designed 
specifically for elderly people or new hotels or other tourist accommodation 
will be assessed on a case -by-case basis  by the Local Planning Authority . 
The key test is based around the likelihood of the proposed development 
generating additional recreational visits to the SPA. Further details are set 
out in the SRMS.  
 
2.6.30  The Council has produced the Gosport Bird Disturbance Mitigation 
Protocol61 which is regularly updated setting out the latest agreed financial 
contributions of the scheme for each size of dwellings as well as 
arrangements for payment and other background information.  The 
contribution will be increased on 1st April each year in line with the Retail 
Price Index.  
 
2.6.31  It is important to recognise that there is no obligation for a developer to 
make contributions towards the SRMS and it is open to them to pursue 
other ways to mitigate the effects of their scheme. Such s chemes will be 
subject to assessment under the Habitats Regulations as to their  suitability 
and effectiveness and will need to provide mitigation that is funded in -
perpetuity. Such stand -alone schemes should not rely solely on measures 
put in place within the development . 
 
2.6.32  The SRMS is aiming to deliver a positive management approach to mitigate 
the recreational disturbance issue on the coast rather than trying to prevent 
access to it.  It focusses on informing and educating all users of the coast so 
as to in fluence how they behave when visiting the Solent.  It is therefore 
considered an effective and efficient mechanism for developers to mitigate 
the increased recreational pressure  generated by the proposed 
development  on the inte rnationally important habitats . 
 
2.6.33  It is important to recognise that in some instances an individual scheme , 
when accounting for their scale or particular location with the SPA , may 
need a site-specific  package of mitigation measures in addition to the 
financial contribution required for the SRMS in -combination effect, in order 
to ensure effective avoidance/mitigation of impacts on the SPA.  A very large 
scheme for example could have a disproportionate im pact on a particular 
sensitive section of the coast.  Other potential considerations are set out in 
the SRMS. The Council, with advice from Natural England, will consider the 
mitigation requirements for such  proposals on a case -by-case basis. 
Developers are  encouraged to hold early discussions  with the Council on 
the mitigation which will be needed for such schemes.

84 Feeding and roosting sites that are functionally linked to the 
internationally important designated sites for Brent goose and waders 
(Point  2d of Policy D5) 
2.6.34  There are a number of terrestrial sites used by Brent geese and waders 
which are located outside of the Solent SPAs but as these sites are 
frequently used by SPA species (including qualifying features and 
assemblage species) it supports the functionality and integrity of the 
designated sites. The land in many instances significantly contributes 
towards the SPA’s conservation objectives. The use of such sites is 
functionally linked for feeding and r oosting.  Such sites in Gosport  include 
playin g fields and parks or grasslands within Ministry of Defence sites. 
Developments on , or adjacent to , these areas can have an impact on the 
SPAs which may be additional to the impacts set out above.  
 
2.6.35  The Solent Waders and Brent Goose  Strategy62 has been prepa red by 
Natural England and a range of other organisations63 and includes interim 
guidance on mitigation and off -setting requirements . The guidance 
document for the Strategy identifies the areas of supporting habitat and 
grades them into five categories64: 
 
 Core A reas;  
 Primary S upport Areas;  
 Secondary Support A reas; 
 Low Use Sites; and  
 Candidate Sites.  
 
2.6.36  Proposals on or adjacent to such sites must be assessed in accordance with 
the Habitats Regulations in order to determine the levels of impact the 
development proposal will have alone and/or in -combination with other 
plans and projects. Suitable avoidance and mitigation measures will be 
required depending on the category of the Brent goose/wader site, 
proportionate to its use by the Solent SPA bird population. The relevant 
measures are set out in the guidance and must be put in place prior to 
development ta king place and be confirmed through a legal agreement.  
 
2.6.37  Candidate Sites contain some record of Brent geese or wader use, but 
further surveys will be necessary to determine the classification of these 
sites. To confirm the classification of a Candidate Site , the follow ing amount 
of survey data will be required:  
 
 Two consecutive years survey where there ha s only been one survey 
to date.  
 One year survey where there have  been two or more surveys to date .

85 2.6.38  Surveys should follow a suitable survey methodology (such as the one set 
out in the Solent Waders and Brent Geese Strategy) and suitable bodies 
should be consulted throughout the process.  
Nutrient Neutrality (Point 2e of Policy D5)  
2.6.39  Since 2019, Natural England have been issuing guidance that under the 
Habita t Regulations all new developments in the Solent must be ‘nutrient 
neutral’ so as not to contribute towa rds eutrophication at European 
designated sites. 
 
2.6.40  As such, all residential proposals and those which include overnight 
accommodation65 will be required to submit a nutrient budget alongside their 
submission. There may also be some commercial or industrial projects 
which  would cause an increase in nitrogen discharges and would be subject 
to a case -by-case approach.  
 
2.6.41  A nutrient budget shou ld be drawn up according to the latest Natural 
England guidance, and be accompanied by a statement on how nutrient 
mitigation (if required) will be secured and provided prior to the occupation 
of the development. The delivery of this mitigation will be sec ured through a 
S106 agreement and planning conditions, as necessary.  
 
2.6.42  Suitable mitigation will include residential development achieving a high 
level of water efficiency of 100 litres per person per day as required under 
Policy DE1. Priority should be give n to on -site mitigation measures where 
available, including green open space and SuDS. Off -site measures include 
land offsetting schemes, the creation of interceptor wetlands and 
enhancements to wastewater treatment works.  
 
2.6.43  In many instances in the Borough , particularly brownfield sites, it will be 
necessary for developers to secure off -site measures. The Council is 
working on a sub -regional basis to provide a comprehensive mitigation 
scheme which developers can contribu te towards. In the meantime PfSH 
can provide developers with a list of third party schemes which can deliver 
nitrate credits as part of a land off -setting scheme within the catchment 
area66. 
 
2.6.44  Further details can be found on the Council’s webpage67 and in the Natural 
England guidance.

86 Nationall y Important Habitats  - Sites of Special Scientific Interest  
(Point 3 of Policy D5 ) 
2.6.45  The Borough’s S ites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI s) are designated 
and protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended by 
the Country side and Rights of Way Act 2000. The Borough contains all or 
part of five SSSIs which are outlined in Box 6 and defined on the Policies 
Map. 
 
2.6.46  The Borough Council recognises the significant  ecological and geological 
importance of SSSIs and will consult Natu ral England  (or where appropriate 
use its relevant standing advice)  when considering planning applications 
affecting these sites. The Borough Council will aim to protect these sites 
from the direct and indirect impacts of development. In exceptional cases,  
there may be occasions when the importance of the development will justify 
damage to a SSSI. Such occasions may occur when there is an overriding 
need for the development and the reasons for the development clearly 
outweigh the value of the site itself. I n such instances developers must 
prove that the need for a development clearly overrides the Government’s 
policy to safeguard the intrinsic nature conservation value of SSSIs. Where 
development is permitted the Local Planning Authority will use conditions or 
planning obligations to ensure appropriate measures are taken to mitigate 
for any adverse im pacts that are likely to occur with compensatory 
measures only used as a last resort.  
Supporting information (Point 4 of Policy D5)  
2.6.47  Proposals should be informed by proportionate information on the 
biodiversity interests of the site and adjoining area including an assessment 
of a site’s significance towards the functioning of the Local Ecological 
Network (LEN) . Developers are encouraged to engage with the Local 
Planning Authority  at an early stage in the process to ensure that the 
potential implications of the LEN are taken into account in the preparation of 
proposals.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D6  
Overview (Point 1 of Policy D6)  
2.7.1  The Alver Valley, Browndown and Stokes Bay are  by far the largest area of 
open space in the Borough and forms a significant undeveloped gap 
between Gosport and Lee -on-the-Solent and together with the extensive 
clifflands and beach at Lee -on-the Solent form the Gosport Strategic Open 
Spaces (GSOS). It is the Borough’s objective to retain, protect and enhance 
these precious assets for future generations as public open space with new 
development limited to specific brownfield sites and where it has been 
identified as supporting improvements in the physica l and mental health of 
local communities.  
 
2.7.2  The COVID -19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of access to 
open space for all. With out the Alver Valley, Browndown,  Lee Beach and 
Clifflands, and Stokes Bay, the residents of Borough would have no access 
to significant open space within its boundary at a time when the movement 
of the public has been  restricted by Government legislation.  
 
2.7.3  The Borough Council also intends to continue to manage existing and newly 
acquir ed areas within the GSOS  by providing a r ange of recreational 
opportunities for the public in appropriate locations compatible with the 
objectives of protecting wildlife and enhancing habitats.  
Alver Valley Country Park (Point 2 of Policy D6)  
2.7.4  The Alver Valley forms a significant undeveloped gap b etween Gosport and 
Lee-on-the-Solent. Part of the Alver Valley has been used for gravel 
extraction and subsequent restoration works have been completed. The 
Alver Valley encompasses a great diversity of habitats and landscapes 
including a range of wetlands , woodlands and grasslands. It is an important 
corridor linking the open land to the north with the coast. Much of the Alver 
Valley is now accessible to the public and owned  or controlled  by the 
Borough Council. The Alver Valley is identified by the Partne rship for South 
Hampshire as being of sub -regional significance representing a strategic 
element of the South Hampshire Green Infrastructure Network . It has also 
been identified as a Suitable Accessible Natural Greenspace (SANG) and 
consequently is conside red as one of a network of sites that can help deflect 
recreational pressure from sensitive habitats in the sensitive area.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
90 2.7.5  The Council adopted a strategy for the Alver Valley Country Park68 in April 
2014. The strategy includes the following vision which criterion 2 of Policy 
D4 seeks to support the delivery of:  
 
The Alver Valley Country Park will be an interesting and exciting natural 
location for all the community incorporating a variety of  recreational and 
educational activities for the whole community. It will be a place for having 
fun, exercising, exploring and socialising. More local residents and others in 
South Hampshire will be able to enjoy all the Country Park has to offer and 
utilise the enhanced facilities and services. The Country Park will be a well -
managed, safe and desirable place to visit.  
 
It will offer wildlife experiences and splendid views across the Solent, the 
Borough of Gosport and beyond. Habitats will continue to be m anaged and 
where possible enhanced; and the net increase of biodiversity will be 
integral to the establishment and ongoing management of the Country Park. 
Heritage assets will be managed, their significance understood and this will 
be communicated to visit ors. 
 
2.7.6  Visitor numbers to the  Alver Valley  has been increasing and the value of this 
strategic open space has been widely appreciated during the pandemic. 
There is significant potential to further increase the number of visitors. The 
Country Park will be im portant for providing a range of recreational 
opportunities to local residents and thereby reduce the need for residents to 
travel out of the Borough to access similar facilities and therefore reduce car 
trips and lengths of journeys. The Country Park will  also promote healthy 
living which can potentially reduce certain health problems evident within the 
Borough. By providing a facility in this location the proposal will reduce 
recreational disturbance on more sensitive habitats in other parts of the sub -
region. 
 
2.7.7  Since the current Local Plan has been adopted there have been a number 
of improvements delivered in the Country Park.  These include:  
 
 Provision of two new car parks at the East and West Gateway with  
interpretation panels and attractive landscaping  
 The creation of new trails and routes including a spine route through 
the park for cyclists ; 
 The development of a major play area at the Western Gateway with a 
toilet block and food and drink facility ; 
 Creation of a major BMX track with associated pump cyc ling track ; 
 Biodiversity enhancements . 
 
2.7.8  The Alver Valley Country Park Strategy identifies a number of projects 
which will be imp lemented over the Plan period. The proposal for a new 
garden centre has recently been granted planning permission and will 
provi de an additional attraction to the Country Park and will provide café, 
toilet, information and meeting facilities for visitors . It will also be a source of 
                                            
68 www.gosport.gov.uk/avcpmanagement   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
91 revenue for the Country Park’s overall upkeep as well as increasing  footfall 
at other facilities and  attractions. It has been one of the Council’s key 
objectives that the garden centre should provide modern facilities for visitors 
to the Country Park and consequently this provision has been secured as 
part of the planning consent.  
 
2.7.9  Activities and events increase footfall and encourage a wider range of 
visitors to the Park. They provide educational, social and recreational 
opportunities for the local population as well as in some cases potentially 
providing additional revenue for the Country Park.  
 
2.7.10  It is important that the site has adequate and well -designed car and 
motorcycle parking arrangements to serve the increased number of visitors. 
Ultimately each of the three gateways will have a car park and will be 
sensitively designed with permeable surfacing (w here appropriate), 
welcome signage, interpretation and site plans. Each will incorporate 
attractive landscaping.  
 
2.7.11  It is important that the proposed limited new buildings and car parking in the 
Alver Valley do not increase surface water run -off and that sus tainable 
drainage systems are incorporated where appropriate which can also assist 
with local biodiversity. Due to the site’s history as a landfill site it will be 
necessary to undertake a site assessment for each proposal in order to 
establish the nature and extent of contamination. It will be necessary to 
ensure that proposals for new facilities and associated drainage systems do 
not act as a pathway for pollutants. For example soakaways in areas of 
contamination would not be acceptable due to the risk to  the water 
environment. Practicable and effective mea sures will be required to treat, 
contain or control contaminants in order to protect proposed users or 
prevent the spread of contamination to adjacent land or cause pollution to 
groundwater, the River Al ver or the Solent.  
Protecting Browndown, Stokes Bay and the Lee Beach and Clifflands 
(Point 3 of Policy D6)  
2.7.12  Browndown is a vegetated shingle with associated habitats to the south of 
the Alver Valley Country Park , adjacent to the coast at the eastern end of 
Lee-on-the-Solent. It has had various uses over time including military 
training and farming. In 1987 the Browndown site was designated a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest  (SSSI).  
 
2.7.13  In 1990 Browndown was inclu ded in the M oD list of managed conservation 
areas. The area is still used by the armed services for emergency fuel 
handling and for on -shore amphibious landings. The ranges at Browndown 
are open to the public when not in use by the military for various day  and 
night exercises, which include amphibious beach landings.  
 
2.7.14  The shoreline of Stokes Bay is a crescent -shaped , south -west facing shingle 
beach, running from Browndown Point at its north -west end to Gilkicker 
Point in the south east. Behind the beach is a low -lying open area that was DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
92 formerly a tidal marsh. Stokes Bay is now characterised by a mixture of 
suburban and seaside development but also retains evidence of an unusual 
variety of historically -significant coastal defences that were built between the  
late 16th and the mid -20th century.  
 
2.7.15  The distinctive coastal topography, formed in part by the longshore drift of 
shingle from west to east, remained largely unaltered until the 18th century 
and was a significant influence on later development. The marsh behind the 
beach included the course of the River Alver and a lake, and was bounded 
on its inland side by a low natural cliff or bluff. The river initially flowed south 
to reach the north -west end of Stokes Bay, but was diverted south -
eastwards by the shin gle at Browndown Point. It meandered through the 
marsh and the lake before turning south again to reach the sea near 
Gilkicker Point.  
 
2.7.16  The Stokes Bay Marsh, the natural watercourse, the lake and the cliff to the 
north were all adapted in the construction of a succession of defensive 
earthworks. Upstream of Stokes Bay the river flowed through Gomer Marsh, 
which was also was utilised as part of the defences. Another major addition 
to the Stokes Bay defences was the construction of Fort Gilkicker, which still  
dominates the headland at the south -east end of the bay.  
 
2.7.17  Stokes Bay now has the appearance of an open and diverse coastal 
landscape, including areas of managed semi -natural habitat alongside 
seaside facilities and suburban development. Large fortificatio ns still 
dominate the area and extensive archaeological evidence survives of former 
defensive features. The largest site, Fort Monckton, is well preserved but 
occupied by the Ministry of Defence and not accessible. The other historic 
sites have been adapte d for a wide variety of new uses, some in -keeping 
with their original function but others effectively disguising their military past.  
The Number 2 Battery now accommodates the Diving Museum.  
 
2.7.18  The Borough will be consulting on a draft Conservation Area Appr aisal for 
Stokes Bay given that  the area has sufficient architectural and historic 
interest to be considered for this designation. This draft policy supports the 
proposed designation.  
 
2.7.19  Lee-On-The-Solent beach and clifflands is a long narrow area between th e 
shoreline and the built -up promenade. The beach is a shingle bank and 
faces south -west over the Solent towards the Isle of Wight and the New 
Forest coastline between Calshot and Lepe. Above the beach is the hard 
surface Solent Beach Path which forms part  of the regionally important 
Solent Way. Either side of the Solent Beach Path is a predominantly 
grassed area, with some areas of car parking. The area plays an important 
role in maintaining an open character in Lee and provides a coastal link 
between Gosp ort and the undeveloped coastline to the n orth of Stubbington 
in Fareham.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
93 Additional areas within the GSOS (Point 4 of Policy D6)  
2.7.20  Fort Road is a Council -owned area of open space and parking adjacent to 
Fort Monckton, Gosport & Stokes Bay Golf Club , and th e western end of 
Haslar Barracks. The site will be retained for public open space with the 
objective of providing a coastal park with additional play facilities for the 
residents of Haslar and Anglesey. The site will should include improved 
routes for the Solent Way and the national coast path.  
 
2.7.21  Lee-On-The-Solent Golf Club  is located north of the Alver Valley Country 
Park partly in Gosport Borough and partly in Fareham Borough. The portion 
of the golf club within Gosport is included within the GSOS to prov ide 
additional protection to this area as open space - in whatever form, in the 
event that the residual area in Fareham was released for development. The 
area is partly covered by a Site of Importance to Nature Conservation 
(SINC) designation.  
 
2.7.22  North and east of the golf club is an L -shaped area of land that forms a 
partly open corridor between two tree belts. This area includes the River 
Alver. The area is covered by a Site of Importance to Nature Conservation 
(SINC) designation. The Council considers tha t this area has significant 
potential to provide an off -road pedestrian and cycle route between Brune 
Way and Rowner Road.  
Proposed enhancements to the GSOS (Point  5 of Policy D6)  
2.7.23  The Borough has four improvement projects it will seek to bring forward in 
the plan period with regard to the GSOS.  
 
2.7.24  The first project is to provide an off -road cycle route between Fort Road car 
park, which itself is identified for public open space improvements in Policy 
SS7 (Haslar Barracks) and Lifeboat Lane, which connects St okes Bay Road 
to Gosport Lifeboat Station. Cycling on Fort Road, particularly for younger 
people or inexperienced cyclists, can be a somewhat intimidating 
experience given the speed of vehicles and the narrow and winding 
character of the road. This new off -road route would be facilitated on land 
associated with the brownfield Qinetiq Fort Road site, which itself is 
immediately to the south of Fort Road. Any redevelopment proposals on the 
Qinetiq site must take account of this and any would be secured throug h a 
planning obligation associated with its redevelopment.  
 
2.7.25  The second project relates to the extension and enhancement of the Alver 
Way which links the Apple Dumpling Bridge within the Alver Valley to Stokes 
Bay.  Where the opportunity arises it is propos ed to extend the route 
northwards through the Country Park which would ideally include land 
currently in private ownership. The route would then extend northwards 
linking with green infrastructure improvements in the Fareham, Gosport, 
Lee-on-the-Solent and  Stubbington Strategic Gap. Similarly there may be 
opportunities to extend the route south of Browndown Road on the west 
side of the river through Browndown itself to the shoreline and Stokes Bay.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
94 2.7.26  The third project is to improve drainage in the Alver Vall ey because of the 
extent of localised flood events caused by periodic blockages of the Alver 
outfall. This will be delivered through a beach management scheme and an 
enhanced management regime of removing shingle from the outfall.  
 
2.7.27  The fourth and final pro ject is to integrate the playing fields at the southern 
end of HMS Sultan, if that site is released, within the Alver Valley. This 
would be a very long -term project and would likely necessitate improved 
pedestrian access across Grange Road and Privett Road . 
Allocated Sites (Point 5 of Policy D6)  
2.7.28  All three sites are allocated for development in Policies A1 or A4 for the 
following uses.  
 
Commercial Leisure  
 
2.7.29  Browndown Camp is a former MoD site immediately south of the Alver 
Valley. It is considered to be an appropriate site for outdoor leisure use or 
non-permanent holiday accommodation (tents, touring caravans, motor -
homes and self -catering cabins) of a density in line with Government 
guidance is ac ceptable in principle. Suitably -scaled ancillary facilities c ould 
also be acceptable.  
 
Residential or Commercial Development  
 
2.7.30  Fort Gilkicker is located at Stokes Bay overlooking the Solent. The fort has a 
particular landmark quality due to its unique architecture and physical 
dominance as a result of its height, sc ale and position. Fort Gilkicker is 
considered to be a suitable site for commercial or residential uses which 
retains and enhances the heritage assets.  
 
Mixed -use – Residential, Access and Public Open Space  
 
2.7.31  The former Qinetiq Dive Test Centre is a brownfi eld site of approximately 
9.0ha south of Fort Road. The site has been vacant since 2012 and has 
over 3,500 sq.m.  of buildings across the central portion of the site which 
also includes a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The outer portions of the site 
are design ated as open space in the current Local Plan. The Council 
considers that the central portion of the site is suitable for new housing , 
subject to the protection and enhancement of heritage assets.  In conjunction 
with this housing a new off -road route should  be provided in line with 
criterion 5 above. The residual area of open space should also be made 
publicly accessible and this will be secured through a suitable planning 
obligation.  
Design and development considerations (Point 6a -f of Policy D6)  
2.7.32  As stated in the introduction and emphasised in Government guidance there 
are numerous opportunities where planning and the wellbeing of local 
communities are linked. Point 6 links to more detailed policies in the Local DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
95 Plan which aim to secure an improved outcomes in terms of walking and 
cycling, biodiversity enhancement, landscape improvement and high quality  
design, heritage assets, community facilities, flood risk and designated 
environmental sites.  
 
2.7.33  It is clear that within the GSOS the design of new buildings and spaces, and 
routes within and between them are vitally important to encourage positive 
physical and mental health benefits as well as prevent accidents a nd 
encourage active lifestyles.  
 
2.7.34  More detailed requirements are set out in each of the cross -refere nced 
policies as well as guidance set out in the Government’s National Design 
Guide.

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
96 2.8 POLICY D 7: FLOOD RISK AND COA STAL EROSION  
Introduction  
2.8.1  Flood events are becoming more frequent in the UK and the effects of 
climate change over the longer term mean that managing flood risk is an 
increasingly important issue in planning for development and assessing 
planning applications.  Effective management of this risk can be achieved 
through lo cational choices, and where necessary, ensuring that appropriate 
mitigation measures are put in place to protect the development and the 
wider community.  
 
BOX  7: What are Fluvial Flood Zones?  
There are three Flood Zones (1, 2 and 3) which are defined by the 
Environment Agency.   
 
Flood Zones refer to the probability of flooding from rivers and the sea and 
ignore the presence of existing defences because these can be breached, 
overtopped and may  not be in existence for the lifetime of the development.  
 
Flood Zone 1  is the lowest probability of flooding comprising of land that 
has less than 1 in 1000 annual probability of river or sea flooding (<0.1%).  
 
Flood Zone 2  is land assessed as having betw een a 1 in 100 and a 1 in 
1000 probability of river flooding (1% -0.1%) or between a 1 in 200 and a 1 in 
1000 annual probability of sea flooding (0.5% -0.1)% in any one year.  
 
Flood Zone 3  is the highest risk area and is land assessed as having 1 in 
100 yea rs or greater annual probability of river flooding (>1%) or a 1 in 200 
or greater annual probability of flooding from the sea in any year (>0.5%) .69 
 
Local Context  
2.8.2  Flood risk is a very important issue for the Borough given its coastal 
location. A total of 363 hectares of land is located within Flood Zones 2 and 
3 representing 13% of the Borough’s land area  (see Plan 8). It is important 
that the risk to development from flooding is minimised through the 
protection of the natural floodpla in and the tidal  regions.

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
98 POLICY D 7: FLOOD RISK A ND COASTAL EROSION  
 
1. The Borough Council will expect development proposals in areas at 
risk of flooding to demonstrate that they are necessary and can be 
made safe without increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere in the 
Borough in accorda nce with policies in the NPPF.  
 
2. For development proposals on sites not allocated in the Local Plan, 
it must be clearly demonstrated that the sequential approach for 
site selection has been followed and the Sequential Test has been 
met. Where it is necessary to apply the Exception Test, all the 
associated criteria in the NPPF (or national policy equivalent) must 
be met to the satisfaction of the  Council.  
 
3. A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) will be required for 
development proposals on those sites which are 1 hectare or more 
in Flood Zone 1 and for all development on land within Flood Zones 
2 and 3. The FRA must also clearly demonstrate t hat: 
 
a) any residual risks can be safely managed ; and 
b) safe access and egress to and from the site.  
 
In exceptional circumstances where this is not be possible to 
achieve then clear and detailed justification as to why this is the 
case will be required. In such cases, the developer will be required 
to provide an appropriate standard of safe refuge(s) and associated 
facilities within the development. In these circumstances a robust 
flood warning and evacuation plan would need to be submitted with 
the developm ent proposal.  
 
4. All new development must ensure there will be no net increase in 
surface water run -off. 
 
5. Proposals for major developments in areas at risk of flooding 
should incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). Such 
systems must address the foll owing elements : 
 
a) be designed in accordance with the latest best practice;  
b) ensure that sewerage, sewage disposal facilities and surface 
water drainage of adequate capacity and design are available;  
c) that the required capacity will be provided prior to occupation of 
the development; and  
d) appropriate arrangements must be put in place for their 
ownership and whole life maintenance and management.  
 
6. Buildings and sewerage infrastructure should be designed to 
incorporate flood resilience and flood resistance measures . 
 
7. Developer contributions may be required for the redesign and/or 
replacement  of existing flood defences and the provision of new DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
99 flood risk management measures as appropriate. Where required, 
land will be safeguarded from development in order to provide for 
current or future flood risk management.  
 
8. Planning permission will be granted for flood risk management  
measures provided the scheme does not individually or 
cumulatively have a detrimental impact on internationally important 
habitats and that any necessary avoidance and mitigation 
measures have been secured.  
 
9. Within areas of coastal change, proposals will only be permitted if 
in accordance with the latest Government guidance  70. 
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D7 
Overarching approach (P oint 1 of Policy D7) 
2.8.3  Managing development and flood risk is an important part of delivering the 
Council’s spatial planning strategy.  A fundamental part of managing flood 
risk is through the avoidance of inappropriate development in areas 
exposed to a higher risk of floodin g or in areas at risk from coastal erosion. 
The key policy message is to guide the most vulnerable development to 
those areas of lowest risk and within the site itself, to ensure that the most 
vulnerable uses should be located to that part of the site wher e the 
probability of risk is lowest , unless there are overriding reason s why this 
cannot be the case.  
 
2.8.4  To achieve this at a local level, the Local Plan retains the flood risk 
management hierarchy approach of Assess -Avoid -Manage and Mitigate  
in order to del iver its long-term planning strategy. There is clearly an 
important role for new development to play through the regeneration of 
major sites such as those within the Harbour Regeneration Area which can 
help deliver improved flood risk management measures t hat will benefit not 
only specific development sites but also the wider community by helping to 
improve the st andard of protection available.  
 
2.8.5  To support the approach outlined above, the Borough Council in partnership 
with the Environment Agency prepared a  ‘Guidance for New Development in 
Flood Risk Areas (More Vulnerable)71. This document sets out the specific 
guidance on the approach for managing flood risk and is relevant for the 
preparation of site -specific Flood  Risk Assessments (FRA).  
 
2.8.6  The River Hamble to Portchester Coastal Flood and Erosion Risk 
Management Strategy (CFERMS) prepared by the Coastal Partners (CP) 
plays a key role in the successful management of flood risk within the 
                                            
70 This is currently set out in the National Planning Practice Guidance: www.gov.uk/guidance/flood -risk-and-
coastal-change   
71 www.gosport.gov.uk/article/1220/Pre -application -advice      DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
100 Borough. The CFERMS was adopted by the Council in 2015 and approved 
by the Environment Agency in 2016.  
Sequential Test and Exception Test (Point 2 of Policy D7) 
2.8.7  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) has been used to inform the 
allocations process and sites allocated in this Local Plan have undergone 
the S equential Test. In addition to the  exception sites allocated in this Local 
Plan through the Urban Regeneration Area policies, there may be some 
instances where development may be allowed in Flood Zones 2 and 3. In 
these cases the requirements of the Sequen tial Test  must be met. If this can 
be demonstrated  the criteria of the  Exception Test will need to be met. 
These development proposals must comply with the requirements of the 
NPPF (or equivalent) and meet all of the criteria of Policy D7. Developers 
must clearly demonstrate through a site -specific FRA that the development 
is safe and will not increase flood risk elsewhere in the Borough.  The latest 
National Planning Practice Guidance (or equivalent) provides detailed 
guidance on what matters a site -specifi c FRA should contain to assist 
developers.  
Site-specific Flood Risk Assessment (Point 3 of Policy D7) 
2.8.8  It is a key objective of the Local Plan to deliver development in a safe and 
sustainable way minimising flood risk to and from development.  For all 
develo pment proposals greater than 1 hectare in Flood Zone 172 and for all 
new development proposed in Flood Zones 2 and  3 irrespective of size; a 
site-specific FRA will be required.  The Coun cil will expect a site-specific -
FRA to address a number of key factors i ncluding : 
 
 the management of surface -water run -off; 
 how the residual risk will be managed over the lifetime of the 
development ; 
 the funding and maintenance of the appropriate level of infras tructur e; 
and 
 the need to take account of the latest climate change  projections .  
 
2.8.9  A FRA will also be required for new development (including changes of use 
to a more vulnerable category) where sources of flooding other than tidal 
and/or fluvial are identified through the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
(SFRA) for example surface water flooding.  
 
2.8.10  General advice on the preparation of FRAs can be found in the publication 
‘Guidance for New Development in Flood Risk Areas (More Vulnerable 
Development) which was prepared by the Borough Council in partnership 
with the Env ironment Agency. This document provides advice for 
developers on specific flood risk issues and what measures should be 
considered in order to addr ess them in site-specific  FRAs.  
 
                                            
72 See NPPF (2021) Footnote 55  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
101 2.8.11  The SFRA produced by the Council for the Local Plan can be used to guide 
developers in preparing site-specific -FRAs and further guidance can also be 
sought from the ‘Preparing a flood risk assessment’ standing advice page in 
the NPPG (or equivalent). To  summarise, when preparing site -specific 
FRAs, the Borough Council wishes to se e evidence of how development 
proposals will address the following matters: 
 
 Follow the flood risk management hierarchy, avoiding areas at highest 
risk and locating higher vulnerability uses in areas of lowest risk;  
 Locate habitable rooms above the design flood level;  
 Provide a safe access and egress route wherever feasible;  
 Not increase flood risk elsewhere;  
 Incorporate flood resilience and resistance measures;  
 Demonstrate that it would remain structurally sound during the design 
flood event; and  
 Demonstra te that residual risk will be managed to a safe level.  
Residual Risk and safe development (Point 3 of Policy D7) 
2.8.12  Residual risks are those risks that remain after applying the sequential 
approach and taking all the mitigation measures necessary. Residual ri sk 
should be addressed in a site -specific FRA which should be proportionate to 
the scale of the development proposed and the risks involved. The SFRA 
can be used as a starting point for undertaking this assessment. This matter 
needs to be assessed early on  in the development process so that 
appropriate measures to manage the residual risk can be identified and 
accommodated into the site layout.  
 
2.8.13  In accordance with the latest advice in national planning practice guidance, 
developers must provide evidence to show the proposed development 
would be safe and residual risk can be overcome. Therefore it is 
recommended the developer prepares a comprehensive flood risk 
management strategy for the site which will manage risk for the 
development across the plan period whilst all phases of development are 
being delivered. In order to comply with the NPPF, developments in areas of 
higher flood risk taking into account climate change will need to be made 
safe for the lifetime of that individual development without i ncreasing flood 
risk elsewhere.  
 
2.8.14  In addition to the above, proposals for development must show safe access 
and egress to , and from , the site during the occurrence of a flood event. 
This must be shown in a site -specific FRA which will accompany a planning 
application. There may be some exceptional circumstances where it may 
not be possible to provide a safe access route. The Borough Council 
consider such occasions where this is the case to be very rare. However, 
where it is clearly and robustly demonstrated by the developer through a 
site-specific FRA that it would not be possible to deliver a safe access to 
and from the site then alternative measures will be considered. This could 
include the provision of an appropriate safe refuge(s) and associated 
faciliti es within the development for those people who are unable to leave if DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
102 a flooding emergency were to occur. In such instances it will be necessary 
for the developer to prepare a robust flood warning and evacuation plan. It is 
recommended that advice relating  to the arrangements for these matters is 
sough t at the pre -application stage.  
 
2.8.15  The Borough Council will expect developers to address matters relating to 
flood warnings and evacuation plans as part of their assessment and the 
management of residual risk of  flooding through site -specific FRAs. The  
NPPF and accompanying guidance  provides further advice on this issue. 
The SFRA will provide the basis for assessing the level of any hazard posed 
should a bre ach in existing defences occur.  
Surface water run -off (P oint 4 of Policy D7) 
2.8.16  Surface water management is an important consideration in determining 
planning applications. Flood Risk Assessments should take account of all 
types of flooding including surface water flooding. Consideration of surface 
water flooding should also be addressed for development proposals in all 
flood risk areas including Flood Zone 1. This should address both the flood 
risk to the proposed development itself through surface water run -off and 
the potential impacts on areas adjacent to and d ownstream of the 
development. When considering major developments, (10 or more houses, 
or sites larger than 1  ha), the Borough Council will consult Hampshire 
County Council, as Lead Local Flood Authority, on the management of 
surface water drainage.  
Sustainable Drainage Systems (Point 5 of Policy D7) 
2.8.17  One way of addressing surface water run -off is through the use of 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS).  Site-specific FRAs should 
investigate the use of SuDS options to manage surface water where this is 
practicable for new development proposals. In particular, major 
developments will be expected to incorporate SuDS unless there is clear 
evidence that this would be inappropriate.  
 
2.8.18  It is recognised that S uDS can potentially play a role in securing nutrient  
neutrality in new developments. Therefore proposed SuDs schemes will 
need to have the appropriate minimum operational standards and be 
designed to ensure minimal nitrate loading is achieved.  Developers will 
need to have regard to the policy requirements on  this issue as set out in 
Policy LE13: Water Resources.  
 
2.8.19  It will be necessary to address issues of adoption, maintenance and long -
term management associated with any SuDS proposals. Proposals for such 
systems should also take account of advice from the lea d local flood 
authority. Although in some circumstances the use of SuDS can require 
substantial land -take, it is considered there are a variety of techniques that 
can be effectively used in urban areas which can significantly contribute 
towards controlling  surface water run -off without the need for large areas of 
land. These may include use of green roof systems which can be used in 
buildings with flat roofs, such as schools and industrial units. Permeable DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
103 pavements (e.g. in driveways and car parks) limit r unoff and maximise 
potential infiltration opportunities. The latest National Planning Practice 
Guidance and relevant industry best practice for example, the Construction 
Industry Research and Information Association73 can provide further advice 
to developer s on this matter. Where possible proposed SuDS should 
provide multifunctional benefits.  
 
2.8.20  It is important that the incorporation of SuDS into the design of 
developments should be undertaken at the earliest stages of the planning 
process. This process should  also be informed by relevant contamination 
investigations; otherwise there is a risk of re -mobilisation of any 
contaminants in the soils and therefore the pollution of contro lled waters in 
accordance with P olicy LE10: Contaminated and Unstable Land.  
 
2.8.21  Owne rship and responsibility for the long -term maintenance and 
management of all the components of SuDS should be identified at the 
earliest opportunity in the planning process and secured through an 
appropriate planning condition.  
Flood resilience and flood r esistance in buildings (Point 6 of Policy D7) 
2.8.22  Flood risk management measures can only manage the risk of flooding; 
they cannot remove it entirely. Where development in higher areas of flood 
risk is unavoidable, careful consideration needs to be given to the design 
and layout of the site and other key infrastructure provision located behind 
flood defences. Flood resilience and resistance techniques should not be 
regarded as the sole mitigation measure required in terms of managing 
flood risk. The Borough C ouncil envisage flood resilience and resistance 
measures74 being part of a package of appropriate mitigation and reduction 
in flood risk informed by the latest SFRA and current best practice guidance. 
The Council welcomes early engagement from developers in  the pre -
application process to discuss design issues and explore innovative 
measures to arrive at solutions.  
New and/or  improved flood risk management measures (Point 7 of 
Policy D7) 
2.8.23  New developments will be expected to play a key role in contributing 
towards the effective delivery of the Borough Council’s sustainable 
development objectives providing a robust ‘front line’ defence as an integral 
part of the  development where appropriate.  
 
2.8.24  In some instances it may be necessary to secure a financial contribut ion for

 74 Examples of flood resistance measures may include: flood doors and windows; flood barriers; concrete floors 
with damp -proof membranes; airbricks, airbrick covers &  vents; water -resistant walls; fitting non -return valves to 
pipes; land and floor level raising. Appropriate flood resilience measures to reduce damage caused by flood 
water may include any of the following: raised electrics and sockets; sump & pump system s; the use of water 
resistant materials in kitchens, bathrooms and for flooring; and keeping valuable items at higher levels.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
104 provision of new flood risk management measures. These will usually be 
provided as part of the proposal  and secured by either a planning obligation  
or through the Community Infrastructure Levy whichever is appropriate.  
 
2.8.25  In other circumstances it may be appropriate for the Council to collect 
developer contributions through the Community Infrastructure Levy to assist 
in funding improvements to existing and/or the provision of n ew flood risk 
management infrastructure. This approach is explained in more detail in 
Policy D11: Securing Infrastructure which is supported by the Council’s 
Infrastructure Assessment Report75. Further details for planned programmes 
for flood infrastructure  and specific schemes in Gosport are set out in the 
River Hamble to Portchester Coastal Flood and Erosion Risk Management 
Strategy and associated documents and delivery of these schemes will be 
reported in the Council’s annual Infrastructure Funding Statem ents which 
includes the Infrastructure Delivery Plan . 
 
2.8.26  It is important to ensure that flood risk can be managed for the lifetime of the 
development. This includes, where necessary, the maintenance and 
enhancement of flood management measures including defe nces which 
may need to be provided at a future point in the life time of the development. 
It is important to ensure that should future flood defences be required, 
sufficient land will be availab le to allow this to take place.  Therefore it will be 
necessary to plan for this at the design stage of the scheme.  
Impacts of new and/or improved flood risk management measures 
(Point 8 of Policy D7) 
2.8.27  It will be necessary to ensure that new or improved flood risk management 
measures do no t have a detrimental impact on internationally important 
habitats. The broad principle for such measures has been established in the 
North Solent Shoreline Management Plan (SMP). The accompanying 
Habitats Regulations Assessment to the SMP indicated the ext ent of habitat 
losses anticipated as a result of implementing SMP policy and that these 
losses will be compensated by the Regional Habitat Creation Programme 
(RHCP)76. 
 
2.8.28  There are large areas of the Borough which contain significant habitats 
(including sites  of national and international importance) supporting a wide 
range of protected species, it is important these areas of nature 
conservation interest are protected and therefore, applications for flood risk 
management infrastructure will need to be consider ed against national 
policies and the local nature conservation policies in this plan ( Policies D5 
and LE5 -LE7). 
 
2.8.29  Some improvements to identified flood risk management measures may 
increase the standard of protection to a level over and above that identified

105 through the North Solent SMP, and the River Hamble to Portchester Coastal 
Flood and Erosion Risk Management Str ategy. Where such improvements 
are likely to increase the amount of internationally important intertidal habitat 
lost to coastal squeeze predicted by the SMP, a project -level HRA will be 
required. The HRA must demonstrate that it is possible to avoid an ad verse 
effect on the internationally important habitat (including areas outside of the 
designated sites known to be of importance for the relevant important 
species). This could be achieved for example by avoiding an increased flood 
defence footprint.  
Devel opment and coastal change (Point 9 of Policy D7) 
2.8.30  National policy stipulates that local planning authorities should reduce the 
risks from coastal change by avoiding inappropriate development in areas 
likely to be affected by physical changes to the coastlin e and identifying 
these as Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMA). A CCMA will only be 
defined where rates of shoreline change are significant over the next 100 
years, taking account of climate change. They will not need to be defined 
where the accepted sh oreline management plan is to hold or advance the 
line (maintain existing defences or build new defences) for the whole period 
of the Local Plan. The North Solent Shoreline Manageme nt Plan (NSSMP) 
(adopted 2010) policy for the whole of the Borough’s coast is ‘Hold the Line’ 
and therefore there is no evidence to suggest that a CCMA needs to be 
identified in the Borough for the plan period up to 2038.  However if during 
the plan period there is a need to define such an area, proposals will be 
determined in acc ordance with the latest national guidance.

106 2.9 POLICY D 8: HEALTHY COMMUNITIE S  
Introduction  
2.9.1  The NPPF is clear that planning policies should aim to achieve healthy, 
inclusive and safe places which enable and support healthy lifestyles, 
especially where this would address identified local health and wellbeing 
needs for the provision of safe and acc essible green infrastructure, sports 
facilities, access to healthier food, and allotments and layouts that 
encourage walking and cycling. The NPPF adds that planning policies 
should take account and support the delivery of local strategies to improve 
health, social and cultural well being for all sections of the community. Box 8 
defines a healthy community and is followed by  Figure 1  which 
demonstrates the large number of determinants which can affect our health.  
 
BOX  8: What is a healthy community?  
 
A healthy community is a good place to grow up and grow old in. It is one 
which supports healthy behaviours and supports reductions in health 
inequalities.  It should enhance the physical and mental health of the 
community and where appr opriate, encourage:  
 
 Active healthy lifestyles that are made easy through the pattern of 
development, good urban design, good access to local services and 
facilities, green open space and safe places for active play and food 
growing, and is accessible by walking and cycling and public transport.  
 
 The creation of healthy living environments for people of all ages which 
support social interaction.  It meets the needs of children and young 
people to grow and develop. As well as being adaptable to the needs of 
an increasingly elderly population and those with dementia and other 
sensory and mobility impairments.

EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D8 
2.9.2  Health is fundamental to the quality of our lives and all development should 
include measures to protect people’s health and take opportunities to 
enhance it. The pandemic has strongly highlighted the fundamental 
requirement  of having the necessary health facilities and professionals  in 
the local community as well as the importance  for individuals to have a 
healthy lifestyle to combat disease and maintain good physical and mental 
health. This is underpinned by a good quality environment to enable this to 
happen.  
 
2.9.3  As clearly evidence d in the Gosport Profile  (Section  7: Health and 
Wellbeing ) and included in the Hot Food Takeaway  Background Paper78, 
the Borough has a number of significant health issues including:  
 
 There are several areas suffering from health de privation with 6 Local 
Super Output Areas within the 20% most deprived areas in the 
country, whilst the Borough is the third most deprived in Hampshire as 
a whole after Southampton and Portsmouth (Indices of Multiple 
Deprivation 2019).  
 Employment, income a nd education deprivation can have a significan t 
impact on a person’s health. There are numerous areas in Gosport 
where people experience this form of deprivation . 
 The average life expectancy for males and females is below the 
national average.  
 The Borough  has one of the highest proportions of the adults with 
excessive weight (overweight and obesity) in the country (6th 
highest)79. 
 69.9% of adults are classified as having excessive weight (overweight 
or obese80) including 29.1% classified as obese (2015) . 
 It has higher than the national average rates of under 75 mortality rate 
from all cardiovascular diseases and cancer . 
 
2.9.4  The built and natural environment are major determinants of health and 
wellbeing. Good planning can have a very positive role in assisting t o 
reduce some of these health issues and it is acknowledged that poor 
planning can help exacerbate underlying health problems of local 
communities. The Government’s Planning Practice Guidance makes it clear

110 that local planning authorities should en sure tha t health and wellbeing and 
health infrastructure are considered in local plans.  
 
2.9.5  It is recognised that planning is only one part of the solution and that there 
are significant other factors that can play an equal or much larger ro le in 
reducing health prob lems.  
Overall approach (Point 1 of Policy D8) 
2.9.6  Gosport Borough Council works with partner organisations such as the 
NHS, Hampshire County Council, local schools , and community and 
voluntary groups to deliver action at a local level to improve health 
outcome s for people living in the Borough. Organisations in Gosport have a 
strong culture of working together and this has been built upon in developing 
a collaborative approach to improve health and wellbeing for local people . 
This approach has been clearly demo nstrated  through the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
2.9.7  The Council has set up the Gosport Health and Wellbeing Partnership 
(GHWBP) to provide a strategic overview and support the delivery of priority 
actions for a range of organisa tions and local delivery groups. It will facilitate  
co-ordination  of activity  and the sharing  of information . The GHWBP 
includes representatives from partner organisations with an interest or 
influence in the health and wellbeing of the local population.   
 
2.9.8  The Partnership priorities are shap ed by local evidence of health set out 
within the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment ( JSNA )81 and the Health  
Profile  for Gosport82. Hampshire County Council’s Public Health Department  
has a responsibi lity for public health services  and to implement a Health and 
Wellbeing Board who  agree ways to improve local health and wellbeing and 
consequently  the GHWBP will prioritise  its activity  to support and implement 
the aims of the Strategy for the Health and Wellbeing of Hampshire83 by: 
 
 Supporting people in Gosport to live active, independent lives and 
building resilience to manage their own health and wellbeing.    
 To address the wider determinants of health such as housing, 
education, employment, physical environment and community safety  
to help reduce the gap between those with the best and worst health 
and wellbeing outcomes, to enable people to increased opportunities 
and a better quality of life.  
 
2.9.9  Where relevant and appropriate the Council will consider opportunities for 
GHWBP initiat ives and other health -related initiatives to link with planning 
proposals coming forward.  These primarily relate to improve the quality of

across all age groups . 
Links with specific policies in the Local Plan (Points 2 -6 of Policy D8) 
2.9.10  As stated in the introduction and emphasised in Government guidance there 
are numerous opportunities where planning and health are linked.  Points 2 -
6 of the Policy link to more detailed policies in the L ocal Plan which aim to 
secure an improved health outcome.  This Policy highlights the cross -cutting 
nature of health in planning and the Council will seek development which 
delivers an improved outcome for the local community.  
 
2.9.11  It is clear that the design o f buildings and spaces, and routes within and 
between them are vitally important to encourage positive physical and 
mental health benefits , as well as  to prevent accidents and encourage active 
lifestyles. More detailed requirements are set out in each of t he cross -
referenced policies as well as guidance set out in the Government’s 
National Design Guide which identifies many the health issues covered in 
Policy D884. 
Assessing health impacts of development and incorporating additional 
benefits (Point 7 of Poli cy D8) 
2.9.12  The Council requires developers to take  a proactive approach regarding 
incorporating measures to improve health outcomes within their 
developments and conseque ntly requires applications for major 
developments to include a health assessment to accompany their planning 
application. The health assessment can be submitted as a stand -alone 
assessment or an explicit part of a supporting document such as a Planning 
statement  or Design and Access Sta tement.  
 
2.9.13  The health assessment aims to encourage developers to fully consider 
opportunities to maximise the opportunities for improving health as part of 
the development and to avoid and/or mitigate any potential negative h ealth 
impacts.  The assessment should include those issues covered in Points 1 -6 
above, where relevant.  Considering these issues at a design and planning 
stage can reap significant physical and mental health benefits for the users 
of the development and ensure such considerations are inher ent to the 
schem e rather than an after -thought.  
 
The Council consider that the use of a health assessment as a tool to add 
value to proposals and identify opportunities that could be missed otherwise.  
The Council considers that the tool should be used by d evelopers to 
question whether more can be done as part of a development to facilitate a 
healthy lifestyle, avoid compounding existing problems or preventing a 
development having negative impacts o n the health of local residents. The 
thresholds set out in t he policy are considered appropriate and proportionate 
to facilitate improved health outcomes. The outcomes of this policy will be 
monitored to establish its effectiveness.

112 2.10 POLICY D9: DESIGN  
Design: Enhancing A Sense Of Place  
2.10.1  Gosport has a strong design heritage as demonstrated through its many 
conservation areas, Areas of Special Character, listed buildings and other 
features of national heritage significance. The Council wishes to build on 
this legacy by supporting new develo pments of high design quality which 
respond to and promote the Borough’s unique ‘sense of place’.  
 
2.10.2  The Government is placing an increasing emphasis on the need for high 
quality  design. The NPPF considers that high quality  buildings and places 
are fundamental to planning and development and the delivery of better 
places to live and work.85 The value of high quality  design has also been 
reinforced through the National Design Guide ( 2021 )86, which considers the 
fundamental prin ciples of good design to be that it is: fit for purpose, 
durable, and brings delight. The National Design Guide considers that the 
components of good design are greater than just the appearance, materials 
and detailing of buildings, but through making the right choices at all levels, 
which includes the layout, form, scale and landscaping of development too. 
Well-designed places should appeal to all our senses in the way they look, 
feel, sound and even smell, affecting its enduring distinctiveness, 
attractiv eness and beauty.  
 
2.10.3  The Borough Council has produced a list of documents which must be 
submitted with all planning applications87. This includes the National List of 
mandatory requirements, which can be found in the Planning Practice 
Guidance, as well as a L ocal List of requirements. It is a statutory 
requirement for major develop ments, listed building consent, and certain 
developments in conservation areas to include a Design and Access 
Statement with development proposals. In preparing  a Design and Access 
Statement developers should have regard to the principles set out in the 
NPPF, Planning Practice Guidance (PPG), the National Design Guide 
(NDG) and local design guidance.  
 
2.10.4  Design and Access Statements should provide a site analysis describing the 
concepts behind the proposal, how it has evolved, and how the proposal 
relates to its surroundings in both design and access terms. Consideration 
of how development achieves the ten characteristics of a well -designed 
place as described in the NDG (see  Figure 2 ), should also be addressed.  
 
2.10.5  By virtue of their size, major development sites will have a large impact 
upon the borough and its residents. The Borough Council will work with 
developers and stakeholders of major development sites to devise positive 
design princ iples to guide development either by agreeing design principles 
as part of an approved masterplan or development brief; or through the 
development of a design code. A design code is a set of illustrated design

a) Proposals need to accord with the principles of the National 
Design Guide, Manual for Streets, the Council’s Design SPD 
and other local design documents set out in  Box 9 .  
b) Development of poor design, that fails to improve the

2. All development in the Borough should be of a high standard 
and contribute towards sustainable development and local 
distinctiveness by addressing:  
 
a) Context:  carefully considering the surrounding context, 
heritage and vernacular architec ture and seeking to deliver 
enhancements;  
b) Identity: having a high quality  and attractive design which 
takes advantage of opportunities to improve the character, 
quality and function of an area.  
c) Built form: having a high quality  design in terms of scale, 
layout, setting, landscaping, massing, roof form, detail and 
materials and making efficient and effective use of land 
which does not prejudice the development potential of 
adjacent or nearby sites.  
d) Movement: supporting improved accessibility for all users 
and prioritising walking, cycling and public transport.  
e) Nature: supporting and enhancing biodiversity, green 
infrastructure and the Borough’s distinctive landscapes.  
f) Public space: improving the public realm and protecting 
public views of important landscape and townscape features.  
g) Health: creating healthy communities through design and 
reducing opportunities for crime and anti -social behaviour.  
h) Quality of life: ensuring  developments are functional, safe 
and comfortable, while protecting the amenity of occupie rs 
and surrounding residents.   
i) Sustainability: delivering long -term sustainability and the 
transition to a zero -carbon economy as detailed in Policy 
DE1: Sustainable Construction.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D9  
National and local guidance (Point 1a of Policy D 9) 
2.10.6  With the final publication  of the National Design Guide (NDG) in 20 21, the 
Government has placed an increased emphasis on the need for high quality  
design. This NDG compliments existing design guidance including Manual 
for Street and Secured by Design, as well local guidance such as the 
Council’s Design SPD (2014) and area -specific guides. A full list of relevant DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
115 guidance is shown in  Box 9 , including optional design guidance which 
proposals may wish to follow. Proposals should always use the most up -to-

Requirement of good  design (Point 1b of Policy D 9) 
2.10.7  The Council places a strong emphasis on the delivery of high quality  design, 
which is integral to improving the character and function of the Borough, and 
meeting the objectives within this Local Plan. Good design enhances 
people’s quality of life by creating better buildings, streets, spaces and 
neighbourhoods that functi on well, are healthier and safer, and have a 
stronger sense of community. High quality  places also respect their 
immediate surroundings and the wider environment including its natural, 
cultural and historic assets. Poor design, on the other hand, can lead to low -
quality surroundings which can have a multitude of other negative effects. 
Paragraph 13 4 of the NPPF is  clear that poor quality design,  that fails to 
improve the character, q uality and function of an area,  should be refused.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
116 Context  (Point 2a of Po licy D 9) 
2.10.8  The first action in preparing a proposal should be to study the context of a 
site. This includes the site itself  as well as its immediate surroundings and 
the wider context. Where appropriate, such development should reinforce 
locally distinctive patterns of development, enhance key landscape features, 
and be responsive to local history, culture and heritage. In particular, this 
includes Gosport’s maritime, military and leisure heritage which has played 
a signific ant role in shaping the Borough  and is a key asset in its commercial 
and visitor economy. The Council’s understanding of local character will be 
informed by the relevant studies and strategies included in  Box 10  and any 
further studies.  
 
2.10.9  The National Design Guide and the Design SPD provide further guidance on 
considering context, while Policy D10 provides guidance on how proposals 
should design for the Borough’s heritage assets.

2.10.10  High quality  design should be visually attractive, unique and bring delight. 
Numerous architectural styles can be utilised to achieve this, however all 
proposals should consider the context and seek to take advantage of 
opportunities to improve the charact er, quality and function of an area. This 
includes contributing to, or creating a ‘sense of place’; emphasising what 
makes the particular locality distinctive. Placemaking may include adopting 
typical building forms, composition, articulation, proportions,  features, 
materials, details, patterns and colours of an area, or creating a new and 
positive character in areas with limited attractive qualities.  
 
2.10.11  The policy aims to ensure that all development supports the Borough 
Council’s vision for high quality  deve lopment which will assist with 
regeneration. The National Design Guide provides further advice on how 
developments can successfully deliver on this requirement.  
Built form (Point 2c of Policy D 9) 
2.10.12  The delivery of high quality  proposals requires careful consideration of a 
number of key features including its scale, layout, setting and landscaping in 
relation to its wider context, particularly where heritage and landscape 
assets are present. The scale of development should feel appropriate to the 
surroundings and for the proposed uses.  
 
2.10.13  Massing, roof form, detail and materials are further key considerations and 
should take into account the surrounding context and the local vernacular. 
The proposed materials should be appropriate for the way they will be used, 
be durable and sustainably produced, and be easy to clean and maintain. 
This will be particularly important for developments near the Borough’s 
coastline where increased weathering may occur. Good detailing should 
complement the overall design and chosen materials.  
 
2.10.14  In most built -up parts of the Borough compact urban layouts would be 
expected, which displays a tight urban grain and medium to high densities 
with a suitable mix of uses. Not only will this help to make efficient use of 
land, but it will increase the viability of sustainable travel and local shops 
and services.  
 
2.10.15  To make the efficient use of land, it will be important to ensure that 
development proposals do not prejudice the comprehensive development of 
a site or an  adjoining site. This should be reflected in the Design and Access 
Statement, where appropriate. The National Design Guide and Design SPD 
provide further advice on how developments can successfully deliver on this 
requirement.  
Movement (Point 2d of Policy D9) 
2.10.16  Well-designed places should provide a choice of travel modes for all users, 
including disabled and older persons. Active travel and access to public 
transport should be prioritised through safe, convenient and well -maintained DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
118 routes that link to the wi der network. Wherever possible, routes should 
follow desire lines and include good signage and attractive planting to create 
‘urban greenways’.  
 
2.10.17  To enhance the Borough’s overall accessibility, it is important that 
accessibility is improved both from the de velopm ent and through the 
development,  unless a justified reason can be provided.  
 
2.10.18  Streets should follow a hierarchy, with quieter local roads and wider main 
roads which make navigation quick and intuitive. Car and cycle parking 
should be provided to the latest Council standards and be conveniently 
located, but not be visually dominant. Further guidance on access and 
parking can be found in Policy D1 2, the Design SPD, the National Design 
Guide and Manual for Streets.  
Nature (Point 2e of Policy D 9) 
2.10.19  Integrat ing nature with the built environment is a key feature of well -
designed places and can deliver multiple benefits for health, wellbeing, 
biodiversity, landscapes, and climate change and flood risk mitigation. 
Integrating nature can be achieved through the inclusion of a network of 
multi functional green infrastructure, which can include open space, 
attractive landscaping and ecological enhancements (see Policies D4 and 
LE1). Where new links are provided planting can be included to create 
urban greenways and g reen corridors for wildlife. The inclusion of on -site 
Sustainable Drainage Systems can also help provide nutrient mitigation (see 
Policy LE13), as well as biodiversity and landscape benefits.  
 
2.10.20  As part of the Environment Bill  all developments will be expect ed to provide 
biodiversity net gain, which can be delivered through a variety of 
approaches (see Policy LE8). The National Design Guide and Design SPD 
provide further advice on how developments can successfully deliver on this 
requirement.  
Public spaces (P oint 2f of Policy D 9) 
2.10.21  The provision of attractive, safe and functional public space is essential to 
good design. Public spaces should aim to be inclusive to all users and 
support social interaction, civic inclusion and a range of associated 
activities. App ropriate street furniture, artwork and planting should be 
designed -in at the earliest stage, however excessive st reet clutter should be 
avoided.  
 
2.10.22  Buildings that front public space should be of a scale, style and mass to 
compliment the space, with active fr ontages, clearly delineated public, 
shared and private spaces, and high levels of natural surveillance. Active 
travel links should be provided to surrounding areas to ensure the space is 
accessible and vibrant, while busy public spaces should consider the need 
for additional security measures which should be i ntegrated as positive 
features.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
119 2.10.23  Developments should demonstrate that they will not have a detrimental 
impact on important public views of key landscape and townscape features, 
and where possible oppor tunities are taken to create new attractive public 
vistas. This will help ensure that developments are legible with appropriate 
views, vistas, focal points and memorable buildings to help people find their 
way. It is important to recognise that the protect ion of views only relates to 
those which are enjoyed by the general public. The policy does not protect 
private views from a private property such as a dwelling unless there are 
wider public benefits.  
 
2.10.24  The National Design Guide and Design SPD provide furth er advice on how 
developments can successfully deliver on this requirement.  
Health (Point 2g of Policy D 9) 
2.10.25  Improving health outcomes is a key priority for the Council and design can 
take a leading role in creating healthier communities. As a starting point, this 
includes designing dwellings which have sufficient levels of natural light, 
ventilation and outdoor amenity space.  
 
2.10.26  At a community level it involves integrating active travel modes and 
providing high quality  areas of open space within which dif ferent forms of 
recreation are supported. This could include children’s play  parks, an area 
to play sports, and paths which support walking and cycling. Further details 
on the provision of healthy communities and open space requirements can 
be found in Pol icies D 8 and LE1 respectively.  
 
2.10.27  The provision of green infrastructure supports healthy communities by 
improving air and water quality, and mental wellbeing. Opportunities to 
include green infrastructure should therefore be maximised, such as through 
the pr ovision of outdoor amenity space, attractive landscaping, generous 
planting in parks and verges, and the inclusion of street trees. Further 
details on green infrastructure can be found in Policy D 4. 
 
2.10.28  Crime is a material planning consideration and the desig n and layout of 
proposals should help to minimise the potential for criminal activity, the fear 
of crime and anti-social behaviour. Key considerations to address include:  
 
 Installing high quality  lighting and facilitating natural surveillance 
wherever possible.  
 Creating defensible spaces, which have a clear delineation between 
public , shared  and private areas.  
 Providing a mix of dwelling types in residential schemes to increase 
the likelihood of c ommunity activity throughout the day.  
 Minimising windowless elevations and blank walls. Where such 
features are necessary buffer planting should be included . 
 Providing wide, well -lit and overlooked pedestrian and cycle rout es 
and minimising the use of subw ays. 
 Designing windows, doors, entrances and walls to achieve the latest 
Secured by Design standard.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
120  Carefully considering the design of public spaces and the location of 
benches to minimise the opportunities for anti -social behaviour.  
 Larger developments should incorporate wider security measures to 
protect the community against potential natural hazards and malicious 
threats.  
 
2.10.29  Further details on design and security can be found in the suite of guidance 
documents Secured by Design (UK Police Service, 2019 ), while amenity 
and health are also considered within the Design SPD and the National 
Design Guide. Other key considerations which affect health, such as noise, 
light and other pollutants are considere d in more detail in Policy LE9.  
Quality of life  (Point  2h of Policy D 9) 
2.10.30  Good design should promote quality of life. For users this includes functional 
and easy to use homes and buildings which integrate comfort, safety, 
security, amenity, privacy, accessibility and adaptability. Proposals should 
include adequ ate floor -to-ceiling heights, space standards, storage spaces, 
heat, sound and fire insulation, and air and light quality to serve their 
expected uses. Ease of access for deliveries, waste collection, utilities and 
emergency services should be demonstrated , with integrated facilities to 
reduce vis ual impacts and street clutter.  
 
2.10.31  All developments must protect the amenity of existing occupiers and 
surrounding residents  and users . Conserving privacy and reducing 
overlooking, particularly on sensitive residenti al spaces such as gardens, 
bathrooms, living spaces and bedrooms will be key considerations. The 
installation of windows, balconies and platforms in locations which would 
harm the privacy of surrounding occupiers should be avoided. The use of 
opaque glass and screens should be used where appropriate, to mitigate 
these concerns.  
 
2.10.32  Detailed guidance on addressing amenity concerns can be found in Policy 
DE2: Residential Design, the Design SPD and the National Design Guide. 
The use of optional design standards ( see Box 9 ) such as the Home Quality 
Mark, Building for a Healthy Life and BREEAM are encouraged to 
demonstrate a development’s quality of life to both the Council and future 
occupiers.  
Sustainability (Point 2i of Policy D 9) 
2.10.33  Sustainable development and the transition to a low -carbon economy are 
core principles of the NPPF and this Local Plan, as demonstrated through 
the overarching Policy D1 : Adap tation and Mitigation to Climate Change.  
 
2.10.34  Development contributes towards sustainability in a multitude of ways from 
land use and green infrastructure provision, to energy use and renewables 
generation. High quality  buildings and places conserve natural resources 
including land, water, energy and materials, and are built to last with spaces 
which are fit for purpose and can be easily adapted to changing needs.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
121 2.10.35  Construction materials should be carefully selected, utilising sustainably 
sourced and  recycled or recyclable materials wherever possible,  which are 
robust, easily maintained, and have low embodied energy and water. Where 
sustainable, the sourcing of local materials is also encouraged. Suitable 
management plans are required to ensure that buildings and spaces have 
ongoing and viable manageme nt and maintenance regimes which maximise 
their use, lifespan and enjoyment, and lower future running costs.  
 
2.10.36  All proposals are expected to achieve high standards of sustainable design 
and construction as encapsulated in Policy DE1: Sustainable Constructio n, 
as well as delivering sustainable neighbourhoods with efficient land use and 
integrated active travel, as required in Policies H1 : Sustainable Residential 
Neighbourhoods and Policy D1 2: Accessibility to New Development . 
 
2.10.37  The NDG provides further detail on this requirement within the ‘Resources’ 
and ‘Lifespan’ sections of that document.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
122 2.11 POLICY D10: HERITAGE  ASSETS  
Introduction  
2.11.1  Box 11 lists the various types of heritage assets having regard to the 
Government’s definition of designated heritage assets. These features are 
key elements which contribute to a unique sense of place and are an 
irreplaceable resource. It is therefore necessary to conserve them in a 
manner appropriate to their significance.  
 
2.11.2  Heritage assets are a finite and valuable resource and the presumption will 
remain in favour of conserving or enhancing a heritage asset. Some assets 
should be conserved due to their unique interest and value nationally and/or 
their value to Gosport. By their very nature some redundant fe atures 
including for example areas of historic defences may not have obvious 
economic value but will be of significant historic value to the Borough and 
the sense of place.  
Local Context  
2.11.3  Gosport has a very significant maritime and naval heritage. This incl udes, 
inter alia, the first purpose -built naval hospital in England on the Haslar 
Peninsula, a series of 19th century Palmerston Forts and Haslar Gunboat 
Sheds . These heritage assets, when considered both with others in the 
Borough, those in Portsmouth and  further afield, form a very distinct 
collection of both international and national importance in relation to that 
period when Britain’s hegemony as a global maritime power was at its apex.  
 
2.11.4  The Borough has approximately 540 Listed Buildings and approximat ely 100 
Locally Listed buildings. There are 1 7 Conservation Areas, which are 
designated to conserve and enhance the special character of the area. 
There are 14 Scheduled Ancient Monuments, the majority of which are 
related to Gosport’s military fortificati ons. The grounds of Royal Hospital 
Haslar (23ha)  and the Has lar Cemetery on C layhall Road are Grade II 
Registered Historic Park of National Importance . There are also s ix Parks & 
Gardens of Local Historic Interest (33.1ha)88. 
 
2.11.5  The Borough contains a number of important and distinctive archaeological 
sites, many reflecting the area’s military, particularly naval, heritage 
spanning hundreds of years. As well as above ground features, there are a 
number of below ground remains which may be of local or national 
importance. However, only a small proportion of these sites are protected as 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments (these being Designated Heritage Assets). 
The Archaeological and Historic Buildings Record (AHBR) maintained by 
Hampshire County Council is a useful so urce of information. In liaison with 
the County Council an ‘Archaeological Alert Map’ has been prepared and 
identifies areas in the Borough most likely to contain archaeological 
remains.

123 BOX  11: What are Heritage Assets?  
 
The NPPF de fines a heritage asset as a building, monument, site, place, 
area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting 
consideration in planning decisions because of its heritage interest. Heritage 
assets comprise of the following:  
 
Designat ed Heritage Assets  
 
 Listed Buildings  
 Conservation Areas  
 Scheduled Ancient Monuments  
 Registered Parks and Gardens  
 Protected Wrecks  
 World Heritage Sites  
 
Locally Important Heritage Assets  
 
 Locally Listed Buildings  
 Parks and Gardens of Local Historic Interest  
 Sites of Archaeological Interest  
 Wrecks of Local Historic Interest  
 Historic L andscapes  
 
Unidentified Heritage Assets  
 
Heritage assets yet to be identified which could become designated or 
locally important as  a result of further assessment.  
 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
124 POLICY D 10: HERITAGE ASSETS  
 
1. The Borough Council will take a positive approach through the 
Local Plan, the Heritage Action Zone Delivery Plan and the High 
Street Heritage Action Zone projects to promot e Gosport’s unique 
historic character by ensuring that all its heritage assets are 
conserved and enhanced through viable new uses.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for development that affects 
heritage assets, and where relevant their setting, provided  it 
conserves and enhances those features which positively contribute 
to its special architectural, historic, landscape or archaeological 
interest.  
 
3. Development proposals which affect heritage assets, whether 
designated or non -designated, or their setting,  will be determined 
with regard to their  significance.  Proposals which harm the 
significance of a designated asset will not be permitted where there 
is a detrimental impact on the historic and architectural character 
of the building or structure unless in wholly exceptional 
circumstances a robust justification can be made in accordance 
with the requirements of the NPPF . 
 
4. All development proposals should be informed by proportionate 
historic environment assessments and evaluations identifying the 
significanc e of all heritage assets that would be affected by the 
proposals, the nature and degree of any effects and should 
demonstrate how any harm will be avoided, minimised or mitigated.  
 
5. Heritage assets at risk will be monitored and development 
proposals that improve their condition will be encouraged.  
 
6. The Borough Council will aim to conserve and enhance the 
character or appearance of existing Conservation Areas and, where 
appropriate, produce and update Conservation Area Appraisals and 
identify additional Con servation Areas.  
 
7. The Borough Council will aim to conserve and enhance locally 
important heritage assets and will consider revisions  to the Local 
List of Heritage Assets dependent on any new information.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D10 
Strategy for protecting and enhancing the Boroug h’s Heritage Assets 
(Point 1 of Policy D10) 
2.11.6  The Borough Council will take a positive approach to promoting Gosport’s 
unique historic character by engaging with local communities, site promoters 
and heritage stakeholders to ensure th at all its heritage assets are 
conserved and where possible enhanced whilst ensuring the Borough has a DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
125 vibrant economic future. The Borough Council places high value on early 
discussions at the pre -application stage with the objectives of fully informing 
site promoters of the issues they are required to address and hence provide 
a suitable strategy for enhancing and conserving heritage assets.  
 
2.11.7  The Urban Regeneration Areas ( URA) set out in the draft Local Plan are 
characterised by having significant heritag e features, historic buildings and 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments. Some are now coming forward for 
redevelopment via public sector land releases. As such, the regeneration 
policies set out specific heritage objectives which should be read in 
conjunction with this policy.  
 
2.11.8  The Gosport Heritage Action Zone (HAZ) and High Street HAZ (see Box 12) 
are needed to help GBC address the challenge of these URA coming 
forward. To enable successful delivery, creative solutions will be set out in 
the draft Local Plan and HAZ Delivery Plan to help ensure that historic 
buildings and places have appropriate and viable modern and commercial 
uses. 
 
BOX 12: Gosport Borough’s Heritage Action Zone  
 
Gosport Heritage Action Zone (HAZ)  
 
Heritage Action Zones are an Historic England initiative to  work with 
partners to breathe  new life into places that are rich in heritage and full of 
promise and thereby unlocking their potential and making them more 
attractive to residents, businesses, tourists and investors.  
 
Gosport Borough has been identified as one of England’s  Heritage Action 
Zones with  its rich military heritage and significant challenges.  Key 
regeneration sites across Gosport are characterised by having significant 
heritage features, historic buildings and Scheduled Ancient Monument s. 
These are now coming forward for redevelopment via public sector land 
releases and this puts pressure on Gosport's historic environment.  
 
Gosport Borough Council is working in partnership with Historic England to 
deliver a Heri tage Action Zone programme which includes feasibility work to 
find new uses for old buildings, masterplanning of historic sites, the delivery 
of public  realm improvements and improved interpretation of historic 
features as  well as publications  and events t o celebrate Gosport’s maritime 
and defence heritage.  
 
The Council  will be endeavouring to ensure that the historic environment is 
respected, whilst generating much needed local economic growth and 
improvements in job opportunities, educational standards an d health.  
 
The HAZ enables  Gosport Borough Council to benefit from  Historic England 
staff expertise and funding support for specific projects that will make 
significant contributions to the overall successful delivery of the key 
regeneration sites. Just as  importantly, the HAZ will also help unlock much DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
126 needed external financial assistance.  Community engagement will be an 
important element  of the HAZ programme.  
 
HAZ will be delivered in partnership with a  number of organisations  
including the Defence Infras tructure Organisation, One Public Estate, 
Hampshire County Council, East Solent Coastal Partnership and the 
Gosport Society.  
 
The most recent updates on the HAZ, including the HAZ Delivery Plan can 
be seen online: www.gosporthaz.org.uk    
 
Gosport High Street Heritage Action Zone  (HSHAZ)  
 
The HSHAZ is a government funded scheme delivered by Historic England. 
Selected as one of 68 locations, Gosport Borough Council in partnership 
with Hampshire Cultural Trust (HCT)  secured funding of £1.78 million to 
implement a four year multi -project programme across Gosport High Street 
and Stoke Road conservation areas.  
 
Through these projects, Gosport's HSHAZ plans to transform disused or 
underused high street buildings and esta blish new creative, cultural, 
residential and commercial opportunities.  
 
The latest news and developments in relation to the HSHAZ programme 
and its projects can be see online: www.gosport.gov.uk/HSHAZ   
 
Determining proposals affecting heritage assets (Points 2 and 3 of 
Policy D10) 
2.11.9  The Borough Council will determine planning applications affecting 
designated assets including Listed Buildings, Registered Parks and 
Gardens and Scheduled Ancient Monuments, as  well as applications for 
Listed Building consent, in accordance with national guidance. Proposals 
which involve the carrying out of works to a Scheduled Ancient Monument 
require consent from the relevant Government department.  
 
2.11.10  Proposals89 which harm the s ignificance of a designated asset will not be 
permitted including proposals which have a detrimental impact on the 
historic and architectural character of the building or structure unless 
justified.  The NPPF sets out how the Council should consider proposa ls 
affecting heritage assets and potential impacts.  Proposals causing harm will 
be weighed  against the substantial public - not private  - benefits of the 
proposal and whether it has been demonstrated that all reasonable efforts 
have been made to sustain th e existing use, find new uses, or mitigate the 
extent of the harm to the significance of the asset, and whether the works 
proposed are the minimum required to secure the long-term use of the 
asset.  
                                            
89 This could include inter alia the removal, repair, replacement or alteration of internal and external features of a 
build ing which affect its character.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
127  
2.11.11  In many cases the most appropriate use for a historic bui lding is that for 
which it was originally constructed and this should, where possible, be 
retained. However in many cases this use will no longer be practical or 
viable and a new use will have to be found. New uses should avoid the need 
to remove important  architectural or historic features, respect the integrity of 
the built form and quality of spaces within the building and avoid or minimise 
the introduction of inappropriate structural features.  
 
2.11.12  In those exceptional circumstances where harm to any herita ge assets can 
be fully justified, and development would result in the partial or total loss of 
the asset and/or its setting, the applicant will be required to secure a 
programme of recording and analysis of that asset, and archaeological 
excavation where r elevant, and ensure the publication of that record to an 
appropriat e standard in a public archive.  
 
2.11.13  The setting of an historic asset often forms an important part of the 
character of a historic structure including landscaped grounds, the walls and 
outbuild ings, the historic plan form of a military complex or a broader layout 
of an historic settlement. New development will need to pay particular 
attention to its impact on the setting of heritage assets and justify how it 
conserves and enhances the setting.  
Appropriate evidence to support planning applications (Point 4 of 
Policy D10) 
2.11.14  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) provides guidance that 
should be used alongside this Plan particularly on th e identification, 
significance and protection of heritage  assets both designated and 
undesignated. We expect applicants to assess and describe the significance 
of these assets, including any contribution made by their setting, sufficient to 
understand the potential impact of any proposal on that heritage 
signifi cance. The NPPF is clear on the need to ensure proposals are 
appropriately informed with background research required to be 
proportionate to the significance of the asset o r site. As such, site promoters 
will be required to describe the significance of any  heritage asset affected 
including any co ntribution made by its setting.  
 
2.11.15  In many cases, the historic significance of an asset may not be entirely 
obvious due to a lack of readily available information. The asset may have 
developed over hundreds of years a nd elements of earlier phases may exist 
within the external structure or below ground level. As such, the Borough 
Council strongly encourages the use of the Archaeology and Historic 
Buildings Record which is regularly updated as new information becomes 
available. Where necessary, applicants may need to engage appropriately 
qualified historic building consultants or archaeologists.  
 
2.11.16  Advice on the information likely to be required in support of an application 
can be sought from the Borough Council at pre -application stage and careful DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
128 thought will be given to the proportionate level of information that may be 
required including the prep aration of a heritage statement.  
Heritage Assets at Risk (Point 5 of Policy D10) 
2.11.17  A key area of concern will continue to be the identification and monitoring of 
‘Buildings at Risk’. These are designated heritage assets which are falling 
into disrepair and ‘ at risk’ of serious deterioration or loss. Gosport’s 
extensive military legacy, much of which by its very nature is obsolete, has 
raised particular challenges but on sites like St George Barracks and Royal 
Clarence Yard, has been integrated successfully in to new developments. 
This approach will need to be replicated for new development including 
those allocated in the Regeneration Areas at Daedalus , Gosport Waterfront, 
Gosport Town Centre and the Haslar Peninsula.  
Conservation Areas  (Point 6 of Policy  D10) 
2.11.18  The Borough will provide up to date information about the significance of 
Conservation Areas, their local distinctiveness and character, and identify 
features of interest. The Borough has produced detailed appraisals for some 
of its Conservation Areas and will continue to produce these and 
Conservation Management Plans where appropriate. The Borough will 
consider identifying additional Conservation Areas where evidence suggests 
that this is appropriate.  
Local List of Heritage Assets (Point 7 of Policy D10) 
2.11.19  Locally important heritage assets are considered by the Borough Council to 
be of local historic or architectural interest or make a particular contribution 
to the character and appearance of an area . In each case their con servation 
or enhancement warrants special consideration in determining any 
proposals relating to them.  
 
2.11.20  The latest Local List  of Heritage Assets90 includes Locally Listed Buildings 
and Parks & Gardens of Local Historic Interest91. From time to time it may 
be necessary to add further buildings structures and parks to the list and this 
will be undertaken using the methodology detailed  in Appendix 3. 
 
2.11.21  Archaeological sites are identified on the Archaeology and Historic Buildings 
Record (AHBR ) and selection for inclusion is subject to the agreement of the 
County Archaeologist.  
 
2.11.22  In appropriate cases the Borough Council will consider the use of Article 4 
Directions to remove permitted development rights where this would 
safeguard features o f impo rtance and consequently these will be added to 
the Local List of Heritage Assets for completeness.   
                                            
90 Currently the Local Listed Buildings can be found at: www.gosport.gov.uk/conservation  . A combined ‘Local 
List of Heritage Assets’ will be available later.

129 2.12 POLICY D11 : SECURING INFRASTRU CTURE  
Introduction  
2.12.1  New development will normally need  a number of different infrastructure 
requirements to support it. Phased delivery of strategic and local 
infrastructure is a key component of implementing  the Local Plan  proposals . 
Such infrastructure provision includes (but is not exclusive to) transport,  
water supply, wastewater treatment, flood defences, public utilities, health, 
education, recreation and social facilities.  
 
2.12.2  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) states that local plans 
should plan positively for the development and infrastructure  required in the 
area to meet the objectives, principles and policies of the NPPF. Local 
authorities are required to work with other authorities and providers to 
assess the quality and capacity of infrastructure and take account of the 
need for strategic i nfrastructure including nationally significant infrastructure 
within their areas.  
 
POLICY D11: SECURING INFRASTRU CTURE  
 
1. The Borough Council and its partners will work together to review 
and monitor existing provision and identify new infrastructure 
needs within the Borough.  
 
2. In determining the appropriate level of infrastructure required for 
both site -specific and off -site measures, the highest priority will be 
given to the following  types of infrastructure:  
 
a) Flood Risk Management Measures;  
b) Transport infrastructure including public transport, walking, 
cycling, where appropriate highway improvements and electric 
vehicle charging points and associated facilities;  
c) Economic development (including skills and digital technology);  
d) Education and training facil ities (including nurseries, primary 
and secondary schools an d post -16); 
e) Green Infrastructure (including open space, biodiversity net 
gain, nutrient neutrality measures and climate change mitigation 
and adaption); and  
f) Community infrastructure (including spo rts, community, health 
and social care facilities).  
 
3. Development proposals will be permitted where it can be clearly 
demonstrated that the required infrastructure can be provided prior 
to the occupation of the new development. Where there are 
circumstances  which mean a phased approach to delivering 
infrastructure is more appropriate this will be agreed with the 
Council.  
 
4. New Infrastructure provision or improvements to existing assets 
will be provided on -site as an integral part of a development and DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
130 secured through an appropriate S106 agreement.  Where a 
contribution towards off -site infrastructure provision is required in 
lieu of on -site provision, this will be secured through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy and/or planning obligations as 
appropriate.  For s ites where changes to the public highway are 
necessary such works will be secured through a S278 agreement.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D11 
Overarching Approach (Point  1 of Policy D11) 
2.12.3  To accord with the principles of sustainability, this Local Plan proposes that 
growth within Gosport is located within existing urban areas, and there are 
no opportunities for major new Greenfield  sites that are dependent on the 
provision of completely new  infrastructure. Growth within Gosport is 
therefore more dependent on the general provision of infrastructure keeping 
pace with developme nt. This however makes determining the necessary  
infrastructure a more complex undertaking requiring an understanding o f 
existing provision  and whether there are any deficits.  
 
2.12.4  In order to meet the Local Plan objectives and create a genuine sustainable 
community the provision of good infrastructure in the right location at the 
right time is essential for the wellbeing of local residents and ensures that 
the area will be attractive for businesses and visitors. The role of the Local 
Plan is therefore to help maintain existing infrastructure and enable new 
infrastructure to be developed. This can be achieved by ensuring that the 
Borough Council works in partnership with a range of key stakeholders 
including developers, infrastructure providers , neighbouring authorities and 
the local community. Policy  D11 therefore sets out the broad principles to 
delivering infrastructure with in the Borough.  
 
2.12.5  The key requirement regarding infrastructure provision  therefore relates to 
how, when  and where the necessary infrastructure is provided and by 
whom. Details of the known requirements at present are contained within 
the Council’s Infrastru cture Assessment Report and Infrastructure Funding 
Statement which includes an Infrastructure Delivery Plan92. 
 
2.12.6  The Borough Council’s assessment of infrastructure requirements will be 
regularly reviewed over the plan period as inevitably infrastructure dema nds 
will emerge that have not been identified at the present time. There may 
also be difficulties in delivering certain elements of infrastructure which may 
need to be reviewed.  
 
2.12.7  It will be necessary to ensure that the appropriate level and type of 
infrast ructure is provided to support the ant icipated level of development , 
including:

131  Transport including r oads, public transport infrastructure (bus a nd 
ferry)  and measures to encourage walking and c ycling ; 
 Education and training facilities including nurserie s, primary schools, 
secondary schools and post -16 education;  
 Health including s trategic  and local health care;  
 Social facilities including social/community facilities, s ports centres, 
sports p itches, parks and p lay space ; 
 Public services including libraries and c emeteries ; 
 Emergency Services including fire and rescue, a mbulance and p olice; 
 Utilities including gas, electricity, water supply, w astew ater, 
telecommunications  and energy generation;  
 Green infrastructure; and  
 Flood risk m anagement . 
 
2.12.8  The Infrastructure Assessment Report 2021 sets out in more detail the 
issues associated with each type of infrastructure. The Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan sets out as far as practicable when, where and by whom key 
elements of the infrastructure will be del ivered  and is updated annually and 
published on the Council’s website.  
Prioritising infrastructure (Point 2  a-f of Policy D11) 
2.12.9  Investment in infrastructure will be a key component in d elivering net zero 
emissions by  2050  and provision of infrastructure wil l need to be adaptive 
and resilient to a changing environment and will also form a significant part 
of the recovery of the impacts of a post COVID -19 economy and society.  
 
2.12.10  At the local level, t he Local Plan will assist in the transition towards 
achieving t he national target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (see 
Policy D 1: Adap tation and Mitigation To Climate  Change ) and has identified 
a number of key infrastructure priorities which are set out below:  
 
2.12.11  Flood Risk Management Measures:  Identifying, assessing and managing 
flood risk is a key consideration for the Council. Flood events are becoming 
more frequent in the UK and therefore identifying and managing flood risk 
from all sources of flooding has become an increasingly important is sue in 
the planning of new development and the critical infrastructure needed to 
support it. New infrastructure must be delivered in an efficient and timely 
way and must be designed and maintained so it can respond to the effects 
of climate change over the  longer term. Effective management of this risk 
can be achieved through locational choices, and where necessary 
appropriate mitigation measures put in place to protect the development . 
New development proposals will  therefore  contribute towards improving t he 
infrastru cture priorities identified in P olicy D11. 
 
2.12.12  Transport infrastructure:  The Council will support improvements to the 
existing public transport network , and will work with the Local Highway 
Authority to secure appropriate funding and where necessa ry safeguard 
land. Additional infrastructure and enhancements to existing provision for 
walking and cycling  will be encouraged and supported, and will be delivered DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
132 in conjunction with the Local Highway Authority where appropriate and in 
accordance with cur rent and future walking and cycling strategies . 
 
2.12.13  The Council will take a proactive approach towards new development 
proposals (where these comply with other policies in the Local P lan) in 
locations which are well supported by existing public transport prov ision, or 
where new public and active travel links can be provided to ensure that 
those developments can be provided with genuine modal choice which 
reduces reliance on the private car  (see Policy D1 2: Accessibility to New 
Development) . 
 
2.12.14  Electric vehicle c harging infrastructure should be provided as part of new 
major residential and commercial development proposals. The provision of 
electric vehicle charging infrastructure will become more important over the 
lifetime of the Local Plan as the sale of new int ernal combustion powered 
vehicles is due to cease by 2030, and there must be sufficient infrastructure 
to facilitate the increased use of and dependency on electrically powered 
vehicles.  
 
2.12.15  Electric vehicle charging infrastructure will  be expected to be prov ided as 
part of new development in line with the latest best practice and national 
policy (see Policy DE3: Layout of Sites and Parking for further details).  
 
2.12.16  The Council will also support improvements to the Borough’s highway 
networks, both to alleviate  existing congestion challenges  and where 
improve ment in highway  safety  can be made . These will particularly be 
prioritised where evidence shows that these schemes will reduce pollution 
and/or improve air quality in the vicinity of those locations  and wher e there 
are benefits for the safety of vulnerable users . 
 
2.12.17  The Council will safeguard land required to deliver schemes through the 
latest Hampshire County Council Local Transport Plan and where 
appropriate developer contributions will be sought.  
 
2.12.18  Economic D evelopment: Securing appropriate levels of infrastructure to 
support economic development and digital technology will continue to be 
key objectives for securing wider economic investment in the Borough. The 
need to support and enhance the skills of the loc al population in supporting 
the local economy is a key objective of  the Local Plan.  The need to enhance 
local skills and provide additional t raining opportunities has intensified due 
to the economic fall -out of the pandemic with whole sectors of business 
suffering significant losses in output and employment.  
 
2.12.19  The use of Skills and Training Plans on qualifying sites will play a key role in 
delivering effective and timely training opportunities within the Borough. 
Further details relating to the requirements for these are found in Policy E2: 
Skills.  
 
2.12.20  The need for effective and efficient digital technology is a key infrastructure 
component to securing economic development post pandemic.  There is a DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
133 continued focus on greater flexible working practices particular ly working 
from home and the strong growth in online retailing and services means 
there is a need to deliver fast and reliable broadband and 
telecommunications. This is recognised in both the Solent LEP’s Gosport 
Infrastructure Investment Plan and the Coun cil’s Economic Development 
Strategy (January 2021). The Local Plan will support the use of appropriate 
information and c ommunication technologies (see P olicy E5) in order to 
support the creation of new, skills and employment opportunities.   
 
2.12.21  Education and training facilities: Facilities to improve education and 
nursery provision will be supported The Gosport Infrastructure Investment 
Plan (GIIP)93 identifies a number of strategic investment priorities including 
facilities for higher education, dedicated mari ne and maritime skills and a 
hospitality skills centre.  
 
2.12.22  Green Infrastructure:  will be secured as an integral part of all new 
development alongside other appropriate infrastructure such as utilities and 
transport networks. Green infrastructure includes a wide range of measures 
including provision of new open spaces and natural featu res within the 
urban design such as green roofs, street planting and sustainable drainage 
systems.  Where it will not be appropriate to secure on -site provision, a 
developer contribution will be secured through either the Community 
Infrastructure Levy or S1 06 Agreement as appropriate.   
 
2.12.23  Community infrastructure: provision of high quality  community facilities 
including health, education and training and built leisure facilities make a 
key contribution to supporting a high quality  urban environment for local 
communities.  
 
2.12.24  Policy C6: Community, Cultural and Built Leisure Facilities sets out in further 
detail how the Local Plan will seek to protect and enhance the  provision of 
these facilities.  
 
2.12.25  Provision of community facilities will  generally be secured through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy.  However there will be some instances in the 
context of major dwellings of over 100 residential units where it may be 
necessary to provide community buildings or land on -site as part of the 
overall development proposal. Further details relating to this can be found in 
the explanatory text accompanying Policy C6.  
Delivery o f infrastructure (Point 3 of Policy D11) 
2.12.26  It is important that infrastructure needs are met in an efficient and timely 
manner  and therefore there may be circumstances where it will be 
necessary for new or improved infrastructure to be provided before the 
commencement of the development occurs. There may also be 
circumstances where it is more appropriate to deliver the necessary 
infrastructure requirements for a development site through an agreed 
phased approach in line with development completions or occupation.  
                                            
93 The Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan (Solent LEP, 2019)  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
134  
2.12.27  The provision of certain types of infrastructure including utilities such as 
local sewerage facilities will need to be  secured by agreement with the 
relevant service provider. The developer will be required to contact the 
provider as early as possible in the planning process to determine the 
contributions required.  
 
2.12.28  The Council will ensure that the site is served by on -site infrastructure that is 
essential to enable the development to proceed and will normally secure 
such measures through planning conditions and secured through planning 
obligation legal agreements where it is appropriate to do so.  
Developer Contributions ( Point 4  of Policy D11) 
2.12.29  In many instances it will not be possible to provide the required 
infrastructure on -site and therefore a developer contribution will be 
necessary. This will normally be via the Community Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL). This mechanism allo ws local authorities to raise funds from 
developers which can be used to fund a range of infrastructure that is 
needed as a result of development.  
 
2.12.30  The Council’s CIL Charging Schedule sets out the tariffs that will apply to 
various types of development and  is supported by a viability study which will 
be refreshed at appropriate times during the Plan period. The Charging 
Schedule has been prepared in accordance with the Community 
Infrastructure Levy Regulations (2010) and the subsequent amendments 
(2011 -2020 ). 
 
2.12.31  The Schedule will also be accompanied by the annual Infrastructure 
Funding Statement which sets out which forms of infrastructure will be 
funded by CIL (formerly known as the ‘123 List’ ). Qualifying developments 
will be required to make payment in line  with the charging schedule.  
 
2.12.32  In some instances there may be a requirement to collect a developer 
contribution, normally by planning obligations contained in a legal 
agreement ( a Section 106 Agreement  or a Section 278 agreement in the 
case of highway works or improved facilities for cyclists and pedestrians ) in 
accordance with the statutory tests. This will often be for particular works 
associated with that development that are not covered by the CIL. The 
Council has prepared a Planning Obligations and Developer Contributions 
Strategy which sets out the various types of obligations including developer 
contributions that arise from the policies of the Local Plan. Its objectives are 
to provide greater cla rity to developers and the local community when the 
Council will seek Section 106 contributions and other types of obligations 
and how these interact with CIL.  
 
2.12.33  In accordance with the NPPF, the Council recognises that development 
sites should be subject to  a reasonable level of contributions to support 
necessary infrastructure which do not threaten their viability and the 
deliverability of a proposal. As part of the CIL viability work, costs such as DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
135 affordable housing and standards of construction will be  taken into account 
as well as abnormal development costs associated with major regeneration 
sites. It is recognised that this work is at a moment in time and that a site’s 
viability will change over the plan period as part of the economic cycle and 
particul arly post COVID -19.  
 
2.12.34  The Council will aim to strike a balance between the need of securing 
necessary infrastructure to support the development (as well as delivering 
other identified planning objectives) with the need to ensure the 
development remains via ble. 
 
2.12.35  The Council’s approach to securing infrastructure is set out in the Planning 
Obligations Strategy  which is appended to the Infrastructure Funding 
Statement. T he prioritisation of infrastructure is identified in the 
Infras tructure Assessment Report 2021 . 
 
2.12.36  The Council will monitor the delivery of infrastructure throughout the plan 
period and report this annually through the Infrastructure Funding Statement 
(www.gosport.gov.uk/infrastructure ) whi ch includes an  update of the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and the Authority Monitoring Report  
(www.gosport.gov.uk/amr ).

POLICY D1 2: ACCESS IBILITY T O NEW DEVELOPMENT  
 
1. Development proposals that prioritise access for acti ve and 
sustainable travel modes  including walking, cycling and a ccess to 
public transport services, will be supported.  
 
2. Development proposals that are likely to generate significant levels 
of travel demand will be permitted, provided that:  
 
a) The site is located where convenient public transport services 
exist or there is a commitment by the developer and public 
transport providers to deliver such service.  
b) The site is, or will be made, accessible to pedestrians and 
cyclists.  
c) Any new or improved  road access and the traffic generated 
would not have any unacceptable environmental implications 
nor significantly prejudice the safety, function and capacity of 
the road network.  
d) Local and strategic transport improvements will be provided, 
where necessar y, to support the development and mitigate 
adverse impacts on the safety, function and capacity of the 
transport network.  
e) Transport Statements or Transport Assessments are submitted 
in support of the planning applicatio n to evaluate transport 
impacts  and to demonstrate that  suitable  transport 
improvements will be provided which meet the needs of the 
development and mitigate  any adverse impacts.  
f) A Travel Plan is provided in support of a planning application 
where appropriate in relation to the scale and type  of 
development.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y D12 
Public transport, cycling and walking (Points 1 , 2a and 2b  of Policy 
D12) 
2.13.1  Safe access should be provided for cyclists and pedestrians and, where 
practical, priority should be given to pedestrian and cycle movements 
through the delivery of appropriate measures and designed / constructed in 
line with the appropriate national and local technical standards, and 
strategies.  
 
2.13.2  In order to emphasise the importance of sustainable modes of travel the 
Boroug h Council will require that new development which is likely to 
generate significant levels of travel demand is sited in locations that are 
effectively and conveniently served by public transport. Locations that are 
not currently well served by public trans port may be acceptable when 
improvements to public transport are included as part of the overall DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
137 development scheme or as part of programmed proposals in the Local 
Transport Plan (and supporting documents) or arising from other funding 
opportunities.  Early  discussions should be held with public transport 
operators to ensure that where required , any new or improved services will 
be available upon the  occupation of a development site.  
Road improvements (Point 2c of Policy D12) 
2.13.3  It is important that any new roa d or access point onto the existing highway is 
constructed to a satisfactory standard which provides appropriate and safe 
access for ve hicles, pedestrians and cycles.  
 
2.13.4  To aid safety, and help avoid congestion on principal routes within the 
Borough, where a  new access from a Classified Road is proposed, such 
access will only be permitted where it is sufficiently demonstrated that road 
safety would not be adversely affected nor would the access affect the free 
flow of traffic . As per Policy DE4, adequate prov ision should be  made to 
enable vehicles to enter and leave the road in a forward gear.  
 
2.13.5  Developers will be required to have regard to national and local standards 
and their successor documents on the scale, type, design and location of 
highway works includ ing: 
 
 Manual for Streets 2 (Department of Transport , 2010);  
 Companion Document to Manual for Streets (HCC , 2010);  
 Highway Construction Standard Details (HCC).  
Transport improvements associated with new development (Point 2d 
of Policy D12) 
2.13.6  Where a development is likely to impose additional burdens on existing 
transport infrastructure the developer will be required to contribute to 
improvements to enable the travel demands generated by the development 
to be accommodated. Developer contributions for o ff-site improvements will 
be secured either through legal agreements and/or the Community 
Infrastructure Levy. Planning obligations secured through legal agreements 
will be particularly applicable for major development schemes.  
Transport Statements and Transport Assessments and Travel Plans 
(Points 2e and 2f of Policy D12) 
2.13.7  As required by  paragraph 11 3 of the NPPF,  all applications generating 
significant levels of travel demand will need to be accompanied by a Travel 
Plan, Transpo rt Statement or Transport Assessment.  The scope of any such 
requirements must be agreed with Hampshire County Council and Gosport 
Borough Council.  
 
2.13.8  The latest thresholds for requiring a Transport Statement or Assessment are 
set out by Hampshire County Coun cil online94. Further guidance can also be

Assessments and Statements’95. It should be noted that there may be 
particular circumstances where a transport statement or assessment is 
required f or a smaller development. The scope of any required transport 
statement or assessment should be agree d with Hampshire County Council  
as the Local Highway Authority . 
 
2.13.9  The relevant document should assess and illustrate accessibility to the site 
by all modes and the likely modal split of journeys to and from the site. It 
should give details of the proposed measures to improve access by public 
transport, walking and cycling; to mitigate the impact of motorised vehicles; 
to maximise the opportunities for sustain able travel and to provide 
accessibility for all people. It should identify highway improvements 
necessary to prevent congestion and maintain a safe and efficient highway 
network.  
 
2.13.10  Travel plans will be required for developments which generate significant 
levels of traffic. The thresholds for requiring a Travel Plan for various land 
uses are set out by Hampshire County Council online96. Travel Plans will 
detail measures that will reduce dependence on the car, encourage and 
facilitate the use of alternative mo des for journeys to and from work, and 
help protect amenities for the local community. Travel Plans shall include 
performance targets and details of measures and funding to deliver, monitor 
and review them. The scope of Travel Plans should be agreed with 
Hampshire County Council as the Highway Authority and secured by a 
Section 106 Agreement .

139 3.0 STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT  SITES  
3.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1.1  As set out in Policy D3, the Council supports major renewal and growth in 
the Borough’s three Urban Regener ation Areas. The Regeneration Areas  
represent an opportunity for significant new sustainable place -making and 
will provide the focus for new development in the Borough. For each of the 
Regeneration Areas  the Council has set out the overall strategy for eac h site 
of strategic importance , as set out in Policies SS1 to SS11.  
 
3.1.2  Development within these strategic sites will also need to take account of 
other relevant guidance and supporting information such as supplementary 
planning guidance, supplementary planning documents and masterplans.  
 
3.1.3  Some of the site allocations are under multiple ownership and comprise a 
number of development plots. In such cases effective engagement between 
landowners, developers and leaseholders needs to take place in order to 
facilitate potential land assembly and comprehensive redevelopment.  
 
3.1.4  When determining a planning application, flexibility may be applied to the 
policies relating to the site allocation requirements based on an up -to-date 
assessment of need and the agreed v iability position of the scheme to 
ensure the site allocation is deliverable in the context of the principles of 
sustainable development.  
 
3.1.5  However, all development proposals in the area covered by Policy SS1 
should also accord with both Policy D3: Urban Re generation Areas , and in 
the areas where it applies , the detailed guidance set out in the Gosport 
Waterfront and Town Centre Supplementary Planning Document (March 
2018).   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
141 3.2 POLICY SS1: GOSPORT WAT ERFRONT – MARINE EMPLOYMENT  
Introduction  
3.2.1  The Council’s preferred planning approach is for development to be based 
on a clear distinction between safeguarded marine employment and leisure 
zones that retain boat yards, deep water accesses and associated 
infrastructure, and mixed -use zones comprised of town centre uses and 
medium to high density residential development. There are also significant 
opportunities within the Waterfront to intensify uses through the 
reorganisation of existing spaces and buildings,  including the rationalisation 
of vehicular parking and storage facilities and an increased vertical mix of 
uses.  
 
POLICY SS1: GOSPORT WATERFRONT – MARINE EMPLOYMENT  
 
Gosport Waterfront  will be enhanced, intensified and made more 
accessible to enable Gosport to grow and diversify its existing offer to 
become a better recognised global hub for marine and maritime 
business and leisure activities. This will be achieved through the 
following development and planned change : 
 
1. The following sites within Gosport Waterfront are safeguarded for 
marine employment and leisure uses only within Class  B2, B8,  
E(a)(b)(cii)(ciii)(g),  F1(a)(c) and F2(a)(c):  
 
a) Royal Clarence Yard and Retained Area  
b) Gosport Marina  
c) Haslar Marina  
d) Blockhouse Marina  and Haslar Gunboat Yards  
      
2. Proposals for the upgrading, intensification and/or refurbishment 
of safeguarded land, buildings and marine infrastructure so that it 
meets modern marine business and/or leisure standards will be 
supported in principle. All proposals will howev er ne ed to clearly 
demonstrate:  
 
a) Their requirement for being located in these sites rather than 
elsewhere in the Borough; and  
 
b) That there would be no harmful impact on:  
 
i. The ongoing operation of existing marine/maritime 
employment and/or leisure uses; and  
ii. the continued use of operational infrastructure including, 
but not limited to, deep water accesses, slipways, cranes 
and pipelines in any circumstances.  
 
c) The close proximity of residential occupiers and commercial 
and/or leisure uses does not result in un acceptable amenity DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
142 impacts on the former and the continued operation of the 
latter.  
 
3. Other uses will only be supported in principle within the 
safeguarded sites if it is demonstrated that they are ancillary to 
marine employment and/or leisure uses.  
 
4. Non-ancillary commercial and/or residential development within 
safeguarded sites will only be considered in wholly exceptional 
circumstances where it has been clearly demonstrated that:  
 
a) The land it is sited upon, or the existing buildings it re -uses, is 
not required for the future growth of marine employment or 
leisure uses in the plan period; and  
  
b) Where the re -use of heritage assets is proposed it is clearly 
demonstrated that their re -use for any marine/maritime 
employment or leisure use is not viable.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS1  
Safeguarded marine and mari na uses (Point 1 of Policy SS1)  
3.2.2  Gosport W aterfront is a working waterfront with a long history of boat 
building, repair  and marine uses and is a key regeneration area in the 
Harbour Regeneration Area (HBRA) . Employment  associated with marine 
related industries97 are of particular importance to both the Borough and the 
South Hampshire sub -region. It has been identified as a ‘priority si te’ by the 
Solent Local Economic Partnership (LEP)98 in the Solent Strategic 
Economic Plan. This is because of the high number of places where there 
are opportunities to intensify employment generating uses and specifically 
marine -related employment , due pr imarily to the d eep water access 
opportunities.  
 
3.2.3  The Solent LEP Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan (February 2019)99 
sets out that there is a unique opportunity by virtue of public sector land 
disposals to develop and evolve Gosport to become a world -class global 
hub for marine and maritime activity. This includes land at Royal Clarence 
Yard and the Haslar Peninsula. The GIIP (p.59) also identifies the draft 
Local Plan as an opportunity to establish within 1 to 3 years a preferred 
planning policy approac h for key development sites.  
 
3.2.4  This context has resulted in the geographical extent of the Waterfront being 
expanded in the Local Plan from that set out in the March 2018 Gosport 
Waterfront and Town Centre Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  and 
                                            
97 The local marine cluster of businesses includes building and repairing boats, defence activities, water 
transport, equipment manufacturing and recreation, and niche support services geared towa rds the marine 
sector.

143 the relev ant Adopted Local Plan regeneration policy (Policy LP4). The 
Waterfront now includes Area 2 ( Gosport Waterfront ), Area 3 ( Royal 
Clarence Yard and Retained Area ) and Area 8 ( Haslar Marina ), as defined 
in the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD, and Blockhouse Marina 
and Haslar Gunboat Yards on the Haslar Peninsula.  
 
3.2.5  Therefore, the Gosport Waterfront – as defined in this Policy - will be an 
area of key focus for new employment developmen t in the plan period. It is 
therefore proposed to safeguard land with access to assets and facilities 
that serve this sector such as deep -water facilities, slipways , cranes, 
moorings and marinas.  
 
a) Royal Clarence Yard and Retained Area  
 
3.2.6  Royal Clarence Yard has been redeveloped from its original use as a naval 
victualling yard into a mix of residential, light industrial uses and a small 
number of commercial uses (restaurant, cafe and offices). The site  is within 
the Royal Clarence Yard Conservation Area and includes numerous listed 
buildings which have been converted to form a quality deve lopment. In 
addition, i t has an attractive waterfront and marina area.  
 
3.2.7  The Royal Clarence Yard Retained Area (RCYRA), Gosport Marina and 
Blockhouse Marina provide clear  opportunities to support the growth of the 
marine economy and improve the marine leisure offer. The RCYRA offers 
significant opportunities to enhance the local marine and maritime economy 
through new facilities in line with the Solent Local Enterprise Par tnership 
‘Strategic Development Location ’ and ‘ Priority Site ’ designations. The 
Council’s clear preference is for marine or maritime based employment and 
is therefore safeguarded for that express purpose. Redevelopment of the 
retained area should also prov ide public access to the Waterfront and 
enhanced pedestrian routes between Forton Lifting Bridge to the north and 
the town centre. These routes should form part of the national coastal path 
and the Solent Way.  
 
3.2.8  The RCYRA can be sub -divided into two smaller  parcels. The northern 
portion of site (‘Victoria Quays’) has recently been sold by the MoD to a site 
developer for marine -led redevelopment. The southern portion of the 
RCYRA (‘Oil Pipeline Agency Site’) is also identified in the Gosport 
Waterfront and To wn Centre SPD for redevelopment. All development 
proposals should accord with th e detailed guidance in the SPD.  
 
b) Gosport Marina  
 
3.2.9  Gosport Marina includes a cluster of marine -related businesses including 
those connected with the boat repair and maintenanc e facilities at 
Endeavour Quay. The Marina has approximately 500 berths, a dry stack 
facility ( housing up to 160 boats), and is a base for sail training operations. 
As such, both Endeavour Quay and Gosport Marina have a significant role 
in supporting the l ocal marine economy and leisure use and are 
safeguarded accordingly for that specific use.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
144  
c) Haslar Marina  
 
3.2.10  Haslar Marina offers a significant sailing facility with 600 berths and access 
on all tides. The Borough’s Urban Area Boundary has been amended to  
include this site so that benefits from safeguarding for marine employ ment 
and leisure under Policy S S1. The Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre 
SPD (p.85 -86) sets out detailed planning guidance on Haslar Marina and 
Haslar Boat Yard that should be addresse d in any develo pment proposals.  
 
d) Blockhouse Marina and Haslar Gunboat  Yards  
 
3.2.11  The proposed marine employment areas on the Haslar Peninsula, 
Blockhouse Marina and Haslar Gunboat Yard, are entirely within the Haslar  
Peninsula Conservation Area and as such all development proposals should 
accord with the supporting Appraisal100.  
 
3.2.12  Blockhouse Marina is broadly the area between Haslar Bridge and Fort 
Blockhouse which has a shoreline onto the saline Haslar Lake. It include s 
both marine infrastructure such as jetty’s and pontoons, an existing cluster 
of industrial buildings and facilities including the Royal Navy Submarine 
Museum (RNSM) (see Policy SS4) and sailing clubs. Blockhouse Marina is  
currently under MoD ownership.  
 
3.2.13  The Solent Local Economic Partnership Gosport Infrastructure Investment 
Strategy (February 2019) sets out that Blockhouse Marina has existing 
features which are potentially attractive to the marine, marina and 
associated sectors101. This includes deep and sh eltered water on the Solent 
as well as on -site assets and a neighbouring cl uster of technology 
businesses.  
 
3.2.14  The proposed Haslar Gunboat Yard marine employment area is the 
easternmost portion of the site, as defined in the Conservation Area 
Appraisal and in cludes part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument ( the walls 
and guard houses102). Development should take full account of the setting of 
these heritage assets and the adjacent gunboat sheds. The interior 
boundary of the scheduled boundary walls should also be s eparated from 
new buildings to ensure that their significance is sustained. The area of the 
site within  Flood Zone 3 is compatible for marine -related uses and  the 
creation of an open space. There is also an opportunity to incorporate a 
public coastal path within the site.

145 Development principles associated with safeguarding marine and 
marina uses (Point 2 of Policy SS1)  
3.2.15  Employment and/or leisure proposals will be supported in principle , subject 
to it being demonstrated that it is both marine related and necessary for it to 
be located within the safeguarded areas. The objective is to stop scarce 
safeguarded land being used by uses which could satisfactorily be 
accommodated elsewhere in the Borough  including othe r employment land 
designations.  
 
3.2.16  All development proposals, without exception, should demonstrate that the 
ongoing functioning of marine employment and leisure uses should not be 
harmed through amenity conflicts or restricting access and hours of 
operation. Proposals in the vicinity of ma rine operational areas should give 
careful consideration to health and safety implications in relation to access 
to the waterfront and to the security  of moorings and storage areas.  
 
3.2.17  There are deep water accesses at Endeavour Quay, Royal Clarence Yard 
Reta ined Area and Blockhouse Marina. Development proposals in these 
locations must retain the existing accesses to support future growth in the 
marine economy and assist water -based leisure uses where it is needed. 
The retention of deep water access, slipways and cranes for marine 
employment and leisure is of paramount importance.  
 
3.2.18  The potential juxtaposition of commercial uses with residential occupiers 
can sometimes result in long -term amenity impacts. All proposals should 
demonstrate that there would not be significant harmful impacts on 
residential amenity. It is also important to recognise that any residential 
development in the vicinity of marine sites must take into account existing 
and potential marine operations identified in this policy and incorporate  
designs into the dwellings that mitigate any impacts caused by normal 
marine operations.  
 
3.2.19  In relation to the RCY retained area, the MoD will require that it maintains 
control over its remaining oil pipeline and associated land holdings. 
Development propos als in proximity to the oil pipeline will need to address 
this issue. Early engagement with the MoD and Oil and Pipelines Agency is 
encouraged.  
Ancillary and complementary uses to marine and marina uses (Points 
3 and 4 of Policy SS1)  
3.2.20  Other functions which support the marine economy may be acceptable if it is 
clearly demonstrated that this relationship is ancillary. This could include for 
example chandler’s retail units or marine insurance offices. It could also 
include leisure and other commercial uses in c onjunction with marina uses 
provided the extent of the use does not prejudice the continued use of 
marine and marina operations.  
 
3.2.21  For non -ancillary proposals it would have to be clearly demonstrated that 
the site and/or buildings proposed to be utilised would not be required for DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
146 future growth of the marine employment or leisure sectors. Residential 
development would only be considere d appropriate within the safeguarded 
areas in very exceptional circumstances. This is because the supply of 
additional land which could support the long -term growth of the marine 
economy is so scarce.  
 
3.2.22  The re -use of heritage assets for residen tial uses will only be considered 
where it is demonstrated both that there are no other viable commercial 
uses and that residential use would be consistent with its long -term 
conservation.DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
148 3.3 POLICY SS 2: GOSPORT WATERFRON T – MIXED -USE 
REDEVELOPMENT  
Introduction   
3.3.1  Historically, the Waterfront was contiguous with Gosport town centre’s 
dense residential streets, many of which were rebuilt for industrial purposes 
or subject to modern planning in the post -war period. However, the fabric of 
the industrial building stock is aging and some are no longer fit for purpose. 
This provides an opportunity for a return to the more traditional juxtaposition 
of higher density housing, albeit utilising different residential typologies, and 
commercial uses including marine employment.  
 
POLICY SS 2: GOSPORT WATERFRON T – MIXED -USE 
REDEVELOPMENT  
 
1. Outside the designated area for Marine Employment, Gosport 
Waterfront, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for mixed -
use development. Development proposals should make the best 
possible use of land resources to provide accessible, higher 
density res idential dwellings and viable commercial uses. This will 
be achieved through the following development and planned 
change at the following sites:  
 
a) Land at Priddy’s Hard Heritage Area is allocated for mixed -use 
development including:  
 
i. Approximately 1 20 residential dwellings;  
ii. Main town centre commercial uses (up to 1500 sq.m. ) 
complementary to the adjacent Explosion Museum; and  
iii. New pu blic open space on the Ramparts.  
 
b) Land at Mumby Road Lorry Park is allocated for up to 50 
residential dwellings.  
 
c) Land at Gosport Marina  and Harbour Road , outside the 
safeguarded marine employment area, is allocated for the 
following mixed -use development:  
 
i. Approximately 300  residential dwellings; and  
ii. Commercial uses and/or undercroft parking at ground 
floor level;  
 
3. All development proposals should accord with Policy  D3 (Urban 
Regeneration Areas) , the detailed guidance for the site set out in 
the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre Supplementary Planning 
Document (March 2018) where the site falls within the SPD area, 
and b e informed by a Site Masterplan. In order for planning 
permission to be granted the following material considerations, in 
addition to those set out in Policy D1, should be fully addressed:   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
149 a) No significant impact on the ongoing operation of adjacent 
marine operations; and  
b) Fully address the amenity of future occupiers given the local 
marine context.  
 
4. Flood risk from all sources of flooding must be fully taken into 
account for development proposals at sites identified within the 
Gosport Waterfront through sit e-specific FRA(s). New 
development will be safely managed through the application of 
appropriate flood risk mitigation measures.  
 
5. Proposals will need to accord with the NPPF and Policy DE5 
relating to  protecting the integrity of  internationally important 
habitats .  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLICY SS2  
Priddy’s Hard Heritage Area (Point  1a of Policy S S2) 
3.3.2  Land at Priddy’s Hard is allocated for mixed -use development and public 
open space. The site has potential for up to 1 20 residential dwellings and 
commercial uses to  complement the Explosion Museum. The Priddy ’s Hard 
Heritage Area is set out in  Plan 9 . 
 
3.3.3  Planning permission has been  granted for a mixed -use scheme on part of 
the site comprising the new Coastal Forces Museum being operated by the 
National Museum of the Royal Navy together with a  brewery, public house 
and restaurant, holiday lets, 17 residential units and storage units (Class 
B8)103. 
 
3.3.4  The Council considers that there is still considerable potential at Priddy’s 
Hard for further regeneration and expansion of the visitor offer. Proposals 
could capitalise on the setting over Portsmouth Harbour. Public access over 
the waterfront should be improved and would be welcomed in development 
proposals. Boat trips link Priddy’s Hard to the Historic Docks in Portsmouth 
and the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Haslar so there is potential to 
increase footfall without  significant impacts on the local road network.  
 
3.3.5  The Priddy ’s Hard site is within the Priddy’s Hard Conservation Area and 
includes a number of listed buildings. Th e design of new dwellings should 
address this heritage context through appropriate scale, height, vernacular 
and materials. The proposed open space is to be provided on the Ramparts 
which are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Proposals should respect the 
heritage assets of the site as well as making provision for nature 
conservation interests.

150 Land at Mumby Road Lorry Park (Point  1b of Policy SS2 ) 
3.3.6  The existing lorry park at Mumby Road is allocated for residential 
development only. The site occupies a prominent  position at the entrance to 
the town centre and as such proposals should provide a suitable landmark 
building sensitive to the historic context. Land at Mumb y Road Lorry Park is 
set out in  Plan 10.  
 
3.3.7  Development at Mumby Road Lorry Park is within the setti ng of the two St 
George’s Barracks conservation areas and as such development proposals 
should accord with the supporting Conservation Area Appraisals and the 
detailed guidance in the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD.  
Gosport Marina (Point 1c of Poli cy SS2 )  
3.3.8  Land between Gosport Marina and Mumby Road provides the best potential 
opportunities for the delivery of higher density housing in the Waterfront. 
There are several potential mixed -use development opportunities along the 
Mumby Road and Harbour Roa d frontages. This could include commercial 
uses at the ground and first floors with residential dwellings above, or solely 
higher -density residential blocks with ground floor parking. Land at Gosport 
Marina for mixed -use regeneration is also set out in  Plan 10. 
 
3.3.9  The existing trading estate located between Harbour Road and the 
Waterside Medical Centre has redevelopment potential for both marine 
employment and more intensive mixed -use. The area also includes the 
‘Crewsaver’ site which has an existing resident ial consent and is considered 
suitable for approximately 40 dwellings. Any development within this area 
must significantly improve the Mumby Road streetscene through positive 
active frontages and distinctive landmark buildings.  
Development considerations (Point 2 of Policy SS2 )  
3.3.10  All development proposals in the Gosport Waterfront mixed -use 
redevelopment area should address Policy  D3. 
 
3.3.11  Development proposals should fully take account of the detailed 
development principles and guidance in the Gosport Waterfro nt and Town 
Centre SPD (2018). Development proposals should also come forward with 
a suitable Site Masterplan. The Borough encourages different site 
promoters to work together on bringing forward these sites  and this can be 
achieved through a  comprehensive  site masterplan.  
 
3.3.12  New residential development should take account of the proximity of marine 
operations. Dwellings should be designed to ensure that future occupiers 
have a satisfactory level of amenity in terms of noise, light and access to 
private or se mi-private spaces.  
 
3.3.13  Development proposals should also have no significant impact on nearby 
marine and maritime operations which themselves may be noisy or 
undertaken at unsocial hours. Site promoters should design out any DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
151 significant sources of conflict. In addition, where commercial uses and 
residential dwellings are proposed in close proximity, for example in the 
same building, the amenity of all future occupiers should be fully addressed.  
Flood Risk (Point 4 of Policy SS2)  
3.3.14  The Waterfront is in Flood Zones 2 and 3 and has been subject to an interim 
Strateg ic Flood Risk Assessment (2021) . It is considered that the site offers 
significant regeneration benefits that are unrivalled anywhere else in the 
Borough. In order to accord with guidance in the NPPF a sequential test has 
been undertaken where it has been demonstrated that there are no 
alternative sites in the Borough that will deliver the quantum and mix of 
uses. Consequently it will be necessary to ensure that the site fully accords 
with the Exceptio n Test through a site -specific flood risk assessment as 
required by Policy D7.  
 
3.3.15  Within the site the most vulnerable development including residential uses 
should be located in areas of lowest flood risk. This could include ensuring 
residential development is above ground floor level within the Waterfront 
site. Such development will need to be appropriately flood resilient and 
resistant.  
 
3.3.16  It will be necessary to demonstrate that the development is safe from all 
sources of flooding without increasing flood ri sk elsewhere and where 
possible will reduce flood risk overall in accordance with Policies D3 and D7. 
Proposals for flood risk management will need to contribute to the overall 
strategy for reducing flood risk to the existing community over the next 100 
years, and that any proposals that come forward will need to contribute 
positively to the adopted River Hamble to Strategy prepared by Coastal 
Partners. The Council’s approach to flood risk management in this location 
is set out in the Council’s interim Stra tegic Flood Risk Assessment which will 
assist in the preparation of a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment and pre -
application discussions with the Council.  It is recognised significant further 
work will be required to demonstrate the deliverability and su itability of flood 
defences for the Waterfront area. Any site specific FRA will need to  address 
the following matters:  
 
 Safe entry and exit to, and from, the site should a severe flooding 
event occur (this could include raising the level of local roads); a nd 
 Appropriate flood defence infrastructure is in place.  
 Early discussions with the Council (including Coastal Partners) and 
the Environment Agency regarding development at the Waterfront will 
be necessary.  
Protected Habitats (Point 5 of Policy SS2) 
3.3.17  Parts of this Strategic Site such as Priddy’s Hard are either adjacent, or in 
close proximity to the Portsmouth Harbour Special Protection Area, Ramsar 
site and Site of Special Scientific Interest as well as the Solent and Dorset 
Coast SPA. Consequently any deve lopment will need to ensure that the 
nature conservation interests of these sites are not harmed and that the DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
152 appropriate avoidance and mitigation measures are incorporated as part of 
any development proposal in accordance with the Habitats Regulations.

Introduction  
3.4.1  The Harbour Regeneration Area (HBRA) as shown on the Policies Map 
includes Gosport Town Centre. The HBRA defines the town centre in its 
wider sense and includes not only the commercial centre focused on the 
High Street but is expanded, over and above that set out in the October 
2015 Local Plan, to also include the ‘Gosport Lines’ open spaces and 
residential neig hbourhoods west of Weevil  Lane.  
 
POLICY SS3: GOSPORT TOWN CENTRE  
 
1. Gosport Town Centre, as shown on the Proposals Map, will be

application of appropriate flood risk mitigation measures.  
 
8. Proposals will need to accord with the NPPF and Policy DE5 
relating to protecting the integ rity of inte rnationally important 
habitats.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS3  
Principle of Development (Point 1  of Policy SS3 )  
3.4.2  Gosport Town Centre has a number of strengths and weaknesses. The High 
Street is pedestrianised, level and accessible and there  is a range of parking 
options. However, the range of shops is somewhat limited and does not 
attract many visitors from outside the Borough. The range of food and drink 
offers is lacking variety and there are, in common with many High Streets 
nationally, a  number of vacant retail units  which has been exacerbated by 
the economic impact of the political response to the COVID -19 pandemic 
which has accelerated trends for online shopping . In addition  the proximity 
to the larger centres of Fareham and Portsmouth provides sign ificant 
competition and associated leakages of retail spend.  
 
3.4.3  The Gosport, Retail, Leisure and Tourism Study (GLTS) (Lambert Smith 
Hampton 2020)104 sets out that Gosport town centre , given its lack of critical 
                                            
104 Gosport, Leisure and Tourism Study (Lambert Smith Hampton 20 20) Paragraphs  3.22-3.24 and 5.55. DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
157 mass, is likely to be vulnerable to future relative decline in the retail and 
leisure markets given the current national climate for retail and restaurant 
closures and larger centre competition. There is a lack of investment in  the 
centre’s retail offer whilst the centres in Fareham and Portsmouth have 
continued to receive investment. Commercial rents have had falling values 
and the further loss of retail and leisure brands in the town centre will impact 
on existing businesses a nd undermine investment efforts. The cumulative 
impact of these identified threats is considered to be a significant barrier to 
the future prosperity of the town centre.  
 
3.4.4  However, despite the geographical isolation of the centre, there are also 
opportuniti es that take advantage of the region’s significant tourist market 
and as such the town centre should be planned to diversify, in terms of 
uses, beyond retail and leisure. The GLTS identifies several key 
opportunities including the potential expansion of th e street market, the 
repurposing of vacant shops to allow a more flexible approach to uses and 
investment in th e centre’s food and drink offer . The latter, in particular, 
should be developed to appeal to both residents and visitors alike in 
synthesis with the regenera tion of the Gosport Waterfront.  
 
3.4.5  The GLTS concludes that under a higher housing growth target that the 
forecasted need for additional comparison (non -food) goods floorspace is 
very modest, up to 960  sq.m.  to 2036, and should be focused on Gospo rt 
town centre. The higher housing growth forecast target forecasts an 
extremely modest need for additional convenience (food) goods floor space; 
up to 82  sq.m. and distributed across the Borough. As such, given the 
current  level of vacancies there is no ro bust evidence which would suggest 
that there is a need to allocate additional sites for the purpose of new Class 
E (shop) use in the town centre.  
 
3.4.6  Thus to ensure the future vitality of Gosport town centre it is considered that 
the existing retail function on its own will not be sufficient. Instead, the High 
Street should be the centre of a more diverse offer for residents and visitors 
alike in terms of additional non -retail uses. The aim is draw in people who 
may undertake linked trips, extend activity into  the evening and encourage 
people to spend longer amounts of time in the centre as more of th eir needs 
are met in one place.  
 
3.4.7  The importance of leisure and cultural uses such as cafes, restaurants, 
bars, clubs, music and other venues that contribute to the  night -time 
economy is recognised. It is also acknowledged that the town centre is not 
only competing with larger centres outside the Borough but there is also a 
degree of competition for potential new investment within the HBRA 
between various places in t he Waterfront, which is focused on the marine 
economy, and the High Street, which is focused on the retail and service 
economy.  Consequently it is important these areas are complementary and 
connectivity between each area is improved.  
 
3.4.8  The Town Centre is c urrently covered by a Borough -wide Heritage Action 
Zone and a more specific High Street Heritage Action Zone (which also DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
158 covers Stoke Road)105. Both schemes identify projects which will benefit the 
Town Centre including:  
 
 Public realm improvements  including a grant programme to maintain 
historic shop fronts and projects to improve particular areas of the 
Town Centre area (such as ‘the alleyways’ and Bastion No. 1); 
 Development of walking routes with interpretation ; 
 The re -use of vacant units for ne w training, enterprise and community 
functions ; 
 The development of cultural facilities and an events programme . 
 
3.4.9  The western end of the High Street is proposed to be a ‘Cultural Quarter’ 
focused on the Old Grammar School, Discovery Centre, potentially the 
Civic Offices, and the open spaces around these buildings to provide 
additional cultural, arts and built leisure based facilities. The Borough 
Council has significant land holdings south of the High Street, is adjacent to 
large areas of surface parking and  as such would welcome potential 
development proposals for commercial leisure and ancillary functions. For 
example, the GLTS sets out that ther e could be demand for a smaller 
boutique cinema which could boost the centre’s evening time economy and 
that the town centre could benefit from investment in new family 
entertainment facilities such as ten -pin bowling. As such, the Council’s 
preferred location for these, and other built leisure facilities is the High 
Street’s Cultural Quarter or available land adjace nt to it.  
 
3.4.10  The Town Cen tre has a good range of Council -owned surface car parks 
which support its vitality through providing parking for residents and visitors. 
Notwithstanding this , a balance needs to be struck between retaining 
sufficient car parking to c ontinue to support the vitality of the town centre 
and releasing some parking capacity for redevelopment. It is the Council’s 
intention to assess  this in a Parking Strategy to be undertaken either in 
parallel with the progression of the Local Plan or post its adoption . 
 
3.4.11  Due to the already dense and historic nature of development in the Town 
Centre there are only limited opportunities for significant redevelopment 
identified at present. However, there are a number of key opportunities for 
regeneration and re development if brought forward by site promoters. This 
includes, in line with NPPF Paragraph 11 9, the intensification of land 
through converting airspace above buildings and spaces, including those 
with an existing use, for additional commercial or residen tial floorspace.  
 
3.4.12  To improve the quality of open spaces in the Town Centre and create a 
joined up walk following the route of the Gosport Lines  is a key objective of 
Policy S S3. Gosport Lines is a rampart which once entirely encircled the 
town and now only  remains in parts. It comprises a series of open space 
including the Northern Ramparts, St. George’s Field (formerly Arden Park ), 
Walpole Park and Bastion No.1. The Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre 
Supplementary Planning Document ( March 2018) sets out (p.87 -96) 
                                            
105 More information available online www.gosport.gov.uk/haz   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
159 detailed planning guidance relating to the regeneration o f each of the four 
main spaces.  
 
3.4.13  Where opportunities arise the Council will aim to secure key routes to 
enable the publ ic to access the Gosport Lines; a rampart which once 
entirely encircle d the town and now only remains in parts.  This will link with 
the England Coastal Path at both Haslar Bridge and Forton Lake to provide 
an alternative pedestrian and cycle route to the coastline.  
Housing (Point 2  of Policy SS3 ) 
3.4.14  The NPPF (Paragraph 8 6f) recognises that new residential development 
often plays an important role in ensuring the vitality of centres and is 
encouraged on appropriate sites. For Gosport, new dwellings in the town 
centre has the potential benefits of bringing more people and poten tial 
customers for existing and future businesses without the need for private 
vehicular trips and making an effective and efficient use of previously 
developed land.  
 
3.4.15  It is estimated that approximately 550 dwellings could be delivered in the 
Town Centre a rea with specific sites identified in points 3 and 4 below.  In 
addition to these sites there are a number of other potential development 
sites identified  in the SPD that require further assessment but are 
potentially deliverable during the p lan period . The  Council will be working to 
redevelop its own land and with third parties throughout the plan period. 
This may involve the compulsory purchase of land to realise the long -term 
potential of the Town Centre.  
 
3.4.16  South Street is located parallel to the High Stre et and provides the most 
significant development opportunities in the town centre, some of which 
could be developed comprehensively for either mixed -use or residential. 
This includes the former Police Station site, the Precinct and the Coates 
Road Car Park . In addition, as set out in the Waterfront and Gosport Town 
Centre SPD, the Council will look to work with the Waterside Church to help 
realise their ambitions as part a more comprehensive development. 
Detailed planning and design advice on these sites an d others is set out in 
the SPD.  
Gosport Bus Station (Point 3  of Policy SS3 ) 
3.4.17  Three strategic development sites identified in the draft Local Plan in 
Gosport Town Centre are Gosport Bus Station, the former Gosport Police 
Station and Barclay House/Land East o f Barclay House.  
 
3.4.18  The Bus Station site forms a key entrance to the Borough for residents and 
visitors using the ferry to and from Portsmouth. The site is the major 
transport interchange for the Borough and includes the existing bus station, 
taxi rank, car  parking and vehicular drop -off/pick -up area and cycle parking. 
However, the bus station is dilapidated and needs to  be replaced with a 
new purpose -built, multifunctional facility. Redevelopment should provide DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
160 an accessible transport interchange incorporat ing bus services, taxis, a 
pickup area, vehicular waiting area and cycle facilities.  
 
3.4.19  Redevelopment should also provide suitable commercial development such 
as that which falls within the definition of ‘ main town centre uses’ in the 
NPPF Glossary which includes retail, leisure, entertainment, offices, cultural 
facilities and hotels. The ground floor of a new facility should capitalise on 
the site location by providing new food and drink facilities overlooking 
Falkland Gardens and Portsmouth Harbour. Hote ls, cultural and leisure 
uses could be suitable on the first floor and above.  
 
3.4.20  The site also provides a one -off opportunity to provide high -density housing 
in a highly sustainable location overlooking the harbour. It is considered that 
the site could provi de between 150 and 240 new residential dwellings in a 
landmark building in a prominent position overlooking Portsmouth Harbour.  
 
3.4.21  A high quality  internal ly accessible waiting area should also be provided for 
bus passengers as part of a new transport interch ange . Funding for this 
project has been secured from the Government’s Transforming Cities Fund  
in partnership with Hampshire County Council , who will be delivering the 
scheme . Sustainable transport options should be incorporated in to the 
proposal. This inc ludes secure and well -designed cycle parking, facilities for 
electric vehicles, car sharing facilities for residents of the building and a 
cycle hire facility.  
 
3.4.22  The new development should include an attractive, welcoming and well -
positioned visitor informa tion facility which will include exhibition space 
showcasing the Borough heritage as well as ancillary functions including 
toilets (to Changing Place standards).  A public viewing area should be 
provided on a higher storey to overlook Portsmouth Harbour and  Fort 
Blockhouse.  
 
3.4.23  Proposals for taller buildings need to have special regard to adjoining uses 
including the setting of the adjacent Conservation Area, Grade II listed 
Trinity Church and the locally listed Harbour and Seaward Towers. The 
proposed uses an d design of the bus station will need to complement the 
adjacent Falkland Gardens and should not detract from its landscape 
quality  and ensure it avoids any overshadowing of Falkland Gardens . The 
design of any tall building should not be overbearing or cau se significant 
overshadowing. Proposals should not intrude on the key pedestrian route 
between the ferry pontoon and the High Street which should be protected 
and enhanced. The amenity of existing local residents in the area should 
not be significantly har med. Taller building(s) within the bus station site 
should be limited to where the impact on local general amenity would be 
acceptable.  
 
3.4.24  The Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD sets out detailed planning 
guidance on a number of key opportunities for red evelopment including 
Gosport Bus Station and Falklands Gardens, the High Street and Trinity DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
161 Green. All development proposals in Gosport Town Centre should take 
account of the SPD.  
Police Station and Barclay House (Point 4  of Policy SS3 ) 
3.4.25  Hampshire Constabulary has vacated the former Gosport Police Station 
premises and relocated to the Town Hall. The site has potential to be 
comprehensively redeveloped for a high -density residential scheme of 
between 3 and 6 storeys with commercial uses on the ground floor. 
Vehicular access to on -site parking should be at the rear of the site off 
Thorngate Way. Undercroft parking should be provided but through a 
design  that has a positive impact on the wider street scene. Further 
guidance on this site and th e wider South Street area is set out in the 
Gosport  Town Centre and Waterfront SPD.  
 
3.4.26  The design for any potential redevelopment of Barclay House is partly 
determined by the positioning of the dwellings to the north. The scale, form 
and materials would need to be appropriate for its sensitive location 
opposite Trinity Church. Appropriate ar rangements would need to be made 
for those people that currently occupy the buildings.  
Upper Floor Residential (Point 5  of Policy SS3 ) 
3.4.27  There are a number of opportunities for conversions above and behind the 
ground floor of buildings in the Town Centre. Th ose sites that are 
considered to be deliverable as of May 2021  are s et out in the draft policy.  
Detailed Design (Point 6  of Policy SS3 ) 
3.4.28  Development proposals should aim to be compliant with the GBC Parking 
SPD (2014) . However, there may be occasions when t his is not possible 
due to site constraints. As such, any shortfall in parking spaces will be 
balanced against the sustainable nature of the Town Centre where public 
transport is in close proximity.  
 
3.4.29  Development proposals should provide suitable refuse sto rage options both 
for storage and collection. Refuse collectors are unlikely to collect bins from 
remote or obscure parts of a site where bins may be stored and as such 
suitable collection points which do not obstruct the highway or pedestrians 
should be p rovided. Cycle storage should be provided in line with the 
Parking SPD.  
 
3.4.30  All new dwellings should have access to either semi -private (shared) or 
private amenity spaces. This could be either balconies, roof gardens or 
courtyards.  
 
3.4.31  Development proposals shou ld have a positive interface with the wider 
street scene through good design. This includes positive frontages, 
appropriately scaled bounda ry treatments and fenestration.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
162 3.4.32  Residential amenity should be suitably addressed ensuring that future 
occupiers have  good light levels, privacy through a lack of overlooking and 
that extensions to buildings do not have an overbearing im pact on 
neighbouring residents.  
 
3.4.33  All such development proposals should not prejudice the use of the ground 
floor units to fu nction as co mmercial premises.  
Flood Risk (Point 7 of Policy SS3)  
3.4.34  Whilst large areas of the Town Centre are within present day (2021) Flood 
Zone 1, parts of the draft allocation are also within Flood Zones 2 and 3. It 
is considered that the site offers significant regeneration. In order to accord 
with guidance in the NPPF a sequential test has been undertaken where it 
has been demonstrated that there are no alternative sites in the Borough 
that will deliver the quantum and mix of uses. Consequently it will be 
necess ary to ensure that the site fully accords with the Exception Test 
through a site -specific flood risk assessment as required by Policy D7.  
 
3.4.35  Within the site the most vulnerable development including residential uses 
should be located in areas of lowest flood  risk as far as possible. This could 
include ensuring residential development is above ground floor level within 
the Gosport Town centre site. Such development will need to be 
appropriately flood resilient and resistant.  
 
3.4.36  It will be necessary to demonstrat e that the development is safe from all 
sources of flooding without increasing flood risk elsewhere and where 
possible will reduce flood risk overall in accordance with Polices D3 and D7. 
Proposals for flood risk management will need to contribute to the o verall 
strategy for reducing flood risk to the existing community over the next 100 
years, and that any proposals that come forward will need to contribute 
positively to the adopted River Hamble to Portchester Strategy prepared by 
Coastal Partners (formerl y the Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership. 
Strategy. The Council’s approach to flood risk management in this location 
is set out in the Council’s interim Strategic Flood Risk Assessment which 
will assist in the preparation of a site -specific Flood Risk Asse ssment and 
pre-application discussions with the Council.  It is recognised significant 
further work will be required to demonstrate the deliverability and suitability 
of flood defences for the Gosport Town Centre area. Any site specific FRA 
will need to  address the following matters:  
 
 Safe entry and exit to, and from, the site should a severe flooding 
event occur (this could include raising the level of local roads); and  
 Appropriate flood defence infrastructure is in place.  
 
3.4.37  Early discussions with the Council (including Coastal Partners) and the 
Environment Agency regarding development along the waterfront at 
Gosport Town Centre will be necessary.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
163 Protected habitats  and species  (Point 8  of Policy SS3)  
3.4.38  Proposals should meet the requirements of Policy D5  and the NPPF  given 
the Town Centre ’s proximity to  internationally important habitats and sites 
that support  their integrity such as open spaces used b y the protected Brent 
geese.  
 
3.4.39  The scale, form, massing and height of new buildings will need careful 
cons ideration to prevent adverse effects through overshadowing, reduction 
of sight lines, over -illumination and collision risk to birds.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
167 3.6 POLICY SS 4: BLOCKHOUSE AND HA SLAR GUNBOAT SHEDS  
Introduction  
3.6.1  The Haslar Peninsula is covered by a number of site -specific policies and 
must be read in conjunction with the overarching policy requirements set out 
in Policy D 3: Urban Regeneration  Areas. Blockhouse i n this policy refers to 
the area immediately  east of Haslar Hospital outside Gosport Waterfront 
and Fort Bloc khouse.  
 
POLICY SS4: BLOCKHOUSE A ND HASLAR GUNBOAT SHEDS  
 
1. Regeneration of the Blockhouse, and the Haslar Gunboat Sheds 
and Traverser area, should protect and enhance its unique heritage 
assets and waterfront location, and make the best possible use of 
its land resources to provide a set of accessible mixed -use 
neighbourhoods. This will be achieved through the following 
development and planned change . 
 
2. Blockhouse as shown on the Policies Map and the supporting 
Parameters Plan, is allocated for the following mixed -use 
regeneration:  
 
a) Approximately 325 new residential dwellings;   
 
b) Strategic open space providing new capacity for flood risk 
mitigation, ch ildren s play areas and habitats for protected 
species;  
 
c) A mixed -use neighbourhood centre with frontage onto Haslar 
Road and an off -road bus stop to serve the site;  
 
d) Strategic surface vehicular parking area sited south of Haslar 
Road to support the future v iability of employment, leisure, 
visitor attractions and the future redevelopment of Fort 
Blockhouse; and  
 
e) A network of fully accessible pedestrian and cycle routes . 
 
3. The redevelopment of Blockhouse should be in accordance with a 
Strategic Masterplan to be  agreed between the Local Planning 
Authority and the Site Promoters. T he Strategic Masterplan should:  
 
a) Reflect  the principles set out in the Blockhouse Parameters Plan 
(below);  
 
b) Be supplemented by a Design Code which takes account of 
national design guidance and the Haslar Peninsula 
Conservation Area Appraisal (March 2007);  
 
c) Identify the phasing of development and set out an supporting DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
168 Infrastructure Delivery Schedule to identify k ey infrastructure 
needs and delivery;  
 
d) Retain the existing road network and accesses for vehicular 
access and egress onto the wider road network and not 
preclude the commercial redevelopment of the adjacent Haslar 
Gunboat Yard;  
 
e) Take account of the potent ial for a park and ride scheme at 
Walpole Car Park adjacent to Gosport Town Centre; and  
 
f) accord with the NPPF and Policy DE5 relating to protecting the 
integrity of internationally important habitats  and species . 
4. The Council will positively consider the re -use of the Haslar 
Gunboat Sh eds and Traverser area, for any viable use where it is 
clearly demonstrated that:  
 
a) The significance of heritage assets is sustained and enhanced 
and is consistent with their long -term conservation;  
 
b) The proposed uses would not  give rise to significant harm to the 
amenity of neighbouring residents; and  
 
c) The site can be suitably accessed by vehicles, pedestrians and 
cyclists.  
 
5. Support will be given for cultural development proposals which 
protect and enhance existing facilities,  including the Royal Navy 
Submarine Museum, and provide appropriately designed new 
cultural and community facilities.  
 
6. Flood risk from all sources of flooding must be fully taken into 
account for both the Blockhouse and the Haslar Gunboat Shed 
sites throug h site -specific FRA(s). New development will be safely 
managed through the application of appropriate mitigation.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS4  
Blockhouse Strategic Outcomes (Point 1 of Policy SS4)  
 
3.6.2  The nationally important heritage assets and waterfront location of 
Blockhouse p rovides a unique setting for a set of new mixed -use 
neighbourhoods. Key development outcomes that should be delivered at 
Blockhouse include :  
 
 New viable uses for heritage asse ts consistent with their long -term 
conservation and enhance their setting;  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
169  A safeguarded zone at Blockhouse Marina to enable the long -term 
growth of marine employment and leisure  (see Policy SS1) ;  
 Delivery of approximately 325 new homes that offer the opportunity 
for all to live in the area;  
 A public realm strategy that delivers an accessible network of 
pedestrian and cycle routes, and open spaces;  
 Provision of public transport alternatives to the private car;  
 Development co mpatible with current and future flood risk that 
provides appropriate mitigation; and  
 Delivery of multifunctional open spaces that provide for public 
access, flood risk and biodiversity enhancements.  
Parameters Plan (Point 2 of Policy SS4)  
2a: Blockhouse residential area  
 
3.6.3  Blockhouse provides an opportunity to provid e approximately 325 new 
homes . Residential development at Blockhouse should be concentrated 
within the 3.0  ha allocation site parallel to the Solent. The boundary set out 
in the Blockhouse Param eters Plan.  
 
3.6.4  The proposed Blockhouse residential area is entirely within the Haslar 
Peninsula Conservation Area and as such proposals should accord with the 
supporting appraisal. The Haslar Hospital Grade II listed historic park is in 
close proximity to t he westernmost portion of the residential area. Although 
outside the prime setting of the Hospital, as defined in the Conservation 
Area Appraisal, residential designs here should be appropriately scaled and 
sympathetic to the wider setting of the Hospital.  
 
3.6.5  The context of the easternmost portion of the proposed Blockhouse 
residential area is less visually sensitive given the adjacent buildings are of 
commercial character, some of which are of significant massing, and which 
are sited on land proposed to be a llocated for marine employment or leisure 
uses. As such, this portion of the proposed Blockhouse residential area has 
the most capacity for high density housing. However, all buildings should be 
no higher than the modern designed but listed Submarine Escap e Training 
Tower (SETT) to ensure that it remains visually preeminent within the wider 
Blockhouse townscape.  
 
2b: Strategic Open Space  
 
3.6.6  Blockhouse currently contains a sports field of approximately 2.75ha used 
by the MoD for football and rugby pitches. It is proposed that the open 
space is reconfigured106, in conjunction with the demolition of some of the 
existing modern military residential blocks and clearance of service yards 
adjacent to the Royal Navy Submarine Museum (RNSM)  to facilitate the 
following si gnificant benefits:.   
 
                                            
106 The size of the proposed new open space would be app roximately 2.3ha  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
170  Provision of a long open vista between the eastern elevation of 
Haslar Hospital and Fort Blockhouse;  
 Capacity for on -site strategic flood mitigation landscape features such 
as swales;  
 Provision of land for a re -routed Solent Way and the National Coast 
Path through Blockhouse;  
 Local amenity space for residents and visitors;  
 A children’s play area to serve future residents and visitors alike; and  
 Providing views of open space for a significant number of dwellings in 
the proposed new r esidential area . 
  
3.6.7  The open area adjacent to the RNSM could also be used for a modestly 
sized area of vehicular parking for the attraction to assist the facilitation of 
the proposed neighbourhood centre which the RNSM owns.  
 
2c: Neighbourhood Centre  
 
3.6.8  The eastern end of the Haslar Peninsula is currently devoid of local facilities 
falling within Class E use. The regeneration of Blockhouse and the potential 
delivery of approximately 1,000 new dwellings and significant commercial 
development, taking the co nsented Haslar Hospital into account, could 
provide an opportunity to facilitate a modestly scaled new neighbourhood 
centre to provide shops and cafes. A new neighbourhood centre with a 
frontage onto Haslar Road would benefit from passing trade, be in 
reasonable proximity to the Submarine Museum  and be within walking 
distance of Haslar Hospital and the two new proposed residential areas. The 
Neighbourhood Centre should also include an off -road bus stop to provide 
public transport access to Blockhouse, Hasla r Hospital and Fort Blockhouse 
without detriment to the flow of traffic on Haslar Road. It should be designed 
not to detract from the historic environment.  
 
3.6.9  The adjacent Haslar Hospital site has a consent for several main town 
centre uses including health centre (Class D1), hotel (Class C1), tearoom 
and restaurant/bar (Class A3/A4) and convenience store (A1). Any 
commercial units within the proposed neighbourhood centre are in addition 
to those at Haslar if implemented.  Any convenience store will need to b e 
limited in scale to serve the site and the immediate neighbourhood.  
 
2d: On -site strategic surface vehicular parking  
 
3.6.10  Blockhouse currently has a number of surface parking areas for military 
personnel, visitors and users of marine leisure facilities. A s ignificant area of 
surface parking is proposed to be retained within Blockhouse for RNSM 
visitors, future marine employees and leisure users , and potentially for 
visitors of facilities at Fort Blockhouse or those exploring other part of the 
Haslar Peninsul a.  
 
3.6.11  The strategic surface vehicular parking should be sited in accordance with 
the Parameter Plan to the rear of the proposed neighbourhood centre. This 
area is currently a mix of hard surface parking and modern buildings. The DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
171 provision of parking here co uld significantly reduce additional vehicular 
movements further into Blockhouse and would provide a comparatively 
open vista of the eastern elevation of Haslar Hospital from the westernmost 
end of Haslar Bridge. Consideration will need to be given to soft and hard 
landscaping to reflect its location within an historic landscape.  
2e: A network of fully accessible pedestrian and cycle routes  
3.6.12  The regeneration of Blockhouse provides a unique opportunity to improve 
public access and connectivity across Haslar. T he existing Solent Way and 
the England Coast Path could be re -routed through Blockhouse and away 
from the enclosed Haslar Road. Additionally, the shoreline around 
Blockhouse, Haslar Barracks and Fort Blockhouse (see also Policy SS5 -7) 
should be opened up i n perpetuity to provide public access with routes 
accessibility as far as could reasonably be facilitated.  
Strategic Masterplan (Point 3 of Policy SS4)  
3a: Parameters Plan  
3.6.13  Given the scope of the proposed changes to land uses, the extent of flood 
risk and the set of nationally important heritage assets within and adjacent 
to the site, development proposals should be set out through a strategic 
masterplan. The masterplans shou ld guide Blockhouse’s transition from a 
predominantly military site to an accessible and vibrant place comprised of a 
set of distinctive places. Masterplans should be informed by a suitable 
analysis of the area’s heritage assets and flood risk, and set out  the context 
for appropriate development in light of this. The masterplan should be in line 
with the Haslar Parameter Plans which outlines the Council’s preferred 
distribution of land uses, access routes and building heights.  
 
3.6.14  It order to achieve an attra ctive and sustainable set of neighbourhoods, new 
development should offer a suitable internal transition in terms of built form 
and fabric. The layout of new development should be physically integrated 
into the existing urban form, maintaining and enhancin g permeability 
between the town centre and existing residential suburbs to the west and 
thus create the conditions for future social cohesion between older and 
newer parts of the community.  
 
3b: Design and Heritage Assets  
 
3.6.15  Whilst it is not the intention of the Local Plan policies to stifle innovative 
design solutions, the primary development outcomes are considered to be 
essential factors in the creation of attractive and sustainable new mixed -use 
neighbourhoods in the Hasla r Peninsula. A very robust justification would be 
required if a scheme which  departs from these principles were to be 
accepted.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
172 3.6.16  In line with the advice in the national Planning Practice Guidance107, 
Strategic Masterplans should be supported by a detailed De sign Code108. 
The content of a Blockhouse Design Code should be informed by a site-
specific  analysis reflecting the 10 characteristics of good places set out in 
the National Design Guide109. A Blockhouse Design Code should also take 
account of the detailed des ign guidance in the Haslar Peninsula 
Conservation Area Appraisal which includes, inter alia:  
 
 Formal grid layouts, the retention of existing roads and avoidance of 
new serpentine internal routes;  
 Buildings to be subservient in scale and height to the easte rn 
elevation of Haslar Hospital;  
 Simple and plain forms of residential architectural vernacular; and  
 Enhanced views to and from heritage assets and their setting.  
 
3.6.17  Buildings should establish a consistent and continuous frontage to create a 
strong enclosure of the street space and sense of continuity. Development 
surrounding the public open spaces should adhere to a common building 
line to establish the area of open s pace. Areas of public open space should 
be overlooked by surrounding development and should have active uses 
fronting onto them.  Taller residential buildings will be permitted parallel to 
the Solent shoreline where they will assist in place -making and help ing the 
legibility of the area. A degree of variety in the heights of blocks is welcomed 
as this creates visual interest and contributes towards a positive character 
for the area.  
 
3c: Identify Infrastructure  Needs  
 
3.6.18  In order to ensure that the implementati on of major regeneration projects 
are delivered within the plan period they should be broken down into 
manageable project components. The phasing of development may be 
contingent on essential infrastructure being in place.  
 
3.6.19  Development must contribute to the provision of infrastructure necessary to 
support the new sustainable communities at Blockhouse. Because of the 
scale of development in the regeneration area, supporting infrastructure will 
need to include provision on -site towards public open space, co mmunity 
facilities, junction improvements, bus enhancements and new pedestrian 
and cycle connections. Where on -site provision is not possible or not 
feasible, financial contributions will be sought.  
 
3.6.20  At Blockhouse and Fort Blockhouse (see Policy SS5) the m ost critical 
infrastructure requirement is likely to be suitably upgraded sea defences at 
the seawall facing the Solent. Other infrastructure that could impact phasing 
                                            
107 Paragraph: 006 Reference ID: 26 -006-20191001 and Paragraph: 008 Reference ID: 26 -008-20191001  
108 The NPPF Glossary defines a Design Code as : A set of illustrated design requirements that provide specific, 
detailed parameters for the physical development of a site or area. The graphic and written components of the 
code should build upon a design vision, such as a masterplan or other design and developme nt framework for a 
site or area.  
109 www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -design -guide   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
173 includes sewerage infrastructure, flood risk mitigation and improvements to 
the local hi ghways (see criterion 3d). Consideration will need to be given to 
the capacity of the physical infrastructure, particularly for sewerage and 
surface water and the ability of the sewerage network to take increased foul 
and surface water drainage generated by  new development. Surface water 
will need to be managed as close to its source with run -off minimised 
through the integration of appropriate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SDS).  
 
3d: Access and Highways  
 
3.6.21  Blockhouse benefits from an existing good quality in ternal road network with 
three vehicular accesses onto Haslar Road. The Council considers it would 
be the most sustainable option to re -use, and upgrade where necessary, 
this network rather than plan new accesses, roads and routes. There is only 
one access  and egress to the Haslar Gunboat Yards and Sheds, close to 
Haslar Bridge, which should be used for redevelopment of those sites rather 
than the creation of any alternative accesses through the scheduled 
monument.  
 
3.6.22  The Haslar Peninsula is connected to Gosp ort Town Centre by Haslar Road 
which passes over Haslar Creek on a 200m long single lane bridge. It is 
signal controlled to allow traffic travelling in each direction to use the bridge 
alternatively. In light of the limitations of both the bridge and the r oad 
network to the west, Hampshire County Council as the Highway Authority 
consider that new development on the Haslar Peninsula, including 
Blockhouse, should not result in significantly more traffic than that arising 
when the proposed sites were fully occ upied by the MoD. The scale of 
development within the wider Haslar Peninsula will therefore need to be 
kept within the capacity of the current bridge and highway network.  
 
3.6.23  As such, it will be necessary to ensure that any development on the Haslar 
Peninsula mitigates any adverse impact on the strategic road network 
(SRN) or the rest of the highway network. As such, proposals will need to 
provide a Transport Assessment to demo nstrate whether there are any 
impacts and how these will be mitigated.  
 
3e: Potential Park and Ride  
 
3.6.24  Proposals should also take account of the potential for a park -and-ride 
scheme at Walpole car park to the north. The surface car park is owned by 
the Boro ugh Council and is often under -utilised. It is within close proximity 
(approximately 800 metres) to the areas identified in the Blockhouse 
Parameters Plan for employment use and hence could be easily accessed 
by staff and visitors by sustainable modes of t ransport such as walking and 
cycling. A park -and-ride could help both significantly on reducing vehicular 
movements, as set out in criterion 3d, across the single -file Haslar Road and 
reducing the land -take for surface parking.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
174 3f: Designated Sites and P rotected Species  
 
3.6.25  Blockhouse is adjacent to internationally important habitats (Portsmouth 
Harbour SPA and Ramsar Site and the Solent and Dorset Coast SPA).  
Gosport is an important location for feeding and roosting Brent geese and 
wading birds. Under nati onal, regional and local policy  these habitats and 
protected species will have continued protection. As such, it will be 
necessary to undertake appropriate ecological studies of the Blockhouse 
sites and ensure that development does not have a detrimental i mpact on 
these protected species and any other features of ecological importance. 
This includes other habitats in the vicinity such as those areas outside of 
designated sites known to be of importance for protected species (such as 
Brent geese and other wa ding birds).  
 
3.6.26  The original Habitats Regulation Assessment for the Adopted  Local Plan110 
recognises that development on the Haslar Peninsula has the potential to 
have a detrimental impact on the internationally important habitats. 
Consequently it will be nece ssary to ensure proposals avoid and mitigate 
any adverse impacts on internationally important habitats  (or areas outside 
of the designated sites known to be of importance to the internationally 
important specie s. A number of measures should be considered i ncluding 
those highlighted in the original HRA report as well as those identified as 
part of the  Solent Disturbance and Mitigation Strategy and the requirement 
associated with achieving nutrient neutrality (See Policy D5) . 
 
3.6.27  A project level HRA is likely to  be required at the planning application stage 
depending on the location and the nature of the proposal on the Haslar 
Peninsula. It will be necessary to ensure that development does not have a 
detrimental impact on the features of the European sites either  alone or in-
combination  with other plans and projects. If there was such an impact the 
proposal would not be in accordance with the Council’s planning policies 
and would be refused 111. 
 
3.6.28  Particular consideration will need to be given to the potential impact  that 
development could have on Haslar Lake. There will need to be careful 
management to prevent access onto the intertidal area, with sufficient 
screening to ensure dog walkers and cyclists do not disturb birds within the 
SPA/Ramsar. The policy also requi res that sections of the Solent frontage 
are opened up to public access. The southern seawall is a potentially 
important wader roost. Proposals to open up the route will require additional 
bird surveys and careful planning and design.  
Haslar Gunboat Sheds and Traverser Area (Point 4 of Policy SS4)  
3.6.29  The gunboat sheds and associated traverse system form part of the Haslar 
Gunboat Yard. The Haslar Gunboat Yard is a unique naval site operating as 
a yard for the housing and repair of British gunboats between 1856  and

111 Unless it could be shown that the project was of overriding public intere st and could secure any necessary 
compensatory measures in accordance with the Habitats Regulations 2010.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
175 1906. Its significance lies in its association with iron technology through the 
traverser system designed and used especially for the purpose of moving 
gunboats and for its historic significance as the only gunboat yard to have 
been built by the Royal  Navy. The site comprises a series of original iron 
sheds for housing the gunboats.  The gunboat sheds are listed Grade I and 
scheduled and the remaining brick structures, contemporary to the sheds, 
are curtilage listed.  
 
3.6.30  The NPPF states that plans should set out positive strategies for the 
conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment taking into account, 
inter alia, the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of 
heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with the ir 
conservation. As such, for the gunboat sheds and  the associated traverser 
system area112, the Council will take a positive approach to proposals for 
suitable viable uses in which the heritage assets and their setting is 
sustained and enhanced. This could include either commercial uses such as 
marine employment, leisure uses or open air sales. Marine employment and 
related uses could complement uses at the adjacent Gunboat Yard site and 
the Qinetiq Haslar Marine Technology Park . 
 
3.6.31  The site may also be approp riate as a heritage attraction benefiting from 
being in close proximity to other naval heritage attractions in the area. The 
long-term viability of such an operation would need to be considered and 
preferably it would be linked to an established attraction  in the area or a 
national charity. The potential for residential use will be limited given the 
constraints of the site in terms of the building form of the Grade I listed  
structures, their setting and access arrangements. All development 
proposals should however clearly demonstrate that the use would not give 
rise to significant harmful amenity impacts on existing and prospective 
residents in the local area.  
 
3.6.32  Proposals should also demonstrate suitable access. The Council’s 
preference is an access from the  adjacent Qinetiq site. However, vehicular 
access could also be made through the proposed adjacent marine 
commercial area on the remainder of the Gunboat Yard. Redevelopment of 
the Yard should take this into account. It will be important that development 
in the Gunboat Yard does not prejudice the successful re -use of the 
Gunboat Sheds and Traverser Area and vice versa.  
Cultural and Community Facilities (Point 5 of Policy SS4)  
3.6.33  Both Blockhouse and Fort Blockhouse provide a significant opportunity to 
create a new heritage/leisure quarter focusing on the strengths of its 
location and heritage assets. Blockhouse includes the existing Roya l Naval 
Submarine Museum (RNSM), the potential future expansion and 
enhancement of which th e Council supports in principle. The Council also 
                                            
112 The Traverser System was a means by which boats could be easily hauled up and stored; and equally, 
removed from storage for active service in a time ly fashion. The solution was a traverser system, complete with 
slips, that allowed boats to be hauled up and moved parallel to the waterline before being placed in a storage 
shed.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
176 supports in principle alternative uses for the listed SETT for community, 
education or training purposes.  
Flood Risk (Point 6 of Policy SS4)  
3.6.34  Flood risk is a key consideration for development proposals at Bl ockhouse 
and the Haslar Gun Boat Shed locations. A flood risk assessment will be 
required demonstrating that the development is safe from all sources of 
flooding without increasing flood risk elsewhere and where possible will 
reduce flood risk overall. Any  site specific FRA will need to accord with the 
flood risk matters identified in Policies D3 and D7. In the case of Blockhouse 
and the Haslar Gunboat Shed s a FRA should also address the following 
matters:  
 
 Safe entry and exit to and from the site should  a severe flooding 
event occur;  
 In addition, at Blockhouse, all development proposals should address 
the condition of the existing Haslar Sea Wall defences and the risks 
of defence failure and potential overtopping of sea defences; and  
 Ensure appropriate f lood risk management measures are in place 
including defence infrastructure at Haslar Sea Wall. The 
consideration and design of such measure must take into account the 
long term effects of climate change including sea level rise and 
surface water flooding.  
 
3.6.35  The long term maintenance of identified flood risk management measures 
over the life of the proposed development will be secured through a S106 
planning obligation (or equivalent).   
 
3.6.36  Detailed discussions with the Council (including the Coas tal Partners) and 
the Environment Agency will be required as part of the planning application 
process.DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
178 3.7 POLICY SS5: FORT BLO CKHOUSE  
Introduction  
3.7.1  Fort Blockhouse is located at the eastern apex of the Haslar Peninsula 
overlooking the Solent and the entrance to Portsmouth Harbour. A 
Blockhouse, or fortified tower, is known to have been located at the end of 
the Haslar Peninsula since the Tudor period.  A 21-gun battery was 
constructed by 1674 and further works including two demi -bastions were 
completed in the 18th century. Some of these heritage assets are retained 
to the present day and have dictated the basic form of the fort since. The 
mid-19th centu ry saw further significant works at Blockhouse to take 
account of developments in weaponry and military architecture. The most 
notable additions were the stone constructed Upper and Lower Battery, 
known as the North Bastion, which provided fields of fire o ver Portsmouth 
Harbour and the construction of new quarters for officers and soldiers.  
 
POLICY SS5: FORT BLOCKHOUSE  
 
1. Fort Blockhouse, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for 
heritage -led regeneration. The Council will positively consider the 
re-use of Fort Blockhouse’s heritage assets for approximately 150 
residential dwellings and any viable  Main Town Centre use  or sui 
generis uses where it is clearly demonstrated that the significance 
of heritage assets is sustained and enhanced and is consistent 
with their long -term conservation.  
 
2. The demolition and redevelopment of existing buildings which are 
not identified as designated heritage assets or undesignated 
buildings of historic interest in the Haslar Peninsula Conservation 
Area Appraisal (March 2007 ) is acceptable in principle. Proposals 
should however be of the highest quality urban design and 
architecture and compatible with the unique heritage of the site 
and its setting.  
 
3. In line with the Haslar Peninsula Conservation Area Appraisal 
(March 2007), Buildings 64 (Clyde Block) and 65 (Clyde Block 
North) could be demolished to form a formally landscaped public 
open space upon their footprint and hence provide a new long 
vista across Portsmouth Harbour to significantly better reveal the 
historic s ignificance of the adjacent listed North Bastion.  
Appropriate recording will be necessary.  
 
4. Redevelopment proposals should provide integrated and publicly 
accessible pedestrian routes onto and around the Haslar, 
Portsmouth Harbour and Solent waterfronts, a nd high quality  
landscaped public open spaces within and around the Fort 
Blockhouse Scheduled Ancient Monument.  
 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
179  
5. Fort Blockhouse has significant archaeological assets. Further 
archaeological investigations should be undertaken to inform 
development propo sals and  mitigation strategies set out.  
 
6. Flood risk from all sources of flooding must be fully taken into 
account at Fort Blockhouse through site -specific FRA(s). New 
development will be safely managed through the application of 
appropriate flood risk miti gation measures.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS5  
Heritage Led Regeneration (Point 1  of Policy SS5 ) 
3.7.2  Fort Blockhouse falls entirely within the Haslar Peninsula Conservation 
Area. The core of Fort Blockhouse is a Scheduled Ancient Monument 
(SAM). Within  the SAM are a number of listed buildings and non -designated 
heritage assets. To the immediate west of  the SAM and around the 
bastions’  is an archaeological site of interest. The Haslar Peninsula 
Conservation Area Appraisal (March 2007) confirm that the hi storic 
fortifications and the early 20th Century submarine base dominate s in terms 
of design influence. The site layout is formal and small areas of open space 
such as the Parade Ground, the garden area within the West Demi -Bastion 
and memorial garden are all of historic interest and add to the character of 
the Conservation Area.  
 
3.7.3  The heritage assets at Fort Blockhouse, particularly those within the 
Scheduled Ancient Monument, are considered to be appropriate for re -use 
for main town centre uses. For exampl e, the Officer and Submariner 
quarters Thames , Hazard, Mercury  and Bonaventure , and The West Demi 
and North Bastions, are considered to be most suitable for re -use as either 
a hotel, restaurant o r bar. The North and West Demi B astions are potentially 
suita ble for food and drink use. The outdoor spaces associated with these 
heritage assets also have likely scope for re -use for outdoor activities 
associated these uses. Buildings 57, 58, 60 and 61 ( Arrogant Block , Sub 
Station , Rapid Block  and Alecto  Block  respectively) could be used for 
ancillary hotel accommodation in conjunction with Thames Block, or as 
holiday accommodation to assist the local visitor economy. Building 50 ( Post 
Office ) could be used for retail or quasi -retail use.  
 
3.7.4  Potential re -use options for the South Casements at this time are not clear 
but the Council would take a positive stance if an appropriate non -residential 
scheme, which conserves and enhances the heritage asset, were to come 
forward. However, listed buildings No. 24 (St N icholas M emorial Chapel) 
and No . 46 (St Ambrose Church) should be retained for Class D1 (Place of 
Worship) use only.  
 
3.7.5  Fort Blockhouse offers significant potential for both conversion of heritage 
assets to residential use and new residential buildings. Any residenti al DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
180 development should sensitively account for the historic fabric of the area’s 
heritage assets. The two areas where new residential buildings would be 
acceptabl e in principle include the hard surface parking area adjacent to 
Buildings 58, 60 and 61 and th e area north of the North Bastion. It is 
considered that there is potential capacity for approximately 150 dwellings at 
Fort Blockhouse although the final figure would depend on the typologies 
bought forward and the vehicular parking strategies utilised wh ich should 
not have a deleterious impact on local visual amenity and townscape 
quality.  
Non-Listed Buildings (Point 2  of Policy SS5 ) 
3.7.6  The scale of new development should be physically integrated into the 
existing form and fabric of Fort Blockhouse which is predominantly 3 
storeys. New buildings should be generally subservient in their massing to 
the heritage assets. Buildings of significantly larger height, up to 5 storeys, 
will only be permitted at the easternmost end of the Peninsula , north of the 
North Ba stion. The layout of new development should reflect the general 
linear formality of the existing form of Fort Blockhouse with tightly defined 
blocks and a strong sense of enclosure . The architectural vernacular, 
fenestration and roof form of new buildings could be either traditional, 
modern, or a mix of both, but all should enhance or better reveal the 
significance of the  heritage assets.  
 
3.7.7  Residential typologies should be either townhouses or modestly scaled 
flatted blocks. New buildings should establish a consistent and continuous 
frontage to create a strong enclosure of the street space and sense of 
continuity. To provide a high level of passive surveillance, all development 
must contribute to overlooking and animation of the street and other public 
spaces . 
Clyde Block (Point 3  of Policy SS5 ) 
3.7.8  The two Clyde Block buildings, whilst of a traditional vernacular, are not 
heritage assets nor are they of particular historic importance. The two 
buildings are however of significant massing and essentially obscure the 
North Bastion in longer view across Portsmouth Harbour. It is considered 
acceptable to demolish the two buildings to better reveal the significance of 
the North Bastion in wider views over Portsmouth Harbour. The loss of the 
two Clyde Block buildings i s considered to comprise less than substantial 
harm to the setting of the Haslar Peninsula Conservation Area.  Appropriate 
recording of the building  will be required with advice from the Council’s 
Conservation Officer.  
 
3.7.9  A secondary benefit of the proposed r emoval of the two Clyde Block 
buildings is to form a new landscaped public open space with views over 
Portsmouth Harbour. The open space should be devoid of new structures or 
buildings which could harm the setting of the North Bastion. The preferred 
landsc aping form is hard rather than soft given the site’s exposed location 
adjacent to Portsmouth Harbour.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
181 Access (Point 4  of Policy SS5 ) 
3.7.10  The release of Blockhouse for redevelopment provides an opportunity to 
provide fully accessible new pedestrian routes for t he public in this unique 
place. The Solent facing and eastern shoreline of Fort Blockhouse between 
the South Casements and Pier Head, with its expansive views over 
Portsmouth Harbour, should be retained as public open space rather than 
incorporated into pr ivate or semi -private open space. Likewise, a publicly 
accessible route should be provided from Pier Head to the area at the rear 
of the West Demi Bastion. New public open space could also be provided to 
the east of the North Bastion and the quality of the  landscaping at the 
Parade Ground should be appropriately enhanced. High quality  hard 
landscaping with suitable limited new planting is encouraged at both th ese 
areas of public open space.  
Archaeology (Point 5  of Policy SS5) 
3.7.11  Further investigations will need to be conducted in order to understand the 
archaeology and historical development of the site including a landscape 
assessment. Development proposals will need to include some form of 
interpretation of the history of Fort Blockhouse and the other Hasl ar sites.  
Flood Risk (Point 6 of Policy SS5)  
3.7.12  Flood risk is a key consideration for development proposals at Fort 
Blockhouse. A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) will be required demonstrating 
that the development is safe from all sources flooding without increas ing 
flood risk elsewhere and where possible will reduce flood risk overall. Any 
site specific FRA will need to accord with the flood risk matters identified in 
Policies D3 and D7. I n the case of Fort Blockhouse, a site -specific FRA(s) 
should also address t he following matters:  
 
 Safe entry and exit to and from the site should a severe flooding 
event occur;  
 All development proposals should address the condition of the 
existing Haslar  Sea Wall defences and the risks of defence failure 
and potential overtoppin g of sea defences; and  
 Ensure appropriate flood risk management measures are in place 
including defence infrastructure at Haslar Sea Wall. The 
consideration and design of such measure must take into account the 
long term effects of climate change including  sea level rise and 
surface water flooding.  
 
3.7.13  The Council has prepared an interim Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
(SFRA). This document provides further detail relating to particular flood risk 
issues from all sources of flooding for this site and also sets  out the 
Council’s approach for how flood risk should be managed, as part of an 
agreed approach to flood risk management and mitigation in this location.  
The interim SFRA should be taken into consideration as a starting point in 
preparing any site -specifi c FRA(s) and further discussions with the Council 
regarding flood risk management and mitigation measures.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
182 3.7.14  It is recognised that understanding the condition and longevity of the Haslar 
Sea Wall and its current and long -term maintenance is a key considerat ion; 
that is likely to have a significant impact on both the deliverability and 
viability of this site. Detailed discussions with the Council (including the 
Coastal Partners) and the Environment Agency will be required as part of 
the planning application p rocess.  
 
3.7.15  The long term maintenance of any identified flood risk management 
measures over the lifetime of the proposed development will be secured 
through a S106 planning obligation (or equivalent).DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

184 3.8 POLICY SS6: ROYAL HA SLAR HOSPITAL  
Introduction  
3.8.1  The Royal Hospital Haslar closed as a military hospital in 2007 and the NHS 
ceased operating from the site in July 2009. A planning application for a 
comprehensive mixed -use development was approved in 2014.  This o utline 
consent (Ref: 12/00591/OUT) comprises the demolition and part demolition 
of a Listed Building and buildings within a Conservation Area and 
conversion of existing buildings and erection of new buildings to com prise:  
 
 286 residential units (Class C3 use) ; 
 Continuing Care Retirement Community of 60 -bed Care Home, 
communal facilities and 244 self -contained retirement units (Class C2 
use); 
 Offices and Business Units (Class B1 use);  
 Health Centre (Class D1 use);  
 Hotel (Class C1 use);  
 Tearooms/Restaurant/Bar (Class A3/A4 use) ; 
 Convenience Store (Class A1 use); and  
 Church, Public Hall and  Heritage Centre (Class D1 use).  
 
3.8.2  However , notwithstanding this, given the length the development has taken 
to complete various phases and with various elements subject to proposed 
change it is important to retain a policy framework for the site and where 
necessary review certain criteria.  
 
POLICY SS6: ROYAL  HASLAR HOSPITAL  
 
1. Land at Haslar Hospital, as shown on the Policies Map, is  allocated 
for the fo llowing mixed -use development:  
 
a) Either:  
i. Up to 300 residential dwellings (Class C3 use) and a 
hotel (Class C1); or 
ii. Up to 360 residential dwellings (Class C3 use) . 
 
b) Up to 305 residential care units (Class C2 use);  
c) Medical, health and ca re facilities including residential care 
will be the prime uses on this site including the re -use of 
existing facilities and buildings;  
d) Other employment uses will be encouraged including the re -
use of buildings for small offices and workshops;  
e) Appropriate leisure and tourism uses;  
f) Small -scale retail facilities and services to serve the site and 
the local community . 
 
 
 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
185 2. Development proposals should address the following design and 
habitat objectives:  
 
a) The Listed Buildings and the Historic Park and Garden are  
conserved and where appropriate enhanced;  
b) That public access to the Historic Park and Garden and the 
Solent frontage is secured; and  
c) The on -site Haslar Hospital Site of Importance to Nature 
Conservation (SINC) is  appropriately protected and 
opportunities taken to enhance it . 
 
3. Development proposals should be served by a sufficient level of 
infrastructure including a connection to the sewerage system at an 
appropr iate point of adequate capacity.  
 
4. Flood risk from all  sources of flooding must be fully taken into 
account for development proposals at Royal Haslar Hospital 
through site -specific FRA(s).  New development will be safely 
managed through the application of appropriate flood risk 
mitigation measures.  
 
EXPLANATI ON OF POLICY SS6  
Mixed -use Regeneration (Point 1 of Policy SS6)  
 
3.8.3  Reflecting the existing consent which is being implemented, albeit slowly, it 
is envisaged that that the facilities of the site will largely be used for medical, 
health and care, and resident ial purposes. Due to the large amount of 
floorspace at Royal Hospital Haslar there are a range of other uses that 
could be accommodated on the site which are compatible with these health -
related and residential uses. It will also be important to create as many jobs 
as possible to replace the employees that worked  on the site and help 
address the current residential/employment imbalance in the Borough.  
 
3.8.4  Reflecting the existing consent, r esidential use may also represent the best 
use of particular historic b uildings. It is considered that around 300  dwellings 
(Use Class C3) could be accommodate d on the site in addition to the 
consented hotel. However, if the hotel was found not to be a viable 
proposition, it is considered that an additional 60 residential dwe llings , up to 
an overall total of 360 Class C3 residential dwellings , could be  provided 
instead of the hotel.  
 
3.8.5  The site is also suitable for a range of medical and health uses including 
public medical and health facilities, private healthcare and specialist 
practices. The site could also include preventative treatment and facilities 
such as a health club/spa uses and a gym. The site is suited to care 
facilities including opportunities for a veteran ’s care facility with all the 
relevant associated f acilities and/or a Continuing Care Retirement 
Community (CCRC) as well as extra -care facilities. The site has the DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
186 potential to play an important role in meeting the demands of an increasingly 
ageing population.  
 
3.8.6  There are also opportunities for other types of employment including office 
and workshop type uses, (particularly in the north -west part of the site) 
including those linked to medical uses, but also those linked with other 
important business clusters in th e Borough as well as knowledge based 
industries. It is estimated the site could accommodate approximately 1,200 
sq.m.  of employment floorspace (B1 uses).  
 
3.8.7  It is considered that buildings close to the existing main entrance of the site 
could include communi ty facilities and a convenience store to serve the site 
and the immediate local community. This would represent a new public 
gateway to the site.  
 
3.8.8  It is anticipated that a limited retail need will arise as part of any 
development to meet the requirements o f new residents. The floorspace of 
such provision should be restricted and serve the immediate 
residential/employment catchment for everyday and small -scale  shopping 
needs, as suggested by the Borough Council’s latest evidence. Small -scale  
in this instance  is considered to be approximately 300 sq.m.  (net) of 
convenience floorspace. Depending on the nature of the rest of the 
development a small amount of specialist shops/services may also be 
appropriate on the site for example relating to health uses. Simila rly food 
and drink uses are likely to be appropriate to serve the uses of the site 
including visitors to the Historic Park and promenade. Any retail proposals 
will need to accord with the policy tests set out in the National Planning 
Policy Framework and L ocal Plan retail policies.  
 
3.8.9  Notwithstanding the potential for additional housing in lieu of the existing 
hotel consent, the  site is considered suitable for hotel/conferencing uses 
which can utilise the assets of the site (historic grounds and buildings and  
the Solent views), and has potential synergies with the health and care 
facilities on the site. A hotel will bring visitors to the site and the town as a 
whole making for a more viable development. It is considered that the site is 
sufficiently close to t he town centre and bus/ferry interchange to be 
accessible by modes other than the private car. If further hotel facilities were 
proposed then it would be necessary for the proposal to accord with the 
relevant tests (sequential and impact) as outlined in th e NPPF.  
Design Objectives (Point 2 of Policy SS6)  
3.8.10  Haslar Hospital was the first purpose -built naval hospital in England. The 
hospital site, which overlooks the Solent, is approximately 23 hectares and 
has been designated as a Grade II Registered Park on Hi storic England’s 
Register of Parks & Gardens of Special Historic Interest. The hospital site 
includes a number of listed buildings and other important historic buildings. 
The site also includes significant areas used for burial. The key 
characteristic of t he Hospital site is the formality of the layout and the form 
of the buildings and grounds with the subservient scale of buildings to the DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
187 main hospital. More details can be found in the Conservation Area 
Appraisal113. 
 
3.8.11  As Haslar Hospital is a Registered Park & Garden, particular regard will be 
given to protecting the unique historic landscape in development proposals. 
Where proposals are made for restoration of the park and garden it will be 
necessary for the applicant to show that the work proposed would not 
detract from the character and significance of the landscape and where 
appropriate opportunities a re taken to enhance the assets.  
 
3.8.12  Due to the presence of the historic park and garden there is limited scope 
for new buildings within the site but where opport unities do exist planning 
applications should be accompanied with the relevant supporting material 
demonstrating how the proposal respects the historic features and setting of 
the hospital site. It will be necessary to ensure that associated parking and 
bin/cycle storage do not detract from the character, setting and appearance 
of the listed buildings and the h istoric park. 
 
3.8.13  It is acknowledged that the site does contain some later twentieth century 
buildings which have had no regard to the historic setting and in such cases 
demolition may be appropriate. The site also includes significant burial 
areas which need to be protected.  
 
3.8.14  Another important objective for the redevelopment of the site is to 
encourage public use of the historic grounds. The Borough Cou ncil will also 
require that public access to the Solent frontage is secured and retained 
with links to the historic park.  
 
3.8.15  Pre-development, when the Royal Haslar Hospital was fully active, the 
Haslar Hospital  Site of Importance to Nature Conservation ( SINC ) 
functioned as part of the open green space within the site, fitting within the 
historic parkland that covers much of the centre of the site. As such, it was 
subject to a management regime that favoured the establishment and 
proliferation of the floral sp ecies for which it is designated, especially the 
Autumn Ladies -tresses’ Orchids.  Further additional development proposals 
will therefore need to demonstrate that the SINC is protected during both the 
construction and occupation periods in line with Policy LE5 (Locally 
Designated Nature Conservation Sites ). 
Infrastructure Objective (Point 3 of Policy SS6)  
3.8.16  Historically, the local service provider has identified that there is insufficient 
capacity in the local  sewerage system to meet the anticipa ted demand from 
the development then proposed at Royal Hospital Haslar. This issue was 
addressed through suitable conditions attached to the existing outline 
consent on the site. Further additional development proposals will also 
therefore need to demonstr ate that the site has sufficient sewerage capacity 
in line with Policy LE13 criterion 3.  
 
                                            
113 www.gosport.gov.uk/conservation -area-appraisals   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
188 3.8.17  In addition it is also necessary to protect existing o n-site infrastructure 
including underground sewers and water mains present o n the site. This 
infrastructure must  be allowed to continue to fulfil its function and must n ot 
be damaged or built over . 
Flood Risk (Point 4 of Policy SS6)  
3.8.18  Flood risk is a key consideration for development proposals at Royal Haslar 
Hospital. A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) will be required de monstrating 
that the development is safe from all sources of flooding without increasing 
flood risk elsewhere and where possible will reduce flood risk overall. Any 
site-specific FRA will need to accord with the flood risk matters identified in 
Policies D3  and D7. In the case of development proposals at Royal Haslar 
Hospital, a site -specific FRA(s) should also address the following matters:  
 
 Safe entry and exit to and from the site should a severe flooding 
event occur;  
 All development proposals should addr ess the condition of the 
existing Haslar  Sea Wall defences and the risks of defence failure 
and potential overtopping of sea defences; and  
 Ensure appropriate flood risk management measures are in place 
including defence infrastructure at Haslar Sea Wall. The 
consideration and design of such measure must take into account the 
long term effects of climate change including sea level rise and 
surface water flooding.  
 
3.8.19  The Council has prepared an interim Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
(SFRA). This document prov ides further detail relating to particular flood risk 
issues from all sources of flooding for this site and also sets out the 
Council’s approach for how flood risk should be managed, as part of an 
agreed approach to flood risk management and mitigation in this location.  
The interim SFRA should be taken into consideration as a starting point in 
preparing any site -specific FRA(s) and further discussions with the Council 
regarding flood risk management and mitigation measures.  
 
3.8.20  It is recognised that understan ding the condition and longevity of the Haslar 
Sea Wall and its current and long -term maintenance is a key consideration; 
that is likely to have a significant impact on both the deliverability and 
viability of this site. Detailed discussions with the Counc il (including the 
Coastal Partners) and the Environment Agency will be required.  
 
3.8.21  The long term maintenance of any identified flood risk management 
measures over the lifetime of the proposed development will be secured 
through a S106 planni ng obligation ( or equivalent).

189 3.9 POLICY SS7: HASLAR B ARRACKS  
Introduction  
3.9.1  Haslar Barracks is designated as a Conservation Area114. Haslar Barracks is 
a site of national historic significance due to its rarity by type, and its 
strategic role in the defence of the wider military establishments in the 
Gosport and Portsmouth area. It appears to be the only significant 
regimental infantr y barracks’ complex that survives in England relating to the 
threat of invasion in the years leading up to the Battle of Trafalgar (1805): a 
crucial and nationally significant period, making the site of particular historic 
value. Many of the original build ings appear to survive on site.  
 
3.9.2  In 1864 the site was converted and possibly partly re -developed as an army 
hospital, following major reforms to the design of military hospitals after the 
Crimean War . Around 1892 the site became the home of the Royal 
Engineers who have a long and close association with the extensive 
nationally important military defences in the area. In the early 1950s the site 
was occupied by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. At some point after the 
1950s it became a Youth Offenders’ Cen tre, before its final use as an 
Immigration Holding Centre which closed in 2017.  
 
POLICY SS7: HASLAR B ARRACKS  
 
1. Haslar Barracks is allocated for heritage -led, mixed -use 
regeneration. The Council will positively consider the re -use of 
Haslar Barracks herita ge assets for residential dwellings and 
viable commercial use or sui generis uses where it is clearly 
demonstrated that the significance of heritage assets is 
sustained and enhanced and is consistent with their long -term 
conservation. Planning permission  will be granted providing th is 
and th e following crite ria are met:  
 
a) Approximately 225 residential dwellings (either Class C2 
and/or C3) in a suitable mix of tenures and sizes;  
b) Residential typologies which address, through their design, 
current and forecasted flood risk from all sources;  
c) Provision of safe vehicular and pedestrian access and egress 
from the site taking flood risk into account  
d) Publicly accessible pedestrian and cycle routes between For t 
Road and the Solent shoreline ;  
e) Removal of all s ecurity infrastructure associated with the 
former use of the site to improve local visual amenity; and  
f) Proposals will need to accord with the NPPF and Policy DE5 
relating to protecting the integrity of internationally important 
habitat  including s uitable mitigation to address the protected 
Brent geese.

190 2. Ancillary small -scale commercial uses will also be considered 
appropriate at the Haslar Barracks site.  
3. Development proposals could in lieu of on -site open space 
provision provide a commuted sum towards the improvement of 
the adjacent Fort Road site into a new public park.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS7  
Development  principles (Point 1  of Policy SS7 ) 
3.9.3  Haslar Barracks is an opportunity to provide up to 225 residential dwellings 
utilising various tenures and typologies. The historic barrack buildings have 
capacity to be re -used for residential dwellings and some limited commercial 
uses. The Council’s preference is that the barracks are used for sheltered or 
care accommodation for vulnerable or elderly people o r service 
personnel/veteran accommodation together with associated facilities. 
However, proposals involving standard market and affordable housing 
would also be acceptable in principle.  
 
3.9.4  The re -use of heritage assets at Haslar Barracks for residential use will be 
supported in principle subject to them being sustained and enhanced 
consistent with their long -term conservation and retention of their historic 
significance. To improve local visual amenity the redevelopment of Haslar 
Barracks should include the r emoval of all permanent modern boundary 
treatments associated with its most recent use.  
 
3.9.5  The playing fields in the western portion of the site are also considered 
appropriate for new housing. The Council’s preference here is for standard 
market and afforda ble housing. However, forms of sheltered or care 
accommodation for vulnerable or elderly people would also be appropriate 
as part of a wider mix of Class C2 and C3 housing.  
 
3.9.6  The site offers the potential to provide a new pedestrian and cycle route 
between Fort Road and the Solent shoreline path. This facility should be 
incorporated into site layouts to improve permeability and public access.  
 
3.9.7  Development proposals should address flood risk through suitable housing 
designs. Site promoters should engage early with the Environment Agency 
(EA) to understand what residential typologies need to include in their 
design in order to satisfactorily address flood risk. These designs may, for 
example, result in the ground floor of buildings being free from resident ial 
living accommodation on parts of the site.  
 
3.9.8  Proposals should meet the requirements of  the NPPF and Policy D5 given 
the site’s proximity to internationally important habitats.  As such, it will be 
necessary to undertake appropriate ecological studies of  the Haslar 
Barracks site and ensure that development does not have a detrimental 
impact on these protected species and any other features of ecological 
importance. This includes other habitats in the vicinity such as those areas DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
191 outside of designated site s known to be of importance for protected species 
(such as Brent geese and other wading birds).  
 
3.9.9  The existing sports field within the site has been identified as a ‘Primary 
Site’ in the latest Solent Waders and Brent Goose Strategy and therefore 
suitable m itigation will be required. Initial discussions between the 
landowner, the Council and Natural England have identified potential 
mitigation for the sports field including the need for the landowners  / 
developers to secure appropriate management of other su itable sites for 
Brent g eese in the vicinity in perpetuity.  Potential sites have been identified 
and are the subject of ongoing discussions.  
Other potential uses (Point 2  of Policy SS7 ) 
3.9.10  Small -scale commercial uses including Class E (a) , (b), (c) and E(g) 
(Business) will be acceptable in principle within this part of the site subject to 
proposals enhancing the setting of heritage assets. There may be scope for 
associated car e facilities with the residential use or indeed training and 
small workshop provision  associated with any veteran provision . 
Fort Road Open Space (Point 3 of Policy SS7 ) 
3.9.11  The allocation site is located adjacent to the Council owned Fort Road open 
space. The Council would be willing to enter into negotiations with site 
promoters to provide a  significant contribution towards improving this open 
space and its car park in lieu of providing open space within the allocation 
site in line with Policy LE1 criterion 3(a). The detail of what could be 
provided on the Fort Road site would be done in conj unction with further 
consultation with the local community but should include a dedicated cycle 
and pedestrian route as part of the Solent Way long distance footpath.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

Introduction  
3.10.1  The Piggeries is a currently undeveloped area at  the western end of the 
Haslar Peninsula. It has capacity for up to 60 dwellings and public open 
space which should primarily provide public acce ss to the Stoke Lake 
shoreline.  
 
POLICY S S8: THE PIGGERIES  
  
1. Land at the Piggeries is allocated for residential  develop ment to 
provide the following:  
 
a) Up to 60 residential dwellings (Class C3 use) in a suitable mix 
of tenures and sizes;  
b) Residential typologies which address through their design, 
current and forecasted flood risk from all relevant sources;   
c) Provision of safe vehicular and pedestrian access and egress 
from the site tak ing flood risk into account;  and  
d) Publicly accessible open space providing suitably landscaped 
access to the Stoke Lake shoreline from Clayhall Road . 
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS8  
3.10.2  Development proposa ls should be informed by a site -specific Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA) and demonstrate, through suitable designs, that the 
proposed dwellings would be resilient to both current and forecasted flood 
risk. These designs may result in the gro und floor of buildings being free 
from residential living accommodation. Proposals should also, in line with 
national planning guidance, provide a safe access and egress, taking 
account of all sources of flood risk.  
 
3.10.3  The site will need to include a new publically  accessible open space which 
would be informal  in ch aracter and incorporate  biodiversity enhancement s. 
The seating/viewing area adjacent  to Stoke Lake should be designed to 
preve nt access onto the shorelin e in order to protect over -wintering birds 
and should include  appropriate interpretation.  The open space should also 
include an appropriately sited play are a to serve the residents of the local 
neighbourhood .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

(Class  E9(g) and  B uses) with high -tech employment uses given 
priority.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS9  
3.11.1  This site includes a cluster  of high -technology, research and development, 
and specialist engineering marine businesses. The Borough Council 
requires that this site be retained for employment purposes with the focus 
remaining on its current strengths. There may be scope to provide li nkages

Haslar site. The site has been allocated on the Policies Map as an ‘Existing 
Employment site’ and will be protected as such.  
 
3.11.2  Proposals will need to conserve and enhance the sit e’s historic assets. The 
eastern part of the site is within the Haslar Conservation Area and the site 
includes the No.2 Cavitation Tunnel which is a Grade II Listed Building and 
two ship testing tanks which are locally listed buildings. The site is adjacen t

194 3.12 POLI CY SS10: ROWNER AND HMS  SULTAN  
Introduction  
3.12.1  The regeneration of the residual part of the Rowner estate  is a long -term 
project that would likely extend into the next plan period. As such, the 
change in the number of residential dwellings is n ot currently known. HMS 
Sultan is located opposite the Rowner estate  and is currently scheduled fo r 
release from MoD use in 2029.  
 
3.12.2  These two distinct sites are considered together in the Local Plan given both 
their geographical proximity, the long -term nature of their potential 
regeneration and the opportunities for taking a more integrated approach to 
create new healthier communities on both sites.  
 
POLICY SS10 : ROWNER AND HMS  SULTAN  
 
1. Land at Rowner, as shown on the Policies Map, will continue to be 
regenerated throughout the plan period to create a range of high 
quality  replacement new homes, open spaces, pedestrian and 
cycle routes and accessible community facilities. The further 
redevelopment of Rowner should be in accordance with a 
Strategic Masterpl an to be agreed between the Local Planning 
Authority, site promoters and the local community. The Strategic 
Masterplan should be co -designed with the residents of Rowner 
and subject to comprehensive local consultation.  
 
2. A Strategic Masterplan for Rowner sh ould positively address the 
following:  
 
a) Significant enhancement of the quality of the local 
environment through high quality  urban design and 
landscaping;  
b) Provision of sustainable housing with a suitable mix of sizes, 
typologies and tenures;  
c) Mitigation of  any impacts on the Strategic Road Network or 
other parts of the highway network;  
d) Creation of legible pedestrian and cycle linkages to and from 
neighbouring places including the Alver Valley;  
e) Improvements to public transport and other suitable 
measures to reduce car use;  
f) Appropriate mitigation to address flood risk;  
g) Enhancement of biodiversity through new green infrastructure 
and improvements to the built environment; and  
h) Development to be served by necessary infrastructure 
improvements.  
 
3. Land at HMS Sult an, as shown on the Policies Map, is scheduled 
to be released by the Ministry of Defence for redevelopment in 
2029 at the earliest. The following proposals will be considered at DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
195 the site:  
 
a) Proposals to encourage the intensification of employment 
uses will be permitted provided it accords with other Local 
Plan policies;  
b) Proposals to re -use Fort Rowner  for residential and 
commercial uses will be permitted provided:  
 
i. Heritage assets are protected and enhanced;  
ii. Safe access and egress can be demonstrated; and  
iii. Sufficient vehicular parking to meet the Council’s 
Adopted Parking Standards . 
 
c) If HMS Sultan is released, either wholly or partially, priority 
will be sought for employment and complementary 
commercial or community uses (as shown on the Policies 
Map as an Employment Priority Site) which help to deliver the 
Local Plan’s objectives in accordance with a planned and 
coordinated programme of land release to be set out in a 
Supplementary Planning Document.    
 
4. Development proposals with 200 residential dwellings o r more 
should provide a Project Level Habitats Regulation Assessment 
(HRA) in line with Policy D5 ( The Local Ecological Network and 
Internationally and Nationally Important Sites).  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS10  
Overall approach (Point 1  of Policy SS10 ) 
3.12.3  Rowner is an established residential estate built in the 1960s for the Ministry 
of Defence (MoD). The site is located between the Alver Valley to the west 
and south, HMS Sultan to the east and other established residential areas to 
the north. Having been s old by the MoD in the 1980s , Rowner now has a 
fragmented land ownership including private housing  and housing 
association stock.  
 
3.12.4  Rowner has had a history of significant economic, social and environmental 
problems. However, whil e the area still retains these issues to an extent it 
has seen in the past 12 years a significant amount of regeneration with new 
community facilities, retail units and approximately 700 new dwellings, a net 
gain of 200 units, to replace existing degraded h ousing stock.  This area is 
now known as Alver Village.  
 
3.12.5  There are still some sizeable outstanding areas where the quality and 
condition of buildings could be significantly improved as well as the 
opportunity to improve the layout of the development. It is considered that 
there is the potential for a second phase of regeneration to be undertaken 
during the plan period. This would be subject to central Government and 
private funding and the  need to organise a consortium in a similar way as DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
196 ‘the quintet ’ was i nvolved with the original scheme. Such a consortium 
would need to include a government agency, landowners, private 
housebuilders and/or social landlords.   
 
3.12.6  As part of any regeneration project local community consultation will be 
given the highest priority from the outset.  
 
3.12.7  This phase will be focused on providing sustainable new housing to replace 
degraded stock which could be in the  control of housing associations , the 
Council and/or private developers . The redevelopment of housing should 
provide a suitable  mix of new dwellings in terms of typologies, numbers of 
bedrooms and tenures. New dwellings should be provided with suitable 
vehicular parking in line with the Council’s adopted standards. All new 
homes should be provided with suitable storage and private  or semi -private 
amenity space.  
 
3.12.8  The regeneration will also be focused on significant environmental 
improvements to Rowner’s townscape and open spaces. This could likely 
include new landscaping to provide better amenity areas, new play areas for 
different  age groups and an improved network of pedestrian and cycle 
routes focused on improved legibility and creating safer environments. 
Existing routes providing off -road access into adjacent areas such as the 
Alver Valley should be improved and, where feasible , suitable new routes 
created.  
 
3.12.9  The boundary of the proposed Rowner Strategic Dev elopment Site is set out 
below ( Plan 17). The overall area of the site is significantl y reduced from 
that set out in the Adopted  Local Plan (October 2015) ( Regeneration Area 4 : 
Rowner and Plan 7 ) by taking account of the recent new house building and 
the Council’s view that the housing stock along St Nicholas Avenue and 
areas north are not in need of significant regeneration in the plan period. 
However, the existing neighbourhood centre, Alver Vi llage, and the adjacent 
Alver Valley schools are included within the boundary of SS 10 in order to 
consider linkages between redeveloped area and these key facilities .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
197 PLAN  17: Rowner and HMS Sultan  
  
DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
198 Masterplan considerations  (Poin t 2 of Policy SS10 )  
3.12.10  Many of the problems associated with the Rowner estate  have resulted from 
poor design and layout. It is therefore essential that any future 
redevelopment is designed to a high quality  and enhances the local 
environment to the benefit o f all local residents.  
 
3.12.11  Currently there is a significant amount of open spaces within the wider 
Rowner regeneration area. The se provide local areas of play and informal 
recreation for local residents, particularly young people. However, much of it 
is of r elatively low quality a nd value and as such as part of any 
comprehensive regeneration of the area the Council would expect 
significant enhancement to the value and quality of accessible open space. 
For example it may be necessary to reduce the number of existing small 
open space s with limited value and improved provision focused in existing 
larger areas of open space.  
 
3.12.12  New housing to be provided in the future regeneration of the Rowner estate  
should be a sustainable mix of different types (houses and flats), tenures 
(affordable and market housing)  and sizes (number of bedrooms).  
 
3.12.13  It will be necessary to ensure that any development within the Rowner 
Regeneration Area mitigates any adverse impact on the strategic road 
network (SRN) or the rest of the highway network. As such, appropriate 
proposals will normally require a transport assessment to demonstrate 
whether there are any impacts and how these will be mitigated.  
 
3.12.14  New designs for Rowner must result in a significant improvement to the 
legibility of the estate. Legibility in  urban development means that spaces 
should be coherent and easily identifiable. Residents and visitors alike 
should be able to easily orientate themselves when moving through the 
estate through the use of clear routes and landmark buildings that can be 
easily identified.  
 
3.12.15  A Travel Plan will be required to set out measures to help reduce car trips 
and encourage alternative modes of travel. When considering new 
proposals it will be important to ensure that linkages are improved to 
neighbouring areas and imp ortant facilities in the vicinity. This could include 
measures to improve cycle links to the existing cycle network including links 
to the new Gosport Leisure Park, Stokes Bay and the Alver Valley Country 
Park with further links to Daedalus . 
 
3.12.16  Although none  of the Rowner  Regeneration Area is currently within Flood 
Zones 2 or 3 prospective developers are advised to contact the Environment 
Agency to determine if there are any issues that may affect the site. Surface 
water management is likely to be the key iss ue and an appropriate SuDS 
scheme will be  required.  
 
3.12.17  The regeneration area is adjacent to the Wildgrounds Site of Scientific 
Interest (SSSI) so it is imperative that any future development does not DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
199 affect the integrity of the site. Future redevelopment sch emes should seek 
to protect and enhance the biodiversity within the  estate and in adjoining 
areas.  
 
3.12.18  Key infrastructure requirements include:  
 
 Improved pedestrian and cycling links with neighbouring areas 
including the Alver Valley ; 
 Open space to serve the needs of the development . 
Overall approach to the HMS Sultan Site (Point 3  of Policy SS10 ) 
3.12.19  HMS Sultan is a centre of excellence for engineering training for the  military.  
It is one of the largest employers in the Borough employing almost 2,600 
people, inc luding approximately 1,350 trainees, 450 service personnel and 
800 civilians.  It currently accommodates the Royal Naval School of Marine 
Engineering and the Royal Naval Air Engineering and Survival School. The 
site also provides opportunities for engineer ing training for a number of 
private sector companies. The training packages offered at this facility 
matches the specific skills sectors in which Gosport excels.  
 
3.12.20  The Borough Council strongly supports the retention of this important 
function at Sultan and will encourage opportunities to expand its role. The 
Borough Council with support from the Solent Local Enterprise Partnership 
and Hampshire County Council will continue to explore opportunities with 
the Ministry of Defence to intensify civilian employ ment and training 
opportunities to fully utilise the potential of this site. Sultan therefore relates 
well to the Borough’s existing strengths in advanced manufacturing and 
aerospace clusters.  
 
3.12.21  The Government  announced  in February 2019  that HMS Sultan wil l be 
released for development no earlier than 2029. If the site is released for 
redevelopment within the latter part of the plan period the Council will 
prioritise commercial (Class E(g), B2 and B8 uses) or community uses 
(Class  E(e), E(f), F1, F2) to assi st the diversification and renewal of the local 
economy. Much of the western  HMS Sultan site has been identified as an 
employment priority site in order to ensure that if the site is released by the 
MoD it retains its role as a major employment site in the  Borough . A 
coordinated programme of land release, to be set out in a Supp lementary 
Planning Document (SPD), will be produced to deliver the site or those parts 
of the site surplus to defence operational requirements  
 
3.12.22  The Council and Historic England have been exploring opportunities with 
the Base to re -use Fort Rowner within the site for hi -tech employment to 
restore this historic building.  
 
3.12.23  Although none of the HMS Sultan a rea is currently within Flood Zones 2 or 3 
prospective developers are advised to contact the Environment Agency to 
determine if there are any issues that may affect the site. Surface water DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
200 management is likely to be the key issue and an appropriate SuDS sc heme 
will be required . 
Habitats Regulations Assessment(Point 4 of Policy SS10)  
3.12.24  The  Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Assessment 
Report (August 2021) recommends that residential development proposals 
in excess of 200 dwellings should undertak e a Project Level HRA  in line with 
Policy D5 (The Local Ecological Network and Internationally and Nationally 
Important Sites).  For reference, the number of additional dwellings that 
could be planned for at Rowner is  currently  unknown.

201 3.13 POLICY SS11 : DAEDALUS  
Introduction  
3.13.1  The Daedalus site is a former military base and lies to the north and north -
west of Lee -on-the-Solent. The site covers a total area of approximately 196 
hectares. The majority of the site, some 115.6 hectares, comprising the 
runways and associated buildings, lies within the Fareham Borough Council 
(FBC) administrative area. The remainder of the site, some 38 hectares, lies 
within the Borough of Gosport.  
 
3.13.2  Daedalus has broadly four parts to it: the airfield, Hangars West, Hangars 
East and the Daedalus Waterfront. The first three areas are predominantly 
within Fareham Borough whilst the Daedalus Waterfront and a small area at 
the southern end of Hangars East and the airfield are within Gosport 
Borough.  
 
3.13.3  The Daedalus Waterfront area h as a strong character and contains most of 
the built development on the site including a number of historic buildings, 
many of which are listed including the prominent Wardroom and Westcliffe 
House located close to the seafront.  
 
3.13.4  Part of Daedalus Waterfron t area has been designated as a conservation 
area and its proximity to Lee -on-the-Solent seafront adds to the site’s 
character with splendid views across the Solent. Between the historic area 
and the airfield are a number of large hangars and related build ings which 
are currently used by a range of employers on a short lease basis.  
 
3.13.5  The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) acquired Daedalus in 2006. It 
was subsequently transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency 
(HCA). The South East England Development  Agency (SEEDA) acquired 80 
hectares of land surrounding the airfield for the purposes of employment -led 
regeneration which also has subsequently been transferred to the HCA 
(now Homes England). In addition, part of the site was retained by the 
Ministry of  Defence (MoD) to develop staff quarters, of which a first phase 
was completed. The remaining part of this site was disposed of by the MoD 
in 2012 to the HCA.  
 
3.13.6  The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) successfully bid for the 
Daedalus site to become a n Enterprise Zone in August 2011. The focus at 
Daedalus was, and remains as such, is advanced manufacturing including 
aviation, aerospace and marine industries which are expected to create  up 
to 3,700 additional jobs by 2026.  
 
3.13.7  Outline planning permission ( planning application : 11/00282/OUT) with all 
matters reserved except access was granted in January 2016 for the 
following development:  
 
 Up to 69,992 sq.m.  of commercial floor space in new buildings and 
re-use of existing buildings (Class B1, B2 and B8 use);  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
202  Up to 1,075 sq.m.  of retail use (Class A1, A2, A3 and/or A4 use);  
 Up to 200 residential units (Class C3 use);

Daedalus Supplementary Planning Document  
 
3.13.9  The Daedalus Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) (September 2011) 
provides detailed guidance for development within the regeneration area. 
The SPD sets out a vision for Daedalus:  
 
 Daedalus will be transformed into a sustainable strategic business 
locatio n; 
 The site will provide significant new job opportunities, particularly 
within key business clusters including aviation, high -tech 
manufacturing and marine industries;  
 It will provide a significant number of highly skilled jobs contributing to 
Gosport’s a nd the Solent area economic growth and diversification;  
 The design and use of existing and new buildings and spaces will be 
of a high quality  to ensure the preservation and enhancement of the 
environment, the Daedalus Conservation Area and its listed 
build ings;  
 The prestigious development will be an identifiable place in its own 
right, well related to, and benefitting the wider community.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
203 3.13.10  The Daedalus SPD also provides guidance on the location of development 
of different types w ithin the regeneration area. In addition, it considers a 
number of character areas within the site. The vision in the SPD was 
reflected in Policy LP5 (Daedalus) in the Gosport Borough Local Plan (2011 -
2029) which set out strategic scale mixed -use developme nt.  
 
3.13.11  The new Local Plan offers an opportunity to reconsider what the residual 
parts of the Daedalus site could provide taking into account the planning 
consents granted since the adoption of the current Local Plan.  
 
POLICY SS11 : DAED ALUS 
 
1. The Daedalus Reg eneration Area (DRA) is the main focus for urban 
renewal, employment growth a nd housing in Lee -on-the-Solent 
during  the plan period to 2038. All regeneration proposals should 
protect and enhance Daedalus  heritage assets and waterfront 
townscape. The follow ing development is allocated at the DRA 
within th e three sites identified below:  
 
a) A heritage -led mixed -use scheme at Seaplane Square 
including a renewed Hovercraft Museum with new commercial 
and community uses (Site A);  
b) A heritage -led mixed -use scheme comprising commercial, 
community uses and approximately  300 Class C3 and/or C2 
residential dwellings (Site B);  
c) Employment and/or residential -led mixed -use at the triangular 
shaped site bounded by Hermes Road, Unicorn Road and 
Implacable Road  (Site C) ; and  
d) Approximately 35,000  sq.m.  (gross) employment floorspace 
(Site D).  
 
2. All development proposals within the DRA should address the 
followin g overarching policy criteria:  
 
a) Heritage assets and their settings are conserved and 
enhanced through appropriate and viable uses, and all 
possible opportunities to interpret their historic significance 
are taken;  
b) Appropriate design responses to the scale, layout and 
character of heritage assets with the aim of enhancing or 
better revealin g their significance;  
c) Use of an appropriate materials palette which reflects and 
enhances the local context;  
d) The provision of multifunctional  and connected public open 
spaces which form strategically important links to the 
surrounding areas, provide accessible routes for people and 
wildlife, suitable open spaces for recreation for all, and 
provide part of a wider flood risk and surface water dr ainage 
mitigation strategy;  
e) Delivery of safe pedestrian and cycle links in all development DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
204 sites and where feasible integration with local, regional and 
nationally important routes;  
f) Consideration of capacity of the road network and potential 
need for miti gation measures to improve road capacity;  
g) Provision of new public transport infrastructure and routes to 
assist modal shift away from private vehicles; and  
h) Measures to avoid and mitigate any adverse impacts on 
internationally important habitats. Proposals should preserve 
and where possible enhance biodiversity.  
 
3. Planning permission will not be given for incremental development 
that would unacceptably hamper or reduce the development 
options for any of the sites.  
 
4. Proposals should be accompanied with the necessary 
infrastructure, where appropriate, to serve the development and 
ensure it is acceptable in planning terms.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y SS11  
Site A: Seaplane Square  
 
3.13.12  The Daedalus Conservation Area Appraisal sets out that the group of World 
War One han gars adjacent to their original slipway are unique surviving 
structures  in the history of military aviation. This complex forms an imposing 
group set within a clearly defined square. Their importance to the site is 
accentuated by their survival from the fi rst phase of development of the 
base in Lee, and at a significant period in military aviation. The form of the 
landscape in this location is very precisely defined with the five hangars 
enclosing the open yard at the head of the slipway. This historic sett ing 
should be retained as a key part of the history of the site.  
 
3.13.13  The Daedalus SPD supports a leisure -led approach to Seaplane Square 
taking advantage of the close proximity to the seafront  with the site 
representing an attractive and vibrant public gateway to Daedalus . Suitable 
uses for the Seaplane Hangars may include a combination of leisure 
facilities including heritage uses, such as a museum, café/bar uses and 
other indoor and outdoor l eisure uses, as well as marine related 
employment. The Square itself could be considered as a flexible events 
space.  
 
3.13.14  The Council considers that given the historic significance of the site and its 
existing use as a Hovercraft Museum, the site would be better utilised a s a 
multi -use community /leisure  destination  centred on a new and significantly 
upgraded home for the hovercrafts  with some rationalisation of space . Given 
the potential impact on amenity of this existing use, it is considered that it 
would  not be realistic  nor appropriate  to include new residential units  at this 
location . The Council acknowledges however that the creation of a new DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
205 community facility centred on the hovercraft museum is a long -term project 
subject to viability and funding con straints.  
 
Site B: Historic Core  
 
3.13.15  The historic core comprises high quality  urban spaces including the 1930’s 
Barracks Square and the setting of the Headquarters Buildings and Officer’s 
Quarters as defined in the Daedalus Conservation Area Appraisal115. This 
includes the listed Dining Room and Cook House, Westcliffe House and the 
Wardroom.  
 
3.13.16  Many of the existing buildings are appropriate for conversion to commercial, 
residential use or other appropriate community facilities. However, 
irrespective of the propose d use, all development proposals should 
conserve and enhance both the buildings and their setting. The Council will 
be seeking a landscape -led approach to the setting of these listed buildings 
through the provision of sympathetically designed semi -private gardens, 
parking facilities and boundary treatments.  For example, the area within the 
historic boundary wall to Westcliffe House merits special attention to both 
retaining its open plan form but also exploring the possibility of restoring its 
historic char acter.  
 
3.13.17  The Council will take a flexible approach towards the tenure of residential 
development with both Class C3 housing and Class C2 sheltered 
accommodation both being appropriate for this site.  
 
3.13.18  The site includes, as set out in the Conservation Area Ap praisal, a number 
of buildings of historic or architectural interest. This includes Norbury House, 
Power House, the Type E Barrack Blocks, the Eagle Club and Eagle Block 
amongst others. The presumption is that all these non -designated heritage 
assets shoul d be retained and renovated for residential use. Any proposals 
which do seek to replace these buildings should have a suitable design of 
the highest possible standard which utilises an appropriate architectural 
vernacular and materials.  
 
3.13.19  There are also a number of more modern poor quality buildings including 
some temporary structures from the post -war period. The removal of these 
buildings comprises a significant opportunity for redevelopment with suitable 
new housing.  
 
3.13.20  The Barracks Square developed betwee n 1932 and 1935. These four blocks 
are built in a restrained and elegant classical style and form an important 
group with the Dining Rooms and Cookhouse from this high point in the 
development of the site. The Barrack Square is a very high quality  urban 
space which should be restored and enhanced in all development 
proposals. The Council will not accept any proposals in this area which fails 
to achieve this objective.  
 
                                            
115 www.gosport. gov.uk/conservation -area-appraisals   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
206 3.13.21  Certain buildings such as the Cookhouse and Dining Room may be 
appropriate for community and business units. In such instances 
consideration will need to be given to the amenity issues associated with the 
potential proximity of residential units around the square.  
 
3.13.22  The large area of hardstanding immediate south of Eagle Block is also 
considere d to be a significant development opportunity for new residential 
development. Proposals should provide a suitable transition in scale 
between Eagle Block and the two -storey dwellings on Richmond Road and 
Kings Road.  
 
Site C: Triangle Site  
 
3.13.23  This site inclu des the triangular shaped parcel of land bounded by Hermes 
Road, Unicorn Road and Implacable Road which currently benefits from 
Class B1 (Employment) consent from planning application:  11/00282/OUT. 
The Council would however consider new mixed -use proposal s on this site if 
it could be demonstrated that this would support the regeneration of 
Seaplane Square and provide a new high quality  urban development.  Any 
redevelopment of the site, irrespective of land use, should include a through 
pedestrian and cycle  route from Seaplane Square through to Hermes Road 
to provide overall site permeability and an enhanced sense of place. The 
Council do not wish to see the site as an enclave or gated residential 
community isolated from the rest of the Daedalus site.  
 
Site D: Employment Land  
 
3.13.24  The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) has clearly recognised the 
business opportunities at Daedalus through the designation of an Enterprise 
Zone. The LEP’s Strategic Economic Plan recognises Daedalus as a priority 
site an d it has also been identified by PfSH as a Strategic Employment Site. 
As such, it is considered to have a significant role in delivering the total net 
additional employment floor space required for the South Hampshire 
Strategy.  
 
3.13.25  The site is considered to b e integral to the regeneration of the Borough’s 
economy. It will create new job opportunities with the potential to increase 
skill levels, including jobs for those living in more deprived communities in 
the Borough. It represents a significant opportunity to enhance existing 
clusters of businesses that can utilise the Borough’s traditional strengths in 
marine, aviation, aerospace and advanced manufacturing sectors and this is 
reinforced by the priorities of the Enterprise Zone.  
 
3.13.26  There is also the potential  to diversify the local economy and develop new 
sectors, for example environmental technologies. The residual area of 
employment land at Daedalus could provide a variety of modern business 
premises and there is the potential to accommodate start -up and mov e-on 
type premises for local businesses.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
207 3.13.27  The latest estimates demonstrate that approximately 35,000  sq.m.  (gross) 
floorspace could be accommodated in the Gosport Borough part of the site. 
There should be flexibility regarding the type of employment floor space to 
be accommodated on the site but it is clear that the site should maximise 
the opportunities at Daedalus to create a dynamic and innovative 
employment area.  This figure includes 8,653  sq.m.  of consented floor space 
at the Swann and Dunning hangar.  
 
3.13.28  The residual employment land has a number of advantages that make it 
attractive to a variety of sectors including:  
 
 Access to the airfield with the potential to attract businesses within 
the aviation and aerospace sectors including both advanced 
manufacturing and service businesses;  
 The waterfront location with the potential to attract marine industries;  
 Its seafront location on the Solent makes it an attractive location that 
can be an important choice for certain types of businesses;  
 The large ar ea of land available which provides flexibility for a variety 
of building types to be accommodated; and  
 Proximity to the Centre for Engineering, Manufacturing, Advanced 
Skills and Training (CEMAST) . 
Explanation (Point 2 of Policy SS11)  
Heritage Assets and  Good Design  
 
3.13.29  The Daedalus Conservation Area was designated in November 1999 to 
ensure that all future development would preserve or enhance the historic 
and architectural character of the area. The area retains many buildings of 
historic interest spanning  the last 120 years, including some that are Grade 
II Listed  and therefore considered to be of national importance. The site is 
primarily associated with the development of naval seaplanes by the Royal 
Navy in the early twentieth century.  
 
3.13.30  The Conservatio n Area is made up of clearly defined groups of buildings, 
which form important focal points in the area. These focal points are linked 
by a well -defined grid pattern of roads, which mark logical and sustainable 
boundaries to the area. A central aspect of a ny designation is that 
boundaries protect not only the key building groups, but also their setting. 
This is best achieved by following what are largely the open vistas of the 
historic road network and the long established site boundary along the 
southern a nd eastern sides.  
 
3.13.31  Historic England advises that maximum advantages can be secured if any 
effects on the significance of a heritage asset arising from development 
likely to affect its setting are considered early116. Enhancing or better 
revealing the significance of heritage assets within Daedalus should always 
                                            
116 The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3 (Second 
Edition) Paragraphs 37 -40, Historic England, March 2015  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
208 be addressed in development proposals and may be achieved through 
positive planning which includes:  
 
 Removing an intrusive building or feature;  
 Replacement of  a detrimental feature by a new and more harmonious 
one; 
 Restoring or revealing a lost historic feature or view;  
 Introducing a wholly new feature that adds to the public appreciation 
of the heritage asset;  
 Introducing new views, including glimpses or bet ter framed view that 
add to the public experience of the asset; and  
 Improving public access to, or interpretation, of the heritage asset 
including its setting.  
 
3.13.32  The listed buildings within the site are characterised by high quality  
materials, for example, the stone and terracotta used on Westcliffe House. 
Development proposals should within Sites B and C (as set out in criterion 
1) should all use a high quality  materials palette sympathetic to the 
Conservation Area and its listed buildings.  
 
3.13.33  The Daedalus Conservation Area Appraisal sets out with regard to building 
materials that the hangars (Site A) should remain corrugated, although their 
colour could be modified if the historic evidence would support a different 
finish. Although these are very functional  buildings , modification of the 
internal space would be considered sympathetically to ensure their long -
term future. Similarly there may be scope to improve light into the buildings , 
either through skylights or improvements to the windows.  
 
Multifunctional  and connected public open spaces  
 
3.13.34  High quality , multifunctional  public spaces should be provided within 
Daedalus. As well as access, they can provide places for younger residents 
to play and to address flood risk mitigation and biodiversity through good 
design. New development at Daedalus should also take account of the local 
coastal microclimate when considering new spaces.  
 
3.13.35  Whilst the risk from tidal flooding at the Daedalus site is minimal (the site is 
in Flood Zone 1) a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) wil l be required given the 
size of the site and scale of development in order to address issues such as 
surface water run -off. The FRA would need to include a SuDS feasibility 
study to identify any constraints of using SuDS such as land contamination. 
Early e ngagement with the sewerage providers by site promoters is also 
recommended.  
 
Access  
 
3.13.36  It will be necessary to ensure that any development at Daedalus mitigates 
any adverse impact on the strategic road network (SRN) or the rest of the 
highway network. Conse quently appropriate proposals will normally require DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
209 a Transport Assessment (TA) to demonstrate whether there are any impacts 
and how these will be mitigated.  
 
3.13.37  In addition, a Travel Plan will be required to the satisfaction of the Local 
Highway Authority to  promote a range of sustainable modes of travel and 
thereby reduce the number and length of sole occupancy car journeys to 
and from the site. Further detail on the necessary improvements to the local 
road network, public transport infrastructure and servic es, and routes for 
pedestrians and cyclists is set out in the Daedalus SPD.  
 
3.13.38  Within the Site the focus should be on providing suitable pedestrian and 
cycle routes to link the employment areas, new housing and Seaplane 
Square with the Lee centre and the sea front.  
 
Nature Conservation  
 
3.13.39  The site is within 100 metres of the mudflats at Hill Head which form part of 
the Solent and Southampton Water Special Protection Area (SPA) and 
Ramsar site , which are of international importance for wading birds. It will be 
necessary to ensure that development does not have a detrimental impact 
on the features of the Eu ropean sites either alone or in -combination with 
other plans and projects. If there was such an impact the proposal would not 
be in accordance with the Habitats  Regulations and the Council’s planning 
policies and would be refused. Consequently it will be necessary to ensure 
proposals avoid and mitigate any impacts on internationally important 
habitats (or areas outside of the designated sites known to be of impor tance 
to the internationally important species).  
 
3.13.40  The Habitats Regulation Assessment for the current Local Plan recognises 
that development at Daedalus has the potential to have a detrimental impact 
on the internationally important habitats. A number of me asures should be 
considered as part of any development proposal including those highlighted 
in the HRA Report for the Adopted  Local Plan as well as those identified as 
part of the Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy produced by Bird Aware 
Solent. In addi tion it will be necessary for developers to consider Natural 
England’s guidance on achieving nutrient neutrality as detailed in Policy D5 
of the Local Plan. Further work is ongoing by the Borough Council regarding 
a revised HRA for this emerging Local Plan  which may have further 
recommendations.  
 
3.13.41  When considering the outline planning application for the site the two 
Borough Councils and Natural England have agreed in principle  to the 
creation of a significant informal recreational area within the north east  
corner of the Daedalus site (within Fareham Borough) , to provide a suitable 
alternative natural greenspace (often referred to as a SANG). It is intended 
that this area will deflect recreational pressure particularly from dog walking 
away from the sensitiv e sites at Hill Head by attracting at least the 
equivalent number of households created by the Daedalus development 
who would otherwise have visited the Hill Head site. In addition the 
recreational improvements within the Alver Valley as part of the Countr y DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
210 Park has become increasingly attractive to a larger number of dog walkers 
from the wider area.  
 
3.13.42  In order to minimise recreation disturbance, access towards Hill Head will 
require careful management and recreational access towards the south and 
the east o f the site should be promoted and maximised including the Lee -on 
the-Solent Clifflands and beach, and the Alver Valley.  
 
3.13.43  The Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Assessment Report 
(August 2021) recommends that residential development proposals i n 
excess of 200 dwellings should undertake a Project Level HRA in line with 
Policy D5. A project level HRA will therefore be required at the planning 
application stage for development outside the scope of the outline planning 
application . 
 
3.13.44  In addition , several European and nationally protected species have been 
recorded within Daedalus, including badgers, bats and birds (barn owl s and 
skylark s). Consequently the necessary ecological surveys and assessments 
will be required to protect these species. Futu re developments should also 
recognise the ecological potential of the site, including retaining important 
features on the site such as mature trees. Measures to enhance biodiversity 
should be incorporated into detailed development design at the planning 
application stage including the planting of indigenous species.  
Development Considerations (Points 3 and 4 of Policy SS11)  
3.13.45  The redevelopment of all of the remaining sites at Daedalus within the 
Borough of Gosport should be regenerated in a holistic manner ta king 
account of the Council’s objectives for the other sites. This is independent of 
land ownership and the Council will expect different site promoters to work 
together constructively particularly with regard to heritage assets, design, 
access and infrast ructure. Incremental development which fails to do this 
and which may hamper the overall redevelopment of the site wi ll not be 
permitted.  
 
3.13.46  The infrastructure requirements to serve the site such as transport (highway, 
public transport and cycle/pedestrian r outes) and utilities will need to be 
considered on a whole -site basis in both Gosport and Fareham. Further 
details of the infrastructure requirements are set out in the Council’s 
Daedalus SPD. Key requirements include:  
 
 Primary and secondary access points and associated internal road 
infrastructure ; 
 Off-site road improvements ; 
 Cycle network improvements ; 
 Utility infrastructure ; and  
 Public realm and open space . DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

212 4.0 OTHER  ALLOCATION SITES  
4.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
4.1.1  In addition to the  Strategic Development Sites (SS1 -SS11) identified in the 
Urban Regeneration Areas there are a number of other allocation sites 
which will also contribute towards the regeneration of the Borough by 
providing new housing, employment, leisure and open space. All the 
allocated sites are identified on the Policies Map and shown on Plan 19 
below.  
 
4.1.2  The following allocation policies are divided into different uses : 
 
 Policy A1: Enabling Allocations  
 Policy A2: Housing  
 Policy A 3: Employment  
 Policy A4 : Leisure, Community Use s and Open Space s 
 Policy A 5: Allotments  
 Policy A6: Safeguarded Land for Transport Improvements  
 
4.1.3  Each policy sets out the proposed uses for the site, the estimated quantum’s 
and other key site -specific development considerations which need to be 
addressed in addition to other policy requirements set out in the Local Plan . 
 
4.1.4  It should be noted that relevant policies are not listed for each site and that it 
is important for the Plan to be read as a whole. All Local Plan policies and 
national policy and guidance will be taken into account in determining 
planning  applications for the site allocations, along with other material 
considerations. The key planning issues that need to be considered in any 
development proposal include:  
 
 Climate change adaption and mitigation ; 
 Design and sustainable construction issues ; 
 Heritage ; 
 Flood risk ; 
 Nature conservation and biodiversity net gain ; 
 Environmental concerns including contaminated and unstable land, 
air quality, noise and light pollution ; 
 Amenity issues ; 
 Transport and accessibility ; 
 Infrastructure provision and services .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

and 
g) A suitably designed off -road access improvement that provides 
a cycle/pedestrian route from Fort Road through towards 
Lifeboat Lane . 
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y A1  
Context (Point 1 of Policy A1)  
4.2.1  The NPPF paragraph 80 sets out that planning policies and decisions 
should avoid the development of isolated homes in the countryside unless, 
inter alia, the development would represent the optimal viable use of a 
heritage asset or would be appropriate enabling development to secure the 
future of heritage assets. NPPF paragraph 20 8 sets out that l ocal planning 
authorities should assess whether the benefits of a proposal for enabling 
development, which would otherwise conflict with planning policies but 
which would secure the fu ture conservation of a heritage asset, outweigh 
the disbenefits of departing from those policies.  
 
4.2.2  Fort Gilkicker and the former Qinetiq site at Fort Road are both heritage 
assets located outside the Gosport urban area boundary that have capacity 
to provid e either residential dwellings or commercial uses to assist in their 
future conservation. The Council has included these sites in the Local Plan 
in line with NPPF paragraphs 80 and 20 8 as it is considers that the benefits 
of conserving these assets clearly  outweighs the impact of some limited new 
housing outside the urban area.  
 
4.2.3  The Council’s preference is for residential development on both sites. 
However, sympathetic commercial development would also be considered if 
it can be demonstrated that residentia l is not a viable option.  
 
4.2.4  The Borough will be consulting in 2021 on a draft Conservation Area 
Appraisal for Stokes Bay given that the area is considered to have sufficient 
architectural and historic interest to be considered for this designation. This 
draft policy supports the proposed designation.  
 
Fort Gilkicker  
 
4.2.5  Fort Gilkicker, a Palmerston Fort, is a Grade II* listed Scheduled Ancient 
Monument located at the apex of Stokes Bay overlooking the Solent.  Fort 
Gilkicker is an especially important being pro bably the finest example of a 
Palmerston Fort. The majority built in the Portsmouth area were never 
armed and were subsequently altered with the loss of original features.  
 
4.2.6  Fort Gilkicker has had two prior residential planning applications. Consent 
was gra nted (application reference 9316/5) in 2001 permitting restoration DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
216 and conversion to 17 dwellings with car parking, Museum with public 
access, new road junction and access road and improvement including new 
revetment and earth mounding. This consent was no t implemented. A 
second consent was granted in 2010 (application reference 08/00423/Full) 
for the restoration of the fort and conversion to 26 dwellings, residents 
stores and interpretation room. This consent has subsequently been 
extended twice and implem entation has commenced.  
 
4.2.7  Notwithstanding this, given this planning history, the Local Plan allocates 
Fort Gilkicker in the event that extent applications are not implemented.  
 
Former Qinetiq Site , Fort Road  
 
4.2.8  The former Qinteiq site has been vacant since 2 012 and c omprises 
approximately 3,500 sq. m. of existing buildings in a central portion of the 
site which includes a Scheduled Monument. It is this portion alone that is 
allocated for enabling development. A sensitive residential development 
which respects its prominent location overlooking Stokes Bay has the 
potential to improve the locality by removing redundant unattractive  former 
research buildings on the site and enable the  setting of the historic f eatures 
to be enhanced.   The inclusion of a public rout e to the south of the site will 
allow improved public views of the area and will improve connectivity and 
safety for pedestrians and cyclists.  
Local Environment (Point 2 of Policy A1)  
4.2.9  The Stokes Bay area is one of the most important areas for biodiversity in 
Gosport Borough and the wider Solent, supporting a number of important 
habitats and species. Of particular concern is the nearby Gilkicker Lagoons 
Site of Special Scientific Interes t (SSSI), which is also included within the 
Solent & Isle of Wight Lagoons Special Area of Conservation (SAC). These 
are habitats of national and international importance and it must be 
demonstrated that the on -site proposals would not result in impacts to  these 
highly sensitive habitats. Proposals should also provide nitrate mitigation in 
line with Policy D5.  
Site specific criteria (Points 3 and 4 of Policy A1)  
4.2.10  The site specific considerations for development on these sites will need to 
be read in conjunc tion with other Local Plan Policies, the Design 
Supplementary Planning Document and the Parking Supplementary 
Planning Document.  
 
4.2.11  The outer portion of the Qinetiq Fort road site is open space and will remain 
as such and is included within the Gosport Strat egic Open Space (see 
Policy D6). Enabling development within the site should facilitate public 
access to this area and include a suitably designed off -road access 
improvement that provides a cycle/pedestrian route from Fort Road through 
towards Lifeboat La ne as set out in Policy D6 Point 5a.

EXPLANATION OF POLICY A 2 
4.3.1  Policy A 2 includes those deliverable sites, as identified in the Gosport 
Borough Council Strategic Housing Land Available Assessment (SHLAA) 
(2021), outside of the regeneration areas for new housing development. 
Each site has potential to deliver a net increase of at least five dwellings  and 
the approximate number of dwellings is included in brackets . 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
219 4.3.2  Sites which involve the loss of existing open space are required to provide a 
contribution to improve the quality of an existing open space in the vicinity of 
the site.  
 
4.3.3  The considerations for development on these sites will need to be read in 
conjunction  with other Local Plan Policies. For example the Anglesey Lodge 
site is a listed building  in a c onservation area and considerations regarding 
heritage assets will be important in this instance.  
 
4.3.4  Details of each of the housing allocation sites, strategic and non -strategic, 
are set out in Appendix 1 of the Local Plan with a supporting Site Plan.  The 
appendices provide  additional issues relating to each site which a developer 
will need to address in any development proposal.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
220 4.4 POLICY A3 : EMPLOYMENT  
 
POLICY A3:  EMPLOYMENT  
 
In order to assist the delivery of new employment land the following 
sites outside the Regeneration Areas, as shown on the Policies Map, 
are allocated for employment development:  
 
1. Land at Aerodrome Road  
 
Development should be for employment uses (E(g), B2, B8) . 
Proposals will need to:  
 
a) ensure buildings and the use of land accord with the 
requirements of the Defence Munitions Safeguarding Area (see 
Policy LE12); and  
b) protect and enhance biodiversity features in accordance with 
other Local Plan Policies.  
 
2.  Land adjacent the Huhtam aki site off Rowner Roa d 
 
Development should be for employment uses (E(g), B2, B8).  
Proposals will need to:  
 
a) Retain a tree buffer adjacent Fareham Road ; and  
b) Mitigate for the loss of existing open space by providing land 
south of the Hu htamaki Grange Road site as identified on the 
Policies Map  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y A3 
4.4.1  The Borough Council has identified 90,000 sq.m . of net additional 
employment floorspace over the p lan period. A significant proportion of this 
floorspace is identified within th e regeneration areas as well as the potential 
of further expansion within exist ing industrial areas . Policy A 3 sets out the 
other employment allocation sites, outside the regeneration areas and 
existing employment sites , with potential to deliver new employment 
floorspace.  
Land at Aerodrome Road  
4.4.2  The site of 0.32 ha could provide a small extension to the business parks in 
the vicinity of an estimated 1,000 sq.m. of employment floorspace. It will be 
necessary to have regard to the requirements of the Defence Munitions 
Safeguarding requirements (Policy LE12) and consequently early 
discussions with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation will be required.  
 
4.4.3  Further consideration will also be required to the ecological importance of 
the site. Whilst the site has not been designated as an internationally, DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
221 nationally or locally important sit e there is evidence117 that this site forms 
part of a larger area where protected Brent geese and wader species have 
been recorded in significant numbers and frequencies. Consequently in 
accordance with the Habitats Regulations it is important to safeguard a reas 
outside of designated sites known to be of importance for these species. 
However there is uncertainty on whether the land proposed for employment 
is used by these important species given its location and t he characteristics 
of the site . 
Land adjacent the Huhtamaki site off Rowner Road  
4.4.4  Land has been allocated for employment uses adjacent the Huhtamaki 
Rowner Road site to enable an extension and reorganisation of operations 
on-site.  To mitigate the loss of space, discussions have been held with the 
Council to provide public open space on land south of the Huhtamaki 
Grange Road site.  The land will also include a new cycle and pedestrian 
link between Grange Road and the strategic cycle route close to Brune Park 
School.  A tree buffer should also be retai ned adjacent the boundary of the 
Rowner Road site with Fareham Road .

POLI CY A 4: LEISURE, COMMUNITY  USES A ND OPEN SPACES  
 
Planning permission will be granted on the following sites provided 
proposals are in accordance with the criteria set out for each site as 
well as other policies in the Local Plan and national planning 
guidance:  
 
1. Gosport Leisure Park  
Development s hould include leisure facilities  
 
2. Stokesmead  
Stokesmead should be developed as a public  park. Proposals will 
need to:  
 
a) accord with national policies on internationally important 
habitats;  
b) respect the setting of the Anglesey and Alverstoke Conversation 
Areas; and  
c) be designed in accordance with the principles set out in Policy 
LE1.  
 
3. Land south  of the Huhtamaki Grange Road Site  
This site will be developed as a public open space.  Proposals 
should:  
 
a) include a new cycle and pedestrian link between Grange Road 
and Brune Park School ;  
b) retain the mature treed area on the south part of the south ; 
c) enable the potential for a southern extension cycle link to the 
HMS Sultan site should opportunities arise in the future .  
 
4. Browndown Camp, a former MoD site immediately south of the 
Alver Valley, is allocated for outdoor leisure use or non -permanent 
holiday accommodation (tents, touring caravans, motor -homes and 
self-catering cabins). Development proposals should:  
 
a) be of a suitable density for the rural location;  
b) provide suitable level of vehicular parking and vehicular access 
from Browndown Road; and  
c) suitably -scaled ancillary facilities could be acceptable  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y A4  
Gosport Leisure Park 
4.5.1  Gosport Leisure Park, which opened in 2012, includes a new major public 
leisure centre with associated outdoor play and sports facilities. A hotel, DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
223 pub/restaurant, and café have also since been completed on the site.  The 
site also includes the well -establi shed ice rink, the only one in south 
Hampshire which attracts visitors to the site from a wider catchment.  There 
may be further opportunities for additional leisure facilities on the remaining 
portion of the complex.  
Stokesmead  
4.5.2  The field occupies a very pr ominent location in the Anglesey Conservation 
Area and adjoins a site currently used for community facilities. It is well 
placed to serve the local area and enables the opportunity to provide a 
green area which can be utilised for recreation and biodiversi ty improvement 
purposes. There is currently a deficiency of local play facilities within this 
part of Gosport. The Borough Council will seek to acquire Stokesmead Field 
for public open space uses through negotiations with the landowners.  
 
4.5.3  Built development, including residential, is not suitable at this location for a 
number of reasons and the site should be retained as open space outside 
the urban area boundary. These reasons include:  
 
 It is a high value open space due to its waterside location,  is an 
important feature of the Anglesey Conservation Area and provides a 
setting for a number of important buildings in the adjoining 
Conservation Area;  
 The site is located within an area of established residential 
development and is an ideal position to provide an area clear of built 
development;  
 The site can help meet identified open spac e deficiencies;  
 The site is adjacent to an internationally important habitat and 
provides a useful buffer between the protected area and the 
residential area; and  
 Most o f the site is in an area at a high risk of flooding.  
Land south of the Huhtamaki Grange Road Site  
4.5.4  This proposed public open space should incorporate a new cycle/pedestrian  
route between Grange Road and the strategic cycle route adjacent Brune 
Park school.  There is also the possibility to construct a southern extension 
to the cycle network to HMS Sultan if opportunities arise in the future which 
will be in accordance with the Council’s wider Green Infrastructure Network 
ambitions of establish a cycle route that links the Borough’s forts . 
Browndown Camp  
4.5.5  The Council considers that there is potential to develop appropriately scaled 
tourism accommodation and leisure activities at the 2.1 hectare Browndown 
Camp site.  
 
4.5.6  Holiday accommodation should be of an approp riate density for the site 
taking into account the need to provide on -site parking for patrons which 
should be provided on at least a one space per unit of accommodation DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
224 basis. Development proposals should not rely on external parking spaces. 
Vehicular acc ess to the site should be from the existing access on

POLICY A 5: ALLOTMENTS  
 
1. Land has been allocated for a new allotment site at Manor Way Lee -
on-the-Solent as shown on the Policies Map.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for proposals to create new 
allotments and associated facilities provided:  
 
a) They are well -designed, accessible, promote the use of high 
qualit y materials and are of an appropriate scale to the use of 
the site. The layout of plots, associated landscaping, boundary 
treatments and waste disposal and composting facilities should 
be designed so they are sympathetic to their surroundings 
including the  setting of the adjacent Lee -on-the-Solent 
Conservation Area, the Lee West Area of Special Character and 
the prominent frontage of Manor Way;  
 
b) A net gain in biodiversity is achieved on the site;  
 
c) Appropriate provision is made for site access and car parkin g 
(including for people with disabilities) in accordance with Policy 
DE4 and relevant current standards; and  
 
d) There are no detrimental impacts on any of the following:  
 
i. Residential amenities;  
ii. Highway safety; or  
iii. Any important landscape, biodiversity or heritage 
features.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y A5 
New allotment provision (Points 1 and 2 of Policy A5) 
4.6.1  Demand for allotments has grown significantly in recent years with waiting 
lists for plots extending across the Borough118. Due to the high demand for 
allotments, land for a new allotment has been identified at Manor Way Lee -
on-the-Solent. In addition to the new allotment provision, there are 
opportunities to creat e of a community rest garden or a community orchard 
and wildlife  meadow as part of the design.  
 
4.6.2  The design of the new allotments and their associated facilities including 
landscaping and boundary treatments in this prominent location will 
integrate well with the existing residential area and maximise opportunities 
for contributing towards its character and local distinctiveness. Appropriate

 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
226 levels of parking and cycling provision will be required in accordance with 
Policy DE4: Layout of Sites and Parking.   
 
4.6.3  Allotments serve an important role in contr ibuting towards the local Green 
Infrastructure Network and supporting biodiversity in the Borough. In 
accordance with Policy LE7: Securing Measurable Biodiversity Net Gain, all 
development is expected to provide a net gain in on -site biodiversity, and 
appropriate site layout incorporating the use of native planting species in 
trees and hedging material, nest boxes, beetle banks within the overall 
allotment design (with appropriate mainte nance) can assist this process.  
 
4.6.4  New allotment provision should not have a detrimental impact on the 
amenities of adjacent residents and highway safety; nor harm important 
landscape, biodiversity and heritage features and/or their setting in 
accordance with the other policies in the Local  Plan.

228 5.0 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT POLI CIES  
 
5.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
5.1.1  The General Development Policies set out planning policies to guide 
decision -making on planning applications. The aim of the General 
Development Policies is to reduce unnecessary complexity for all parties 
engaged in development. The policies reflect an emphasis on collaboration 
and a positive proactive approach to coming to a balanced agreement that 
solves problems rather than a compromise that does not meet everyone's 
objectives.  
 
5.1.2  When considering development proposals the Council will take a positive 
approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sus tainable development 
contained withi n the National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) . The 
Council will always work proactively with applicants to find solutions which 
mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure 
development that improves the economic, social and environmental 
conditions in the area.  Where there are no policies relevant to the 
application or relevant policies are out-of-date at the time of making the 
decision then the Council will grant permission unless material 
considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
5.1.3  The General Development P olicies pro vide more detailed local planning  
guidance which supplement the s trategic policies for five different subject 
areas:  
 
 Housing ; 
 Employment ; 
 Design ; 
 Centres and facilities ; and 
 Local e nvironment . 
 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
229 5.2 HOUSING  
 
5.2.1  The Borough of Gosport is home to approximately 84,679  residents119. The 
provision of a sufficient quality and quantity of housing  to meet the 
Borough’s growing and ageing  population is a central part of the Local Plan s 
development strategy. The type and aff ordability of homes, together with the 
quality of the environment in new and existing residential neighbourhoods is 
one of the most important factors affecting the quality of life for residents.  
 
5.2.2  The issues connected with housing in Gosport are set out in the relevant 
Background Paper and summarised  in Box 1 3. Addressing these matters 
has informed the Development  Strategy (Policy D2) which deals with the 
supply of housing and inform s the proposed development in the Borough’s 
Regeneration Areas and non -strategic housing allocations.  
 
BOX  13: Summary of key housing issues  
 
 There is a continual demand for a range of housing to meet local needs 
at each stage of life  and meet the requirements of the increasing number 
of households ; 
 There is clear need, and hence justification, for the provision of 
affordable housing , particularly rented tenures ; 
 Access to capital and employment conditions are key factors in 
restrictin g access to market housing as well as the cost of housing ; 
 The number of older people (conventionally those aged 65 and over) and 
those with long -term health problems will increase notably in the future 
and the specific housing needs arising should be plan ned for ; and  
 The focus of new market housing provision will continue to be on 2 - and 
3-bed properties with demand from both younger families and 
downsizers .

230 5.3 POLICY H1: SUSTAINAB LE RESIDENTIAL NEIGH BOURHOODS  
Introduction  
5.3.1  Policy H1: Sustainable Residential Neighbourhoods seeks to address the 
Council’s wider strategy for urban regeneration and future economic 
prosperity by ensuring residents can live in high quality  and affordable 
housing. The approach will need to ensure th at there is sufficient 
development options available to enable access to a variety of good quality 
housing to meet a wide range of needs. It is necessary to ensure that 
provision is made for an appropriate number of dwellings to provide a range 
of homes to  meet, as far as possible, the needs of current and future 
residents both in terms of market and affordable housing. The mix of 
housing types should accommodate the different needs of a range of 
households including families, single people, older people an d those with 
disabilities.  
 
POLICY H1: SUSTAINAB LE RESIDENTIAL NEIGH BOURHOODS  
 
1. The appropriate density of residential development wi ll be informed 
and assessed by:  
 
 The need to maximise the efficient use of scarce land 
resources;  
 The character and mix of uses of the area in which it is located 
taking into account local townscape, protected trees and 
heritage assets;  
 Level of accessibility in terms of walking, cycling and public 
transport; and  
 The need to minimise environmental and amenity impacts  
 
Indicative built densities  for different areas are set out in Table 3 
but the criteria above may indicate that a different density is 
appropriate. Where the proposed built density falls below that 
specified the applicant will be expected to provide support ing 
information justifying the density proposed. Applications that, on 
balance of considerations, either fail to make efficient use of land 
or propose an excessively high density for its context, will be 
refused.   
 
2. New residential development should contri bute towards meeting 
the need for a mix of housing as set out in Table 4 with the aim of 
delivering mixed, balanced and sustainable neighbourhoods. 
Accoun t will need to be taken of the:  
 
 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (or any subsequent 
revision);  
 Detailed Local Housing Market Assessments (where 
applicable);  
 Current and future demographic studies and profiles;  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
231  Locality and ability of the site to accommodate a mix of 
housing; and  
 Market signals and local housing market trends.  
 
Applications that, on  balance of considerations, fail to provide a 
suitable mix of housing will be refused.   
 
3. The regeneration and renewal of existing housing estates, or 
larger sites partly comprised of housing estates, will continue to 
be promoted to ensure that high quality  new housing and site 
environments are provided in line with the principles of 
sustain able neighbourhoods set out in Point 1 above. In 
redeveloping existing housing estates opportunities to improve 
public open spaces, provide new or improved community faci lities 
and alternative modes of transport, and create opportunities for 
employment will be taken where appropriate.  
 
4. Proposals for self and custom build housing, to be occupied as 
homes by those individuals, will be supported by the Council where 
they are in conformity with all other relevant local and national 
policies. On sites with 40 or more non -flatted market dwelli ngs site 
promoters should provide at least 2.5% of plots as self -build plots.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y H1  
Density (Point 1 of Policy H1)  
5.3.2  With the significant need for housing in Gosport it is important that efficient 
and effective use is made of the land th at is available to boost the delivery of 
new homes. However, there are other considerations that need to be 
weighed against this in particular the character of the surrounding areas. 
Appropriate densities will vary across the Borough, with higher densities  in 
Gosport Town Centre and the Waterfront , to lower density housing in 
established residential suburbs. Each site has its own particular 
characteristics, and as such it is not appropriate to set down exact densities 
in policy.  
 
5.3.3  Nevertheless, some guidance  on appropriate densities in different areas can 
be helpful as an indication, and Table 3 (below ) sets out indicative ranges 
within different locations. For town centres, 80 dwellings per hectare is used 
as an indication, but, depending on the site, the ap propriate density may be 
significantly greater than this, in view of the need to make best use of 
accessible sites.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
232 TABLE 3: Indicative Built Density Range (dwellings per hectare  (dph) ) 
Town Centre and 
Waterfront  Other Regeneration  
Areas  Suburban  
Above 80 dph  50 to 100 dph  30 to 50 dph  
 
5.3.4  The spacious nature and low density of some of the Borough’s existing 
suburbs has led to development pressure for the intensification of existing 
housing areas through redevelopment at higher densities and the 
development of infill plots and ‘backland’ are as. This can have a significant 
impact on local distinctiveness through the erosion of their character. 
Therefore it is essential that if infill or backland development does take place 
it is sensitively designed and makes a positive contribution to the loc al 
environment. The range of densities is greatest in the identified regeneration 
areas. Where appropriate, detailed site-specific  density guidance is set out 
in the regeneration policies.  
Housing Mix  (Point 2 of Policy H1)  
5.3.5  The Partnership for South Hampsh ire (PfSH) Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (SHMA) (2014) considers that to meet the needs of new and 
existing households, address stock imbalance and the impact of future 
demographic and household formation, new developments should provide a 
suitable m ix of dwellings. The SHMA provides a range of different sizes of 
dwelling across the PfSH area. However, due to the local demographics of 
Gosport  Borough  the requirement for affordable housing  is for smaller 
dwelling sizes  (see Policy H2 : Affordable Housin g). 
 
5.3.6  The Gosport Borough Council Demographic Projections (GBCDP) (JG 
Consulting, September 2019) sets out that there are a range of factors 
which will influence demand for different sizes of homes including 
demographic changes, future growth in real earnings and housing 
affordability. Table 4 (below ) sets out the recommended mix of market and 
affordable dwellings:

Affordable Housing 
(rented)  35-40% 30-35% 20-25% 5-10% 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
233 5.3.6  In all proposals at least 70% of the market dwellings should also be a 
suitable mix of 2 -bed and 3 -bed dwellings, given that this is the source of 
greatest need, irrespective of whether they are flats or houses or a mix of 
both. The Council will however be  willing to negotiate in exceptional 
circumstances a different market housing mix if it can be demonstrated that 
this would result in other significant positive benefits to the local community. 
This could include for example the optimal viable use of a des ignated 
heritage asset.  For reference, the issues of housing mix and affordable 
housing will be determined at the Outline stage, and secured through 
suitable condtions or in a planning obligation clause, where applications 
defer detailed design to a subseq uent Reserved Matters application.  
 
5.3.7  The mix of affordable housing provided as part of any residential scheme 
should respond to the identified need taking account of the most up -to-date 
information. The PfSH SHMA (2014) identifies a requirement for the 
following size of affordable dwellings in the wider Portsmouth Housing 
Market Area, of which Gosport  Borough  is entirely within:  
 
 1-bed dwellings: 35 -40% 
 2-bed dwellings: 30 -35% 
 3-bed dwellings: 20 -25% 
 4-bed dwellings: 5 -10% 
 
5.3.8  It is expected that in all pro posals at least 50% of the affordable dwellings 
should be a suitable mix of 2 -bed and 3 -bed dwellings, given that this is the 
source of greatest need, irrespective of whether they are flats or houses. 
For reference, all proposals of 10 dwellings or more sh ould also address 
Policy H2 : Affordable Housing .  
Estate Renewa l (Point 3 of Policy H1)  
5.3.9  The quality of neighbourhoods and the housing stock within them is an 
important factor affecting resident’s quality of life. The Borough Council will 
work to improve th e quality of existing residential neighbourhoods through a 
programme of regeneration in specific housing estates outside the  identified 
urban regeneration a reas.  
 
5.3.10  A significant proportion of the Borough’s housing stock is contained within 
existing residential areas where the Council retains ownership. Some of 
these areas do not provide the quality of accommodation or environment 
that ensures a good quality of life f or residents and as such the Council will 
continue to work on regenerating specific housing estates and/or parts of 
estates, blocks and individual buildings. Redevelopment could include 
adjacent previously developed land  that is considered suitable for ren ewal 
and may comprise a mixture of uses  where this would support the overall 
viability  of proposals.  
Self and Custom Built Housing  (Point 4 of Policy H1)  
5.3.11  The NPPF requires local planning authorities to widen opportunities for 
home ownership by identifying  the size, type, tenure and range of housing DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
234 that is required in particular locations, reflecting local demand. The 
government wants to enable more people to build or commission their own 
home and wants to make this form of housing a mainstream housing opt ion. 
In line with this, the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, requires 
local authorities to keep a register of individuals and associations of 
individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in their area in 
order to build homes f or those individuals to occupy.  
 
5.3.12  A Self and Custom Build Register has been established in order to provide 
evidence of demand for custom/self -build plots within Gosport  Borough . At 
the time of preparation of this Local Plan there are 43 individual s and 3 
developers on the Register, indicating limited existing demand for plots.  
National planning guidance, set out in the Planning Practice Guidance 
(PPG) states that local planning authorities should use the demand data 
from the registers in their area, support ed as necessary by additional 
sources, when preparing their Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
(SHMA) to understand and consider future need for this type of housing in 
their area. The Council will continue to collect evidence in order to develop a 
fuller  understanding of the demand for self  and custom build  housing . This 
policy will be reviewed once further understanding of local demand has 
been established.  
 
5.3.13  The standard  in draft Policy H1 is based on taking a ratio approach 
comparing the Council’s housing waiting list register with the self-build  
register as at 1st April 2021 i.e. 701/43 = 16 and consequently if one uses  
the same ratio regarding the Council’s affordable  housing requirement  on 
sites of 10 or more as set out in Policy H2 i.e. 40%  and divide this by 16 the 
resulting figure would be 2.5%.  Therefore , on a site of 100 dwelling new -
build site, 40 would be affordable housing ,  if the 60 market dwellings were 
all non -flatted, then 1.5 would be self-build  plots  which would be rounded to 
2 in this instance .   
 
5.3.14  The Council will also be allocating five self -build plots at Land at  Heritage 
Way and Frater Lane (see Policy A2 : Housing). For reference, self or 
custom build housing is subject to all the requirements of the Gosport 
Borough Local Plan  2038  including affordable housing, design and planning 
obligations.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
235 5.4 POLICY H2: AFFORDABL E HOUSING  
 
POLICY H2: AFFORDABL E HOUSING  
 
1. The Borough Council will seek 40% affordable housing on 
residential developments of 10 dwellings or more. Provision 
should be made on -site in the first instance . In exceptional 
circumstances the Council will consider  a financial contribution 
being negotiated to make up the full requirement as appropriate. In 
all cases where proposals fall short of the policy target an open -
book approach will be taken and the onus will be on the developer/  
landowner to clearly demonstrate the circumstances justifying  a 
lower affordable housing contribution.  The Council will seek to 
negotiate a percentage of affordable housing as close as possible 
to the target level having regard to a site-specific  viability 
assessment.  
 
2. In determining applications with affordable hou sing the Council 
will assess the site size, suitability and type of units to be 
delivered in relation to the current evidence and the local site 
context. The Council will seek an appropriate tenure mix of 
affordable housing to include social rented, afford able rent, 
intermediate rent and shared ownership affordable units.  
 
3. Affordable housing proposals should also take account o f the 
following considerations:  
 
a) Dwellings provided should be fully integrated into the 
development;  
b) In phased housing developments,  site promoters will be 
expected to provide details of the affordable housing provision 
in each phase, including the number and type of affordable 
housing to be provided;  
c) All affordable housing contributions should be secured in 
perpetuity through a planning obligation; and  
d) Site promoters may not circumvent this policy by artificially 
subdividing qualifying sites.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y H2  
Quantum of Affordable Housing ( Point  1 of Policy H2)  
5.4.1  Affordable housing is subsidised housing that enables the asking price or 
rent to be substantially lower than the prevailing market prices or rents in the 
locality, and is subject to mechanisms that will ensure that the housing 
remains affordable for those who cannot afford market housing. It is defin ed 
in the NPPF as “ housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met 
by the market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
236 ownership and/or is for essential local workers ).” The Government has also 
classified some new tenures as affordable including starter homes.  
 
5.4.2  A Ministerial Statement in November 2014 sought to remove sites of ten or 
less dwellings from the need to provide affordable housing. Although 
subsequent challenges in the courts have upheld this statement, they have  
also clarified that the statement does not have the effect of overriding local 
policies where there is evidence of exceptional need for affordable housing. 
However  there is  currently  insufficient evidence to justify an affordable 
housing contribution from  devel opment sites of 9 units or less in the 
Borough.  
 
5.4.3  The Partnership for South Hampshire (P fSH) Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (2014), Objectively Assessed Housing Need Update (GL 
Hearn) (April 2016) and the Gosport Borough Council Demographic 
Proje ctions (September 2019) have all clearly demonstrated that there is an 
overriding need to provide affordable housing in Gosport and that the 
Council would be justified in seeking to achieve a target 40% affordable 
housing on qualifying sites.  Affordable ho using contributions will be sought 
from residential -only developments and mixed -use developments. On-site 
provision (serviced land or completed units) of affordable housing will 
always be sought in the first instance on sites of 10 dwellings or more.  
 
5.4.4  The Council will be sensitive to exceptional costs of bringing a site to market 
such as for reasons of expensive reclamation, or infrastructure costs, or 
high existing use values. Where applicants can demonstrate, to the 
satisfaction of the Council, exceptiona l difficulties in bringing a site to 
market, the Council will be prepared to consider detailed information on the 
viability of a particular scheme and, where justified through an open book 
approach, to reduce the affordable housing requirement.  
 
5.4.5  The information required in a viability appraisal should be proportionate to 
the scale and/or complexity of the proposed development. As development 
costs are usually reflected in the residual land value, the purchase price of a 
particular site will not, on it s own, be a reason for reducing the affordable 
housing requirement. The viability appraisal should be undertaken by a 
professionally qualified member of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors (RICS) to establish the appropriate form and level of cont ribution. 
Where the Authority does not agree that the appraisal has been undertaken 
robustly and fairly, it must be independently audited, at the cost of the 
developer and subsequently reviewed if necessary.  
 
5.4.6  Exceptionally, off -site provision or a financia l contribution of broadly 
equivalent value to the normal on -site provision may be justified. Only when 
all options for on -site provision are shown to have been reasonably 
explored, without success, will a financial contribution to provide affordable 
housin g off-site be accepted.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
237 Tenure, Size and Type of Affordable Housing ( Point  2 of Policy H2)  
5.4.7  Affordable housing can take the form of a variety of residential tenures, 
sizes of dwelling (usually in terms of the number of bedrooms) and housing 
typologies  i.e. flat or house. The P fSH SHMA (2014) identifies a requirement 
for the following types in Gosport  Borough : 
 
 28% Intermediate housing – assigned to households who can afford 
a housing cost at or above 80% of market rents but cannot afford full 
market costs . 
 15% Affordable Rent – assigned to households who could afford a 
social rent without the need to claim benefit to afford an Affordable 
Rented home (priced at 80% of market rented costs) . 
 57% Social Rent – households who would need to claim housing 
benefit r egardless of the cost of the property . 
 
5.4.8  The 2021  NPPF  subsequently introduced a new category of household in 
affordable housing need and widen ed the definition of affordable housing to 
include households that would be suitable for starter homes and discounted 
market sales housing. Other potential forms of affordable housing t enure 
include shared ownership.  
 
5.4.9  The Gosport Borough Council Demographic Projections (September 2019) 
sets out (Paragraph 3.67) that it would be reasonable for the Borough 
Council to conclude that there is no need to provide housing under the new 
NPPF definition of affordable home ownership. Whilst there are clearly 
some households in the gap between renting and buying, there may well be 
a surplus supply of affordable homes for ownership, and this should be 
balanced against the clear and acute need for rented affordable housing 
from lower inco me households. Paragraph 3.69 sets out however that if the 
Borough Council did seek to provide 10% of housing as affordable home 
ownership then shared ownership would be the most appropriate form of 
tenure due to likely deposit requirements.  
 
5.4.10  The affordabl e housing needs should  therefore be split as follows:  
 
 Social rented or Affordable rent housing – no less than 70% of total 
affordable housing units;  
 Intermediate – no less than 20% of total affordable housing units; and  
 Shared ownership housing – no grea ter than 10% of total affordable 
housing units . 
 
5.4.11  The residential typology used to provide the affordable housing will depend 
primarily on the location of the proposed development . Sites within Gosport  
Town Centre and Gosport Waterfront would be expected to  primarily provide 
flatted dwellings. Sites in the Haslar Peninsula could provide a mix of both 
flats and houses. Other regeneration areas such Rowner and Daedalus  
should also provide a mix of typologies with houses being the preferred 
option there and els ewhere in the Borough.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
238 5.4.12  The mix (number of bedrooms) of affordable housing should be ad dressed 
in line with Policy H1: Sustainable Residential Neighbourhoods  criterion 2.  
Other considerations ( Point  3 of Policy H2)  
5.4.13  Affordable homes must be integrated throughout the development and be of 
a visually indistinguishable design. They should be located throughout the 
site in a manner that supports integration but can also be managed 
efficiently by the relevant housing assoc iation.  
 
5.4.14  Affordable housing provision will be secured at the granting of planning 
permission by a Section 106 legal agreement. Affordable housing should 
remain as such in perpetuity.  
 
5.4.15  The Authority will not accept the artificial subdivision of sites where an 
obvious consequence of doing so would be to fall under the relevant policy 
threshold requiring either on -site provision of affordable housing, or a 
financial contribution proportionate to the total sum of development. For the 
purposes of housing provisi on, the Authority will consider a site to be a 
single site if the current arrangements, in either functional and/or legal land 
ownership terms, can be considered part of a wider whole.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
239 5.5 POLICY H3: HOUSING F OR OLDER AND VULNERA BLE PEOPLE  
 
POLICY H3: HOUSING  FOR OLDER A ND VULNERABLE PEOPLE   
 
1. A positive approach will be taken towards housing proposals that 
seek to meet the needs of an aging population and increased 
needs for those with disabilities. Provision will be made for the 
following quantum of specialist housin g for older or disabled 
people:  
 
 Up to 500 homes with support (Class C3 sheltered housing or 
retirement living) ; 
 Up to 500 homes with care (Class C2 or C3 enhanced 
sheltered and extra -care housing) ; 
 Up to 750 residential care bed -spaces (C lass C2 nursing care) .  
 
2. The Council will take a positive approach to the provision of 
specialist residential accommodation for younger people who are 
vulnerable and/or disabled.  
 
3. All development for specialist accommodation for older, disabled 
and vulner able people should satisfy the following criteria:  
 
a) The site is accessible by residents by public transport;  
b) Buildings compatible in height, scale and massing with the 
local townscape character;  
c) Well-designed and healthy internal living environments with 
positive use of internal circulation and shared spaces;  
d) Layouts should maximi se natural light and ventilation;  
e) Access to private balconies and suitably designed private or 
semi -private open spaces; and  
f) Suitable provision for ambulance access, visitor parking and 
storage.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y H3  
Overview of planne d provision (Point 1  of Policy H3)  
5.5.1  Gosport is facing a range of specialist housing needs in the plan period and 
as such it is critical to plan for some of the more complex needs arising. This 
is driven primarily by changing demographics including increasing life 
expectancy and an increase i n the number of people with specific illnesses 
or disabilities. Offering older people and those with vulnerabilities or 
disabilities a better choice of accommodation to suit their changing needs 
that can help them live independently for longer, feel more c onnected to 
their communities , and help reduce costs to the social care and health 
services , is a key part of building a healthier community in Gosport.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
240 5.5.2  The Gosport Borough Council Demographic Projections (GBCDP) (JG 
Consulting, September 2019) assessed the housing needs and 
characteristics of older and disabled people in the plan period as the two 
groups are clearly linked.  
 
5.5.3  As of 2018, Gosport has an average age structure in terms of older people, 
when compared to the Hampshire and national figures, bu t is projected to 
see a significant increase in the number of older (age 65+) in the population 
in the plan period to 203 8. In absolute terms this is projected to be an 
increase of between 8,400 and 8,900 people.  
 
5.5.4  Gosport will also have large increases in the plan period of people with 
dementia and mobility issues which disproportionately affect older people. 
Growth shown in those with disabilities provides clear evidence justifying 
delivering accessible and adaptab le homes, including wheelchair access, as 
defined i n current Building Regulations.  
 
5.5.5  The main types of older persons’ housing includes120: 
 
 Retirement or sheltered housing – a group of self -contained flats or 
bungalows, typically age restricted to the over 55 ’s, with some shared 
facilities such as residents lounge, garden, guest suite and laundry, 
with on -site supportive management.  
 Enhanced sheltered housing – sheltered housing with additional 
services to enable older people to retain their independence in th eir 
own home for as long as possible. Typically this housing provides 
24/7 staff cover, meals and additional shared facilities.  
 Extra care housing – schemes where a service registered to provide 
personal or nursing care is available on -site 24/7. Often all  meals are 
provided and has additional shared facilities. Some schemes 
specialise in dementia care.  
 Residential care homes – residential settings where a number of 
older people live, usually in single rooms, and have access to on -site 
care and personal car e services. Some care homes have on -site 
nurses to provide for more complex health needs.  
 
5.5.6  The quantum of each of these type of housing set out in the policy is based 
on the projections set out in the GBCDP. The Council will monitor the supply 
of specialis t housing throughout the plan period to enable an understanding 
of whether there is a shortfall or over -supply at any given time.  
 
5.5.7  For the plan period to 2038, the main sources of supply for older persons 
accommodation include the already permitted Royal Hospital Haslar site, 
Land at former HMS Daedalus and Land at Addenbrooke House , which will 
provide a total of 336 C2 bedrooms and 60 C3 units . In addition, it is 
expected that the following sites which are allocated in this Local Plan will 
                                            
120 There is a significant amount of variability in the types of specialist housing for older people. The list above 
provides an indication of the different types of housing available, but is not definitive. Any single development 
may contain a range of differ ent types of specialist housing.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
241 also provide ol der persons accommodation: Blockhouse, Haslar Barracks 
and other Borough Council owned land.  
Specialist Residential Accommodation  (Point 2 of Policy H3)  
5.5.8  Other potential groups covered by this section include new specialist 
residential accommodation for you nger people (under 55) who may be 
disable d, vulnerable or both. This includes people with particular learning 
disabilities, young people at risk, children, people with a drug or alcohol 
problem, ex -offenders, homeless people, former armed services personne l 
with care needs and people fleeing domestic violence. The Council will take 
a positive approach to the range of specialist housing requirements from 
these groups and others which can change over time.  
 
5.5.9  The urban regeneration areas at Daedalus , Haslar, Ro wner and Gosport  
Town Centre are the best locations for the provision of the types of housing 
addressed in both criteria 1 and 2 given their greater capacity for future 
change and access to jobs and services. However, proposals outside the 
urban regenerati on areas will also be considered acceptable in principle 
where it is demonstrated that the site has good access through public 
transport taking into account the mobility of the proposed future occupiers.  
Design Considerations (Point 3 of Policy H3)  
5.5.10  The design of housing for older, disabled and vulnerable people should 
always be carefully considered and inclusive. Proposals should broadly 
accord with the key design criteria set out in the independent Housing our 
Ageing Population Panel for Innovation (HAPPI ) principles121, or subsequent 
replacement guidance, which have particular relevance to older people’s 
housing.  
 
5.5.11  Proposals should be located in accessible locations no more than 800 
metres from public transport provision. Where prospective residents c ould 
potentially either have more significant mobility issues or not have the ability 
to drive, proposals should be sited within 400  metres  of a bus service.  
 
5.5.12  Proposals should be broadly compatible with the prevailing townscape 
character. Where larger bui ldings are proposed in existing residential areas 
there should be sufficient separation distances and suitable landscaping to 
avoid a discordant presence in the local street scene.  
 
5.5.13  Building layouts should promote circulat ion areas as shared spaces offer 
connections to the wider context, encouraging interaction, supporting 
interdependence and a voiding an ‘institutional feel’. This can  includ e the use 
of shared balcony access to front doors and thresholds which may promote 
natural surveillance and provision  for ‘defensible space’.  Entrances should 
be clearly identifiable and well lit. Accesses should always  be level and 
suitable for all.  
 
                                            
121 www.housinglin.org.uk/Topics/browse/Design -building/HAPPI/     DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
242 5.5.14  Building layouts should also maximise natural light and ventilation through 
careful  design of fenestration that allows da ylight into shared spaces, 
circulation routes and private areas. Apartments should have balconies, 
patios, or terraces with enough space for tables and chairs as well as plants. 
Adequate storage  should be  available outside the home together with 
provision for cycles and mobility aids, and storage inside the home should 
meet the needs of the occupiers. Visitor parking should be provided and 
clearly demarcated. Specific spaces should be provided for ambulanc es 
close to the main site entrance.

a) the site is accessible to local facilities and services and is 
served or capable of being served by essential utility 
infrastructure;  
b) adequate levels of privacy and residential amenity for site 
occupiers should be provided;  
c) the site is capa ble of accommodating both the number of 
caravans/mobile homes proposed and any associated 
equipment for business activities; and  
d) the proposal would not significantly adversely affect the 
character of the area including natural and built heritage assets 
and the wider landscape or have unacceptable amenity, traffic or 
other environmental impacts.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLICY  H5 
Allocation of land at Fareham Road (Point 1 of Policy H5)  
5.7.1  National Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (August 2015)122 requires local 
authorities to proactively plan to meet the housing needs of Gypsies , 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in their area.   
 
5.7.2  In partnership with other local authorities in Hampshire, a study was 
commissioned to assess the accommodation needs  of members of the 
Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople communities following changes 
to the National Planning Policy for Traveller Sites.  The Hampshire 
Consortium Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Assessment was published in M ay 2017.  
 
5.7.3  The findings of the Study considered that a site in Gosport accommodating 
1 permanent pitch would meet the needs of G ypsies and Travellers over the 
local p lan period. The study did not consider it to be necessary for the 
Borough Council to make additional provision for Travelling Showpeople.  
 
                                            
122 www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning -policy -for-traveller -sites DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
244 5.7.4  Policy H5 allocates land at Fareham Road to provide for 1 permanent site 
accommodating up to 3 caravans to meet identified local need. The Borough 
Council considers it appropriate to limit the number of cara vans to be 
accommodated on site in order to ensure the appropriate standard of both 
vehicle and pedestrian access and parking can be achieved on site as well 
as ensuring that activity in the site will not generate unacceptable traffic 
impacts onto the clas sified A32.  
Additional pitch or plot provision (Point 2 of Policy H5)  
5.7.5  Based on current evidence, the Borough Council does not consider it 
necessary to make further allocations in the Local Plan for permanent 
pitches in addition to the allocation proposed a t Fareham Road. However it 
is important that the Local Plan provides clear policy criteria in order to 
assess any new proposals that may come forward or in the light of new 
evidence. Applications for new proposals will be assessed against both the  
criteria  set out in part 2 of P olicy H5 and the other relevant policies of the 
Local Plan.  
Accessibility to local f acilities and services (Point 2 a of Policy H5)  
5.7.6  The Borough Council will expect new proposals to be located in areas that 
can be well served by local facilities and services in order to help support 
the everyday needs of residents on the site.  
On-site privacy and amenity (Point 2b of Policy H5)  
5.7.7  It is important that site residents can enjoy good levels of privacy and 
residential ameni ty. New development should be designed to respect the 
residential amenity of existing and new occupiers.  
Site capacity (Point 2c of Policy H5)  
5.7.8  The Borough Council recognises that proposed sites may need to be able to 
accommodate  both residential and busine ss uses. In particular, it is 
recognised that proposals for Travelling Showpeople sites may also need to 
be capable of being able to store large pieces of equipment where this may 
be necessary for the occupants  business. Therefore in order to ensure 
compat ibility of uses with existing neighbours, the Borough Council will 
require  evidence to show that the associated business uses from the 
proposal will not have a detrimental impact on neighbouring land uses.  
Local amenity (Point 2d of Policy H5)  
5.7.9  As with oth er development proposals for residential use s, the impact of a 
specific proposal on the local amenity is a key planning consideration. It is 
important that new development proposals make a positive contribution to 
both their immediate surroundings and the wider environment. Development 
proposals must not cause harm to the Borough’s nature conservation 
interests or heritage assets.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
245 5.7.10  It is necessary to ensure new development can provide safe access and 
that adequate  on-site parking  can be achieved. Developmen t generating 
adverse impacts on the highway network will not be acceptable and 
therefore the Borough C ouncil will consult the Highway  Authority to ensure 
these arrangements are satisfactory.  
 
5.7.11  As with other forms of residential development, where planning permission 
is granted, the Borough Council may use planning conditions or obligations 
to assist in the delivery of good quality development in the Borough.  
Transit site provision  
5.7.12  The Hampshire Consortium Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
Accommod ation Assessment (2017)  recommended that in terms of transit 
site provision, it is necessary to continue to monitor the trends with regard to 
current and future levels of unauthorised encampments across the county 
and within individual local authorities . This review of evidence will determine 
the potential for future investment in transit provision or temporary stopping 
places following the changes to planning policy for traveller sites post 2015 , 
and therefore the study does not make specific locational re commendations 
for the provision of transit sites. Should robust evidence show that a transit 
site is required in the Borough then this would be considered under Point  2 
of Policy H5 and the other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
Travelling Showpeople  
5.7.13  There are no yards for Travelling Showpeople in the Borough. The study 
concluded that no additional provision is required in Gosport. However 
should a planning application come forward during the plan period the 
Borough Council considers that Point  2 of Policy H5 along with other 
policies in the Local Plan will provide clear policy guidance for the 
consideration of planning applications for Travelling Showpeople sites.

246 5.8 EMPLOYMENT  
Introduction  
5.8.1  It is important that the Local Plan can help facilitate economic development 
in the Borough in  order to create jobs and prosperity for the local 
community. This is particularly important as part of the post COVID -19 
recovery which will need to be a green r ecovery in order to meet the 
Government’s legal requirement of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  
 
5.8.2  The Local Plan includes a number of measures that can contribute to 
improving the local economy and these need to be read in conjunction with 
policies that incorporate measures which deliver net zero carbon emissions.  
Relevant policies include:  
 
 The need to e nsure there is sufficient land for employment floorspace  
as well as mak ing the best use of key employment  assets in order  to 
attract new employment  (Policy E1); 
 The need to e nsure that there is an increase in local skill levels  which 
meet  the demands of new investors  (Policy E2);  
 The need to d evelop the local tourism industry to make the most of 
Gosport’s waterfront setting and naval history  (Policy  E3);  
 The need to ensure any further marina  and other coastal 
development, which can enhance the local economy, is suitably sited 
in relation to environmental and other considerations ( Policy E4 ); and  
 The need to ensure business is served by modern 
teleco mmunications technology (Policy E5). 
 
5.8.3  In addition, many of the strategic site and other allocation policies in Section 
3.0 have a strong economic development focus.  
 
5.8.4  Box 1 4 sets out a definition for economic development123 and is used within 
this section.  
 
BOX 14: What is economic development?  
 
For the purposes of this Local Plan, economic development includes:  
 
 development within the B Use Classes and Class E part g;  
 public and community uses; and the main to wn centre uses including:  
o retail development;  
o leisure and entertainment facilities.  
 
This definition does not apply to housing development.  
 
  
                                            
123 This is a useful Government definition previously used in the NPPF which is still considere d relevant although 
has been amended by the Borough Council to reflect the Use Class Order amendments of September 2020.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
247 Local Context  
5.8.5  There are a number of factors that make Gosport a good place to attract 
new businesses including:  
 
 The presence of important  employment asse ts such as a coastal and 
harbour frontage  which include  access to deep water and associated 
facilities, the presence of an airfield and a variety of specialist 
engineering buildings ; 
 Good skill levels in a number of high -tech industries ; 
 A cluster of businesses in a number of sectors  including aviation,  
aerospace,  marine and advanced  manufacturing  with linked 
employment assets and the benefits of being located in close 
proximity to each other ; 
 The traditionally lower land values in this part of Hampshire may 
make sites attractive for emerging sectors and businesses that need 
to keep costs low particularly whilst becoming established;  
 Relatively  low housing costs in Gosport  compared to other parts  of 
the South East ; 
 The coastal location offers a good quality of life; and  
 Relatively good access to the motorway compared with many areas 
of the UK, particularly off -peak.  
 
5.8.6  There are a number of economic issues facing the Borough which need to 
be address ed. These are summarised in Box 1 5 below124. Addressing these 
problems has shaped the Development  Strategy (Section  2.0, Policy D2 ) 
and directed the development objectives of each of the Regeneration Areas  
and Strategic Development Sites  (Section 3.0). 
 
BOX  15: Summary of key economic issues  
 Significant loss of local employment over the last 30 years due to the 
release of M inistry of Defence  sites and the loss of other manufacturing 
jobs.  
 The Borough has the lowest job density in the South Eas t and one of the 
lowest in England.  
 Increased out -commuting on  a constrained road network has led to 
extended peak -time congestion.  
 The Borough’s economy is underperforming and has a significantly lower 
business density when compared with the aver ages for Hampshire and 
the South East Region and has the lowest number of businesses 
registered for VAT within Hampshire.  
 Public sector jobs accounts for a high proportion of workforce.  
 Relatively low levels of entrepreneurship.  
 The Borough has significant  pockets of deprivation which experience 
higher rates of economic inactivity, lower skill levels and qualification 
attainment than the Borough as a whole, and compared to national and 
regional averages.

POLICY E1: EMPLOYMEN T LAND  
 
1. The Local Plan will make provision for at least 90,000 sq.m. of net 
additional employment floorspace (Use Classes E(g), B2 & B8).   
 
2. The Local Plan will ensure that new employment land is provided 
by identifying:  
 
a) major development sites (as shown on the Policies Map) that 
have opportunities for significant employment creation 
including the Harbour Regeneration Area  (Policy D3 ), Daedalus 
(SS11 ) and HMS Sultan ( SS10 ); and 
b) other employment land allocations (as shown on the Policies 
Map) ( Policy A 3). 
 
3. Employment assets such as deep waterfront access, airfield access 
or specialist on -site facilities will be protected. Specific sites 
requiring such protection include:  
 
Marine  
 
a) deep -water  access and associated land at Victoria Quays and 
Royal Clarence Yard  Retain ed Area ; 
b) Royal Clarence Marina and associated land ; 
c) deep -water  access, the boatlifting crane, marine and associated

Other assets  
 
j) other employment assets where evidence is forthcoming that 
identify the need to  protect them for economic activity.  
 
4. Existing employment land (as shown on the Policies Map), will be 
safeguarded for employment purposes (E(g), B2 and B8). Planning DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
249 permission for other types of economic development  on existing 
employment land will be granted if it can be demonstrated that:  
 
a) the use will generate similar or higher levels of employment than 
the existing use;  
b) the use is compatible with neighbouring  uses within  the 
employment site; and  
c) the relevant tests  in Policy C1 regarding town centre uses are 
met. 
 
5. In certain circumstances planning permission may be granted for 
residential development as part of an employment -led mixed -use 
scheme provided that:  
 
a) it is demonstrated that it is not viable to redevelop t he whole site  
for employment uses or other types of economic development; 
and 
b) the overall proposed development will generate the same or a 
greater number of jobs than recent levels on the site.  
 
6. Planning permission will be granted to diversify the local ec onomy 
including the following proposals:  
 
a) service hubs to support live /work units;  
b) Incubator, Co -working space and a Skills Hub as part of High 
Street redevelopment plans . 
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y E1  
Overall approach  
5.9.1  The Borough Council’s employment -led approach accords with the  PfSH  
Spatial Position Statement (2016) and emerging PfSH e vidence for the 
forthcoming sub -regional work. This  includes a strong driv e to deliver 
economic growth, the regeneration  of brownfield land, the creation of new  
jobs to tackle unemployment , and increase productivity.  
 
5.9.2  The Borough Council’s approach also reflects the ambitions of the Solent 
Local Enterprise Partnership’s Strategic Economic Plan  (2014)125 which 
identifies a number of strategic sectors and clusters including marine, 
aerospace and defence, advanced manufacturing, engineering and 
enhancing the visitor economy. It places significant emphasis on the need to 
invest in skills and enable infrastru cture priorities to be secured such as land 
assets, transport and housing, reducing flood risk and improving access to 
superfast broadband. It  is also in accordance with the LEP’s emerging 
Economic Strategy for the Solent - Solent 2050126, which has an incre asing 
emphasis on green growth.

250  
5.9.3  In addition, the LEP’s Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan (GIIP) 
(February  2019) highlights the importance of regenerating brownfield sites in 
the Borough for economic development opportunities.  
 
5.9.4  The GIIP recognises that the proposed disposal of a number of Government 
sites provide s an unparalleled opportunity to accommodate a new phase in 
Gosport’s growth.  Recent economic trends identify a pattern of relatively 
poor performance of Gosport’s economy and a business as usual approach 
could mean a real risk that the Borough’s economy stagnates and by doing 
so, worsens the existing performance gap between Gosport and the wider 
Solent region.  The GIIP includes a Vision for Gosport to 2050 ( Box 1 6) 
drawing upon the Borough’s  existing strengths and attributes, and is 
ambitious about the scale of transformative change that could be pursued. It 
includes four themes.  
 
BOX  16: Solent LEP  Vision for Gosport  
as in the Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan  (Solent LEP , 2019)

DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
251 5.9.5  The GIIP highlights that there are no fundamental overriding infrastructure 
issues constraining short term development. However there are several 
broader infrastructure issues , these are : 
 
 ongoing risks associated with tidal flooding/coastal defences  
 press ures on the Borough’s transport networks; and  
 the relatively uncompetitive resident skills position . 
 
5.9.6  The above issues could undermine Gosport’s ability to deliver 
transformative economic growth and change. In addition, these may impose 
additional costs th at impact the financial viability of development proposals. 
The GIIP identifies significant barriers to delivery and viability challenges 
present on all the sites and that initial investment is needed to help unlock 
and accelerate their potential and ultim ately encourage public sector 
investment. The document includes a number of overarching investment 
priorities in  the following areas : 
 
 flood defences and manageme nt; 
 renewable energy;  
 transport;  
 telecommunications incl uding next generation broadband;  and  
 training and skills including higher education facilities, dedicated 
marine and maritime skills and a hospitality skills centre.  
 
5.9.7  The Council’s  Economic Development Strategy127 was adopted in 2021 and 
covers the period to 2031. The Local Plan reflects the land use elements of 
the Strategy.  
 
5.9.8  In accordance with the GIIP and the Gosport Economic Development 
Strategy t he Local Plan aims to make the best use of the Borough’s asset s 
and create the conditions that will attract business investment. The focus on 
an employment -led strategy will assist in the Council’s wider economic 
objectives to stimulate enterprise, reduce public sector dependency and 
enhance and develop its busi ness clusters. The Local Plan aims to facilitate 
the use of derelict or unused land, muc h of it currently or until recently in 
public ownership, towards employment generating commercial uses.  
 
5.9.9  It is clear that an employment -led approach is the most appropriate method 
of addressing Gosport’s out -commuting and congestion problems as well as 
helping to  alleviate the sig nificant pockets of deprivation  within the Borough. 
This employment -led strategy includes the need to identify major sites for 
employment and protect key assets.  
 
5.9.10  The development of existing business clusters (including marine, avi ation , 
aerospace  and advanced manufacturing sectors) will be encouraged as well 
as the  promotion of new sectors particularly those supporting green growth.  
It is therefore important to build upon existing strengths and assets in 
Gosport to support these ke y clusters.

252  
5.9.11  The development of existing clusters and/or the emergence of new ones will 
impact on the level of demand for new employment floorspace and the type 
of premises required . Some of these businesses will require that premises 
have particular loca tional attributes. In many cases individual businesses 
enjoy the benefits of being located within an area where there are other 
similar businesses. These benefits include the use of specialised facilities, 
being part of a specialised supply chain, benefiti ng from a positive local 
reputation, sharing knowledge and expertise, and the ability to lobby for 
mutual interests.  In addition such clusters support other local businesses 
including a range of service industries (e.g. catering, retail, business 
services such as accountancy) which may develop their own linked 
specialism.  
 
5.9.12  Employment sites require access to the Borough’s main road network, with 
good public transport access and will be compatible with the character and 
amenities of the local area.  
 
5.9.13  To compen sate for the significant loss of jobs in the Borough over the past 
few decades caused by MoD rationalisation it is important that employment 
sites are maintained and developed most effectively, generating significant 
job opportunities. It will therefore be  necessary to encourage medium to 
high density employment uses128 on employment sites rather than low 
employment generating uses such as warehousing, distribution and open 
storage. These low employment generating uses can include high levels of 
automation an d require significant areas of land, thereby reducing 
opportunities to significantly increase employment levels. I t has been found 
that the  warehouse/distribution sector will have only limited potential in 
Gosport as other parts of the sub-region  have better motorway and rail 
access129. Consequently the Borough will have a limited demand for large -
scale strategic warehousing . Instead this sector is likely to occur in 
connection with manufacturing businesses in the Borough or be on a 
smaller scale wi th more intensive employment levels serving a local market.  
Employment Floorspace Targets  (Point  1 of Policy E1 ) 
5.9.14  The Borough Council aims to ensure that 90,000 sq.m.  of net additional 
employment floorspace (E(g), B2 and B8 use classes) is provided in the 
Borough over the period to 203 8. Further details are set out in the 
Development  Strategy Section (Policy D2).  
Proposed Employment Sites  (Point 2 of Policy E1 ) 
Allocations  
 
5.9.15  The allocations contributing to the above  employmen t floorspace  target 
include a num ber of strategic mixed -use sites within Urban Regeneration 
Areas and a number of smaller employment allocations which are shown on 
                                            
128 Medium to high employment densities are considered to be within the range 15 -40sq.m per employee.

253 the Policies Map. New employment opportunities will generally be located 
on brownfield sites  within the urban area.  
 
5.9.16  Daedalus  has been identified as an Enterprise Zone and  is of sub -regional 
significance with a focus on  marine, aviation , aerospace  and other 
advanced manufacturing  clusters.  Gosport Waterfront has the potential for 
marine employment with small -scale  office  and workshop  development  in 
both the Town Centre and Waterfront areas . Royal Hospital Haslar has the 
potential for health related employment  with Blockhouse having assets 
which are appropriate to  the marine sector . In addition smaller employment 
allocatio ns have been identified (see Policy A3) which contribute t o the 
overall proposed quantum.  
 
Employment Priority Site  
 
5.9.17  In November 2016 the Government  announced,  in its document ‘A Better 
Defence Estate’130, that it intended to release the HMS Sultan site in 2026 
with various functions being moved to different locations in Hampshire and 
Scotland. In February 2018 the Government made a further 
announcement131 stating that this release would take place no earlier  than 
2029 and that the updated disposal date  would  follow ‘ detailed work to 
assess the optimum laydown required to support operational capacity .’ 
Given the considerable uncertainty over the release of HMS Sultan and 
therefore the significant doubt over th e deliverability of any of the land for 
employment or indeed other uses during the plan period the Council has 
proposed to maintain the position it held in the Gosport Borough Local Plan 
2011 -2029. Policy SS10  sets out the Council’s position. Consequently much 
of the western  HMS Sultan site has been identified as an employment 
priority site in order to ensure that if the site is released by the MoD it retains 
its role as a major employment site in the Borough.  If in the meantime a firm 
timetable is reached on the release of the HMS Sultan site then this would 
trigger a partial review of the Local Plan.  
 
5.9.18  HMS Sultan employs large numbers of people primarily linked to its role as 
a military  training base.  It employs almost 2,600 people (including 
approximately 1,350 trainees, 450 service personnel and 800 civilians)132. 
The Borough Council strongly supports the retention of this important 
function at Sultan and will encourage opportunities to expand its role. The 
site also accommodates advanced engineering trainin g to private sector 
companies and consequently there may be further opportunities in this 
sector. The Borough Council with support from the Solent Local Enterprise 
Partnership and Hampshire County Council will continue to explore 
opportunities with the Min istry of Defence to intensify civilian employment 
and training opportunities within the site to fully utilise the potential of this 
site. Sultan therefore relates well to the Borough’s existing strengths in 
advanced manufacturing and aerospace clusters. Th e Council and Historic

254 England have also been exploring opportunities with the Base to re -use Fort 
Rowner within the site for hi -tech employment (see Policy SS10 ). 
 
5.9.19  If released it will be imperative that the site is re -used for new employment 
to at least r eplace the lost employment but also take the opportunity to 
increase employment densities. The re -use of the specialist training facilities 
as well as the use of premises for advance manufacturing, marine and 
aviation businesses are considered to be key op portunities. Due to the 
uncertainty it is not appropriate to include the site as part of the current 
employment land supply but ensure that such sites are used for employment 
if released. The Council’s priority would be to continue to argue for its 
retenti on as a MoD centre of excellence for training and seek further 
employment opportunities both military and civilian at this site.  
Employment Assets  (Point 3 of Policy E1 ) 
5.9.20  The Borough Council considers that it is important to protect employment 
assets that have the potential to attract new employment opportunities. 
These sites are set out in the policy with more de tails included in the 
relevant urban regeneration area policies.  In addition there may be other 
employment assets which come to light as part of s ite release s and 
consequently it will be necessary to assess the importance of such an asset 
to maintain or increase employment opportunities on that site.  
 
5.9.21  The importance of waterfront access  sites for economic purposes  has been  
strongly advocated by nume rous sub -regional strategies and evidence 
studies including  the Solent LEP’s Transforming Solent Growth Strategy  
(Solent LEP Jan 2015)133 and the  Marine and Maritime Suppl ement134 
(March 2014) . The Solent  Waterfront Strategy  (SEEDA 2007)  identifies 
significant stretches of Gosport Waterfront as having potential for marine 
businesses. Access to deep water is a particular employment asset in 
Gosport Borough as well as associated marine - and marina -related 
infrastructure.  This includes one o f the largest hydrodynamic facilities in the 
world located at Haslar Marine Technology Park (managed by Qinetiq ). 
Other identified employment assets include access to the runways at 
Daedalus . It is also important to ensure that land is developed effectivel y 
and the  appropriate type of employment -generating opportunities are 
delivered which fully utilise the asset.  The importance of an employment 
asset should not be compromised by an inappropriate use.  
Protecting existing employment s ites (Points 4 and 5 of  Policy E1)  
5.9.22  The Employment Land Availability Assessment (ELAA)  (November 2018) 
assessed the appropriateness of existing employment sites and 
recommendations have been made regarding which sites should be 
protected for employment use. These sites are identif ied on the Policies 
Map. The ELAA will be periodically reviewed to determine if the allocated 
sites are still appropriate.

255  
5.9.23  In September 2020  the Government introduced new Use C lass Orders 
which changed the status of office and light industrial uses  to a n ew C lass E 
(formerly known as B1) allowing existing premises to change to other uses 
including retail, cafes and restaurants, financial services, indoor sports, 
health and medical facilities and crèches  without the need for planning 
permission.  This underm ines the plan -led approach advocated by 
Government as it takes away the ability for the local authority in consultation 
with the community to determine the most appropriate strategy for its area. 
The Government’s approach will affect the Council’s ability to regenerate its 
town centres post -COVID -19 and enable much needed employment 
premises to be converted to uses not appropriate for an industrial site. The 
Government has also introduced other significant changes which enable s 
Class E uses to convert to residential uses without planning permission 
further undermining the Borough’s economic health.  
 
5.9.24  The Council’s approach in the Gosport Borough  Local Plan 2011 -2029  
(adopted 2015)  provided the necessary flexibility but enabled the Council to 
consider what w as most appropriate for each site.  The Council proposes to 
maintain this approach as it remains entirely applicable for B2 and B8 uses.  
It will maintain its approach in relation to office and light industrial uses 
(Class E(g) ) in those instances where plan ning permission is required which 
will include redevelopment proposals rather than a simple change of use. 
Also it is considered appropriate for the Council to future -proof the policy 
wording as the Council st rongly considers that over the p lan period the 
Government may change its position after the implications of the Use Class 
Orders are fully understood.  
 
5.9.25  Consequently the Council considers that employment site s should be 
predominately for E(g) , B2, and B8 uses, however it is accepted that in 
certain inst ances in order to  generate new employment opportunities and  
contribute towards genuine  sustainable communities other economic uses  
(as defined in  Box 1 4) could be accommodated on employment sites.  
 
5.9.26  This approach aims to ensure  that local authorities avoid designating sites 
for single or restricted use classes . In such instances it will be necessary for 
a developer to demonstrate the following criteria are met.  
 
Alternative uses and employment levels:   
 
 When proposing non E(g), B2 or B8 uses the applicant would need 
to demonstrate that the proposal would create at least the same 
number of jobs than the existing prem ises has achieved over the 
past three  years.  This period is considered a reasonable length of 
time within the business cycle to provide a fair u nderstanding of the 
potential levels of employment that can be achieved on the site.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
256 Compatibility:  
 
 When determining the appropriateness of a non E(g), B2 or B8 use 
on a site it will be necessary to ensure the use will not have a 
detrimental environmental impact on neighbouring businesses and 
vice versa.  
 
Alternative sites and meeting relevant tests:  
 
 It will be necessary to consider whether a proposed non E(g), B2 or 
B8 use  can be more suitably located elsewhere in the Borough and 
whether sites or premises are reasonably available. In particular 
town centre uses should meet the tests set out in Policy  C2. 
Similarly other uses such as community facilities should firstly be 
located in existing centres or within neighbourhoods in accordance 
with other policies in the Local Plan. If no such sites are available 
the use may be appropriate on the employment sit e if it is 
compatible with other employment uses on the site and sufficient 
jobs are generated.  
 
5.9.27  The Borough Council will continue to safeguard employment sites and will 
consider a wide range of employment uses. The Borough Council will 
encourage the refu rbishment of existing employment sites in order to meet 
modern business requirements . In some cases the layout and design of 
existing premises may not be suitable for new enterprises  and it may be 
necessary to redevelop all or part of the site for alternat ive employment 
premises.  
 
5.9.28  Residential uses will not  normally  be considered given the Borough’s 
extremely low job density and the demonstrated demand for new 
employment premises in the Borough . However there may be certain 
circumstances where the developmen t of dwellings on part of the site could 
be considered acceptable to the Council. Primarily this is when the 
proposed residential development would enable the refurbishment and/or 
redevelopment of older industrial buildings in order to create new 
employmen t premises. In such cases the applicant would need to 
demonstrate that the new employment site would create at least the same 
number of jobs that the existing premises has achieved over the past three 
years and that it is not viable to redevelop the whole site for employment 
purposes. The applicant would also need to provide evidence regarding 
financial viability and that the proposed level of housing is required to 
refurbish or redevelop the rest of the site. The applicant will also have to 
demonstrate how  the existing premises have been marketed for 
employment uses.  
Diversification of employment premises (Point 6 of Policy E1) 
5.9.29  Increased levels of working from home have the potential to reduce out -
commuting and congestion.  This trend has been exacerbated by  the 
pandemic which has also highlighted the importance of online connectivity DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
257 but also facilities for business people to meet in person to share ideas.  The 
provision of live/work units with local support facilities , known as service 
hubs, which can includ e meeting roo ms/IT suites will therefore be 
supported. However, s uch units will be considered primarily as residential 
units when determining planning applications and therefore all the policies in 
the Local Plan relating to residential development will ap ply. 
 
5.9.30  The pandemic has also accelerated the trend  for online shopping and this 
has led to the closure of high street retailers. This increase in vacant 
floorspace offers an opportunity to repurpose the space for new economic 
activity and employment.  Co-working space and a Skills Hub as part of High 
Street redevelopment plans could transform enterprise development in the 
Borough and will be encouraged.  Proposals will need to accord with other 
policies in the Local Plan including those which require  an active  
commercial frontage facing the main shopping street (see Policy C1).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
258 5.10 POLICY E2: SKILLS  
 
POLICY E2: SKILLS  
 
1. The Borough Council will require employment and training 
measures as part of development proposals on appropriate sites.  
 
2. Existing specialist  training facilities will be protected unless it can 
be demonstrated that there is no longer a requirement for such 
facilities.  
 
3. New training facilities will be permitted provided they accord with 
other policies in the Local Plan.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y E2 
5.10.1  The need to improve the skills of the local population is considered one of 
the most critical issues for the Borough’s economy and its residents, and 
this was recognised by the Solent LEP and the Borough Council even 
before the pandemic.  The need to enhance local skills and provide 
increased training opportunities has intensified due to the economic fall -out 
of the pandemic with whole sectors of business suffering significant losses 
in output and employment.  
 
5.10.2  The Gosport Infrastructure and  Investment Plan (LEP 2019) (GIIP) 
recognised t hat the Boroug h’s uncompetitive resident skills position could 
undermine Gosport’s ability to deliver  transformative economic growth and 
change. It proposes a number of key actions:  
 
 Provision of higher educat ion facility/facilities within the Borough ; 
 Dedicated marine and maritime  skills centre/training academy,  
potentially linked to existing  institutions ; 
 Dedicated hospitality skills  centre/training academy . 
5.10.3  It recognises that there needs to be proactive action to develop resident 
skills in key growth areas for Gosport, enhancing the  Boroug h’s 
competitiveness as a global marine hub  and maritime cluster, and more 
generally as an  attractive and viable place to start and grow a business. 
This is necessary to develop a World Class Centr e of Excellence for sailing 
and yacht technology and engineering . The report recognises the 
opportunities to develop such facilities on key sites in the Borough such as 
at Daedalus, Blockhouse and Sultan . 
 
5.10.4  The Solent LEP’s emerging Solent 2050 Strategy as set out in its progress 
statement135 recognise s that the sub-region  needs to have a sufficiently 
trained workforce to achieve higher levels of productivity. The Gosport 
economy continu es to have a strong defence dependency and related skills 
base with high levels of employment in the high technology manufacturing 
sector. Despite these strengths there are growing concerns over skill 
                                            
135 PUSH Economic Development Strategy (DTZ , October 2010).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
259 shortages with deficiencies in basic skills as well as academic and 
vocational attainment levels. This is underpinned by low participation levels 
in further education, training and lifelong learning opportunities. It is 
recognised that there are numerous barriers for residents to overcome in 
order to gain acce ss to employment opportunities including poor health, low 
skills and family responsibilities. Improving the skills base will help residents 
to retain employment and progress with greater prospects for higher wages.  
Appropriate training and support can ensu re more people can gain 
employment and thereby help i mprove social and economic well being.  
Developing the local skills base is necessary to help attract investment, 
provide new job opportunities and reduce the need to out -commute. The 
alternative of relyin g on workers from outside the Borough will not ease local 
deprivation and represents a missed opportunity to improve skills at the 
same time as regenerating the Borough’s brownfield sites.  
 
5.10.5  There are a range of measures which can enhance access to jobs inc luding: 
training to develop skills and achieve qualifications; lifelong learning; 
apprenticeships; advice to help apply for jobs; guaranteed interviews; 
training/work experience; childcare provision; and transport measures.   
 
5.10.6  There are a number of initiatives at sub -regional and local levels to increase 
the educational attainment and skills in the area and reduce barriers to 
learning and employment. This includes measures to improve local access 
to training. The Borough Council recognises that there  are a number of 
agencies working in partnership to increase skill levels and reduce barriers 
to work and it will continue to  work with these organisations.  
 
5.10.7  The Borough Council recognises that initiatives will need to:  
 
 Meet the anticipated growth in dema nd for workers with qualifications 
of NVQ Level 2 and above136; 
 Reduce the number of young people not in education, employment or 
training (NEETs);  
 Deliver inclusive learning opportunities in community and workplace 
settings, targeting those with no qualifications or NVQ Level 2 and 
below;  
 Address skill shortages in priority sectors (e.g. marine); and  
 Assist in retaining people in employment and encourage progression.  
 
5.10.8  There are a range of organisations which will have a role in delivering 
education a nd training initiatives including: Hampshire County Council, as 
the local education authority; local secondary schools and colleges which 
deliver a variety of academic and vocational training services including the 
Centre of Excellence for Engineering, Man ufacturing and Advanced Skills 
Technology (CEMAST) College at Daedalus; the Gosport Discovery Centre; 
the Employment Access Centre137; the significant training and education 
role undertaken by MoD establishments  particularly at HMS Sultan ; as well

137 Which is a joint initiative between the Wheatsheaf Tru st and Gosport  Borough Council.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
260 as a range  of private training providers across a number of industries.  
Gosport is also a nationally important centre for sail training including:  
Clipper Round the World Sailing (based at Gosport Marina) ; Joint Services 
Adventurous Sail Training Centre (JSASTC) at Fort Blockhouse;  Sea 
Cadets; The Association of Sail Training Organisation; and numerous clubs, 
charities and companies offering sail training and other watersport training.  
Securing training opportunities as part of new development  (Point 1 of 
Policy E2 ) 
5.10.9  Where appropriate the Borough will negotiate with a developer to secure 
training opportunities as part of the development of a site. The Borough 
Council has produced its own practice guide outlining the process for 
securing training and employment in relat ion to major development which 
relate to local priorities138. Key measures the Borough Council will seek to 
secure where appropriate include:  
 
 Work placement ( 14-16 yrs & 
16-19 yrs)   Curriculum support activities  
 Career advice   Pre-employment training  
 Work  trials and Interview 
guarantees  
 Vocational training  
 Leadership and management 
training  
 Support with transport, 
childcare and work -equipment  
 Financial contributions 
towards relevant training 
schemes within the area   Apprenticeships  
 Supervisor training  
 Health and safety  
 Construction skills certificate 
scheme  
 
5.10.10  This policy applies to major employment generating developments including 
retail, leisure and office development greater than 1,000 sq. m; industrial 
development greater than 2,000 sq. m; warehouse  development greater 
than 4,000 sq. m (all figures gross); and any other development likely to 
generate 50 full time equivalent jobs or more. The policy will also apply to 
construction jobs related to residential schemes of 40 or more dwellings139. 
 
5.10.11  Measures  will be negotiated so they are  appropriate to the specific 
development and secured by a legal agreement in the form of a training and 
employment plan.  It is envisaged that for most commercial developments 
the Borough Council will seek to secure ‘in -kind’ measures rather than 
financial contributions, which will only be sought where it is not possible to 
secure ‘in -kind’ measures.  
 
5.10.12  For residential developments of 40 or  more dwellings  the Borough Council 
will seek to secure training measures relating to the construction industry. In 
some cases it may be appropriate to secure a financial contribution towards 
                                            
138 See GBC practice guidance:  www.gosport.gov.uk/article/1220/Pre -application -advice    
139 See GBC practice guidance for further explanation of how these threshold s were derived.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
261 training schemes in the area which in principle could be accessed by 
residents of the new housing  development . 
Existing and new premises for training purp oses (Points 2 and 3 of 
Policy E2 ) 
5.10.13  It is important for the Borough Council to facilitate the creation of improved 
and new facilities to enable training and learning. This can be achieved by 
ensuring that sufficient land is made available in accessible loca tions.  
 
5.10.14  The Borough has a strong tradition for training the British A rmed Forces 
which is still the primary function of HMS Sultan and creates a significant 
number of jobs in its own right. However the contraction of the MoD 
presence in the Borough and unc ertainties regarding the future training 
function at the base could potentially reduce this role. It is important that 
significant training assets including specialist facilities such as the Diving 
Tank at Blockhouse and specialist engineering facilities a t HMS Sultan are 
retained unless it can be demonstrated that they are no longer required by 
alternative training providers.   
 
5.10.15  It is considered that if, or when, these sites are released by the MoD it will 
be important to assess whether any of the specialist training facilities and 
support facilities (for example classrooms, catering and accommodation) 
could be utilised by other organisations for training purposes. It will also be 
appropriate to safeguard other premises used for training in the Boro ugh 
which are not related to military use. There may be scope on certain sites 
for new facilities to be built to meet modern training requirements for other 
sectors.  
 
5.10.16  The Daedalus site, in addition to the CEMAST College, has the potential to 
include traini ng facilities to support local clusters. The provision of skills and 
training facilities at Royal Hospital Haslar, particularly for medical and care 
sectors will be supported as well as any high -tech training in connection with 
uses at the Haslar Marine Te chnology Park.  
 
5.10.17  Similarly it is important to recognise the importance of the contribution of sail 
training to the local economy and therefore important to protect key features 
of this sector . Gosport’s existing sail training offer also has significant 
potential to expand (for instance on key sites such as Blockhouse, Royal 
Clarence Yard Retained A rea, Haslar Gunboat Sheds) and attract further 
investment into the Borough by companies and visitors.   
 
5.10.18  Any additional training sites will be permitted provided they accord with the 
other Local Plan policies.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
262 5.11 POLICY E3: TOURISM  
 
POLICY E3: TOURISM  
 
1. Proposals that develop the tourism sector will be supported in the 
Borough as they can assist in diversifying the local economy, 
creating additional jobs and providing  a wider range of recreational 
activities.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for appropriate tourism and 
visitor economy proposals in the following locations:  
 
a) within the r egeneration areas including the Strategic 
Development Sites in accordance with Policies SS1 -SS11; 
b) within other sites allocated for leisure uses including the 
Gosport Leisure Park in accordance with Policy A3; 
c) appropriate proposals to improve and complement existing 
tourism and visitor attractions and facilities in accordance with 
other policies in the Local Plan . 
 
Outside of these areas proposals will need to accord with the 
sequential test as outlined in the National Planning Policy 
Framework.  
 
3. Planning permission will not be granted for proposals which will 
result in the loss of exi sting tourism accommodation with 6 or more 
tourist bedrooms unless it can be demonstrated that the use is no 
longer viable in this location and that there have been reasonable 
attempts to let/sell the property for tourism accommodation.  
 
EXPLANATION OF PO LICY E3  
5.11.1  The tourism industry in Gosport Borough is a significant economic sector, 
with over 1.4 million visitors a year in 2018 contributing £85.5 million to the 
local economy and sustaining over 1,762 jobs (Tourism South East 2018). 
However visitors staying overnight make -up only a small proportion of these 
visits (8.5%) and expenditure (26%) and therefore there is considerable 
scope for this element of the market to expand and bring greater economic 
benefits. 74% of the visits were a  leisure/holiday trip, 13% visiting friends 
and relatives, 9% a sailing trip, 3% attending an event and 1% a 
pub/restaurant trip.  
 
5.11.2  It is considered that there is significant potential for more weekend tourism 
as hotel occupancy rates are significantly weaker than mid -week. The 
Borough itself has sufficient attractions to encourage over -night stays and 
serve as a base to explore the Portsmouth Harbour area, particularly those 
with an interest in the rich maritime heritage or those who enjoy marine 
activi ties (sailing and other water sports).  A 2018 survey of visitors identified 
the beaches at Lee -on-the-Solent and Stokes Bay  as the most popular DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
263 planned activity being undertaken by visitors to the Borough (48% of the 
survey) followed by a visit to the Subm arine Museum (32%) or the Explosion 
Museum (23%)  (Tourism South East (TSE) , 2018).  
 
5.11.3  The importance of the tourism and visitor economy for Gosport Borough and 
the significant opportunities to enhance the availability of facilities to grow 
this sector are c learly identified by a number of reports including:  
 
 The Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan (GIIP) produced for the 
Solent LEP (February 2019);  
 Gosport, Retail, Leisure and Tourism Study (Lambert Smith Hampton 
for Gosport Borough Council); and  
 The Council’s own Economic Development Strategy (January 2021) . 
 
5.11.4  These reports highlights the strengths of the Borough’s harbourside and 
Solent frontage location including; a high density of naval and maritime 
historic assets including a number of museums; the  excellent opportunities 
for water sports including marina provision and numerous sail training 
venues; and the beaches at Lee -on-the-Solent and Stokes Bay.  
Deve lopment of the tourism sector (Point 1 of Policy E3 ) 
5.11.5  Tourism opportunities as referred to in th e policy can include:  
 
 Hotel  and other visitor accommodation;  
 Marina  and marine related activities for visitors;  
 Heritage  related activities;  
 Bars, restaurants , cafes;  
 Parks, viewpoints, walkways;  
 Indoor and outdoor recreational , and cultural activities;  and 
 Uses  that support the tourism sector . 
 
5.11.6  Tourism plays an important role in providing employment and contributing to 
the local economy. It is clear that Gosport has significant potential to further 
develop its tourism sector taking advantage of its  coasta l location. Future 
development  should complement the significant heritage attractions in 
Portsmouth, particularly the Historic Dockyard , as well as sites such as the 
Spinnaker Tower and Gunwharf Quays . This will include working with 
partners on a cross -harbour basis.  
 
5.11.7  The Council will encourage the upgrading of tourism facilities in ways that 
promote higher value activity, reduce seasonality and support urban 
regeneration. This includes  additional leisure uses  in the Borough  and an 
enhanced Town C entre with a quality evening economy.  There is 
recognition that there is a need to better utilise existing facilities and to 
improve the offer of tourism accommodation, food and beverage 
opportunities and other tourism facilities and infrastructure.  The 
regeneration  of a number of significant brownfield sites such as Daedalus 
and Blockhouse offer new opportunities to develop the tourism sector and 
this potential is set out specifically in the  urban  regeneration areas policies DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
264 (see Policies D3 and SS1 -11). The Council  is currently developing a 
Tourism Development Strategy which will consider in more detail 
opportunities to deliver these necessary improvements.  The Local Plan will 
help facilitate these objectives.  
 
5.11.8  Particular improvements identified by the evidence base  include:  
 
 Additional tourism accommodation includ ing budget and mid -range 
hotels;  
 Provision of a gateway visitor centre with exhibition space close to 
the Gosport ferry to provide a focus for tourists including a narrative 
of the Gosport story and  signpost to other attractions;  
 Improved public transport and active travel linkages between sites 
which are relatively dispersed;  
 Improved evening economy with opportunities for food and beverage , 
cultural activities and other activities to increase dwell  time a nd 
increase visitor expenditure;  
 Potential to explore niche leisure/tourism opportunities such as 
outdoor adventure and family orientated attractions in addition to 
those relating to specia list naval and maritime history;  
 Physical improvements to th e public realm to enhance the 
appearance of locations adjacent to visitor facilities and between 
them as well as improved way -marking and the development of 
themed trails;  and 
 Improve d physical and commercial connections between the marinas 
and adjacent ar eas. 
 
5.11.9  Since the Gosport Borough Local Plan 2011 -2029 was adopted  in 2015 
there have been two hotel developments in the Borough ( at Gosport Leisure 
Park and Gosport Town Centre). This has significantly increased hotel 
provision in the Borough. However the e vidence base recognises the 
potential for  additional bed space within  the urban regeneration areas  to 
make use of waterside locations and various historic assets.  New hotels 
together with the existing accommodation are considered critical for 
developing th e local tourism industry and bringing additional multiplier 
effects into the wider economy.  
 
5.11.10  As outlined above the evidence studies recognise a number of other 
improvements to improve the tourism offer for visitors.  The Council will work 
with partners to help facilitate these improvements. The Borough -wide 
Heritage Action Zone and the High Street Heritage Acton Zone  include  
proposals which will assist with feasibility studies and deliver improvements 
to the public rea lm and enhance visitor facilities.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
265 Location  of tourism  and visitor economy opportunities (Point 2  of 
Policy E3 ) 
5.11.11  Brownfield sites adjacent  the Solent and Portsmouth Harbour will be a key 
focus for the development of tourism  and visitor economy opportunitie s. A 
number of coastal opportunities have been identified running along the 
coast  from Priddy’s Hard to Daedalus:  
 
 Priddy’s Hard – Coastal Forces Museum adjacent the existing 
Explosion Museum with the development of complementary visitor 
attractions includ ing food and beverage offer (see Policy SS2 ). 
 Royal Clarence Yard  – use of current empty units for  food and 
beverage and other visitor facilities to complement the Marina as well 
as the potential to re -use the Rum Store at the adjacent Victoria 
Quays site (formerly referred to as the north part of Royal Clarence 
Yard  - Retai ned Area)  (see Policy SS2). 
 The Bus Station site offers opportunities to incorporate a high quality  
heritage/visitor centre with café/exhibition space which can sign post 
to other attrac tions in the Borough.  The development will offer a 
choice of waterfront food and beverage units to retain expenditure on 
the Gosport side of the harbour  (see Policy SS2). 
 The opportunities to highlight the Camper and Nicholson story and its 
global signific ance for racing and leisure sailing in the Gosport 
Marina/Falklands Gardens area.  
 The use of vacant units in the Gosport High Street for exhibition 
space and encourage a greater diversification of uses as well as 
improvements to the cultural offer associat ed with the Old Grammar 
School  (see Policy SS3) . 
 The regeneration of Blockhouse utilising the on -site presence of the 
Submarine Museum, the SETT Tower, and other significant heritage 
assets including opportunities for tourist accommodation and 
associated f acilities within the Fort area overlooking the Harbour and 
the Solent.  There are also opportunities to increase sail training 
opportunities and associated overnight stay facilities  at Blockhouse 
(see Policy SS4 and SS5) . 
 The potential for public access and  interpretation of the Grade I 
Listed Haslar Gunboat Sheds  (see Policy SS4) . 
 Public access to the listed park and gardens and Solent frontage at 
Royal Haslar Hospital together with a café and the interpretation of 
historic features as part of the consented  scheme at the site  (see 
Policy SS6) . 
 The potential to develop appropriate tourism accommodation and 
leisure activities at the Browndown Camp site  (see Policy A4) . 
 Major regeneration at the Daedalus site including the potential for 
hotel and associated facilities at the Wardroom and adjacent 
buildings (if required) and the development of Seaplane Square to be 
a leisure -led site utilising the seaplane hangars for a potential mix of 
food and beverage, indoor leisure and museum/heritage uses with 
outside ev ent space to complement the significant visitor assets at 
Lee-on-the-Solent  (see Policy SS11) .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
266 5.11.12  Other general coastal opportunities include:  
 
 Encouraging greater public accessibility to the marinas and the 
associated facilities;  
 The development of heritage and waterside trails with appropriate 
interpretation (Gosport Lines Walk and Creekside Walk) and continue 
to take opportunities to improve coastal access in the Borough 
(Policy SS3); 
 Improved public transport and active travel o pportunities between the 
coastal sites linking Priddy’s Hard, Royal Clarence Yard, the Town 
Centre/Waterfront, the Haslar Penin sula, Stokes Bay and Lee -on-the-
Solent.  
 
5.11.13  Inland there are also a number of opportunities including : 
 
 Greater utilisation of the F ort Brockhurst site as a visitor attraction, 
event space and po tentially visitor accommodation;  
 Continued enhancements in the Alver Valley Country Park as 
identified in the Alv er Valley Country Park Strategy;  
 Further leisure facility improvements at the Go sport Leisure Park.  
 
5.11.14  These sites outlined in the above paragraphs have attributes that offer the 
potential to develop a range of facilities that will enhance the tourism sector. 
Whilst some of these sites are town centre or edge of centre sites it is 
ackno wledged that certain proposed sites are further from the Town Centre. 
However these are considered acceptable locations for hotel and other 
tourism proposals in order to make good use of the tourism assets of the 
immediate locality such as the waterfront a nd historic setting or add to the 
overall viability of a mixed -use development.  
 
5.11.15  Additional proposals  on sites outside these areas  for hotel and other tourism 
uses will need to accord with the latest Government guidance ensuring that 
the sequential test fo r site selection has been followed.  
Safeguarding existing tourism accommodation  (Point 3  of Policy E3)   
5.11.16  There is currently relatively limited tourist accommodation in the Borough 
and consequently the loss of just one hotel for redevelopment would 
represent  a loss of a large proportion of its tourist bedspaces. Consequently 
the Borough Council will protect existing hotels and other tourist 
accommodation of six tourist rooms or more from redevelopment to other 
uses. This threshold enables the Borough to restrict the loss of  larger tourist 
establishments but enables flexibility for small -scale  providers to move in 
and out of the market including those wishing to use their dwelling for such 
purposes.   
 
5.11.17  Experience140 elsewhere has shown that operators may deliberat ely over -
price accommodation; undertake insufficient marketing, or allow a facility to

267 become run  down as a pre -cursor to applications for redevelopment, using 
arguments such as ‘poor performance’  and ‘lack of demand’. Consequently 
any proposals that would  result in the loss of tourist accommodation would 
need to be accompanied with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there 
is no demand for the accommodation. These measures would apply to 
hotels, bed and breakfasts, tourist and static caravan and campin g facilities. 
As a guide the following information will be sought where applicable:  
 
 A marketing report covering at least 6 months to show that the 
property was marketed at a competitive and realistic price and 
through appropriate media and mainstream tourism publications; and  
 Evidence of a clear and demonstrable lack of demand based on 
evidence of the preceding three years occupancy rates where 
applicable as well as any other relevant factors such as previous 
marketing or business plan.  
 
5.11.18  Whilst six months is considered a reasonable length of time to market a 
property it is acknowledged that in some cases it may be more appropriate 
to consider a longer marketing period particularly if it is a large premises or 
site. There may also be circumstances whe re a shorter marketing period 
may be acceptable. Further advice should be sought from the Borough 
Council on this matter.  
 
5.11.19  Whilst a number of tourism accommodation sites are shown on the Policies 
Map, it is important to note that this Policy also applies t o smaller sites not 
shown on the Policies Map as well as other accommodation sites which are 
not shown such as those that have been developed since the Local Plan 
has been adopted.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

POLICY E4: MARINAS A ND MOORINGS  
 
1. Planning  permission will be granted for new marinas and the 
extension of marinas and mooring areas provided that the 
development:  
 
a) does not harm important features of internationally and 
nationally important habitats;  
b) is acceptable to the Queen’s Harbour Master in  that it does not 
have a detrimental impact on the movement of marine traffic in 
the Harbour and surrounding waters;  
c) is supported by adequate on -shore facilities;  
d) does not harm the distinctive landscape  and heritage assets of 
the coastline;  
e) incorporates d esigns that are appropriate to existing and 
proposed sea defences; and  
f) does not constrain further development of the waterfront or 
access to other sites with the potential for development.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y E4  
5.12.1  The Solent is an internationally -renowned area for sailing  and Gosport’s 
proximity to it via the mouth of Portsmouth Harbour makes  it an attractive 
area for marinas and related industries. Its marina assets have the capacity 
to host large sailing vessels and such facilitie s enable it to host and service 
major  international sailing events. F or example , Gosport is the base for the 
Clipper Round the World Race.  Linked to many of these facilities are the 
significant sail training opportunities that already exist and have the po tential 
to expand both in terms of capacity and the type of facilities and 
experiences that can be offered.  
 
5.12.2  The Borough Council recognises the importance of marinas for the local 
economy which supports a wider sailing community and supply chain and 
can bring visitors to the Borough. The Borough currently has three marinas 
(Gosport, Haslar and Royal Clarence) as well as a number of sizeable areas 
of moorings including those linked to the Ministry of Defence. The Council’s 
Economic Development Strategy rec ognises that  the marinas could provide 
growth opportunities; most likely through mixed -use schemes that broaden 
site uses and increase values.  
 
5.12.3  The Solent LEP’s Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies that 
Gosport’s strengths in this sector leave  it well placed to develop into a global  
hub for marine and maritime industries. It states that , ‘through its extensive 
existing marinas, the Borough has a ‘built -in’ world class advantage in 
marina infrastructure, coupled with the prospect of additional w aterside 
development sites becoming available for redevelopment and regeneration 
over the coming years .’ The sector is also supported by business DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
269 representative organisations  such as Portsmouth Harbour  Marine141 which 
aims to raise the profile of Gosport as a yachting centre.  
 
5.12.4  Whilst recognising the importance of the existing network of marinas and 
mooring areas it will be important to ensure proposals for new marinas or 
extensions to marinas and moorings meet the criteria set out in Policy E4 
and detailed be low. Subject to all the criteria of the policy it is recognised 
that the redevelopment of the Blockhouse site could offer new opportunities 
and it is recognised that there is the potential for ‘short -stay’ moorings in the 
area between the Gosport Ferry Pon toon and the pier adjacent  to Haslar 
Marina, as identified in the Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD.  
Nature conservation (Point 1a  of Policy E4 ) 
5.12.5  The detailed considerations in relation to this issue are set out in Policy  D5 
and other relevant nature c onservation policies.  
Marine Traffic considerations (Point 1b  of Policy E4 ) 
5.12.6  The Queen’s Harbour Master (QHM) advises that due to capacity limits of 
the small boat channel and issues of harbour mouth congestion it is 
necessary to restrict the number of tota l moorings in Portsmouth Harbour. It 
is estimated that there are currently approximately 3,800 berths.  The QHM 
has set a limit of 5,000 berths maximum. The trend for larger boats has over 
time reduced the number of available berths in the Harbour and 
conse quently there is some scope for the minor extension of existing 
marinas.  
On-shore facilities (Point 1c  of Policy E4)  
5.12.7  Planning applications should set out what facilities are required to support 
any marina or moorings. Such facilities could include the  provision of 
additional on -shore facilities such as long-term car parking, a boat 
compound for winter lay -up and storage of trailers. It may also be 
appropriate for the  development of associated uses such as a chandlery, 
administrative facility, and leisu re uses such as cafés and restaurants.  
Landscap e and townscape issues (Point 1d  of Policy E4)  
5.12.8  Proposals will need to ensure that the quality of local landscape and 
townscape including heritage assets are not unduly harmed and that 
important landward and s eaward views are protected as much as possible 
(see Policy D 9 and D10 ). 
Flood defence issues (Point 1e  of Policy E4)  
5.12.9  It is important that any proposals do not compromise the integrity and 
continuity of the sea walls and consequently it will be necessary to  consult 
with the Environment Agency and the Coastal Partners. Consideration will

270 need to be given to Government advice in the NPPF and reflected in Policy 
D7. 
Safeguarding development opportunities and access to sites (Point 1f  
of Policy E4)  
5.12.10  Proposals for  new or extended marinas should not have a detrimental 
impact on the potential to develop other sites in the vicinity nor restrict 
access to sites with the potential for development. This could include for 
example , reducing the width of a channel making it  difficult for boats using 
other existing or potential future development sites to pass.  
 
 
5.13 POLICY E5: INFORMATI ON AND COMMUNICATION  TECHNOLOGY  
 
POLICY E5: INFORMATION AND COMM UNICATION TECHNOLOGY  
 
1. The Borough Council will work with relevant partners to support 
advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
including positively promoting the development of ICT embedded 
sites and premises.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for telecommunication 
installations and equipment provided that:  
 
a) the feasibility of sharing an existing mast or erecting antennae 
on an existing building or other structure has been investigated 
and demonstrated to be unsuitable;  
b) they do not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the 
character of  the area or the appearance of any building;  
c) the proposal does not harm important nature conservation 
interests;  
d) all reasonable measures have been taken in respect of siting, 
design and landscaping to minimise the impact of the 
development;  
e) they do not cause significant a nd irremediable interference with  
other electrical equipment, air traffic services, broadcast or 
telecommunication services, or instrumentation operated in the 
national interest.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y E5  
Promoting new ICT technology ( Point  1 of Policy E5 ) 
5.13.1  Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) includes high speed 
broadband, 3rd, 4th and 5th generation telecommunication technology (often 
referred to as 3G 4G, 5G) and full -fibre for laptops, wireless modems, smart 
phones and other mobile devices.  It is a constantly advancing area of 
technology which often requires rapid changes in infrastructure. The 
implications of the pandemic and the requirements for working from home DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
271 and organisations having to conduct a greater proportion of their business 
online have highlighted the importance of fast and reliable broadband and 
telecommunications.  
 
5.13.2  ICT is commonly recognised as the most significant driver of economic, 
social and cultural change in the past 25 years and in an increasingly 
globalised society th is trend is set to continue, if not accelerate. Such 
technology can help deliver a number of benefits including:  
 
 Enabling areas which may have disincentives for businesses (e.g. 
limited transport infrastructure) to operate more competitively;  
 Enabling bus iness to operate competitively in global, national and 
local markets;  
 Providing greater opportunities for home working and thereby 
reducing commuting;  
 Providing opportunities to develop local ICT expertise and attract new 
businesses as part of emerging clu sters (e.g. knowledge based and 
creative industries) as well as enhancing existing ones such as 
advanced manufacturing;  
 Enabling new and efficient ways to deliver  a range of services 
including those provided by public and voluntary agencies (for 
example he alth, education, transport and energy management, 
community information) which can have benefits to local business.  
 
5.13.3  The Solent LEP ’s Gosport Infrastructure Investment Plan recognises the 
importance of this technology for the future economy in Gosport and states 
that the roll -out of 5G technology and ultrafast broadband  connectivity 
(100Mbps +) is a high priority. It adds that p roviding fast and reliable digital  
connectivity to reinforce Gosport’s  attractiveness as a business location,  
particularly within kn owledge and service  based sectors where growth is 
required to  diversify Gosport’s existing business base  is critical . Both the 
LEP and the Council’s Economic Development Strategy (January 2021) 
recognise the need to develop a full -fibre strategy to better connect our 
coastal communities.  
 
5.13.4  It is therefore essential for existing and new businesses in Gosport to have 
access to the latest technologies in order to create new wealth, skill and 
employment. Consequently the Borough Council will work with service 
providers and other partners to facilitate the provision of technology within 
the Borough including within the urban regeneration areas. Sites at 
Daedalus, the Haslar Peninsula and Sultan will be a particular focu s in order 
to stimulate hi -tech businesses and training opportunities.  
Telecomm unication masts ( Point  2 of Policy E5 ) 
5.13.5  It is important the Borough has sufficient coverage of telecommunication 
masts and associated infrastructure to enable this technology to operate 
effectively. At the same time it will be necessary to ensure that such 
infrastructure does not detract from the quality of the local environment.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
272 5.13.6  The latest Government guidanc e contained in the NPPF  states planning  
policies and decisions should su pport the expansion of electronic 
communications networks, including next generation mobile t echnology 
(such as 5G) and full -fibre broadband connections.  
 
5.13.7  The number of radio and electronic communications masts, and the sites for 
such installations, should  be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of 
consumers, the efficient operation of the network and providing reasonable 
capacity for future expansion. Use of existing masts, buildings and other 
structures for new electronic communications capability (including wireless) 
should be encouraged.  
 
5.13.8  Consequently there is a need to use existing masts and structures unless 
the need for a new site has been justified. Where a new mast is proposed 
developers will be required to provide evidence that the applicant  has 
explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or 
other structure. Applicants will also be required to provide a statement that 
self-certifies that, when operational, guidelines produced by the International 
Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) will be met.  
 
5.13.9  Where new sites are required (such as for new 5G networks or for 
connected transport and smart city applications), equipment should be 
sympathetically designed and camouflaged.  The height of the prop osed 
mast/antenna, the nature of ancillary equipment and the scope of 
landscaping and screening will be considered. Proposals must have regard 
to areas of landscape prominence and environmentally sensitive areas, 
such as the Strategic Gap, conservation areas, the coast and harbour and 
areas of nature conservation value. All telecommunications development is 
subject to the normal statutory procedures in so far as Listed Build ing 
Consent is concerned. In addition to planning considerations, all mast 
proposals  must comply with the prevailing technical and industry standards. 
Where appropriate, provision is also to be made for the reinstatement of the 
site after it is no longer required for telecommunication purposes.  
 
5.13.10  Planning applications for telecommunication s development (including 
applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development 
Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the 
proposed development as outlined in the above policy. This should be 
supported by the outco me of consultations with organisations with an 
interest in the proposed development, in particular with the relevant body 
where a mast is to be installed near a school or college or within a statutory 
safeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome or technical  site (see Policy 
LE12). DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
273 5.14 DESIGN  
Introduction  
5.14.1  With the publication of the National Design Guide in 2019, there is an 
increasing emphasis on higher design quality from development . The 
achievement of high quality  design is integral to delivering many of the 
Council's obje ctives including creating well-designed  places, tackling climate  
change , and improving  health and wellbeing.  
 
5.14.2  Gosport already has a rich d esign heritage, as demonstrated through its 
many historic  assets, inc luding the  conservation areas and  Areas of Special 
Character. Through Policy DE 4 the townscape qualities of the Areas of 
Special Character at Marine Parade an d Lee West  will be protected and 
enhanced . The policy also makes provision for the designation of additional 
Areas of Special Character over the plan period , should they be considered 
necessary . 
 
5.14.3  It is important to ensure that not just existing high quality  places are  
protected, but that design quality  is embedd ed within all new developments. 
Policy DE1 seeks to ensure that all new deve lopments achieve high 
standards in terms of sustainable design and constructi on. Not only will this 
help the Borough meet  local and national carbon reduction and biodiversity 
gain targets, but it will ensure t hat buildi ngs have lower running costs, are 
built to last, and can adapt to changing needs; benefiting future occupiers.  
 
5.14.4  The application of quality design  will be particularly important on la rge 
development sites such as  the Borough ’s urban regeneration areas, wher e 
opportunities exist to deliver whole communities of well -designed buildings , 
homes  and spaces. The need for exemplary design standards in urban 
regeneration areas therefore form s part of Policy D3.  
 
5.14.5  The COVID -19 pandemic h as shown more than ever the need  for quality 
living spaces; with adequately sized roo ms and outdoor amenity areas. 
Policy DE2 will ensure that new homes provide a high quality  living 
environment, for both their occupiers and neighbours.  
 
5.14.6  To deliver climate and health outcomes, sites wil l also be expected to 
prioritise access for walking, cycling and public transport. Pro vision for 
suitable levels of parking,  including for bicycles and electric vehic les, is 
another area where Policy DE 3 helps to deliver quality design.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
274 BOX 17: Summary of key design  issues  
 
 The Borough has a strong design legacy which needs to be protected 
and enhanced.  
 High quality  design is integral to achieving many Council objectives 
including carbon reduction, heritage protection and improved health and 
wellbeing . 
 Exemplary design standards are expected within the Borough’s urban 
regeneration areas.  
 Sustainable design and construction can help deliver local and national 
commitments to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.  
 The COVID -19 pandemic has shown the need for homes to include high 
quality  living spaces  and outdoor amenity space . 
 
 
 
5.15 POLICY DE1: SUSTAINA BLE CONSTRUCTION  
 
POLICY DE 1: SUSTAINABLE CONST RUCTION  
 
1. The design, construction and lifecycle of all development must 
contribute to the preservation of resources and the mitigation of, 
and adaption to, climate change. This includes, but is not limited 
to, improving energy performance, minimising material use and 
reducing water use. The use of recognis ed assessment tools or 
aiming for quality  / exemplar standards is expected wherever 
possible.  
 
2. To achieve this all residential development should aim to: 
 
a) Incorporate Passivhaus principles, or equivalent,  to maximise 
the use of insulation, natural sunlight , solar gain and cooling, 
and natural ventilation;  
b) Achieve a reduction in carbon emissions of at least 19% 
compared to the Target Emission Rate of Part L of the Building 
Regulations;  
c) Achieve a water efficiency standard of at least 100 litres per 
person per  day; and  
d) Be assessed under the H ome Quality Mark, or equivalent.  
 
3. Planning permission will be granted for non -residential and multi -
residential developments over 500 sq.m.  that achieve a BREEAM 
standard of at least ‘Very Good’, or equivalent. If the required 
BREEAM rating is considered to be financially unviable or 
technically unfeasible, this will need to be demonstrated with 
appropriate evidence in support of a planning application. In this 
instance, the applicant will be expected to meet the  highest 
BREEAM score that is viable. An alternative certification process 
may also be acceptable, where it can be shown to be DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
275 approximately equivalent in outcomes.  
 
4. Developments that fail to adequately incorporate the principles of 
sustainable constructio n will be refused permission.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y DE1  
Overall approach  (Point 1 of P olicy DE1)  
5.15.1  The application of sustainable construction methods should be a holistic 
approach that considers all aspects of a building’s design, construction and 
lifespan and takes advantage of opportunities to reduce environmental 
impacts. As a starting position this should include a consideration of whether 
the development can be incorporated into an existing structure through 
refurbishment, redu cing the need for construction waste. Flexibility should 
be designed into all proposals, allowing buildings to adapt to changing 
needs.  
 
5.15.2  Proposals will need to demonstrate how they have sought to improve a 
building’s energy performance, such as through max imising the use of 
natural light, heat and ventilation, integrating high quality  insulation  and 
providing on -site renewables generation, where appropriate. The energy 
hierarchy should be applied to all developments, starting with:  
 
1. Reducing the need for en ergy;  
2. Maximising energy efficiency;  
3. Maximising the potential for energy supply from decentralised, low 
carbon and renewable energy sources, including community -led 
initiatives;  
4. Efficient use of fossil fuels from clean technologies.  
 
5.15.3  Reducing resource use, especially those from non -renewable sources, will 
be another key consideration. Materials should be sought which are robust, 
recycled or recyclable and can be easily maintained. The BRE ‘Green 
Guide’ provides further guidance on selecting sustainable const ruction 
materials142. Most forms of developments are required to prepare Site 
Waste Management Plans  (SWMP)  to ensure construction waste is reduced  
and these can be enforced through suitable planning conditions.  
 
5.15.4  As described belo w, the Council expects devel opments to use recognised 
assessment tools  such as  Passivhaus, Homes Quality Mark  or BREEAM to 
demonstrate a proposal’s application of sustainable construction principles. 
Alternative or equivalent assessment tools may also be supported, however 
developers  are recommended to consult the Council’s Planning Policy 
section as soon as possible on the acceptability of this approach.  
 
                                            
142 www.bregroup.com/greenguide/podpage.jsp?id=2126   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
276 5.15.5  The standards in the policy should be considered to be a minimum 
requirement, with proposals that achieve higher standards being considered 
favourably. Planning conditions and/or obligations will be used to secure the 
standard and performance ratings as appropriate. Where the application of 
a standard isn’t financially viable or technically unfeasible, this will need to 
be demonstrated with appropriate evidence as part of a submission, and a 
lower or alternate standard may be agreed.  
Incorporating Passivhaus principles (Point 2a of Policy DE1)  
5.15.6  Passivhaus is an internationally r ecognised standard for constructing high -
efficiency, low -energy buildings. This is achieved through utilising high-
performance  insulation and windows, having no  air leakages or thermal 
bridges, and orientating buildings to maximise the use of natural dayli ght 
and natural ventilation systems , while allowing for summer shade. This is 
often supplemented with mechanical ventilation with heat recovery143. 
 
5.15.7  The design and orientation of a building can increase the comfort of future 
occupiers a nd significantly reduc e heating and cooling bills. New 
developments should aim to incorporate the following Passivhaus 
principles144 into their designs, with proposals that achieve the Passivhaus 
Standard (see Box 1 8) being considered favourably:  
 
 accurate design modelling using the Passive House Planning 
Package (PHPP) ; 
 very high levels of insulation ; 
 extremely high -performance windows with insulated frames ; 
 airtight building fabric ; 
 'thermal bridge free' construction ; 
 a mechanical ventilation system with highly efficient heat recovery . 
Reduct ion in carbon emissions (Point 2b of Policy DE1 ) 
5.15.8  Under the Deregulation Bill 2015 local authorities can continue to require 
new homes to achieve a carbon emission reduction of at least 19% in the 
expected Dwelling Emission Rate (DER) when c ompared to the Target 
Emission Rate (TER) of Part L of the Building Regulations145. This is 
equivalent to the energy requirements of Level 4  of the former Code for 
Sustainable Homes. As part of the Council’s commitment to achieving 
carbon reductions across t he Borough, all new homes are required to 
achieve this target. It is expected that this will be met predominantly through 
increasing the energy efficiency of a building’s fabric and therefore can be 
achieved through applying Passivhaus principles.  
 
5.15.9  Well-insulated buildings will help meet the Government’s aspirations of all 
homes having an Energy Performance Certificate of at least C standard by

145 www.gov.uk/government/speeches/planning -update -march -2015   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
277 2035146. It is important that insulation is installed appropriately as there is  
the risk of overheating , which is a partic ular concern for older persons and 
can have a negative impact upon productivity levels . This could require 
costly and carbon -intensive retrofits such as the installation of air -
conditioning units so should be avoided.  The Chartered Institution of 
Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) provides guidance on how to assess 
the risk of overheating  in a development , as well as examples on how to 
reduce its impact147.  
Achieve a water efficiency  standard of 100 litres (Point 2c of Policy 
DE1) 
5.15.10  Water resilience is already a major national concern and one which is likely 
to be exacerbated by climate change. Like much of the South East, Gosport 
is already classified as an area of ‘moderate’ to ‘serious'148 water stress, 
with some future scenarios putting the area in ‘se rious’ water stress by 
2050149. The Environment Agency supports the use of higher water 
efficiency measures in new builds in water stress areas.  
 
5.15.11  Due to these concerns, residential developments in the Borough are 
expected to achieve Southern Water’s water ef ficiency goal of ‘Target 
100’150, which is equivalent to 100 litres of water per person per day (pppd) 
drawn from the mains supply. The use of water butts need not be included 
in this calculation. Should a dwelling be able to reduce water use to less 
than 10 0 litres pppd, it will be a material consideration in the determination 
of that application.  
Be assessed unde r the Home Quality Mark (Point 2d of Policy DE1 ) 
5.15.12  All residential developments of 1 dwelling or more will be expected to be 
assessed under the Home Quality Mark (HQM)151 (see Box 1 8). If it is not 
financially viable or technically feasible for a development to achieve HQM, 
this would be expected  to be demonstrated with appropriate evidence in the 
planning submission.  
 
5.15.13  Applicants undertaking a HQM assess ment will need to submit a pre -
assessment estimator and design -stage certificate at the appropriate stage 
(this is likely to be  at full or reserved matters stage) and a fin al certificate 
post-completion.  Planning conditions and/or obligations will be used to 
secure the standard and performance ratings as appropriate .

278 Achieve a BREEAM standard (Point 3 of Policy DE1) 
5.15.14  The Building Research Establishment Environment Assessment Method 
(BREEAM) provides a rating system for developments in terms of their 
environ mental impacts, comfort levels and health benefits (see Box 1 8). All 
non-residential and multi -residential schemes (such as residential 
institutions and some housing for older persons) will be expected to use the 
most up -to-date and relevant BREEAM technic al standard152 and achieve a 
rating of at least ‘Very Good’. Developments that exceed this rating will be 
considered favourably.  
 
5.15.15  Independent assessors licenced by BRE and funded by the developer must 
be used to assess the proposal . It will be necessary for planning 
applications to submit  a pre -assessment estimator, an  interim  (design stage) 
and final (post -completion stage) certifica te. Planning  conditions and/or 
obligations will be used to secure the certificate rating issued at the pre -
constructi on and pos t-occupation stages.  
 
5.15.16  If the required BREEAM rating is considered to be financially unviable or 
technically unfeasible, this will need to be demonstrated with appropriate 
evidence in support of a planning application. In this instance, the applicant 
will be expected to meet the highest BREEAM score that is viable. An 
alternative certification process may also be acceptable, where it can be 
shown to be approximately equivalent in outcomes.  
Refusal of permission  
5.15.17  The achievement of sustainable development is an essential requirement of 
national planning policy and this Local Plan. The incorporation of 
sustainable construction principles demonstrates a proposal’s commit ment 
to sustainable development  and therefore applications that fail to adequately 
incorporat e these principles, will be refused.

What is the Passivhaus Standard?  
A Passivhaus is a building in which thermal comfort can be achieved solely 
by post -heating or post -cooling the fresh air flow required for a good indoor 
air quality, without the need for a dditional recirculation of air. (Passivhaus 
Institut)  
 
What is the Home Quality Mark?  
The Building Research Establishment (BRE) launched the Home Quality 
Mark (HQM) in 201 5 as a simple to use five star  rating system for 
homebuyers to assess a home’s running costs, health and wellbeing 
benefits, and environmental impact. The trust mark also benefits developers 
by allowing them to showcase the quality of their homes to councils, 
homebuyers  and prospective tenants.

POLICY DE 2: RESIDENTIAL  DESIGN  
 
1. All residential development should provide a high quality  living 
environment for occupiers and neighbouring residents by:  
 
a) Providing adequately sized habitable rooms which meet or 
exceed the nationally described space standards153. 
b) Providing each dwelling with suitable private outdoor amenity 
space.  
c) Building in adaptability for changing future  needs by having:  
 
i) Spaces which are design ed to be flexible and adaptable ;  
ii) At least 15% of all new dwellings achieve  Category 2 
standard of Part M of the Building Regulations154; 
iii) On schemes of over 100 dwellings (gross), at least 2% of 
private housing and 5% of affordable housing achieve  
wheelchair accessible Category 3 standard of Part M of 
the Building Regulations.  
 
2. In line with the Council’s Parking SPD, residential developments 
should provide a balanced mix of parking solutions that are 
integrated into the design and layout without al lowing vehicles to 
become visually dominant.  
 
3. All new residential dwellings should ensure that convenient and 
secure storage space is provided for refuse, recycling and organic 
waste, and post and packages, to meet the likely needs of the 
household and wit hout detriment to the wider street scene.  
 
4. Extensions, parking layouts, boundary treatments and materials 
should be subservient to the host residential dwelling unless 
robust justification is provided.  
 
5. Proposed residential developments comprised of gated  
communities that fail to improve wider accessibility where this 
could be reasonably achieved will not be supported.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y DE 2 
5.16.1  The NPPF is clear that creating high quality  buildings and places is 
fundamental to the planning and development process. For many people 
their home is their most important space, and one which has specific needs, 
which is why this policy provides focus on designing high quality  homes.  
 
                                            
153 Technical housing standards – nationally described space standard  (MHCLG, 2015)  
154 www.gov.uk/government/publications/access -to-and-use-of-buildings -approved -document -m  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
281 5.16.2  This policy should be read in conjunction with the Design Policy D9, which 
provides overarching  design requirements for all developments. Reference 
should also be made to the National Design Guide155 and the Council’s 
Design SPD156 which add detail on how high quality  development can be 
achieved.  
Providing adequately sized habitable rooms (Point 1a of Policy DE2)  
5.16.3  The provision of adequately sized rooms is essential to the delivery of a high 
quality  living environment157. In particular, in higher -density developments 
and family accommodation the quality of internal space requires careful 
consideration. The National Design Guide recognises the importance of 
room sizes including floor -to-ceiling heights and internal storage spaces, 
while the Council’s Design SPD includes dis cretionary space standards.  
 
5.16.4  In 2015 the Government introduced ‘Technical housing standards – 
nationally described space standard’158. The starting point will be for all new 
homes, including subdivisions of larger properties and conversions, to meet 
or excee d the national space standards. Where a development is unable to 
meet the national space standards robust evidence will need to be 
submitted explaining why, and demonstrating that every effort has been 
made to reach the standards.  
 
5.16.5  To adopt the optional ho using standards, the Planning Practice Guidance 
(PPG) states that local authorities need to address the issues of need, 
viability and timing159. The Council agrees with the Government’s standards 
and recognise that they represent industry good practice. Neig hbouring 
authorities in South Hampshire have undertaken research which 
demonstrates a local need for space standards. Consequently the Council 
considers it appropriate to take a common approach and include  them in 
this consultation draft of the Local Plan for comment. It will undertake a 
desktop study for the next stage of the Local Plan taking in to account 
comments received regarding the need to adopt the national space 
standards160. Viability will be tested through the forthcoming Local Plan 
viability stud y. By introducing the standard through the Local Plan process 
the Council considers that suitable timing will be provided.  
Providing suitable outdoor amenity space (Point 1b of Policy DE2)  
5.16.6  Private amenity spaces enhance visual and outdoor amenity and enjoy ment, 
and can provide some privacy and separation from adjoining public space. 
Front gardens can incorporate planting to add natural features within the 
public realm, enhancing local wellbeing and biodiversity.

282 5.16.7  All dwellings should have access to adequat e private, semi -private or 
communal outdoor amenity space which is of sufficient size to meet the 
needs of the likely number of occupants. Such amenity space should be 
designed to provide a good level of amenity by providing a reasonable 
degree of privacy from the surrounding properties and maximising levels of 
daylight and fresh air. Communal amenity spaces should feel safe and 
secure for their users, providing a social area for relaxation, socialising and 
play. They must be overlooked, easily accessible f or all residents and have 
a suitable management regime, such as community management. Further 
guidance on designing amenity spaces can be found in the National Design 
Guide and  the Council’s  Design SPD. Where suitable amenity space cannot 
be provided, robu st justification as to why this can’t be achieved will be 
required in all exceptions.  
Adaptability and accessibility for changing future needs (Point 1c of 
Policy DE2)  
5.16.8  The PPG specifically addresses the issue of adaptable and accessible 
housing. This form of housing enables people to live more independently 
later into life, improving wellbeing and saving on health and social costs in 
the future. The guidance states that  it is better to build accessible housing 
from the outset rather than make expensive adap tations at a later stage.  
 
5.16.9  Flexibility and adaptability should be built -in to allow dwellings to 
accommodate changing future needs for people at different stages of life 
and with different abilities. This includes having rooms which can be used 
for multiple purposes such as a bedroo m, a guest room or a home office, or 
building lofts which can easily be converted. The size, location and design of 
such spaces will be crucial to achieving these outcomes. While open plan 
designs can facilitate some adaptability it can also create limitat ions, so 
requires careful consideration. Flexibility for technological change should 
also be considered, such as increased use of electric vehicles, full -fibre 
broadband or remote working.  
 
5.16.10  Evidence demonstrates that Gosport has a growing need for more 
accessible units including wheelchair accessible homes161. The Council has 
therefore adopted the optional accessibility and wheelchair housing 
standards162, relating to  Approved Document M (Access to  and Use of  
Buildings) of  the Building Regulations (2015), which replaces  the Lifetime 
Homes standards. Developments which exceed these standards will be 
supported.

283 Developments should provide a balanced mix of parking solutions 
(Point 2 of Policy DE2)  
5.16.11  How parking is arranged can have a fundamental impact on the quality of 
place. Developments need to adhere to the car and cycle parking standards 
as laid out in the Council latest guidance163 in terms of both quantity and 
quality. Parking should be convenient, safe and integrated but without 
becoming visually dominant . Visitor cycle parking however should be highly 
visible to promote sustainable travel and reduce the potential for crime. New 
planting including trees and bushes can be used to soften the visual impact.  
Convenient and secure storage space (Point 3 of Poli cy DE2)  
5.16.12  The provision of suitable storage space is essential to delivering quality 
living environments for both the occupier and the wider community. The safe 
and convenient storage, management and collection of refuse, recycling and 
food waste to meet the  likely needs of the household should be integrated 
so that bins are not visible from the street. Proposals should meet the 
Council’s latest guidance164 including demonstrating that bins can be 
conveniently taken to a collection point which is clearly shown on plans, and 
that refuse freighters can safely access the site, where required.  
 
5.16.13  Where bicycles are to be stored, safe and secure cycle parking which meets 
the adopted standards in terms of quantity and quality should be provided. 
Incorporation of safe an d secure places for the storage of post and package 
delivery should also be considered. Utilities including water, electric and 
lighting systems should be discreet and well -designed, making them easy to 
access, clean and maintain.  
Extensions, parking layou ts, boundary treatments, and materials 
(Point 4 of Policy DE2)  
5.16.14  Alterations or additions to existing homes should seek to match or 
compliment the host dwellings in terms of materials and design, and be 
subservient in terms of size and scale, unless robust justification is provided 
to the contrary. Materials should be durable, robust and maintainable and 
chosen with regard to their visual qualities and contribution to the character 
of the area. Where applied, robust boundary treatments should be utilised to 
create defensible spaces that distinguish between public and private realm.  
Gated communities (Point 5 of Policy DE2)  
5.16.1  Developments should seek to improve accessibility across the Borough, 
particularly for walking and cycling routes. Developments which seek  to 
create gated communities will not be supported by the Council.

POLICY DE3: LAYOUT OF SITES A ND PARKING  
 
Development proposals will be permitted, provided that the layout of 
the site is designed so that:  
 
1. Safe and convenient routes for pedestrians and cyclists which link 
with the existing network are prioritised . 
 
2. Existing public rights of way are safeguarde d or enhanced where 
appropriate.  
 
3. There is provision for bus access in larger developments with 
suitably l ocated bus stops.  
 
4. Adequate provision is made for an appropriate range of vehicles to 
access the site, manoeuvre within it, park, load and unload and turn 
around in a safe and convenient manner.  
 
5. Where vehicular access is from a Classified Road there is ad equate 
provision made to enable vehicles to enter and l eave the road in a 
forward gear.  
 
6. Sufficient visibility and lighting is provided for the safe and 
convenient use of the roads, cycle tracks, paths and parking places.  
 
7. Traffic management measures are i ncluded, where appropriate, to 
control the speed of traffic generated by the development, to ensure 
that the safety and convenience of all highway users including 
cyclists and pedestrians is maintained or enhanced.  
 
8. Provision is made for parking cars, moto rcycles, bicycles and 
where appropriate, goods vehicles.  
 
9. Provision is made for electric ve hicle (EV) parking and charging:  
 
a) For residential developments, each individual dwelling with on -

charge point;  
 
b) For non -residential developments or any development providing 
communal (non -allocated parking) an electric vehicle 
chargepoint must be provided at a ratio of at least one 
chargepoint per 5 parking spaces.  
 
10. Access and parking for people with disabil ities is provided in 
accordance with the relevant current standards.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
285 EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y DE3 
Pedestrian and cycle routes (Point 1 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.1  Walking  and cycling have the potential  to reduce the use of the car for local 
journeys or as a means to reach public transport facilities, particularly in 
support of first -mile / last -mile principles. Developments should be designed 
to facilitate cycling and walking by providing safe, secure, effective and 
attractive routes. Direct routes to facilities in the local area are important to 
reduce the reliance on the private car and encourage patronage of local 
shops.  
Rights of Way (Point 2 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.2  The Borough Council will expect development  to safeguard public rights of 
way and retain them in a setting of appropriate quality. Opportunities should 
be taken to expand the network of public access routes where appropriate  
(see also Policy LE4: A ccess to the  Coast and Countryside) . 
Bus routes and  bus stops (Point 3 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.3  It is important that the highway layout in larger new developments provides 
adequate potential for bus services to operate within the site. Developments 
should be designed so that bus stops are within easy walking distanc e of all 
parts of the site and can be safely accessed. Bus operators should be 
engaged early in the planning process to ensure the required infrastructure 
forms part of the overall design process.  A general guide of 400 metres is 
normally used as the maxim um distance that people are prepared to walk to 
a bus stop.  
Road layout (Points 4 -7 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.4  It is necessary to maintain a safe environment within developments and 
provide for the convenient movement of all users and appropriate vehicles.  
Appropriate  access to premises, vehicle parking, turning and servicing 
provision should be made having regard to national and local standards.  
Parking (Point 8 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.5  The Borough Council’s Adopted  Parking SPD includes guidance on the 
amount of car parking req uired. In order to protect the amenity of existing 
and new residents and protect the function of the highway, parking provision 
for residential uses will need to reflect the likely levels of car ownership, and 
ensure developments are planning in accordance  with the Parking SPD’s 
Core Objectives.  The SPD indicates where car parking may be reduced, for 
example in areas displaying higher levels of accessibility to alternative 
modes, in the interests of encouraging modal shift and making efficient use 
of land.  It must be clearly justified and evidenced that any developments 
with a reduced parking provision still accord with the Core Objectives of the 
Parking SPD and will not result in overspill parking or be detrimental to the 
safety and function of the highway or residential amenity.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
286 5.17.6  In order to support and promote sustainable modes of transport, 
developments will be expected to provide convenient and secure cycle 
parking which should be integral to the design in accordance with the 
Parking SPD.  Good quality, s ecure cycle parking for both long and short 
stay provision is integral to encouraging ownership and use.  
Electric Vehicle (EV) Parking and Charging (Point 9 of  Policy DE3) 
5.17.7  In light of Government carbon reduction targets, the phasing out of new 
internal com bustion engine  vehicles by 2030, and the uptake in ownership 
of electric vehicles , developments must provide parking and charging 
facilities for such vehicles.  New developments provide an opportunity to 
influence consumer behaviour towards more sustainably  fuelled vehicles, 
and can help facilitate the roll -out of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  
 
5.17.8  For residential developments, each individual dwelling with on -plot car 
parking must be provided with an electric vehicle charge point.  
 
5.17.9  For non -residenti al developments or any development providing communal 
(non-allocated parking) an electric vehicle chargepoint must be provided at 
a ratio of at least one chargepoint per 5 parking spaces.  Additionally, to 
ensure developments are future -proofed for increased electric vehicle 
charging demands, there should be enabling infrastructure in place (e.g. 
ducting) to allow further chargepoints to be installed with minimal disruption.  
 
5.17.10  All electric vehicle chargepoints and infrastructure must conform to and be  
installed in accordance with the relevant technical standards . 
Access and parking for disabled people (Point 10 of Policy DE3) 
5.17.11  Development should be designed to have regard to the latest Government 
guidance on access for disabled people this includes the design of 
pavements and parking provision. Further details on parking provision are 
set out in the Council’s Parking SPD.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

c) vehicular access is achieved via rear service areas, except 
where it has been demonstrated that it would be preferable to 
gain access from Mari ne Parade provided that:  
 
i. it does not have an adverse impact on road safety;  
ii. there would be no harmful increase in traffic flow; and  
iii. it would not be detrimental to the overall character and 
design of the area.  
 
3. Within the Lee West Area of Special Character  (as shown on the

and where poss ible, reinstates, the townscape qualities and 
visual appearance of the area of special character;  
b) proper and adequate protection given to the residential 
amenities of neighbouring properties.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y DE4 
Overall approach (P oint 1 of Policy DE4) 
5.18.1  Areas of Special Character are considered to be local areas that have 
recognised townscape qualities such as a strong sense of cohesion and 
sense of place; and where particular design characteristics have been 
identified as worthy of being safeguarded. Suc h areas do not have the 
exceptional historic or architectural qualities to be designated as a 
conservation a rea and therefore do not have the same controls or policy DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
288 tests.  However the areas do have characteristics that add substantially to 
the character o f the local area . All developments within Areas of Special 
Character should have regard to this policy and any associated 
supplementary planning guidance.  
  
5.18.2  These characteristics in most instances  have been considered in the 
Borough Council’s latest townsc ape assessment. In order to identify any 
new Areas of Special Character it will be necessary to undertake detailed 
character appraisals of an area in order to ascertain whether any such 
designation can be sufficiently justified. If there is merit in design ating an 
Area of Special Character it will be necessary to identify those features 
which are particularly important to maintaining the character and local 
distinctiveness of that area. Further planning guidance for such areas will be 
contained within a Sup plementary Planning Document and subject to public 
consultation.  
Marine Parade Area of Special Character ( Point 2 of Policy DE4) 
5.18.3  When viewed in its entirety, the seafront at Lee -on-the-Solent forms one of 
the most distinctive stretches of urban coastline o n the Solent. It is 
characterised by detached 2 to 3 storey buildings with some higher 
development of 4 and 5 storeys set in regular plots and forming a 
continuous urban edge behind the promenade and clifflands.  
 
5.18.4  Lee-on-the-Solent began to develop in the 1 880s when a grid pattern of 
streets was laid out. A key part of this was the long seafront of Marine 
Parade, facing areas of parkland dropping down to the beach. The plots 
were largely developed by the late 1930s giving the area a distinct character 
of int er war detached and semi -detached housing to the west and east of 
Pier Street (the centre of the Victorian new town).  
 
5.18.5  This character has been eroded in part by larger -scale post -war flat 
developments, but there remains a relative uniformity in the height of 
development along Marine Parade that is separated into four distinct areas 
which are detailed in the Marine Parade Area of Special Character 
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)165. Although there are a few 
examples of late Victorian seaside architecture , the buildings are of more 
value as a group. Given their combined townscape quality and visual 
prominence along the seafront and from the Solent, the Borough Council 
regards the overall appearance and character of the seafront area as 
meriting special con sideration in determining proposals for development . 
 
5.18.6  The Council will seek to encourage innovative design that improves the 
overall appearance and character of Marine Parade. While helping to 
safeguard the local distinctiveness of the area, new developmen t should 
also be of a high standard of design and appropriate scale and form that 
helps enhance both the buildings’ immediate context and the area’s special 
character. Equal consideration should be given to the design of each 
elevation of a building in ter ms of its visual impact and the potential impact

289 on the amenity of properties within its setting including those to the rear of 
Marine Parade.  
 
5.18.7  The distinct townscape qualities which are evident along Marine Parade 
include:  
 
 The rhythmic quality to the pat tern of development with many 
buildings  within the original Victorian plots;  
 The consistent building line set back from the pavement;  
 Buildings largely developed on the southern half of the plots;  
 The relative uniformity in ridge and parapet heights along  key groups 
of buildings (within the four areas described); and  
 The predominance of hipped and pitched roofs.  
 
5.18.8  These are all important qualities which define the area’s built form and can 
help guide potential development. Detailed guidance is contained within the 
Marine Parade Area of Special Character SPD. In addition, the Daedalus 
SPD sets the design context for development proposals along the Marine 
Parade frontage within the Daedalus site.  
 
5.18.9  The issues relating to vehicular access are further detailed in the Marine 
Parade Area of Special Character SPD.  
Lee West Area of Special Character ( Point 3 of Policy DE4) 
5.18.10  Lee West forms part of the original settlement of Lee -on-the-Solent, with a 
distinct urban style composed of two -storey dwellings set within generous 
plots, landmark corner buildings, and an attractive streetscape featuring 
grassy verges and trees.  
 
5.18.11  The fo cal point of Lee West is Victoria Square upon which a church was 
constructed in the 1880s. The church was rebuilt in the 1930s, during which 
time a number of the remaining plots in Lee West were developed, giving 
the area a mix of Victorian and inter -war a rchitecture. This character was 
sufficient for the Council to adopt a Lee West Area of Special Character 
SPD166 in 2019, which described the four distinct areas in Lee West in more 
detail, as well as outlining opportunities for enhancements.  
 
5.18.12  The distinct to wnscape qualities which are evident within the whole of Lee 
West include:  
 
 Buildings set within their generous Victorian plots;  
 Consistent building line set back from the pavement;  
 Relative uniformity in ridge and parapet height amongst groups of 
buildings ; 
 Preponderance of large pitched and hipped roofs;  
 Garden walls with hedgerows and mature trees;  
 Grassy verges with street trees.

5.18.13  Like the neighbouring Marine Parade, the character of Lee West has 
suffered from erosion. Unsympathetic developments in terms  of style and 
scale have occurred, a number of front gardens and walls have been 
removed, and mature trees and vegetation have been lost.  
 
5.18.14  The Council will support innovative design which enhances the overall 
appearance and character of Lee West. Proposals which reinforce and 
reinstate the local character of the area will also be supported. All new 
developments should be of high quality  and r elate its surrounding context 
and scale, with consideration given to the special characteristics identified

development will also  form part of that mix of uses and will be encouraged in 
appropriate locations,  for example on upper floors whilst the ground floor of 
commercial units will be retained for retail, commercial, community and 
leisure uses in order to help support the vitalit y of centres. This approach 
DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
292 will encourage increased footfall to support existing and new businesses . 
This will be particularly important in both the context of responding to 
changing shopping habits, emerging market trends and the business 
requirements of the retail, leisure and tourism sector. An evolving, 
responsive and diverse hierarchy of centres is even m ore important 
following the economic effects and the recovery of the local economy post 
COVID -19. 
 
5.19.4  There are a number of significant challenges facing the Borough’s centres 
whose primary function has been traditionally to maintain and promote a 
retail core  along with other key ancillary services. However alongside the 
challenges there are also significant opportunities for centres to repurpose 
themselves moving forward . This includes taking account of changes in the 
retail sector , capitalising  on Gosport’s rich heritage, tourism and leisure 
potential , and providing  a focal point for supporting local community 
activities and services.  
 
BOX  19: Summary of key issues and opportunities  
 
 COVID -19 has accele rated trends for online shopping an d the economic 
fall-out has led to an increase of vacancy rates . 
 Whilst Gosport Town Centre will remain the main retail destination for 
the Borough, it is vulnerable to  a decline in the retail market given the 
current climate for store closures and the com petition from larger nearby 
centres in the region.  
 Gosport Town Centre and the other centres in the Borough will need to 
embrace new trends and build in resilience to adapt to future changes. 
This will be based, in part, on identifying and building on uni que 
attractions and competitive positioning where possible, and embracing 
the digital transformation of centres.  
 Greater diversification is required  with a wider range of retail, leisure, 
cultural, heritage, employment, tourist and other amenities/attracti ons 
including marine leisure. This could be supported by a mix of new homes 
and apartments on the edge of and/or ‘on top of’ centres to help boost 
their ‘captive’ resident and working catchment populations in the most 
sustainable and commercially effective  way. 
 Improve the environment and public realm of centres  to encourage 
visitors to spend more time within centres.  
 Improve accessibility to, and within, centres . 
 
 
5.19.5  The Council is engaged in a number of key initiatives to support the 
development of the High Street including both the Borough wide Heritage 
Action Zone (HAZ) and the High Street HAZ. The HAZ is a partnership 
between key stakeholders. The identified projec ts will make an important 
contribution towards meeting regeneration objectives across the Borough . 
Gosport Town Centre and the two District Centres are key focal points for 
the projects for both the HAZ and the High Street HAZ; where a number of DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
293 specific p rojects for Gosport Town Centre and Stoke Road District Centre 
are being delivered.  
 
5.19.6  There are 22 existing centres in Gosport as shown in Table 5 below , 
together with a proposed centre at Blockhouse  (see Policy SS4) .

POLICY C1: CENTRES  
 
1. The vitality and viability of the Borough’s centr es, as set out in the 
Table 5, will be maintained and enhanced wherever possible . 
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for appropriate  main town 
centre uses which will support a wide range of activities within the 
Princip al, District and Neighbourh ood Centres across the Borough.  
 
3. The existing network of centres will be protected and the following  
uses will be permitted:  
 
a) Within the frontages of the Principal, District and 
Neighbourhood centres ( as defined in Appendix 4) planning 
permission will be granted for Class E, F1 and F2 uses as well 
as pubs and drinking establishments (formerly Class A4); and  
b) All uses identified above within these frontages  will be required 
to maintain a shop window display that is appropriate to  the 
building.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
294 4. Hot Food Take -away uses will only be permitted within a centre if 
the proposal accords with Policy C 5. 
 
5. Planning permission will be granted for proposals for residential 
development in appropriate locations within the Principal, District 
and Neighbourhood defined centres provided that:  
 
a) they are not within the ground floor frontage;  
b) they do not affect the function of the commercial and 
community units nor prevent the servicing of these units;  
c) they do not have a detrimental effect on adjoin ing uses; and  
d) a separate independent and appropriate access can be achieved 
to serve the residential accommodation.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C1  
Retail hierarchy and appropriate town centres uses (Point 1 of Policy 
C1) 
5.20.1  The established hierarchy of centres in the Borough will be maintained and 
improved wherever possible. Plan 2 0 and Table 5 shows the location of 
centres across the Borough. There is one principal town centre, two district 
centres and twenty two  existing neighbourhood centres. The boundaries of 
each centre are shown on the Policies Map with more detail ed maps 
contained in Appendix  4. 
 
5.20.2  The order of the centres  in the hierarchy  reflects the ir size and the role they 
perform in terms of the goods and services provided.  Each type of centre 
performs a distinct and complimentary role. Gosport Town Centre will 
remain the principal shopping centre supported by the district centres of 
Lee-on-the-Solent and Stoke Road with the neighbourhood centres serving 
the needs o f their immediate catchment communities.  
Gosport Town Centre (Point 1 a of Policy C1)  
5.20.3  Gosport Town Centre contains a variety of convenience and comparison 
shops including a range of national multiples and local independent 
businesses.  It also contains other  non-retail functions such as the Discovery 
Centre and Gosport Gallery along with the Town Hall.  
 
5.20.4  However Gosport Town Centre is vulnerable to competition from higher 
order centres in the South Hampshire sub-region  and the effects of changes 
to the traditi onal retailing and commercial services role of town centres.  
 
5.20.5  Gosport Town Centre is within  the Harbour Regeneration Area (HBRA) . A 
specific policy approach has been developed fo r it and is set out in Policy 
SS3. Policy S S3 seeks to promote a greater flexibility of uses in order to 
support and encourage a greater diversity of facilities and services within 
the town centre alongside the traditional retailing role .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
295 5.20.6  This policy approach is supported by the Gosport Retail, Leisure and 
Tourism Study (2019 /20) (GRLTS) which forecast s that no significant new 
retail floorspace is required during the plan period. The study recommends a 
more flexible approach to non -Class A1 uses within the primary shopping 
area of the Town Centre and identifies the potential in  the centre to improve 
leisure related uses and residential development in appropriate locations in 
order to increase quality dwell time allowing the Town Centre to fulfil a key 
role within the wider Ha rbour Regeneration Area (HBRA).  
 
5.20.7  Market research from the GRLTS identified a requirement for more 
commercial leisure provision, including better quality restaurants. There may 
also be the potential to attract small -scale  leisure  operator s which along with 
new restaurant provision would enhance the town’s even ing/night -time 
economy and the centre’s attractiveness to both local residents and visitors 
to Gosport.  
 
5.20.8  Therefore the Council will take a proactive approach to planning for Gosport  
Town Centre  as identified in point 2 below . 
 
5.20.9  The close proximity of the Town Centre to the HBRA and in particul ar 
Gosport Waterfront (Policy S S1-2) will provide important regeneration 
opportunities to promote regeneration benefits for both of these areas. 
Strengthening the linkages between the Town Centre and the wider HBRA 
will help to enhance the retail, leisure and tourism offer.  
District Centres (Point 1b of Policy C1 ) 
5.20.10  The Lee -on-the-Solent District Centre primarily serves the community of 
Lee. The Centre has continued to thrive over recent years. There has been 
a trend of low vacancy rates despite the fluctuating economic fortunes. It 
has a good mix of independent retail as well as a small number of national 
chains. The centre is in close proximity to the seafront and has benefitted 
from a number of environmental improvemen ts. 
 
5.20.11  The Stoke Road District Centre provides a mix of specialist and local retail 
and services. Currently it largely consists of independent traders and also 
includes a national supermarket chain. This centre has experienced a 
number of vacant units over a  period of time and some of the shop fronts 
are in poor condition.  As mentioned above the High Street HAZ covers 
Stoke Road and includes projects to re -use vacant units  and projects 
involving local businesses.  
Neighbourhood Centres (Point 1 c of Policy C1 ) 
5.20.12  There are twenty two  smaller neighbourhood centres across the Borough 
which serve a significant proportion of residential areas. These are identified 
on the Policies Map and in Appendix 4. Each neighbourhood centre 
provides for a range of town centre uses serving the needs of the local 
community. The provision of local services and facilities can add vitality to 
individual centres and contribute towards a sense of place and local 
community.  They can contribute towards generating linked trips thereby DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
296 reducin g the number of private vehicle borne trips whereas a loss of 
facilities can increase car journeys adding to road congestion and air 
pollution.  
 
5.20.13  The Local Plan seeks to enhance the vitality and viability of the 
neighbourhood centres. This includes supporting an increased diversity in 
commercial and community uses. This will help to reduce vacancy rates and 
support the development of sustainable communities and businesses.  
Measures to enhance centres (Point 2 of Policy C1)  
5.20.14  The Council is taking a proactive approach in addressing issues facing 
Gosport Town Centre and Stoke Road in particular.  
 
5.20.15  The Gosport Waterfront and Town Centre SPD represents an initial strategy 
document and has identified key opportunity sites.  The Counc il is a partner 
of the successful Transforming Cities Fund programme which represents 
the first stage in the redevelopment of the Bus Station site  (see Policy SS3) . 
It has also been successful in bidding for a Borough -wide Heritage Action 
Zone  (HAZ)  which will deliver a number of public realm projects in and 
around Gosport  Town Centre (including Bastion No. 1 improvements, the 
Gosp ort Lines and Creekside Walks). More recently the Council has been 
successful in achieving High Street Heritage Action Zone stat us for Gosport  
Town Centre and Stoke Road  District Centre . Part of the programme 
involves re -using vacant units for va rious training, commercial and 
community units to increase investment and footfall in the Town Centre as 
well as significant  investment into the Gosport Museum, the development of 
an events programme as well as additional public realm and frontage 
improvements.  
 
5.20.16  Supporting a greater mix of uses: The Gosport Retail, Leisure and 
Tourism Study (20 19/20) confirms that even pre -COVI D-19, national retail 
market trends and forecasts are likely to remain on a low -growth path in 
2020 due to the uncertainty created by the Brexit transition period and the 
sluggish global economy.  Negative growth in convenience goods spending 
has had a sign ificant impact on the grocery sector and on retailer business 
models over the last 10 -15 years. The growth in non -store retail sales has 
undoubtedly had the most significant impact on consumer spend and 
behaviour, and the reta il sector over the last decade . 
 
5.20.17  The study concluded that as with other centres across the UK, Gosport’s 
hierarchy of centres will need to embrace new dynamics and trends, and 
build in resilience to adapt to future changes. This will be based, in part, on 
identifying and building on th eir unique attractions such as its heritage and 
marine leisure and competitive positioning where possible, and embracing 
the digital transformation of centres.  
 
5.20.18  Therefore in order for the centres to be competitive they must offer a wider 
range of uses than  at present which can complement and build on existing 
facilities and attractions in order to increase both footfall and dwell time. This DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
297 includes  a move away from high streets as solely retail -led locations to 
those that offer a wider range of retail, lei sure, cultural, heritage, 
employment, tourist and other amenities/attractions. This transition to more 
diverse uses that go “beyond retail” will need to be supported by a mix of 
new homes in appropriate locations to help boost their ‘captive’ resident and 
working catchment populations in the most sustainable and commercially 
effective way.  
 
5.20.19  Local Markets:  Gosport Town Centre has  a local market operating twice a 
week (Tuesdays and Saturdays). Local markets can add significantly to the 
vitality and viability  and local character of centres and have the potential to 
become destinations in their own right. Opportunities to support and 
enhance the range and type of market activity such as Farmers Markets, 
arts and crafts and Christmas markets and linking market a ctivities with 
events such as the Gosport Marine Festival will be encouraged within 
Gosport Town Centre and the District Centres.  
 
5.20.20  The evening economy:  Gosport Town Centre has a relatively weak 
evening economy with very few pubs, restaurants and bars.  Cons equently 
the Town Centre is not capitalising on the potential spend from residents 
and visitors as it becomes quieter when shops close for the day.  
 
5.20.21  Food and beverage are an integral part of a town centre’s wider offer and 
economy.  A good choice and qualit y of restaurants, bars and pubs can help 
to complement other town centre uses, by generating trips, extending ‘dwell 
times’ increasing ‘linked’ expenditure to other shops and businesses as part 
of the same trip, and strengthening both daytime and evening e conomies.  
There are opportunities within the wider Harbour Regeneration Area to 
strengthen the links between Gosport Town Centre and other waterfront 
locations which could support the high quality  food and beverage offer as 
part of a wider opportunity for promoting leisure and tourism in the Borough.  
 
5.20.22  There may be further opportunities to encourage the development of an 
evening economy within Lee -on-the-Solent District Centre and Stoke Road 
District Centre with its close links to Gosport Town Centre. Develo pment  
proposals will need to take into account the Council’s Licensing Policy  which  
can be found on the Council’s website167. Proposals will need to have 
regard to th e amenities of local residents  in accordance with the Local Plan 
design policies . 
 
5.20.23  Environmental improvements:  The Council will continue to work with local 
businesses and other partners to improve the environmental quality of the 
centres focusing on a wide range of initiatives to improve the regeneration of 
local High Streets principally  through the High Street Heritage Action Zone.

Policy   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
298 Diversity of uses (Point 3 of Policy C1)  
5.20.24  It is important to ensure each centre has an appropriate and balanced mix of 
uses to reflect its role within the centres hierarchy.  However, traditional retail 
pattern s are changing with growing take -up of online shopping and a 
reduced need for physical space  and as mentioned previously these trends 
have been accelerated by the  COVID -19 pandemic . Consequently  centres 
need to re -purpose themselves to perform a broader ro le within the 
communities they serve rather than being solely retail -led with a greater 
range of food and drink establishments, community uses, business units 
and workshops, and leisure uses . The Council’s Gosport Waterfront and 
Town Centre SPD recognise s this and encourages a grea ter diversity of 
uses at ground floor . The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) 
(Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 (which came into force on 1st 
September 2020) provides greater flexibility to support a wide range of town 
centre and community uses within established centres  but unfortunately 
limits local planning authority control on such matters , particularly  with 
regard to assessing what is most appropriate for its own centres . 
 
5.20.25  Table 6 below provides guidance on the recl assification of the relevant use 
classes for Policy C1 .

Hot Food Take Aways (Point 4 of Policy C1)  
5.20.26  The Council considers it appropriate to limit the proliferation of  hot food 
takeaways (Use Class s ui generis) to assist in meeting both local and 
national health priorities and will require any proposal for a new, expansion 
of existi ng, or the change of use of individual premises to a hot food 
takeaway use to meet the requirements of Policy C 5. This includes the 
proposal being suitably located to meet the requirements of Policy C 5 which 
link to a location based criterion set out in th e policy.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
299 Residential development (Point 5 of Policy C1)  
5.20.27  Residential development can play an important role in supporting the vitality 
and viability of centres by increasing footfall to those centres and through 
natural surveillance. However in order to maintain the integrity and 
continuity of a centre it is considered that residential development at the 
ground floor fronting onto a shopping street is not appropriate. However the 
use of upper floors in these centres for residential uses as well as in some  
cases the rear of commercial and community buildings (subject to the other 
policies in the Local Plan). It will be important to ensure that such uses do 
not have a detrimental effect on adjoining uses.  It is acknowledged that 
some changes of use to reside ntial properties is allowed under permitted 
development rights  and the Government has recently  extend ed these rights 
(from the 1st August  2021 ). The Council will  now have much more limited 
control over these changes of use and this will undermine the work by the 
Council and its many partners to maintain commercial and community uses 
along main frontages in the centres.  However where planning permission is 
required the  Council will resist the loss of these uses at ground floor to 
residential. It is also recognised that the Government may amend these 
permitted development rights during the plan period when the implications of 
these changes are fully understood . 
 
5.21 POLICY C 2: TOWN CENTRE USES OUT SIDE O F CENTRES  
 
POLIC Y C2: TOWN CENTRE US ES OUTSIDE O F CENTRES  
 
1. Proposals for new retail and other town centre uses outside of a  
centre will need to undertake:  
 
a) the sequential test in accordance with the latest Government 
guidance; and  
b) an impact assessment in accordance with the latest 
Government  guidance and locally set floorspace threshold.  
 
2. Planning permission will be refused where an application fails to 
satisfy the sequential test or is likely to have significant adverse 
impact on the vitality and viability of a centre.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C2  
5.21.1  Supporting town centres to evolve and thri ve is an important objective of the 
Local Plan , particularly  post COVID -19. Therefore in considering proposals 
for new floorspace, the Council will expect an applicant to provide clear and 
robust evidence to demonstrate compliance with the sequential test for 
development proposals which are defined as town centre uses. This 
includes applying ample floorspace flexibility when assessing potential units, 
particularly where there is no confirmed operator or tenant. Disaggregation 
should also be considered, wher e the proposed uses would allow . The latest 
national planning guidance provides further advice on the issues that should 
be taken into account when demonstrating whether the sequential test for DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
300 site selection has been followed, and that the necessary impac t 
assessments are carried out.   
 
5.21.2  New retail proposals and development associated with major town centre 
uses will be focused in the Harbour Regeneration Area (Policy D3) and 
where appropriate in other centres in the Borough in relation to their scale. 
There may however, be circumstances where new development is 
considered in out of centre locations providing the relevant tests can be met.  
 
5.21.3  For such applications the Coun cil will apply the sequential test for proposals 
not in an existing centre or in accordance with the allocations set out in this 
Local Plan. This requires that the applicant demonstrate that first there are 
no suitable sites in the centres and secondly tha t there are no suitable sites 
in edge of centre locations. If the proposed site is allocated for a non -retail 
use the applicant will need to demonstrate that it is no longer needed for 
that particular use having regard to the relevant policies in this Loca l Plan.  
 
5.21.4  When assessing retail, leisure and office development outside of town 
centres which are not in accordance with the allocations identified in this 
Local Plan, the Council will generally require an impact assessment if the 
development is over the fo llowing size thresholds in terms of gross external  
floorspace:  
 
 350 sq. m (gross) for new convenience and comparison retail 
development; and  
 2,500 sq. m (gross) for new leisure development . 
 
5.21.5  The threshold for leisure development follows the nationally set threshold 
identified in the NPPF; however the threshold for retail development has 
been locally set to take account of relevant retail evidence168. It is 
considered the impact test should be demonstrated on proposals that 
involve 350 sq.m.  (gross) or more of  new retail floorspace.  
 
5.21.6  Given the particular pressures facing the Borough’s centres it is considered 
reasonable for applicants proposing developments for new comparison and 
convenience goods retailing of 350 sq.m.  (gross) and above to demonstrate 
that th ey will not have a significant adverse impact cumulatively with other 
commitments in the area, in accordance with the NPPF , on any defined 
centre within the Borough. Therefore, a 350 sq. m (gross) threshold should 
be applied to all proposals for retail tha t are defined as ‘edge of centre’ or 
‘out of centre’. This will ensure that proposals can be tested on their 
potential impact on nearby centres. In addition, the proposed threshold 
would capture proposals that seek to incrementally expand the out of centre  
retail offer.  
 
5.21.7  This requirement would also include applications that seek to vary 
conditions that restrict the sale of goods (e.g. bulky goods) for example on

Council (July 2020).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
301 retail parks, to allow a broader range of goods for sale, which could impact 
on existing centres.  This threshold should be applied, where relevant, to 
change of use applications and applications seeking variations of conditions.  
 
5.21.8  Pre-application discussion on the scope of any Retail Impact Assessment in 
support of planning applications are adv ised and the scope of the Retail 
Impact Assessment should be discussed and agreed between the applicant 
and the Council at the earliest opportunity.  
 
5.21.9  The Retail Impact Assessment should be proportionate to the scale of the 
proposal and as a minimum include : 
 
 The impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public 
and private investment in a centre or centres in the catchment area of 
the proposal; and  
 The impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability 
including local consumer choic e and trade in the town centre and 
wider area, for up to five years from the time the application is made. 
For major schemes where the full impact will may not be realised in 
five years, it is considered that the impact should also be assessed 
up to ten ye ars from the time the application is made.  
 
5.22 POLICY C3: LOCAL SHO PS 
 
POLICY C3: LOCAL SHO PS 
 
Development proposals for changes of use of existing shops (Class E 
and Class F2) outside of the Principal, District and Neighbourhood 
centres (as shown on the Policies Map) will be permitted provided they 
are vacant and there have been reasonable attempts to let/sell them for 
retail use.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C3  
5.22.1  Local shops outside defined centres can play an important role in providing 
for the needs of adjacent residential areas. However, should these shops no 
longer be required or they are no longer viable then their change of use to 
non-retail use would be considered acceptable provided it can be 
demonstrated that they have b een vacant for a period of time and there 
have been reasonable attempts to let or lease them for retailing uses.  
 
5.22.2  Planning permission for a change of use169 or redevelopment to a non -retail 
purpose will only be considered if sufficient evidence is provided o f how the 
property has been marketed for sell and/or let which demonstrates that a 
retail use cannot be secured at this site. Information required to the 
satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority  includes the length of the 
                                            
169 It is important to acknowledge that the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2020 which came into force on 31st August 2020 allows greater scope for permitted changes of 
uses (without the need for planning permission).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
302 marketing period and details o f the marketing including advertising methods 
which are proportionate to the nature of the premises and details of the 
prices that the properties have marketed at and whether this represents a 
competitive local market rate. Consideration will be given to t he location and 
type of shop and the community it serves and whether there are other shops 
in the vicinity.  
 
5.22.3  It is considered that normally properties should be marketed for a period of 
at least six months. However it is acknowledged that in some cases it may 
be more appropriate to consider a longer marketing period particularly 
where the shop is important to the local community170. There may also be 
circumstances where a shorter marketing period may be acceptable if 
appropriate justification can be provided.   
 
5.23 POLICY C4: COMMERCIA L FRONTAGES OUTSIDE OF CENTRES  
 
POLICY C4: COMMERCIA L FRONTAGES OUTSIDE OF CENTRES  
 
Existing important ground floor frontages as shown in Appendix 4 will 
be protected for commercial purposes (Class E). Planning permission 
for a change of use or redevelopment of properties on these frontages 
from commercial uses will only be permitted provided that there have 
been reasonable attempts to let/sell the property for a commercial use.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C4  
5.23.1  The Borough Council considers that there are a number of commercial -led 
frontages within the Borough that perform an important economic role in 
prime locations. These include a variety of commercial type functions at 
ground floor level which should be safeguarded for economic uses.  
 
5.23.2  Planning permission171 for a change of use or redevelopment to a non -
commercial purpose will only be considered if sufficient evidence is provided 
of how the property has been marketed for sell and/or let which 
demonstrates t hat a commercial use cannot be secured at this site. 
Information includes the length of the marketing period, the methods of 
marketing, the level and type of interest generated as well as pricing details.  
  
5.23.3  Preferred alternative uses would include communit y uses if a commercial 
use is not feasible . Residential uses on the ground floor are not considered 
appropriate in these locations . It is acknowledged that some changes of use 
to residential properties is allowed under permitted development rights and 
                                            
170 For example it is the only convenience store serving a population that is further than 400 metres from a 
centre.  
171 It is important to acknowledge that the Town and Country Planning  (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2015 which came into force on 15th April 2015 allows greater scope for permitted changes of 
uses (without the  need for planning permission). Further amendments to permitted development rights have been 
made through the Town and Country Planning (Permitted Development, Advertisement and Compensation 
Amendments) (England) Regulations 2019 which came into force on 25th May 2019 and the Town and Country 
Planning (Permitted Development and miscellaneous amendments ) (England) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 
which (subject to paragraph 3) came into force on 1st August 2020.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
303 the Government has extend ed these rights from the 1st August 2021. The 
Council will  now have much more limited control over these changes of use 
and this will undermine the work by the Council and its many partners to 
maintain commercial and community uses  along main frontages in the 
centres. However where planning permission is required the Council will 
resist the loss of these uses at ground floor to residential. It is also 
recognised that the Government may amend these permitted development 
rights during  the p lan period when the implications of these changes are 
fully understood.  
 
5.23.4  Normally it is considered that properties should be marketed for a period of 
at least six months. However it is acknowledged that in some cases it may 
be more appropriate to con sider a longer marketing period particularly 
where a commercial frontage forms part of a larger development site that 
has yet to be completed. Further advice should be sought from the Council 
on this matter.  
 
5.23.5  The key frontages are set out below (with detai l included in Appendix 4).  
 
5.23.6  Marine Parade Area of Special Character  – An intrinsic part of the Marine 
Parade area is its seafront location and its consequent attraction to day 
visitors. The presence of day visitors provides a valuable contribution to the 
local economy. In order to sustain and potentially enhance the local 
economy it is important to retain the commercial uses along the seafront.  
 
5.23.7  Royal Clarence Yard Waterfront  – This frontage is adjacent the Royal 
Clarence Marina and forms an important part of a larger mixed -use site. The 
ground -floor frontage is considered important to support the marine 
economy and once established will add vitality to the site providing leis ure 
opportunities including bars and restaurant to a wider population. It also has 
the potential to include additional office and retail uses to serve the site and 
the marina.  Further guidance is provided by the Gosport Waterfront and 
Town Centre SPD (2018) . 
 
5.23.8  Martin Snape House, St. George Barracks South  – This frontage was 
completed as part of the St George Barracks mixed -use site and now 
contains a number of community -office based functions including the 
Citizens Advice Bureau and Gosport Voluntary  Action offices. It is 
considered important to retain this ground frontage for commercial  / 
community type uses particularly given its close pr oximity to Gosport Town 
Centre.

304 5.24 POLICY C5: HOT  FOOD TAKE  AWAYS  
Introduction  
5.24.1  The expansion of the fast food industry in recent decades has had a 
considerable influence on our food consumption and diet choices. Hot food 
takeaways often offer ‘energy -dense’ or ‘fast -food’, high in total fats, 
saturated fats and salt . These types of food are linked to obesity and related 
healt h conditions including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke 
and some cancers. There is a growing body of evidence on the association 
between exposure to fast food outlets and obesity. There are also concerns 
about the effect fast food consumptio n is having on children’s diets and 
eating behaviour, with health problems such as obesity starting to develop 
at primary school age and behaviour that’s established early in life following 
through to adulthood.  
 
5.24.2  Hot food takeaways (sui generis) are now a common feature in the 
Borough’s centres meeting an increased demand for convenience and 
instant food access. In June 2018, Gosport Borough had 90 takeaways 
according to the Food Environment Assessment Tool (FEAT)172. This is the 
equivalent of 36% of all food  outlets or 1.09 takeaways per 1,000 people in 
the Borough. This is well above the average for Hampshire which had 0.75 
takeaways per 1,000 people, accounting for 24.1% of all food outlets. Out of 
all districts in Hampshire, Gosport has the highest number of takeaways per 
1,000 people and is not far behind the cities of Portsmouth (1.40 per 1,000 
people) and Southampton (1.30 per 1,000 people).  
 
5.24.3  The percentage of adults (aged 18+) classified as overweight or obese in 
Gosport Borough is above the average for  Hampshire and England. In 
2017/18, 66.2% of adults  in Gosport  were overweight or obese, compared to 
63.1% in Hampshire and 62% in England173. The National Child 
Measurement Programme (NCMP)174 shows that in 2018/19, 34.3% of year 
6 children in the Borough wer e overweight or obese compared to 30.4% in 
Hampshire. Gosport Borough has the second highest proportion of 
overweight and obese year 6 children out of all the Hampshire districts. For 
reception year children, 25.7% were overweight or obese compared to 
21.5% in Hampshire and 22.6% in England. Gosport Borough has the 
highest proportion of overweight and obese reception age children out of all 
Hampshire districts.  
 
5.24.4  Improving people’s health is complex and involves numerous interventions 
at a national and local  level and by individuals themselves.  
 
5.24.5  The Council acknowledges that poor health and excessive weight cannot be 
fully addressed using a single intervention, but the Council is well placed to 
coordinate initiatives across various organisations and introduce  measures

305 to ensure it assists in improving access to healthier food production and 
consumption choices. Through the Local Plan and the decision -making 
process, the Council plays a key part in influencing developme nt in the 
Borough. Planning is therefore a  key mechanism that can be used to 
improve the places in which we live and build healthier communities.  
 
5.24.6  Nationally, the Government recognises the need for planning policies and 
decisions to ‘enable and support healthy lifestyles, especially where this 
would address identified local health and wellbeing  needs’175. The 
Government’s Planning Practice Guidance176 sets out that planning can 
influence the built environment to improve health, including the creation of a 
healthier food environment. It also details how  planning policies can, where 
justified, seek to limit the proliferation of particular uses, such as hot food 
takeaways, having regard to issues such as: the proximity to locations 
where children and young people congregate: evidence indicating high 
levels  of obesity and health inequalities; the over -concentration of certain 
uses within a specified area; and other issues such as odours and noise 
impact and refuse and litter.  
 
5.24.7  The Council considers it appropriate to limit the proliferation of hot food 
takeaw ays to assist with meeting both local and national health priorities 
and will require any proposal for a new, expansion of existing, or the change 
of use of a premises to, a hot food takeaway (sui generis) to meet the 
requirements of Policy C 5. 
 
5.24.8  In additio n to this policy, the Council is working on initiatives to promote 
active lifestyles and improve health and wellbeing . Health also underpins the 
Local Plan, with many policies targeting the factors that affect health, 
including th e cross -cutting health y communities  Policy D8, promoting active 
travel (Policy D12), ensuring a well -designed built environment (Policy D9), 
and providing high quality  open spaces (Policy LE1). 
 
5.24.9  In response to the coronavirus outbreak the Government introduced 
measures to allow restaurants and drinking establishments such as pubs 
and cafes to operate as hot food takeaways without requiring a planning 
application. In March 2021, the Secretary of St ate confirmed these 
measures would continue to apply until March 2022 and may make them 
permanent.  
 
5.24.10  These measures would likely render this policy unnecessary. Policy C5 will 
therefore be subject to review and may be adjusted accordingly based on 
the lates t Government guidance at Regulation 19 stage.

306 POLICY C5: HOT FOOD TAKE AWAYS  
 
1. Planning permission will not be granted for hot food takeaways 
which are located in any of the following locations:  
 
a) Outside a principal, district or neighbourhood centre; or  
b) within 400 metres of secondary schools or colleges; or  
c) wards where the number of approved hot food takeaways equals 
or exceeds the Hampshire average per 1,000 population.  
 
2. Proposals for hot food takeaways in suitable locations (as 
determined by Point 1) wi ll be granted permission provided that:  
 
a) they do not cause significant harm to residential amenity; and  
b) external ventilation and extractor systems do not significantly 
harm the appearance of the building or street scene and the 
residential amenity of neigh bouring properties through noise or 
odours; and  
c) there is adequate provision for the disposal, storage and 
collection of refuse, and litter bins for use by customers are 
provided.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C5 
5.24.11  The Council is continuing to undertake  research and will publish  a Hot Food 
Takeaway Guidance Note (HFTGN)  at Regulation 19 stage  to provide 
evidence that supports this policy approach and information on  how the 
policy operates. This will be published on the Council’s website and updated 
regul arly to ensure that decisions are informed by the latest data.  
 
5.24.12  The policy aims to achieve an economically viable balance between hot 
food takeaways and other retailers across the Borough and to contribute 
towards reducing levels of obesity and poor health . It is acknowledged that 
hot food takeaways are by no means the only source of unhealthy food. It is 
also clear that the policy needs to accompany a range of other measures to 
ensure an effective approach and to maximise improvements to health and 
wellbei ng. 
 
5.24.13  It is recognised that the Borough has a wide range of existing hot food 
takeaways which provide convenience and choice to consumers. The 
Council’s approach seeks to restrict further increases and applies to new, 
expansion of existing, or the change of  use of existing retail units to hot food 
takeaways only.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
307 Restricting the location of new, expansion of existing, or the change of 
use of a premises to, a hot food takeaway (sui generis) (Point 1 of 
Policy C 5) 
5.24.14  Proposals for hot food takeaways must be loca ted to meet the requirements 
of Policy C 5 which link to a location  based criterion outlined below.  
 
a) Locations outside of the Borough’s principal, district and 
neighbourhood centres (Point 1(a) of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.15  Hot Food Takeaways fall outside of a defined use class (sui generis) but are 
considered a retail use class and therefore a main town centre use as 
defined in the NPPF Annex 2: Glossary. Consequently, proposals should be 
directed to the Borough’s c entres (as defined in Policy C1: Centres ) in the 
first instance and be subject to relevant ret ail policies in the Local Plan.  
 
b) Locations where young people are more likely to be exposed to hot 
food takeaways (Point 1(b) of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.15  No new, expansion of existing, or the change of use of a premises to, hot 
food takeaways will be permitted within 400 metres of a secondary school or 
college access point. Takeaway outlets can provide a temptation to children 
and their parents to over consume fast food with the number of outlets near 
a school li nked to school obesity rates177. By restricting hot food takeaways 
in these locations, the exposure of school children is reduced. Additional 
outlets near to schools can limit the effectiveness of schools and other 
organisations efforts to improve young peop le’s health. 400m is used as a 
proxy for a 5 -minute walk, which is considered an easy walking distance. To 
avoid ambiguity, the Council will produce maps showing the ar eas covered 
by this restriction . Plans will be  updated as necessary and published in a 
Hot Food Takeaway Guidance Note (HFTGN)  online at Regulation 19 stage . 
 
c) Locations where there is an over -proliferation of outlets which is 
above the Hampshire average (Point 1(c) of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.16  Planning permission will not be granted in a ward where th e number of 
approved hot food takeaways equals or exceeds the Hampshire average 
per 1,000 population. Using data from the Food Environment Assessment 
Tool (FEAT) or other up -to-date evidence the Council will determine the 
number of outlets in each ward per  1,000 population. For each ward, details 
of the current number of approved takeaways per 1,000 population and the 
comparison with the Hampshire average is provided in the HFTGN  and will 
included in the Council’s Authority Monitoring Report . This informati on is 
used in the determination of planning applications.   
                                            
177 Please see HFTGN for more information.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
308 d) Reducing the impact on neighbouring amenity (Point 2 of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.17  Proposals for hot food takeaways must contain information to demonstrate 
that they meet the requirements of Policy C 5. Each point links to an issue 
outlined below:  
 
e) Significant harm to residential amenity (Point 2 a of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.18  Proposals for hot food takeaways within proximity to residential units will be 
refused where it is considered that there may be significant adverse  impacts 
on residential amenity in terms of noise, vibrations, odours, traffic 
disturbance, litter or hours of operation as a result of the proposed 
premises. The Borough Council’s overall approach in relation to design is 
set out in Policy D 9: Design.  
 
f) Noise and odour extraction (Point 2b  of Policy C 5) 
 
5.24.19  Many hot food takeaways produce odours during opening hours. Proposals 
for hot food takeaways are expected to provide detail of odour -neutralising 
and ventilation equipment with the application to enab le the Council to 
assess whether the equipment would be appropriate for its purpose and 
visually acceptable. The applicant will need to supply sufficient information, 
to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority , that demonstrates that the 
equipment  will: 
 
 make provision for an acceptable level of food safety and workplace 
health and safety (i.e. remove smoke, soot, particulates, grease and 
cooking related combustion gases from the cooking area) and;  
 minimise any detrimental impact on the local ameni ty of the area and 
thus avoid constituting a ‘statutory nuisance’178. 
 
5.24.20  The Borough Council’s overall approach in relation to noise and pollution is 
set out in Policy LE9: Pollution Control.  
 
g) Refuse and litter (Point 2c of P olicy C 5) 
 
5.24.21  Litter is unsightly and can cause considerable annoyance to residents and 
adjoining businesses. It can attract vermin and take decades  to degrade, 
causing harm to wildlife and habitats. Hot food takeaways are often 
associated with litter, which can be disc arded in the immediate vicinity and 
further afield. Although the proprietor of a hot food takeaway business has 
little control over where customers drop their litter, they can act to 
significantly reduce the potential of its occurrence by providing appropr iate 
litter bins within their premises. Hot food takeaways can also generate a 
significant volume of commercial waste. Proposals should demonstrate that 
there are adequate and appropriate facilities on the site for the storage and 
collection of waste gener ated by the business.  
 
                                            
178 ‘Statutory nuisance’ is defined in part 1 of Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act (1990).  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

Introduction  
5.25.1  The Local Plan seeks to provide and promote a range of quality community 
and leisure facilities in easily accessible locations for residents, workers and 
visitors. Such facilities include:  
 
 Education: nursery, primary and secondary schools, h igher 
education ; 
 specialist vocational training;  
 Health: hospitals, GPs and health centres, clinics and specialist 
practices;  
 Care facilities;  
 Sport and leisure centres and other indoor facilities;  
 Cultural facilities: museums, libraries, theatres and cine mas;  
 Children ’s facilities  and youth clubs;  
 Community halls;  
 Public Houses ; and 
 Places of worship . 
 
5.25.2  This section includes an overarching policy on the protection and 
improvement of community facilities in the Borough ( Policy C6). 
Local Context  
5.25.3  The provision of good quality community services can enhance the quality of 
life of local residents and help address particular issues facing the Borough. 
A summary of key issues are identified in Box 20  below with a more detailed 
assessment contained with in the Infrastructure Assessment Report 2021 . 
 
BOX  20: Summary of key issues relating to community uses  
 
 Community facilities will need to meet the needs of all the community 
with particular attention to an increasingly ageing populat ion with 
implications for : 
 the provision and location of services such as health and care facilities;  
 Provision of good education facilities to increase local attainment and 
skills to improve opportunities for future employment;  
 Provision of good and acces sible health and leisure facilities to help 
alleviate ; 
 health deprivation issues;  
 Less public funding available requiring alternative arrangements to be 
made in some cases;  
 Need to increase participation in leisure and cultural activities to improve  
 physic al and mental wellbeing ; 
 Ensure community facilities are located within or adjacent to centres as 
much as possible.

POLICY C6: COMMUNITY , CULTURAL AND BUILT  LEISURE FACILITIES  
 
1. The Borough Council will support the development of new 
community, cultural and built leisure facilities179 including those 
proposed within the regeneration areas and other proposed sites.  
 
2. Proposals for community, cultural and built leisure facilities not 
allocated in this Local Plan which are considered to be a main town 
centre use will need to accord with the latest Government 
guidance.  
 
3. Planning permission will be granted for community, cultural and 
built leisure facilities provided that:  
 
a) they have good pedestrian and cycle access;  
b) there is good access to public transport services, particularly 
for facilities serving the whole Borough;  
c) they are well -designed; and  
d) they have the potential to be used as a multi -use facility.  
 
4. New residential development proposals will need to contribute 
towards providing high quality  and acces sible community, cultural, 
sports recreation  and built leisure facilities including:  
 
a) The provision of appropriate on -site facilities in relation to the 
scale and type of development for which a need has been 
identified; and/or  
b) The use of Developer Contrib utions in accordance with the 
latest Borough Council standards.  
 
5. Planning permission will not be granted for development which 
would result in the loss of the existing community, cultural, sports 
recreation180 and built leisure  facilities unless it can be 
demonstrated that:  
 
a) An assessment has been carried out which clearly shows the 
building or buildings are surplus to requirements for that 
particular purpose; or  
b) The loss resulting from the proposed development would be 
replaced by equivalent or better provis ion in terms of quantity 
and quality in a suitable location; and  
c) It can be demonstrated that there are no other viable 
community, cultural, sports recreation and built leisure facilities 
uses for the premises or site and there have been reasonable 
attempts  to sell/let them for these purposes.  
                                            
179 For the purposes of this policy commun ity, cultural and built leisure facilities relate to those types of facilities or 
similar listed in paragraph 5.21.1 rather than facilities such as local shops. Cemeteries are dealt with separately 
by Policy LE2 . 
180 This policy relates to buildings used for  sports rather than sports pitches and other open spaces which are 
dealt with under Policy LE1.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
312  
6. Planning permission will not be granted for non -leisure uses at the 
Gosport Leisure Park (as shown on the Policies Map).  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y C6  
New community and cultural facilities ( Points 1 and 2  of Policy C6 ) 
5.25.4  Proposals for new facilities as part of mixed -use proposals are set out within 
the strategic sites and allocation policies of the draft Local Plan and are 
shown on the Policies Map.  
 
5.25.5  Proposals for community facilities that are not allocated in the Local Pl an 
which are defined by national  guidance as main town centre uses including 
significant leisure and cultural facilities will need to accord with the latest 
national guidance including for example, the sequential test and impact test.  
 
5.25.6  Where possible, in o rder to support town centre s, community facilities 
should be located within or close to existing centres. However the Council 
acknowledges some facilities will have particular spatial requirements and 
alternative locations may need to be considered.  
Develo pment c riteria (P oint 3 of Policy C6)  
5.25.7  It is important that new modern facilities are situated in locations which are 
easily accessible for pedestrians and cyclists and that Borough -wide 
facilities are well served by public transport. Buildings should be well-
designed , accessible for all members of the local community and can 
incorporate a flexible design approach to allow for multiple uses wherever 
this is possible.  
Provision of community facilities in connection with new residential 
development ( Point 4 of  Policy  C6) 
5.25.8  It is important the new residential contributes towards improving the quality 
of and accessibility of community facilities including education, health and 
leisure to meet the needs of its occupants and the wider local community. In 
most instances contributions towards community facilities will be sought 
through the Community Infrastructu re Levy.  
 
5.25.9  However, in the case of major developments (over 100 dwellings) where it 
may be necessary to provide community buildings, or land on -site or clo se 
by to serve the new community, this will be secured through the use of 
Section 106 Agreements in accordance with the latest national  guidance. 
The Council will consider other site requirements and constraints when 
negotiating such provision. The Council  will enter into a Community Use 
Agreements where this will assist in securing  additional community use for 
example,  securing community use of a sports facility on an education site 
out of school hours. The Council will have regard to evidence in the 
Infrastructure Assessment Report and Infrastructure Funding Statement DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
313 (which incorporates the Infrastructure Delivery Plan) as well as the latest 
consultation with the relevant providers to inform infrastructure 
requirements.  
Protecting existing community, cultural, sport and built leisure 
facilities ( Point 5 of Policy C6)  
5.25.10  The larger community, cultural and built leisure facilities protected by this 
policy are shown on the Policies Map.  However it is important to note that 
this policy also applies to smaller  sites not shown on the Policies Map as 
well as those that are developed post adoption of the Local Plan.  
 
5.25.11  The Council has commissioned a new Playing Pitch and Built Facilities 
Assessment Council and are awaiting the final results which will inform the 
Regulation 19 version of Local Plan. However, initial findings show there is a 
need to protect indoor sports facilities and there may be a need for 
additional provision for indoor facilities and these should ideally be co -
located with existing facilities suc h as Gosport Leisure Park and educational 
and training facilities. Therefore the Council will normally resist any proposal 
that would result in a loss of existing community, cultural, sport181 or built 
leisure facilities.  
 
5.25.12  Proposals for a change of use or re development of existing facilities will only 
be considered where the Council is satisfied that the tests outlined in Point 5 
are met.  Firstly it will be necessary for the developer to demonstrate that the 
building is no longer required for its existing or recent function.  Reasons 
could include that there is no longer a local demand or that satisfactory 
provision exists elsewhere in the locality, evidence to support this will be 
required.  
 
5.25.13  In addition to meeting either of the above two tests (P oint 5a and 5b ) it will 
be necessary to demonstrate that there are no viable community, cultural, 
sports recreation or built leisure uses for the buildings or the site for which 
there are a local need.  In the case of a building used for sports it will be 
necessary to in vestigate all alternative sports uses prior to community, 
cultural an d built leisure  use. 
 
5.25.14  If the developer is proposing an alternative change of use or redevelopment, 
the applicant must demonstrate that an appropriate marketing exercise of at 
least 6  mont hs has been undertaken to try and secure a comm unity, 
cultural, sport or built leisure  use. It is acknowledged that in some cases it 
may be more appropriate to consider a longer marketing period for example, 
if the site is of particular importance or is a complex site. There may also be 
circumstances where a shorter marketing period may be acceptable if 
suffic ient justification is provided. The level of information required  to 
demonstrate this  includes: the details of the marketing including advertising 
methods which are proportionate to the nature of the premises; details of the 
prices that the properties have been marketed at, and whether this 
                                            
181 This policy relates to buildings used for sport rather than sports pitches and other open spaces which are dealt 
with by P olicy LE 1. DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
314 represents a competitive local market rate; and details of any interest 
received.  
 
5.25.15  It will also be appropriate in many cases to engage with the local community 
to ascertain whether there is any local demand for a community  use of the 
building. Consideration will be given to the location and type of facility and 
the community it serves and whether there are other such facilities in the 
area. It will also be necessary to consider the provisions of the Localism Act 
which makes provisions for assets of community value whereby local 
community  groups are given time to develop a bid and raise the funds to 
buy an asset when it  comes onto the open market.  
Gosport Leisure Park  (Point 5 of Policy C6)  
5.25.16  Gosport Leisure Park, which opened in 2012, includes a new major public 
leisure centre with associated outdoor play and sports facilities. A hotel, 
pub/restaurant, and café have also since been completed on the site. The 
site also includes the well -established ice rink. The site has been a 
successful facility and  as stated in Policy A4 there may be further 
opportunities for additional leisure facilities on the remaining portion of the 
complex. This policy aims to protect the existing mix of uses on the site from 
non-leisure uses and thereby ensuring a suitable mix of leisure uses is 
retained on the site in an accessible location within the Borough

315 5.26 LOCAL ENVIRONMENT  
Introduction  
5.26.1  The Borough’s natural environment is one of its most defining features. With 
an attractive and diverse coastline, generous and biodiverse areas of open 
space, and numerous tree -lined streets, Gosport’s high quality  natural 
environment really stands out.  
 
5.26.2  Having a flourishing natural environment delivers many benefits to the 
Borough including improved health and wellbeing, enhanced biodiversity 
and climate change adaptation, and strengthening of the local economy.  
 
5.26.3  The Alver Valley Country Park for example, provides multiple benefits 
including popular walking and cycling routes, spots for picnicking and play, 
and areas for nature conservation. This includes the Wildgrounds SSSI and 
the West of the River Reserve, whic h are protected under Policy LE6. Along 
with protecting habitats, this policy recognises the need to protect important 
species too, such as the Borough’s notable badger and bat populations.  
 
5.26.4  Looking forward, it will be important for the Borough to not just  protect what 
is has, but to build on it. In line with the new Environment Bill, Policy LE8 will 
seek to secure biodiversity enhancements from all developments, so that 
measurable  biodiversity  gains will be achieved over the plan period. Larger 
residential  developments of 50 or more units will also be required to provide 
well-designed local parks under Policy LE1, increasing the Borough’s 
quantity and quality of green and open space.  
 
5.26.5  Linking in with this, street trees will be sought from new developments u nder 
Policy LE7, along with enhanced woodland and hedge coverage; helping to 
deliver multiple benefits for the Borough, including improved soil, water and 
air quality.  
 
5.26.6  Meanwhile Policy LE2 will seek to  secure new cemetery provision to 
address the Borough’ s future need. In achieving this, it will be important to 
ensure that local amenity, heritage and ecology are suitably protected, and 
where possible, enhanced.  
 
5.26.7  With the expected launch of the England Coast Path in 2021, Gosport will 
become part of a natio nal walking trail. This will build on the Borough’s 
existing popularity as a recreational hotspot, with high quality  walking and 
cycling routes across the Alver Valley Country Park, Stokes Bay and 
Portsmouth Harbour. Policy LE4 will promote improved public  access to the 
coast and countryside, including creating new links and green corridors.  
 
5.26.8  The value of these recreational routes and the Borough’s natural 
environment has been clearly shown during the COVID -19 pandemic and 
the Council wishes to protect and  enhance these key assets with the 
policies within this section.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

Introduction  
5.27.1  Open space is an integral part of the urban fabric of the Borough and makes 
an important contribution to the quality of life of local residents.  The term 
open space covers a wide variety of forms of private and public spaces and 
provides for a diverse range of activities which can support physical health 
and mental wellbeing.  
 
5.27.2  Open space is an essential part of the urban he ritage and a strong element 
in the architectural and aesthetic form of the town. It serves a variety of 
functions including:  
 
 Defining and separating urban areas;  
 Providing linkages between settlements and the countryside;  
 Enhancing the quality and visual amenity of urban areas;  
 Providing opportunities for formal sports, children’s play and other 
leisure activities;  
 Helping to improve people’s physical and mental wellbeing;  
 Providing important habitats for flora and fauna;  
 Providing a venue for community co ntact and events;  
 Providing flood water storage;  
 Reducing the impa cts of pollution and noise; and  
 Provides a setting that encourages inward investment.  
 
5.27.3  There are several types of open spaces which are covered by the Local 
Plan, many of which perform a num ber of functions and represent the 
predominant element of the Borough’s green infrastructure (see  also 
Policies D4, D5, D6 and LE7). This section relates to the following types of 
open space:  
 
 Parks & Gardens;  
 Outdoor sports facilities;  
 Cemeteries (see also Policy  LE2) and Church Yards;  
 Provision for children and young people ; 
 Allotments  (see also Policies A 5 and LE3) ; 
 Amenity space;  
 Green corridors;  
 Natural and semi -natural ; 
 Greenspaces (See also Policies LE5 - LE7); and  
 Civic space.  
 
5.27.4  Open spaces in Gosport Borough contribute significantly to the local 
distinctiveness of the Peninsula with many having a strong relationship with 
the adjoining coastal waters of the Solent and Portsmouth Harbour. The 
Borough has  some 618 hectares  of open spa ce (excluding private gardens 
and incidental amenity areas) including natural  / semi -natural greenspaces 
in the Alver Valley Country Park and the extensive coastal areas; formal DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
317 urban parks such as Crescent Gardens; the historic park and garden at 
Royal Ha slar; allotments; a range of sports pitches; and small 
neighbourhood play areas. The full diversity of the open spaces in the 
Borough including details of their function, quality, value and size is set out 
in the Council’s Open Space Monitoring Report.  
 
5.27.5  The Borough’s open space has an important role to play in enhancing the 
quality of the environment in order that sustainable growth can be achieved 
creating a place where people want to live, visit and invest. The Borough’s 
open spaces are highly valued and represent a finite resource that should  
largely  be protected and enhanced in one of the most densely populated 
districts in the South East region.  
 
5.27.6  It is recognised that many residents have limited opportunities to access the 
wider countryside, particularl y those with restricted access to the car 
including the elderly, young people and disabled people. It is therefore  
important to make areas along the coast and the Alver Valley accessible for 
all to enjoy whilst protecting important habitats (see Policy D4 and D6 ). It is 
also acknowledged that many residents have no gardens or limited private 
areas to enjoy, highlighting the importance of local  multifunctional  open 
spaces.  
 
5.27.7  Many open spaces have the potential to be improved and it is essential that  
new deve lopments are well -served by a range of open spaces that meet the 
needs of all parts of the community. Key issues relating to open space are 
summarised below in Box 21. 
 
BOX 21: Summary of key open space issues  
 The provision of quality  open spaces is important in managing the 
recognised health and wellbeing  issues in the Borough . This has been 
particularly  recognised through the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 Open spaces are highly valued within a dense urban Borough and 
should be protected from inappropriate development  and where possible 
their quality should be enhanced . 
 Limited opportunities to access the wider countryside particularly those 
with restricted access to private transport including those with 
disabilities, the elderly and the young . 
 There are quality and/or quantity deficiencies in a range of open space 
provision including allotments, cemetery space, play space and outdoor 
sports facilities . 
 Continued improvements to enhance the accessibility to open spaces f or 
local residents is im portant.  
 Protecting and enhancing important natural habitats and increasing the 
opportunities to secure net gains in biodiversity within open space s is 
crucial.  
 Open spaces have a role to play in supporting both nutrient neutrality 
and flood risk managemen t measures in response to climate change . 
 Many open spaces have the potential to be improved and it is important 
that new development is well served by a range of open spaces . DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
318   
5.27.8  This section includes the Council’s overall approach to protecting, improving  
and creating new ope n space provision (Policy LE1).  
 
POLICY LE1: OPEN SPA CES 
 
1. Planning permission will not be granted for development proposals 
on existing open space identified on the Policies Map , except 
where:  
 
a) The redevelopment of a part of the site for recreation and/or 
community facilities would retain and enhance the existing 
facilities; or  
b) Alternative provision is made available of equivalent  or greater  
community benefit in terms of quality, quantity and accessibility 
and that the proposed site ca nnot be used for an alternative 
form of open space for which there is an identified need.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for proposals to create or 
improve open space provided that:  
 
a) They are designed t o achieve the Council’s ‘good’ quality 
standards ; 
b) They do not have a significant adverse impact on the amenities 
of local residents;  
c) They have good access for pedestrians and cyclists from the 
wider community and the open space is accessible for all;  
d) They do not have an adverse effect on nature conservation 
features and incorporate measures to enhance local 
biodiversity; and  
e) If the open space serves a Borough -wide catchment it:  
 
i. Is appropriately sited in proximity to public transport; 
and 
ii. Has adequate vehicular access and parking 
arrangements including spaces for disabled people . 
 
3. Planning permission will be granted for residential development 
(Use Class C3) provided that appropriate provision is made for 
public open space facilities in accordance with the standards set 
out below:  
 
a) For developm ents of 50 dwelling s or more on -site provision of 
public open including a ‘local park’ will be required to a 
standard of 1. 6 ha per 1,000 people and that this open space 
should be provided to the Borough Council’s ‘Good’ Quality 
Standard. Developer contrib utions should also include provision 
for the long -term  management of the open space;  
 
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
319  
b) In particular circumstances off -site provision may be considered 
appropriate for sites of 50 dwellings or more provided a financial 
contribution is secured through a Se ction 106 agreement. 
Contributions will be directly related in scale and in -line to the 
proposed development to reflect the impact the development 
has on existing green infrastructure. Such funds will be used to 
improve an existing facility normally within  800 metres of the 
development site to achieve the Co uncil’s ‘Good’ quality 
standard.  
 
For sites of less than 50 dwellings the developer contribution for 
improving public open space and associated facilities has been 
calculated as part of the Community Infrastructure Levy and 
consequently no further contribution is required. However 
proposal s should include green infrastructure elements (see Policy 
LE8). 
 
EXPLANATION OF POL ICY LE1  
Protection of existing open spaces ( Point 1  of Policy LE1)  
5.27.9  The Council will resist the loss of existing open spaces due to local 
deficiencies and the important role they play in terms of health and 
wellbeing , their recreation and amenity value and the opportunities they 
create for biodiversity, flood management an d adapting to, and mitigating 
climate change.  
 
5.27.10  The Council will normally refuse planning permission for development 
proposals resulting in a loss of open spaces identified on the Policies 
Map182. This policy will also apply to those open spaces that have bee n 
created since the Local Plan has been adopted.  
 
5.27.11  The Council’s Open Space Monitoring Report includes an assessment of 
the quantity, quality and value of open spaces in the Borough. It has been 
concluded that the protected  open spaces are necessary to reta in the 
mulitfun ctional benefits outlined above. I t is important to note that existing 
low and medium value sites have the potential to be enhanced by changing 
their function to an alternative type of open space, adding a function, or 
improving their qualit y. Such measures are likely to increase usage 
particularly where communities have been closely involved with the 
improvements.  
 
5.27.12  Sites can only be considered genuinely surplus once a full assessment of an 
individual site’s potential has been carried out. In  relation to MoD, school or 
college playing fields or other outdoor sports or recreational facilities no 
longer required for service personnel or school sports, the Council would 
                                            
182 The ‘Existing Open Space’ designation relates to most forms of open space, although the protection of 
cemeteries and allotments are dealt with by policies LE2 and LE3 respectively.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
320 wish to see the land continue in recreational use for the benefit of the loca l 
community. There are other providers of open space such as the church 
and similarly the provisions of the policy will apply.  
 
5.27.13  Development on part of an existing open space may be acceptable in order 
to provide a recreational or a community facility needed by local residents. 
Such uses could include changing rooms or a community hall. In these 
circumstances particular care will be taken to ensure the nature of the 
development is in keeping with the character and function of the open space 
and that the  proposal is compatible within existing adjoining uses and 
safeguards the amenities of local residents. Such facilities have the potential 
to encourage greater use of the adjoining open space for sports and 
recreation. Where development is proposed on play ing fields, Sport 
England, as a statutory consultee, will be consulted . 
 
5.27.14  In exceptional circumstances, planning permission may be granted for 
development at a recreational site, provided that alternative provision of 
equal or better value can be created to  serve the same community. The 
arrangements of any alternative provision will need to consider the existing 
site’s amenity and recreational value, quality of facilities, ecological 
characteristics, size and its accessibility to the community it currently 
serves.  
 
5.27.15  When considering whether an open space should be lost to development it 
will be necessary to consider all the functions that open space can perform 
and whether the particular site could be used for an alternative open space 
function for which a need has been identified.  
 
5.27.16  In relation to schools and colleges the Borough Council will consider 
proposals for the redevelopment of a part of an open space for additional 
buildings to be used in connection with education, recreational or community 
uses pro viding the character and the function of the remaining open space 
is maintained.  
Creat ing and improving open spaces (P oint 2 of Policy LE1)  
5.27.17  In order to achieve a network of high quality  open spaces it is recognised 
that a strong partnership between the Cou ncil, major landowners, 
developers and other key stakeholders at both a local and sub -regional level 
is required. The PfSH Green Infrastructure Strategy continues to provide a 
framework for delivering green infrastructure across the sub -region. 
Continued c ross-boundary working between the local authorities within 
PfSH and other key stakeholders will be key in the delivery of sub -regional 
networks of strategic open space and related green infr astructure. This is 
set out in P olicy D5: The Local Ecological Net work  and Internationally and 
Nationally Important Sites . 
 
5.27.18  Opportunities to improve open spaces have been identified in the latest 
Borough Council’s strategies and studies and it will be important to work 
with local communities to maximise these opportuniti es. Furthermore it will DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
321 be important to work with other key providers of existing open space 
including the M oD and schools to increase community usage of their open 
space.  The Council will consider the use of Community Use Agreements in 
order to assist in  securing further community use on sites where 
appropriate.  
 
5.27.19  The Local Plan contains various proposals for new open space, these are 
primarily within the Strategic Development Sites and include:  
 
 The Alver Valley Country Park (Policy D4);  
 The Ramparts at P riddy’s Hard (Policies D3 and SS2);  
 Fort Blockhouse and Haslar Victorian Gunboat Yard (Policies D3 and 
SS4-5); 
 Royal Haslar Hospital (Policies D3 and SS6);  
 Haslar Barracks and Fort Road (Policies D3 and SS7);  
 Daedalus (Policies D3 and SS11); and  
 Stokesmea d (Policy A4).  
 
5.27.20  Proposals for new open spaces and improvements to existing open spaces 
will be required to meet the Council’s ‘Good’ Quality Standards183. The 
Council aims to achieve a ‘good’ rating on all open spaces within the 
Borough and could use funds f rom the Community Infrastructure Levy on 
priority sites.  
 
5.27.21  Proposals for open space which could include associated buildings, such as 
changing rooms, must be well-designed  and have regard to the character of 
the area in accordance with other relevant polici es of the Local Plan. 
Outside of the urban area, outdoor recreational uses should reflect and 
enhance the character of the countryside and coast.  
 
5.27.22  All proposals will be considered in the light of the impact that they will have 
on the location and on the am enity of adjoining areas and neighbouring 
residents. In determining proposals the Council will have particular attention 
to hours of use, noise levels and light emissions including floodlighting (see 
Policy LE9: Pollution Control).  
 
5.27.23  Open spaces should be easily reached by pedestrians and cyclists.  Sites 
should be designed to be accessible for all users of the local community 
including wheelchair and pushchair users. The most intensively used public 
spaces should also be served by public transport , and those serving a 
Borough -wide catchment area should have adequate vehicular access and 
parking arrangements  with electric charging points as set out in Policy D12. 
Open space associated with new residential development (Point 3 of 
Policy LE1)  
5.27.24  New devel opment places additional demands on the existing inadequate 
supply and quality of open spaces. It  is important that new residential 
                                            
183 The ‘Good’ Standard is assessed against the criteria in the Council’s Lo cal Open Space Standards.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
322 development (Use Class C3) meet or exceed the standards set out in the 
Policy L E1 in order to provide adequate open space pr ovision for new 
residents. If these standards are not achieved the existing deficiencies in 
quantity, quality and accessibility will be exacerbated. Key elements of the 
standards are outlined below.  
 
5.27.25  The Borough Council’s standard includes three key elemen ts: ‘Public Open 
Space’ including local parks; ‘Outdoor Sports Provision’; and Allotments.  
These el ements are set out in  Table 7. 
 
TABLE  7: Gosport Borough Open Space Quantity Standards  
Type of open space  Standard  
Public Open Space  standard (includes the ’local 
park’  element)  1.6 ha per 1,000 
people  
 
To be provided on -site for developments of 50 dwellings or more.  For smaller developments 
this element is covered by the  Community Infrastructure Levy  
Outdoor sports provision  1.1 ha per 1,000 
people  
 
Not normally provided within a development site and could be funded by the Community 
Infrastructure Levy  
Allotments  
 0.46 ha per 1,000 
people  
Not normally provided within a development site and could be funded by the Community 
Infrastructure Levy  
 
5.27.26  The Borough Council will require developments of 50 dwellings or more  to 
provide , a total of 1. 6 hectares per 1,000 residents or 1 6m2 per person of 
public open space . This provision should be made on -site184. This provision 
will provide  at least one park to serve the development with more required 
on larger developments. All dwellings should generally be within 400 metres 
of the park provision. It is considered that the 50 dwellings threshold will 
enable a useful -sized local park to be p rovided on -site. The Borough 
Council will require the on -site provision to achieve the Bo rough Council’s 
Good Standard185. In order to meet the Council’s Good Quality Standard it 
will be necessary to assess it against the criteria set out in the relevant ope n 
space scorecard186. 
 
5.27.27  The proposed park should include all or most of the elements that make up 
the park standard, such as play areas, informal recreational elements, 
formal garden and natural features. It is recognised that there may be the 
need to change the emphasis of each element to suit the type of dwellings 
proposed, the expected age profile, the size of the site, characteristics of the 
location, the presence of on -site natural features, as well as what other 
                                            
184 It is estimated that 50 dwellings would accommodate approximately 113 residents (based on an average of 
2.25 persons per household). This is multiplied by the 16m² standard is 1,808m² approximately 0.18 hectares.  
185 See the Co uncil’s Local Open Space Standards.  
186 See the Council’s Local Open Space Standards  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
323 provision is already available in the loca lity. In some circumstances it may 
be appropriate to include outdoor sports facilities (such as a multi -use 
games areas) or allotment type facilities as part of the on -site public open 
space standard.  
 
5.27.28  The developer will be required to contribute towards t he maintenance (this 
includes the replacement of equipment) of the open space to cover a period 
of twenty five years in accordance with the Council’s standards. In addi tion 
green infrastructure that is required to be provided on -site, could be 
incorporated  as part of the open space provision.  
 
5.27.29  In certain instances it may be necessary for the developer of a proposal of 
50 or more dwellings to provide a financial contribution towards a specified 
off-site open space proposal in lieu of all or part of the requi red on -site 
provision.  This could include a new facility or an enhancement to an existing 
one. This would be secured by a Section 106 Agreement and normally be 
specific with regard to the site it is intended to be allocated to. In such cases 
the obligation  will need to meet the tests of Government legislation . 
Exceptional circumstances may relate to particular characteristics of the site 
or that there is an open space facility in close proximity to the development 
(normally within 800 metres of the developm ent) which would significantly 
benefit from improvements and help it achieve the Council’s ‘Good’ 
Standard. In certain cases the particular open space may be further than 
800 metres from the development if it has the potential to be of sufficient 
quality a nd recreational value to attract residents of the new development.  
The latest indicative costs are published on the Council’s website and 
updated each year to take into account of inflation which provide an 
indication of the sum required.   
 
5.27.30  The Borough Cou ncil recognises that on small residential developments it is 
neither desirable nor practical to make provision for open space other than 
certain elements of green infrastructure . Consequently the Borough Council 
in most instances will take a financial cont ribution in the form of the 
Community Infrastructure Levy where a proportion of money may be spent 
on new or enhanced open space provision.  These arrangements are set out 
in the Council’s Infrastructure Funding Statement.  
 
5.27.31  In relation to outdoor sports pro vision and allotment provision (see also 
Policy L E3) where quality and quantity deficiencies have been identified it is 
accepted that this provision is not normally suitable to be provided on -site 
given the characteristics of these uses.  Instead this provi sion can be funded 
by the Community Infrastructure Levy and has been calculated by using the 
standards identified in  Table 7  to inform the Borough’s overall infrastructure 
requirements .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

POLICY LE2: CEMETERY  PROVISION  
 
1. Development proposals for other uses will not be permitted on 
existing cemeteries as shown on the Policies Map.  
2. Proposals for new cemeteries will be permitted provided that they:  
a) Are in keeping with the character of the surrounding area;  
b) Do not have an adverse impact on the amenities of local 
residents;  
c) Are appropriately sited in proximity to public transport;  
d) Have adequate vehicular access and parking arrangements with 
suitable provision for disabled users and electric vehicle 
charging points;  
e) Will have  no adverse impact on the ecological value of the area  
and opportunities are taken to enhance biodiversity ; and  
f) Do not have an adverse impact on heritage or archaeological 
interests.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE2  
Protection of Existing Cemeteries (Point 1 of  Policy LE2)  
5.28.1  The Borough’s main cemetery is located at Ann’s Hill along with the large 
Royal Haslar Naval Cemetery in Clayhall Road. There are also a number of 
smaller cemeteries and church yards in the Borough. These cemeteries are 
well kept tranquil spaces often with historic monuments which add to  the 
character of the Borough. The Borough Council considers that such sites 
should be protected for this purpose and that they form an important part of 
the local townscape  character.  
New cemetery provision (Point 2 of Policy LE2)  
5.28.2  The Borough Council is responsible for providing adequate cemetery 
facilities and ensuring that a continuous supply of land is available for this 
purpose. It is likely that provision for a new cemetery could be required 
during the Plan period  due to existi ng provision at Ann’s Hill Cemetery 
reaching capacity .  
 
5.28.3  When developing a new cemetery, the Borough Council will have regard to 
the criteria in Policy LE2 and more detailed guidance published by the 
Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management on new cemeteries 
which provides advice on the selection and design of new cemeteries 
including issues relating to drainage, topography, soil types, site layout and 
landscaping. It will be necessary to liaise with the Environment Agency 
regarding the appropriaten ess of any potential location.  
 
5.28.4  The size of any cemetery is an important consideration and will need to be 
able to accommodate burials for the long-term, taking into account average DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
325 burial rates, local demographic trends and the size of grave spaces. The 
Borough Council has commissioned a feasibility study to investigate these 
issues and identify a number of potential sites for consideration by the 
Council. Work is still ongoing  to identify the best possible site to serve the 
needs of the Borough and a site  will therefore be allocated in the next 
version of the draft Local  Plan (known as the Regulation 19 or Publication 
version) and will be subject to a separate community consultation.   
 
5.29 POLICY LE3: ALLOTMEN TS 
 
POLICY LE3: ALLOTMENTS  
 
1. Planning permission will be granted for proposals to create new 
allotments and associated facilities provided:  
 
a) They are well -designed  and accessible  and that  the layout of 
plots, associated landscaping, boundary treatments and waste 
disposal and composti ng facilities should be designed so they 
are sympathetic to their surroundings;  
 
b) A net gain in biodiversity is achieved on the site;  
 
c) Appropriate provision is made for site access and car parking 
(including for people with disabilities) in accordance with Policy 
DE4 and relevant current standards; and  
 
d) Sites for new allotments should not have a detrimental impact 
on any of the following:  
 
i. Residential amenity;  
ii. Highway safety; or  
iii. Any important landscape, biodiversity or heritage 
features.  
 
2. Planning permission will not be granted for development which 
would result in the loss of allotment gardens as identified on the 
Policies Map.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE3  
New allotment provision (Points 1 of Policy LE3)  
5.29.1  Due to the high demand for allotments, land for a new allotment has been 
identified at Manor Way Lee -on-the-Solent. In addition to new allotment 
provision, there are opportunities to include the creation of a community rest 
garden or a community orchard an d wildlife meadow as part of the design. 
Further details can be found in Policy A5.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
326 5.29.2  The Council will continue to seek opportunities for new allotment sites within 
the Borough. New allotment sites and community gardens could be 
established on existing open  spaces where it is considered that this new 
function will add recreational value to the existing open space such as 
amenity open spaces.  
 
5.29.3  Allotments serve an important role in contributing towards the local Green 
Infrastructure Network  and supporting bio diversity in the Borough.  In 
accordance with Policy LE8: Securing Measurable Biodiversity Net Gain , all 
development is expected to provide a net gain in on -site biodiversity . An 
appropriate site layout, design and maintenance schedule incorporating  
native planting species in trees and hedging material, and nest boxes,  and 
beetle banks can assist this process187.  
 
5.29.4  It is important that a new allotment site is designed appropriately to ensure 
that it does not detract from its surroundings , particularly when loc ated in 
close proximity to residential areas. New allotment provision should not 
have a detrimental impact on the amenities of adjacent residents and 
highway safety; nor harm important landscape, biodiversity and heritage 
features or setting in accordance with the other policies in the Local Plan.  
Protection of existing allotments (Point 2 of Policy LE3)  
5.29.5  Gosport has ten Counci l-owned allotment sites (and one Parish site that is 
managed by  Gosport Allotment Holders and Gardeners Association) spread 
evenly ac ross the Borough , totalling an area of approximately 22.5 hectares . 
This equates to 0.27 hectares of allotment provision per 1,000 of the 
population with  in the Borough (the equivalent to approximately 1,050 
plots)188. They form an important part of Gosport’s Green Infrastructure 
Network . They provide a valuable recreational resource and have an 
important role in fostering positive ou tcomes for health and well being, 
providing opportunities for social interaction as wel l as being a key source of 
local food production and supporting nature conservation habitat. The role of 
allotments in supporting potential Gosport Food Partnership initiatives to 
alleviate food poverty and encourage healthy eating is also recognised.  
Dema nd for allotments has grown significantly in recent years with waiting 
lists for extending across the Borough189.  
 
5.29.6  The Council will resist any proposals which would result in a loss of

5.30 POLICY LE4: ACCESS T O THE C OAST AND COUNTRYSIDE  
 
POLICY LE4: ACCESS TO THE  COAST  AND COUNTRYSIDE  
 
1. The Borough Council will promote public access to the coast and 
countryside. Planning permission will be granted for  new 
development provided that:  
 
a) it will protect exist ing public acce ss to the coast and 
countryside;  
 
b) public access is incorporated within new proposals where 
possible, including taking advantage of opportunities to link to 
and enhance the Borough’s existing access network, which 
includes:  
 
i. public rights of way and permissive routes;  
ii. long -distance routes including the Millennium Promenade, 
Solent Way; England  Coast Path;  and the National Cycle 
Network;  
iii. public open space such as parks and gardens, Stokes Bay 
and the Alver Valley Country Park.   
 
c) access does not adverse ly affect important habitats and species 
through increased disturbance; and  
 
d) opportunities to create green corridors and achieve biodiversity 
net gain along access routes are taken, wherever possible.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE4  
5.30.1  The Council recognises the multiple benefits of access routes for recreation, 
health and wellbeing, and sustainable travel purposes.  It is one of the 
Council’s Strategic Priorities for the Borough to have a high quality  
waterfront environment. Public access along the coast  can enhanc e the 
quality of life for residents.  
 
5.30.2  Certain parts of the coast have good public access to the shoreline including 
Stokes Bay and the Lee -on-the-Solent clifflands. The Borough will benefit 
from the designation  of the England Coast Path in 202 1, which will form a 
continuous National Trail around the country’s shoreline. The Council aims 
to further extend public access along the coastline as opportunities arise 
within the Gosport Waterfront reg eneration area.  
 DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
328 5.30.3  Access to certain coastal areas is constrained by the extensive MoD 
landholdings at Fleetlands, Bedenham, Frater and the Haslar Peninsula.  
Where opportunities arise, such as through redevelopment proposals on 
Haslar Peninsula (see Policy SS4-8), appropriate public access will be 
sought.  
 
5.30.4  With the improvement of coastal routes and the creation of the Alver Valley 
Country Park there will be new opportunities to improve linkages to the 
wider countryside as supported by the PfSH Green Infrastr ucture Strategy 
and Hampshire County Council’s Countryside Access Plan for the Solent. 
Improved links to the countryside to the north of the Borough will also be 
sought.  
Protection  and enhancement public access (Point s 1a and 1b of Policy 
LE4)  
5.30.5  When conside ring planning applications for new development, the Borough 
Council will aim to ensure that there are no adverse impacts upon the 
access network and that opportunities to enhance access routes are 
achieved, where possible. This could include securing on an d/or off -site 
access enhancements, such as the dedication of new routes and links to the 
existing network, and contributions towards surface and planting 
improvements, additional signage and interpretation panels.  
Protection of important habitats and speci es (Point 1c  of Policy LE4)  
5.30.6  Careful consideration will be given when improving access along the coast 
and to the countryside to ensure that proposals do not adversely affect 
important habitats and species, including along the coast which contains 
internati onally designated habitats. Where applicable an appropriate 
assessment  in accordance with the Habitats Regulations will be required 
and advice sought from Natural England regarding the suitability of 
avoidance and mitigation measures.  
Creation of green cor ridors  (Point  1d of Policy LE4)  
5.30.7  As well as enhancing biodiversity, walking or cycling through green space, 
or even just viewing it , can help improve people’s mental health and 
wellbeing190. Access routes can also provide a key function as green 
corridors, li nking up different habitats. Enhancing health and wellbeing, and 
delivering a net gain in biodiversity are key national and local objectives. As 
such, the Borough Council expects developers to take advantage of all 
opportunities to ‘green’ routes, such as through including green buffers in 
new routes, or providing additional planting along existing routes, where 
appropriate.

Nature Conservation  
5.31.1  The following set of nature conservation policies must be read in conjunction 
with the strategic Policy D5 relating to the Local Ecological Network and 
internationally and nationally important sites (Section 2). This policy sets out 
the over arching principles of the LEN and the following policies provide 
detailed considerations on particular aspects  that are included in the LEN. 
Similarly some of the elements of the following policies also support 
protected species that are features of the internationally and nationally 
important sites.  
 
POLICY LE5: LOCALLY DESIGNATED  NATURE CONSERVATION SITES  
 
1. Locally designated sites such as Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINCs) and Local Nature Reserves will be 
appropriately protected and opportunities will be taken to enhance 
them.   
 
2. Planning permission will not be granted on locally designated sites 
unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the benefits of the 
proposal outweigh the need to protect the nature conservation 
value of the sit e.   
 
3. In exceptional circumstances where development is permitted the 
Local Planning Authority will ensure that any adverse impacts are 
appropriately mitigated for, with compensatory measures only used 
as a last resort.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE5 
5.31.2  Sites of  Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCS) are identified by HBIC 
following an ecological assessment and are considered by the Local Sites 
Panel . The panel comprises representatives from Natural England, 
Hampshire County Council and the Hampshire and Isle  of Wight Wildlife 
Trust for ratification, in accordance with local sites guidance  issued by 
DEFRA in 2006191. These sites are shown on the Policies Map. It is 
acknowledged that following the adoption of the Local Plan further sites may 
be identified as SINC s. These additional sites will also be covered by Policy 
LE5. A list of all the sites including those added after the Local Plan is 
adopted can be found on the Council’s website together with the list of 
qualifying criteria192. 
 
5.31.3  The Borough has two Local Nature Reserves (LNRs): the Wildgrounds (also 
a SSSI) and the West of the River Reserves. Both sites are located in the 
Alver Valley and are owned and managed by the Borough Council. LNRs

National Parks and Countryside Act 1949 (as amended by the Local 
Government Act 1972).   
 
5.31.4  All these  designated sites form an important network of habitats  known as 
the Local Ecological Network (see Pol icy D5) which suppor t a range of 
species. T he Borough Council  will continue to protect them and encourage 
and support opportunities to enhance them , including the establishment of 
buffer areas around them. The Borough Council will resist any development 
proposals which would adversely affect these locally designated sites  unless 
the benefits of the proposal outweigh the significance of the site . Where 
there is a risk of damage to a designated site, the Local Planning Authority 
will impose planning conditions or require  a Secti on 106 Agreement in order 
to secure measures that overcome any potential impacts. Such measures 
could include the long-term management of the site, restriction of 
operations , or the provision of nature conservation features to compensate 
for any such featu res lost when development takes place  to ensure that  
there is no net loss in overall biodiversity .  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
332 5.32 POLICY LE6: PROTECTI NG SPECIES AND OTHER  FEATURES OF 
NATURE CONSERVATION IMPORTANCE  
 
POLICY LE6: PROTECTING SPECI ES AND OTHER FEATURES OF  
NATURE CONSERVATION IMPORTA NCE  
 
1. Planning permission will not be granted on a site that would have 
an adverse impact on a protected species or its habitat unless it 
can be clearly demonstrated that there is an overriding need for the 
development that outweighs the  significance of the nature 
conservation feature. In such instances, the planning authority will 
impose conditions on the planning permission or require a 
planning obligation to:  
 
a) facilitate the survival of individual members of the species;  
b) reduce disturb ance to a minimum;  
c) provide alternative habitats to sustain at least the current levels 
of population of the species; and  
d) take opportunities to enhance their habitat.   
 
2. Planning permission will not be granted for development which 
would adversely affect, directly or indirectly, features of nature 
conservation importance unless it can be demonstrated that the 
justification for the development outweighs their importance for 
nature conservation or amenity value.   
 
3. Appropriate management of these features will  be secured by the    
imposition of planning conditions and by entering management 
agreements with landowners where appropriate. Where such 
features ar e lost as part of a development  proposal, the Borough 
Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to ensure 
there is a net gain  of biodiversity.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE6 
Protected Species and their habitats ( Point  1 of Policy LE6) 
5.32.1  This policy needs to be consider ed with Policy D5  relating to the Local 
Ecological Network  and development proposals should be aiming to achieve 
a net gain in biodiversity as set out in Policy L E8. There are numerous sites 
which are likely to contain animal and plant species which are  protected by 
law. F or example, householder applications relating to roof materials or 
voids  may impact upon roosting bats and nesting birds, whilst applications 
relating to trees and other vegetation could impact  nesting birds . 
 
5.32.2  Protected species are principally identified under the Habitats Regulations  
2017 (as amended) , the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981  and other Acts 
which protect particular species, such as the Protection of Badgers Act 
1992.  All local authorities have a statutory obligation to conserve biodiversity 
under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006. DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
333 The duty encourages local authorities to maximise opportunities for 
conserving and enhancing the natural environment.  
 
5.32.3  The presence of a protected species is a material consideration when  
determining a planning proposal, particularly if it is likely to result in harm to 
the species. Planning applications will therefore need to be supported by the 
relevant ecological surveys and studies if applicable, including data 
searches obtained from H BIC. It is important to note that whilst some sites 
may appear to have little or no ecological value  through  a desktop  survey,  
the ecology  of a site can be unpredictable  and there  may in fact be some  
value  present  on site. As such, the information about a site’s ecological 
status could change through the lifetime of the planning process and further 
information and/or mitigation may be needed in order to determine the 
application and prevent ecological harm.  
 
5.32.4  Where relevant the Borough Council will attach ap propriate planning 
conditions or require planning obligations in order to secure the protection of 
the particular species and take opportunities to enhance their habitat.  
 
5.32.5  The Borough Council will also consider relevant strategies and evidence 
studies when  determining planning applications. This includes the following:  
 
 The Solent Waders and Brent Goose Strategy (20 20)193 which 
identifies the most important sites for a variety of species and 
outlines a number of policies and proposals to minimise human 
impact s on such sites.  
 The Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy produced by Bird Aware 
Solent  includes detailed evidence on the impact of recreational 
disturbance generated by  proposed development around the Solent 
on important habitats. It includes a mitigation strategy which will be 
used when determining relevant proposals.  
Features of nature conservation importance  (Point s 2 and 3 of Policy 
LE6) 
5.32.6  There are a number of habitats and features outside of designated sites that 
make a significant contributi on to local biodiversity which may or may not 
contain protected species  and these also form part of the LEN (see Policy 
D5). Such features include trees and woodland hedgerows  (see also Policy 
LE7), wetlands and ponds,  river corridors and other important l ocal habitats.  
  
5.32.7  Planning applications affecting features of importance for nature 
conservation will not be determined until the impact of development is 
properly evaluated. The Council’s requirements for supporting information 
are set out in its local lis t.194 
5.32.8  Where the Borough Council considers that development proposals are 
acceptable but may result in damage to identified features, it will ensure that

334 this is minimised by use of a planning condition and/or a planning obligation 
to protect and enhance rema ining features. Provision may be required to re -
establish elements of the area affected either on -site or within the locality. 
The level of provision should ensure a net gain in  biodiversity  occurs , and 
should take account of time lags between the loss and  replacement of 
important nature conservation features as well as the risks associated with 
delivering the appropriate quality of such features. This often requires a 
replacement ratio of greater th an 1:1 to take account of these risks.  
 
 
5.33 POLICY LE7: PROTECTING AND ENHAN CING TREE, WOODLAND AND 
HEDGE COVERAGE  
 
POLICY LE7: PROTECTING A ND ENHANCING TREE,  WOODLAND AND 
HEDGE COVERAGE  
 
1. Proposals should conserve and, where appropriate, enhance tree, 
hedgerows and wo odlands coverage in the Borough.  
 
2. Developmen t which results in the loss of protected trees (including 
ancient, and veteran trees) or groups of trees (semi -ancient and 
ancient woodland) will be refused unless there are wholly 
exceptional reasons.   
 
In such exceptional cases a suitable compensation st rategy will 
need to be agreed, prepared by a suitably qualified arboriculturalist 
(or related profession), which proposes a sufficient number of 
replacement trees of appropriate species and size within the 
develop ment or the immediate vicinity.  
 
3. A minimum buffer of 15 metres will be required between the 
development and ancient woodland or ancient and veteran trees;  
 
4. Planning permission for development  on sites with  unprotected 
trees will be granted provided:  
 
a) Development does not result in an unacceptable loss of, or 
damage to existing trees;  
b) A comprehensive landscaping plan is agreed, and that suitable 
opportunities for the restoration, enhancement or planting of 
trees, woodland, and hedgerows are identified and incorporated 
within the new development;  
c) The loss or damage of non -protected but valued trees, 
woodland or hedgerows should be avoided, and if demonstrated 
as being unavoidable, appropriate mitigation measures are 
provided;  
d) Unprotected trees not retained as part of the development are 
replaced at a ratio of at least 2:1;  
e) Development proposals must demonstrate that appropriate 
protection measures are in place prior to any work on site DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
335 throughout the development process.  
 
Where it is not possible to secure sufficient tree planting within the 
site deve lopers are required to pay a sum in lieu, allowing the 
Local Authority  to plant trees at a suitable location outside the 
site. The sum will also need to cover 10 years of maintenance 
costs.  
 
5. The Council will require developers to incorporate street trees as 
part of their development to produce a higher quality development.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE7  
Overview: increasing tree coverage in the Borough (Point 1 of Policy 
LE7) 
5.33.1  Trees, woodlands and hedgerows are essential features of the Borough’s 
townscape and landscape and range from the ancient oak woodland within 
the Wildgrounds area of  the Alver Valley Country Park which is a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest ; through to s treet and garden trees which improve 
the appearance of our urban environment.  Various studies have highlighted 
the wide range of benefits provided by trees (as depicted in the reproduced 
diagram below in  Figure 3 ) and include improving air, water and soil quality, 
enhancing wellbeing and landscape character, and mitigating climate 
change and flood risk. Part s of the Borough have very limited tree coverage 
and in line with the NPPF it is important to protect existing tree and hedge 
coverage and take opportunities to increase it wherever possible , such as in 
gardens, parks and orchards .

5.33.2  Box 2 2 sets out a number of terms used  when referring to trees and 
hedgerows and their relevance to the Borough.   
DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
336 BOX 22: Definitions and relevance to Gosport  
 
Ancient or veteran tree195: A tree which, because of its age, size and 
condition, is of exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value. All ancient 
trees are veteran trees. Not all veteran trees are old enough to be ancient, 
but are old relative to other trees of the same species. Very few trees of any 
species reach the ancient life -stage.  
 
Gosport has a number of trees that fit this definition and these are currently 
being mapped as part of an ongoing project between Gosport Borough 
Council and the Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre  
 
Ancient woodland195: An area that has been wooded continuously sin ce at 
least 1600 AD. It includes ancient semi -natural woodland and planta tions on 
ancient woodland sites (PAWS).  
 
The main area classified under this defi nition is the Wildgrounds which 
forms a significant element of the eastern part of the Alver Valley Country 
Park and has been designated as a SSSI for the ecological value of the 
woodland. Other areas have been identified in the Defence Munitions Site.  
 
Tree Preservation Order196: A Tree Preservation Order is an order made 
by a local planning authority in England to protect specific trees, groups of 
trees or woodlands in the interests of amenity. An Order prohibits the cutting 
down, topping, lopping, uprootin g, willful damage and willful destruction of 
trees without the local planning authority’s written consent. If consent is 
given, it can be subject to conditions which have to be followed. In the 
Secretary of State’s view, cutting roots is also a prohibited activity and 
requires the authority’s consent.  
 
In addition, trees in a conservation area  (there are 17 in Gosport Borough) 
that are not protected by an Order are protected by the provisions in section 
211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 . These provisions require 
people to notify the local planning auth ority, using a ‘ Section 211 N otice ’, 6 
weeks before carrying out certain work on such trees, unless an exception  
applies. The work may go ahead before the end of the 6 week period if the 
local planning authority gives consent. This notice period gives the authority 
an opportunity to consider whether to make an Order  on the tree.  
 
Important Hedgerows : A hedgerow is important and protected if it is at 
least 30 years old and meets at least one of eight criteria identified by the 
Hedgerow Regulations.197

337 Protecting important trees in the Borough (Point 2  of Policy LE7) 
5.33.3  The Government’s NPPF requires that planning policies and decisions 
contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by recognising 
the intrinsic character and the wider benefits of trees and woodlands. It 
recognises that when determining planning application s local planning 
authorities should refuse permission for development resulting in the loss or 
deterioration of ancient woodland , and ancient and veteran trees unless 
there are wholly exceptional reasons and a suitable  compensation strategy 
exists. The NPPF g ives the following example as an exceptional reason:  
 
 Infrastructure projects (including nationally significant infrastructure 
projects, orders under the Transport and Works Act and hybrid bills), 
where the public benefit would clearly outweigh the loss or  
deterioration of habitat.  
 
5.33.4  The loss of trees, woodland and hedgerows  will therefore  be considered on 
a site by site basis. The applicant must provide a clear and robust reasoning 
for any proposed loss, setting out why any loss is unavoidable and justified.  
 
5.33.5  In such circumstances compensation measures will need to be agreed 
between the d eveloper and the Local Planning Authority  as submitted by the 
developer and prepared by a suitably qualified person. The package should 
be in line with the mitigation hierarchy and include  an appropriate number, 
species and size of replacement trees in an appropriate location to provide a 
net gain in biodiversity. An appropriate ongoing maintenance mechanism 
will also be required.  
 
5.33.6  Trees protected by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) make an important 
contribution to the Borough.  As the main criterion in serv ing a TPO is the 
local amenity value of an individual tree or group of trees, the Council will 
refuse consent for felling if it will harm the character o r appearance of the 
local area.  
Providing buffer zones for important trees  (Point 3 of Policy LE7)  
5.33.7  Ancient and veteran trees which are incorporated within developments will 
require at least a 15 metre buffer zone to protect trees from damage.  
Increasing tree and hedge coverage within developments and the loca l 
vicinity  (Point 4 of Policy LE7) 
5.33.8  In addition to  protecting important trees, new development retain 
unprotected trees on the site which add amenity value to the street scene. 
Where new development is proposed the preference will always be to 
incorporate  natural features into the development and developm ent should 
be designed from this first principle. Where the loss of trees or hedgerow s is 
unavoidable adequate replacement provision should be secured. All 
development must be undertaken in accordance with the British Standard 
5837 and all tree works must be carried out in accordance with British 
Standard 3998.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
338  
5.33.9  In order to deliver a net gain in trees the Council considers that any 
necessary loss of unprotected trees on the site should be replaced on at 
least a ratio of 2:1. Replacement trees should be high quality , and suitably 
sized and located.  
 
5.33.10  As part of new developments further opportunities should be taken to plant 
additional trees and hedges within the site or the local vicinity.  This will be 
expected at a standard of two trees per residential dwelling, and one tree 
per parking space or per 50 sq.m.  of gross floorspace, whichever is lower, 
for all other forms of development. Where this is not possible the Council will 
expect the de veloper to provide a commuted sum to the Council to plant 
additional trees within the Borough including maintenance costs for a period 
of 10 years.  
Street trees ( Point 5 of Pol icy LE7) 
5.33.11  Street trees make an important contribution to the Borough , and in line  with 
the NPPF the Council will require developers to make this provision 
wherever possible including as part of existing streets where practicable.  
 
5.33.12  As of 1 April 2017 trees situated adjacent to the adopted roads  are 
managed  / maintained by  Hampshire Co unty Council and consequently 
when provision is proposed it will be necessary to consult with them to 
determine any practical issues. The Borough Council will also work with 
Hampshire County Council to encourage their retention and replacement  as 
set out in HCC’s Tree Strategy 2020198.

POLICY LE8: SECURING MEASURABL E BIODIVERSITY NET G AIN 
 
1. All developments are expected to provide a net gain in on -site 
biodiversity  and where possible contribute towards the wider Local 
Ecological Network . 
 
2. Development meeting the thresholds set out below are required to 
secure a measurable net gain of biodiversity of at least a 10% 
increase in biodiversity units  for the lifetime of th e development  
and contribute towards the wider network of green infrastructure 
(see Policy D4) and the Local Ecological Network (see Policy D 5). 
The development thresholds are:  
 
a) Development of 10 dwellings or 0.5ha or more (if the  number of 
homes is not kn own) ; 
b) Development for other buildings of 1,000 square metres or more 
and a site of 1 hectare or more.  
   
3. Planning conditions or obligations will be considered to provide 
appropriate enhancement and site management measures.  
Arrangements for the long -term  management of any measures 
required will need to be appropriately secured.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE8 
5.34.1  The NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should minimise 
impacts on, and provide net gains for biodiversity. It adds that plans should 
pursue opportunities for securing measurable biodiversity net gain. The 
Planning Practice Guidance recognises  that as part of Section 40 of the 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, there is a statutory 
basis for planning to seek to minimise impacts on biodiversity and provide 
net gains in biodiversity where possi ble199. 
 
5.34.2  The Government recognises tha t we need to improve our environment by 
more than just compensating for biodiversity loss where it cannot be 
avoided or mitigated. Greener development with access to local natural 
spaces will be more pleasant and healthier places to live and work, and 
habitats and wildlife  delivered through biodiversity net gain could deliver 
wider social and economic benefits.  The increase in biodiversity relates 
directly with the Council’s overall health objectives as there is a growing 
body of evidence suggesting that li ving in greener environments is 
associated with reduced mortality.200

340 Delivering biodiversity (Points 1 -3 of LE8)  
5.34.3  The Council requires that all developm ents provide some form of net gain in 
biodiversity and this needs to be set out in the supporting material of the 
planning application. However where a development meets the thresholds 
set out in Policy  LE8 the Council will requir e a net gain of 10% as set out in 
the Government’s emerging  Environment Bill .  
 
5.34.4  In such cases the Council recommends the use of the latest version of the 
DEFRA Biodiversity Metric to calculate the biodiversity net gain requirement 
and inform the relevant ecological assessment of wha t measures will be 
delivered.  For such schemes it will be necessary to submit a Biodiversity 
Plan with the planning application which covers mitigation and enhancement 
issues.  It will also be necessary for the Biodiversity Plan to set out ongoing 
managemen t and maintenance arrangements for the proposed measures 
for a minimum of 30 year, as suggested by the emerging Environment Bill.  
However it is recognised that as part of the long-term management of the 
development maintenance measures may be required for a period  beyond 
30 years . 
 
5.34.5  Net gain for biodiversity is delivered by applying a sensitive design that 
avoids the loss of high quality  habitats, minimises the impact of 
development on a site, enhances habitats in poor condition and delivers 
desirable places to l ive by creating new habitats on -site. Biodiversity net 
gain will be secured on -site in most instances , but where this cannot be 
achieved the developer should consider enhancements in  the immediate 
locality and then the neighbourhood. In certain circumstances due to the 
type of biodiversity net gain required it may be neces sary to secure 
enha ncements further afield including at a su b-regional level utilising  habitat 
land banks agreed by the Council.  
 
5.34.6  Specific measures to be considered include:  
 
 On-site: a range of measures depending on the scale and 
characteristics of the site including the enhancem ent and creation of 
open spaces , wildflower amenity areas, soft landscaping including 
street trees and hedges,  wildlife corridors to and from and within 
developments, Sustainable Drainage Systems, green roofs and walls, 
private garden spaces designed for wildlife,  beetle banks and 
hedgeho g highways , and integrating bird and bat nesting sites within 
buildings (such as swift bricks). The Council will also consider 
working with the developer on innovative community initiatives which 
engage local residents in biodiversity projects.  
 Neighbourho od: in Gosport this could include working with major 
landowners such as the Council, Hampshire County Council and the 
Ministry of Defence to enhance local spaces such as parks, verges, 
and other land holdings for biodiversity.  
 Strategic: the use of agreed land banks for off -site local and strategic 
compensatory habitat creation and enhancement schemes. This 
could include a tariff approach.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
341 5.34.7  Developers should seek early advice from Hampshire County Council’s 
Ecology Team and give a consideration of how the b iodiversity net gain will 
support the Local Ecological Network  (see Policy D5)  which also includes 
details regarding  ecological opportunities. Opportunities may also exist to 
combine biodiversity net gain with the requirements of Policy D4 to 
contribute to wards enhancing the Borough’s Green Infrastructure Network. 
The Council will be considering producing further guidance on this specific 
issue as further  Government guidance is available.

including air, odour, noise and light pollution, do not have a likely 
significant effect upon existing and future occupiers, neighbouring 
occupiers, and the wider environment.  
 
2. Where pollution is  a material consideration proposals should 
submit an appropriate impact assessment. Where impacts are likely

  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
344 EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE9 
Overall approach  (Points 1, 2 and 3 of Policy  LE9)  
5.35.1  While many types  of development will generate some form of pollution such 
as noise, t he NPPF is clear that planning  policies and decisions should seek 
to prevent and minimise the impacts of pollution  on people and the 
environment . The Borough Council will seek to ensure that new 
development does not generate adverse  levels of pollution, particularly near 
sensitive uses and habitats. This includes ensuring development is suitably 
located, designed and laid out, and where necessary  effective mitigation 
measures are incorporated.  
 
5.35.2  Applicants should seek to direct development away from sites where 
existing or permitted operations create significant levels of pollution to which 
the occupiers of the proposal could be sensitive too. Where such instances 
occur , the Council will apply the NPPF’s ‘agent of change’ principle, and the 
provision of suitable mitigation measures prior to occupation may be 
required. Planning conditions and covenants may also be sought to protect 
existing uses and businesses from compla ints about existing and 
foreseeable nuisances arising from their operation.  
 
5.35.3  Proposals where pollution is likely to be a material consideration will be 
required to submit an appropriate impact assessment undertaken by a 
competent person. Where proposals could cause significant noise or air 
quality impacts or create significant  disturbance or intrusion during the 
demolition and construction phases, a Construction and Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) will be required to be submitted. Where 
appropriate t hese will be expected to include assessments of vehicle 
movements associated with the construction site and measures to prevent 
unreasonable impact on local parking and public transport services.  
 
5.35.4  Wherever possible, developments should seek to reduce exist ing levels of 
pollution. Such proposed will be supported by the Borough Council where 
suitable evidence can be supplied that a reduction will occur.  
 
5.35.5  The impact of water pollution is considered in Policy LE13 while Policy D9 
also addresses amenity impacts.  Policy C5 considers the amenity impacts 
from takeaways, including through noise, odours and vibrations.  
Air pollution (Points 4 of Policy LE9)  
5.35.6  The Council seeks to protect the Borough’s air quality standards through 
regular air quality monitoring.  This da ta helps form the Joint Annual Air 
Quality Reports201, which are produced in partnershi p with Fareham 
Borough Council.  
 
5.35.7  There are currently no major industries in the Borough that are significant 
generators of air pollution, with the main sources of air poll ution being road 
                                            
201 www.fareham.gov.uk/licensing_and_inspections/air_quality/aqmanagementarea s.aspx    DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
345 traffic with some contribution from shipping. There are currently no Air 
Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) in the Borough however to the north of 
Gosport - in Fareham Borough - there are two AQMAs including the area 
surrounding Quay Street Roundabout on the A32; the main access road 
serving Gosport.  
 
5.35.8  Development that would contribute to a reduction in air quality, such as 
generators of significant levels of new traffic, will be refused where air 
quality standards are likely to be breached an d the effects cannot be 
mitigated. It will also be necessary to demonstrate that major schemes in-
combination  with other development will not have a detrimental impact on 
internationally important habitats within the area. All major planning 
applications s hould be supported by suitable information to allow  full 
consideration of the impact on the air quality both on the site and in the 
wider area.  
 
5.35.9  The Council’s Overall Development Strategy (Policy D2) aims to ensure that 
sustainable development is achieved  in the Borough by focusing 
development in locations which can be served by sustainable transport 
modes (bus, walking and cycling) and where residents are served by 
appropriate facilities and employment opportunities. This overall approach 
aims to reduce t he need to travel by car and therefore reduce air pollution. It 
is recognised however that additional mitigation measures may also be 
required. National planning guidance sets out a number of examples of 
possible pollution mitigation options. Where mitigat ion is considered 
necessary the type of measure will depend on locationally -specific factors, 
the type of development and whether the mitigation measures are 
proportionate to the likely impact. Mitigation measures could include:  
 
 Ensuring the design and layout of the development allows sufficient 
separation distances from sources of air pollution;  
 Using green infrastructure, in particular trees or hedges, to create a 
barrier from pollution;  
 Incorporating means of filtration and ventilation;  
 Including infr astructure to promote transport with a low impact on air 
quality (such as electric vehicle charging points);  
 Controlling dust and emissions from construction, operation and 
demolition; and  
 Contributing funding to measures designed to offset the impact on 
air quality from new development.  
Noise pollution (Points 5 and 6  of Policy LE9)  
5.35.10  Noise from development can cause unacceptable impacts on the health and 
quality of life of local residents , occupiers  and wildlife202. The Borough has 
significant transport movem ents within it and other noise -generating 
                                            
202 The NPPF emphasises the need to mitigate and reduce adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
unacceptable levels of noise from new development including, where appropriate through the use of planning 
conditions.  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
346 activities including industrial, aviation and maritime activities, and as such, 
the control and mitigation of noise pollution is a notable concern.  
 
5.35.11  Under D EFRA ’s Noise Policy Statement for England203 and the associ ated 
Noise Action Plan204, the Borough is designated as a ‘Noise Receiving 
Authority’ as part of the Portsmouth Urban Area  which covers Portsmouth, 
Gosport and parts of Fareham, Havant and East Hants. The provisions  
within the Noise Policy Statement and Nois e Action Plan to manage 
additional significant sources of noise within the Borough therefore apply. 
The Noise Policy Statement has the following aims:  
 
 Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
noise ; 
 Mitigate and minimise adverse impacts on health and quality of life 
from noise ; 
 Where possible, contribute to the  improvement of health and quality 
of life through effective management and control of noise . 
 
5.35.12  In line with the Noise Policy Statement and the Noise Exposure 
Hierarchy205, where a development would generate significant levels of 
noise, or a sensitive development would be located in an area with noise 
above the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (see Box 23), suitable 
mitigation measures will be expected. Where noise levels would be above 
the Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level, development may be refused 
unless suitable mitigation is provided.  
 
BOX 23: Definitions of Noise  
 
What constitutes LOAEL and SOAEL will depend upon how various factors 
combine in  a particular situation and can include , amongst other factors,  the 
source and absolute level of noise, the time of day, the frequency and 
pattern of occurrence , and the sensitivity of the people affected.  
 
Lowest Observe d Adverse Effect Level  (LOAEL)  
Noise can be heard and causes small changes in behaviour, attitude or 
other physiological response, e.g. turning up volume of television; speaking 
more loudly; where there is no alternative ventilation, having to close 
window s for some of the time because of the noise. Potential for some 
reported sleep disturbance. Affects the acoustic character of the area such 
that there is a small actual or perceived change in the quality of life.  
 
Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level  (SOAEL)  
This is defined as when: noise causes a material change in behaviour, 
attitude or other physiological response, e.g. avoiding certain activities 
during periods of intrusion; where there is no alternative ventilation, having 
to keep windows closed m ost of the time because of the noise. Potential for

347 sleep disturbance resulting in difficulty in getting to sleep, premature 
awakening and difficulty in getting back to sleep. Quality of life diminished 
due to change in acoustic character of the area.  
 
 
5.35.13  Where noise is likely to be a material consideration, a noise impact 
assessment must be submitted alongside a planning application. The 
Council will expect any proposals likely to generate noise (including 
construction noise) to take account of the impact of this on any noise -
sensitive populations. Similarly, in assessing proposals for noise -sensitive 
development, the Council will expect the developer to take into account 
existing noise levels and foreseeable changes to these. Where required, a 
noise assess ment which will be expected to:  
 
 Identify all significant sources of noise;  
 Determine the relevant noise exposure category;  
 Assess the likely short and long-term impacts of noise generated or 
exposure to noise;  
 Propose noise protection measures; and  
 Demons trate that there is no significant effect on the integrity of 
European Designated Sites and other important nature 
conservation interests within the vicinity.  
 Have regard to DEFRA ’s most up -to-date Noise Policy Statement 
and Noise Action Plan , and other re levant studies.  
 
5.35.14  For flats and terraced houses , wherever possible  developers should aim to 
achieve higher sound insulation standards than  those stipulated within  the 
Building Regulations206 for the purposes of p rotecting residential amenities . 
Additional  guidance on noise control can be found in the Further Information 
box at the end of this section.  
Light pollution (Point 7 of Policy LE9)  
5.35.15  Lighting provides valuable benefits to society including through increasing 
safety, extending opportunities for sport , recreation and commerce, and 
tackling crime and antisocial behaviour. Excessive and unnecessary lighting 
in inappropriate locations however can have negative impacts upon the 
appearance and amenity of an ar ea and the natural environment.  
5.35.16  When assessing p roposals which include outside lighting it will be 
necessary to ensure proposals have a good standard of design which 
considers the following:  
 
 the potential impact on the amenities of local residents and those 
particularly sensitive to light intrusion;  
 the need to reduce wasted light to limit light pollution and reduce 
energy consumption;  
                                            
206 Performance standards set out in the Building Regulations provided for England in Approved Document E

348  the need to maintain intrinsically dark areas for nature conservation 
or local character, where this is appropriate;  
 ensure that there is no significant effect on the in tegrity of European 
sites within the vicinity;  
 the need to ensure a safe environment for users at night ; and  
 highway safety issues . 
 
5.35.17  All lighting should be the minimum necessary to be effective and be 
designed to limit spillage above the horizontal plane. All major applications 
are required to submit a lighting assessment. In certain other cases it may 
also be appropriate to prepare a lighting scheme where the proposal may 
have a particular impact as outlined above.  
 
5.35.18  Proposals for th e lighting of buildings within c onservation areas will be 
assessed against the relevant policies in the Local Plan in particular Policy 
D10: Heritage Assets and current best practice207. 
 
5.35.19  Proposals for o utdoor lighting outside of the U rban Area Boundary will not 
normally be accepta ble however there may be certain instances where 
schemes are necessary for particular functions and consequently it will be 
necessary to minimise the impact of any lighting.  
 
5.35.20  Planning conditions regarding the use of lighting may be appropriate in 
some inst ances. Further advice relating to the consideration of light pollution 
is set out in national planning guidance208 and the Institute of Lighting 
Professional’s Guidance Note209.

POLICY LE10 : CONTAMINATED AND UNSTABLE LAND  
 
1. Where development proposals are submitted on or near a site that 
is known to be, or may be, contaminated an applicant should carry 
out a risk assessment and submit a report of the findings in order 
to establish the nature and extent of the contamination.  
 
2. Development proposals will not be permitted unless practicable 
and effective measures are proposed to treat, contain or control 
any contaminants so as not to:  
 
a) expose the future occupiers of the development and 
neighbouring land uses, including the users of gardens, to 
unacceptable risk;  
b) cause the contamination of adjoining land or allow such 
contamination to continue; and  
c) cause pollution of the water environment including 
groundwater, the River Alver, Portsmouth  Harbour and the 
Solent.  
 
3. Where development proposals are submitted on land which is 
either unstable or has the potential to become unstable, the 
Borough Council must be satisfied that any such instability can be 
reasonably overcome. In circumstances where  unstable land may 
be present, the developer will be required to submit a stability 
report at the planning application stage.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE10  
Land  Contamination ( Points  1 and 2 of Policy LE10 ) 
5.36.1  Development can provide important opportunities to restore land which may 
be contaminated. Contamination can give rise to hazards which put at risk 
people working on the site and the occupiers and users of the proposed 
development, so appropriate measures need to be taken . Every measure 
should be used through the development process to facilitate and enhance 
the remediation of land affected by contamination.  
 
5.36.2  As a minimum  standard,  land should  be made  useable  for development  in 
accordance with the provision s of national pollution control regimes 
including those  identified  in the National  Planning  Policy  Framework  (or 
equivalent) and the latest Government guidance210. Where a site is affected 
by contamination issues, responsibility for securing safe development  rests 
with the developer and/or landowner.  
 
                                            
210 www.gov.uk/government/publications/contaminated -land-statutory -guidance    DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
351 5.36.3  Where land contamination may be an issue, early pre -application meetings 
with the Borough Council and the Environment Agency are advised. The  
standard of investigations, assessments, including risk  assessments, 
remedial schemes and verification reporting  should  follow  current  UK good 
practices and be carried out by a competent person . As a minimum, a 
contamination assessment will be required on all sites within 250m of a 
landfill site and on all site s where previous uses may have resulted in land 
contamination and on all sites where contamination is known. The minimum 
information required in these instances should be a desk study, initial 
conceptual model and risk assessment.  
 
5.36.4  A developer  will need  to satisfy  the Council  that unacceptable  risks from 
contamination will be successfully addressed through remediation measures 
and will not  cause  undue  environmental  impact  either  during  the 
construction phase  or after the completion  of the development. Mitigation 
measures will be secured by condition and/or planning obligations to ensure 
that any likely significant negative effect is mitigated to an acceptable level 
prior to the occupation of the development. As a minimum developed land 
shou ld not be capable of being determined as contaminated land under Part 
IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.  
 
5.36.5  Other policies relating to specific development sites as well as the policies 
relating to water resources and waste are also applicable in  relation to the 
issue of contamination.  
Unstable  Land (Point 3 of Policy  LE10 )  
5.36.6  Making the best use of land is a key Government objective.  In doing so it is 
necessary to  ensure that the site is suitable for its new use.  Development of 
land which is either  unstable or is potentially unstable can be successfully 
developed  provided  that all the remedial,  preventative  or precautionary 
measures  are identified  and put in place  at the earliest  stages  of the 
development process. As is the case with sites that are contaminated, 
where a  site is affected by land instability responsibility  for securing the safe 
development  of such land rests with the developer and/or land owner.  
 
5.36.7  Where land is known to be unstable or has the potential to become so, an 
applicant  should  ensure a co mpetent person carries out a risk  assessment 
and submits a  report of the findings in order to establish the nature and 
extent of the instability and details of the mitigation measures proposed. 
Through the remediation process it will be necessar y for developers to 
ensure that proposed mitigation measures do not adversely impact on the 
natural environment.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

POLICY LE11 : HAZARDOUS SUBSTANC ES 
 
Where devel opment is proposed in locations where hazardous 
substances may be a cons ideration the following applies:  
 
1. Planning permission for development involving the use, movement 
or storage of hazardous substances will not be granted if there is 
an unacceptable ris k to public health and safety, neigh bouring land 
or the environment; and  
 
2. Development within the vicinity of a site known to be used for the 
storage, use or transport of hazardous substances will not be 
granted planning permission if there would be an unacceptable risk 
to public health and safety.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE11  
Hazardous  substances (Points 1 and 2 of Policy LE11 ) 
5.37.1  Hazardous substances include certain gases, liquids and explosive 
chemicals. If not carefully controlled these substances can pose 
unacceptable risks to people and wildlife, and create air, water, soil and 
noise pollution and land instability. Wherever possible development should 
seek to lower risks and improve local environmental conditi ons. 
 
5.37.2  In addition to requiring planning permission, developments which include 
hazardous substances may also require a Hazardous Substances Consent 
and/or an Environmental Permit. The Health and Safety Executive and the 
Environment Agency have responsibili ties on advising local authorities on 
the potential hazards of any proposed development, including alterations to 
existing hazardous installations. The Borough Council will take into account 
any advice received from these and other statutory agencies in de termining 
such applications. Separate health and safety law is also in place to ensure 
measures are taken for the safe use of hazardous substances.

POLICY LE12 : SAFEGUARDING ZONES  
 
Development will be granted for proposals which do no conflict with 
identified safeguarding zones.  
 
1. The Borough Council will consult appropriate organisations before 
granting planning permission for certain types of development 
which fall inside identified safeguarding zones.  
 
2. Proposals including the construction of new buildings and 
structures should no t interfere with broadcast and 
telecommunications services.  
 
EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE12  
Identified safeguarding  zones (Point 1 of Policy LE12 ) 
5.38.1  There are a number of safeguarding zones within the Borough which have 
design implications for proposed buildings within these areas. There may 
also be restraints on particular uses in some instances. As the boundaries of 
these areas can be subject to change at short notice the Borough Council 
has not shown them on the P olicies Map. Instead the latest areas are shown 
on the Council’s website211. 
 
5.38.2  Under the provisions of the Government Circular 01/03: Safeguarding 
aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas the 
Borough Council is required to consult the  relevant organisation regarding 
development proposals for buildings, structures and works within the 
safeguarding zones. The types and characteristics of each safe guarding 
zone are set out below:  
 
 Defence Munitions Safeguarding Zone : This area covers 
Bede nham and Frater as well as parts of Hardway and Elson and the 
precise boundaries are subject to change. The Defence Infrastructure 
Organisation (DIO) will need to be consulted in this instance who will 
advise developers on issues such as buildings material s and 
construction techniques for proposals within this safeguarded area.  
 
 Aerodrome Safeguarding Zone for Daedalus : The outer boundary 
of this safeguarded area covers most of the Borough and may have 
implications for building heights. The inner zones have  the most 
stringent safeguards. The Civil Aviation Authority and airfield operator 
are the relevant organisations for consultation in this instance where 
height specifications are exceeded.  
 
                                            
211 www.gosport.gov.uk/GBLP2038   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
355  Fleetlands Safeguarding Zone : There are various height and 
constr uction material restrictions associated with different zones 
around this helicopter services facility as well as the requirement to 
consult on particular types of uses which could increase bird activity.  
 
 Southampton Airport Safeguarding Zone:  This covers the whole 
Borough and the relevant authorities must be consulted on any 
applications for wind farm proposals within a 30km radius of the 
airport due to the potential for interference with radar signals and 
disruption to air traffic control systems.  
Interfe rence with broadcast and telecommunications services  (Point 2 
of Policy LE12 ) 
5.38.3  There is a need to ensure new buildings and structures do not interfere with 
broadcast and telecommunications services as set out in the NPPF.

356 5.39 POLICY LE13: WATER RE SOURCES  
 
POLICY LE13 : WATER RESOURCES  
 
The Borough Council together with its partners will seek to manage 
the use of water resources  through the following measures:  
 
1. Development proposals which would have an adverse effect on the 
quality of surface, ground or coastal water will not be permitted in 
accordance with the Water Framework Directive. New development 
should take opportunities to enhance these resources wherever 
possible.  
 
2. Development proposals will be permitted provided that the 
necessary water resources are available. New residential 
development proposals should include measures that will reduce 
the consumption of water to 100 litres per person per day 
(including external water use).  
 
3. Development proposals will be permit ted provided that they 
facilitate the efficient use of new and existing sewerage 
infrastructure. In cases where these are deficient, development 
proposals and their occupation should be phased to coincide with 
the provision of necessary wastewater infrastr ucture so as to 
safeguard the environmental qualities of the area. It will also be 
necessary to:  
 
a) Ensure that existing underground sewers are not built over and 
future access to the existing sewerage infrastructure must be 
secured for operational, maintena nce and upsizing purposes;  
b) Ensure that surface water is separated from existing foul or 
combined sewers; and  
c) Where required, construct on -site and off -site sewers to 
adoptable standards to ensure they function effectively and that 
adequate capacity is prov ided to serve the development.  
 
4. Development proposals which incorporate, where practical, the use 
of sustainable drainage systems will be permitted, provided that:  
 
a) Sewerage, sewage disposal facilities and surface water drainage 
of adequate capacity and de sign are available;  
b) The required capacity will be provided prior to the occupation of 
the development; and  
c) Appropriate long -term  management arrangements are made for 
their maintenance.  
 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
357 EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE13  
Water quality (Point 1 of Policy LE13 ) 
5.39.1  It is necessary to protect water resources from all sources of pollution in line 
with the Water Framework Directive ( see Box 2 4). This includes protection 
from existing or potentially contaminated land which has the potential to be 
disturbed through new co nstruction. It will also be necessary to ensure that 
the operation of new development through its use, or the infrastructure 
required to serve it, does not cause pollution or worsen existing problems.  
 
5.39.2  The Borough Council will seek guidance from the Enviro nment Agency 
when this issue is likely to be a material consideration in assessing planning 
applications. It will be necessary to ensure:  
 
 That foul water and surface water drainage are separated for new 
developments;  
 Water efficiency standards are adhered  to; and  
 Sustainable urban drainage systems are used wherever possible to 
help protect and enhance the water environment.  
 
BOX 24: Water Framework Directive  
 
The European Water Framework Directive came into force in December 
2000 and became part of UK law in December 2003.  The Directive aims to 
ensure that there is ‘no deterioration of water quality and improvements are 
made where possible to achieve a ‘good status’ for all ground and surface 
waters (rivers, lakes, transitional waters and coastal waters).  Ecological and 
chemical attributes are assessed when determining its quality.  
 
Water consumption (Point 2 of Policy LE13 ) 
5.39.3  Population, household size and affluence all affect how much water is 
consumed. Climate change is also likely to  affect demand placing greater 
pressure on future water supply. To meet current and future need it is 
essential that the demand for water is managed sustainably. Whilst new 
homes account for a relatively small proportion of total water consumption, 
the add itional demand they represent can be significant.  
 
5.39.4  Water efficiency provides other benefits as well. It increases the amount of 
water available for other purposes, such as agriculture, and can reduce the 
amount of water that has to be abstracted from water  sources including 
those that contribute to the integrity of habitats of international importance. 
Reducing water consumption can also have a positive impact on water 
quality and reduce the amount of energy and chemicals used in providing, 
distributing and  treating it.  
 
5.39.5  The Borough Council will require new development to meet the water 
efficiency standard of 100 litres per person per day (including external water DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
358 use) in accordance with Southern Water’s ‘Target 100’ goal212. The 
Environment Agency has identified the need for water efficiency measures 
in South Hampshire which can also maintain and enhance water quality 
within the Borough as well as reduce pressure on the Peel Common 
Wastewater Treatment Works (operated by Southern Water). Similarly this 
approach accords with Portsmouth Water’s overall objectives to increase 
water efficiency as set out in its latest Water Resources Management 
Plan213. 
Wastewater (Point 3 of Policy LE13 ) 
5.39.6  Southern Water provides the sewage and wastewater infrastructure for the  
Borough and have identified that there are capacity issues within South 
Hampshire which are required to be dealt with using a number of initiatives, 
including the ‘Target 100’.214 The separation of surface water from foul 
sewers will release capacity in the  foul sewer thus making more efficient use 
of it and minimising the risk of flooding.  
 
5.39.7  It will be necessary to ensure that future access to sewers for the purposes 
of maintenance and upsizing is secured. This requires that sewers are not 
built over and eas ements of 6 to 10 metres wide are required dependent on 
the size and depth of the infrastructure. Any pumping station on -site will 
require 15 metres clearance to the nearest habitable room. The layout of 
development should take these sewerage infrastructur e requirements into 
account or make allowance for diversions at the developers’ expense.  
Sustainable Drainage Systems (Point 4 of Policy LE13 ) 
5.39.8  The use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)215 within new 
developments can have a number of benefits including i mproving water 
quality, reducing flood risk (see Policy D8), contributing to local green 
infrastructure (see Policy D4) and enhancing biodiversity (see Policy LE8), 
all of which can make areas more desirable to live in. Importantly SuDS can 
reduce the spee d and amount of storm water and thereby reduce pressure 
on sewers and surface water flooding and prevent pollution of the local 
environment.  
 
5.39.9  By incorporating natural processes SuDS can assist with managing water 
resources sustainably and protecting local water quality and thereby helping 
to achieve the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. 
SuDS can include a number of different elements including green roofs, 
permeable pavements, rainwater harvesting, infiltration trenches, swales 
and ret ention ponds.  
 
5.39.10  It is important that the incorporation of SuDS into the design of 
developments should be informed by relevant contamination investigations; 
otherwise there is a risk of re -mobilisation of any contaminants in the soils

POLICY LE14 : WASTE AND MATERIAL  RESOURCES  
 
1. The Borough Council will have regard to the latest Hampshire 
Minerals and Waste Plan and associated strategies and guidance 
when considering new development.  
 
2. Planning permission will be granted for the provision of waste 
facilities to serve the Borough’s needs in accordance with the 
adopted Hampshi re Minerals and Waste Plan provided that there 
are no adverse impacts on:  
 
a) Residential amenity;  
b) The highway network;  
c) Heritage assets; and  
d) Biodiversity interests.  
 
3. Proposals for all new development should use recycled materials 
and local secondary aggregat es in the construction process 
wherever possible.  
 
4. The layout and design of all new forms of development should 
provide adequate space to facilitate the storage, re -use and 
recycling of materials as well as composting facilities where 
appropriate.  
 
5. Develop ment proposals involving reclamation and/or dredging will 
not be permitted except for essential maintenance dredging or 
coastal protection works and subject to the following 
considerations set out in criteria below.  The proposed development 
will not:  
 
a) Have  an individual or cumulative adverse impact on 
internationally important habitats;  
b) Have a detrimental impact on other important biodiversity 
interests as outlined in the relevant policies of the Local Plan;  
c) Harm marine archaeological sites;  
d) Have an adverse  impact on the hydrology of the area; and  
e) Have an adverse impact upon ground stability;  
f) Have an adverse impact on the visual amenity of the area.  
 
  DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
361 EXPLANATION OF POLIC Y LE14   
Overall approach ( Point  1 of Policy LE14 ) 
5.40.1  The Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan (HMWP)216 was adopted in 2013 
by Hampshire County Council217, which is the minerals and waste authority 
for the Gosport Borough area and consequently forms part of the 
development plan.  
 
5.40.2  The HMWP aims to safeguard  mineral resources within the Plan area as 
well as infrastructure sites associated with minerals and waste. These are 
set out in ‘ Appendix B – List of Safeguarded Minerals and Waste Sites ’ of 
the HWMP. The safeguarded list will be updated through monitorin g of the 
Plan. Sites in Gosport include:  
 
 The Material Recovery Facility at the Cranborne Industrial Estate;  
 The Metal Recycling Site at the Quay Lane Industrial Estate;  
 The Household Waste Recycling Centre off Grange Road; and  
 The Concrete Batching Plant off Fareham Road.  
 
5.40.3  Proposals for these, and any additional sites would need to accord with the 
relevant policies of the HWRP.  
 
5.40.4  Whilst Hampshire County Council is the waste authority for the Gosport 
area, the Borough Council has responsibilities to collect domestic waste. 
Waste has become a major issue for the South Hampshire sub -region due 
to the lack of landfill sites and this has informed the HWMP and 
consequently it aims to increase  the efficiency  of the use of materials  in the 
Borough.  Key consideration s include:  
 
 Reducing and re -using waste ensuring that development minimises 
primary aggregate use and encourages the use of high quality  
building materials made from recycled and secondary resources;  
 Increasing recycling and composting ensuring the design of 
development provides adequate facilities to enable storage, recycling 
and composting; and  
 Ensuring specialist facilities are provided including energy recovery 
from waste biomass.  
Location of waste facilities (Point 2 of Policy LE14 ) 
5.40.5  In relation to the last point above the Borough Council will be supportive of 
small enclosed facilities on existing employment sites rather than large open 
facilities which are unlikely to be appropriate to a densely urban area. Such 
schemes  will need  to be appropriate  to the character  of the area and 
consideration given to amenity and access issues as well heritage and 
nature conservation interests.   
                                            
216 www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/strategic -planning/hampshire -minerals -waste -plan  
217 The plan was also adopted by the other Hampshire Authorities which include Portsmouth City Council, 
Southampton City Council, the  New Forest National Park Authority and the South Downs National Park Authority.   DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
362 Recycled materials and local aggregate (Point 3 of Policy LE14 )  
5.40.6  Developers for most forms of developments are required to p repare Site 
Waste Management Plans to ensure construction waste is reduced.  
Waste and recycling storage (P oint 4 of Policy LE14 ) 
5.40.7  The Borough Council places a high degree of im portance in ensuring that 
suita ble provision is made for waste and recycling stor age in new 
businesses and homes. This can help facilitate less waste to landfill and 
increase rates of recycling and composting. Appropriate storage can also 
improve the appearance and character of a neighbourhood. Further 
guidance is contained within  Policy DE2: Residential Design and the 
Council’s Design SPD218. 
Reclamation and dredging (Point 5 of Policy LE14 ) 
5.40.8  Historically reclamation of land from Portsmouth Harbour has taken place at 
a number of locations within the Local Plan area including Coldharbour, 
Haslar, Forton, Frater and Fareham Lakes. Policy D5 includes a 
presumption against further reclamation, particularly where proposals would 
have detrimental impact on internationally important habitats within the area 
as well as other important nature conse rvation interests (see Policies D5, 
LE5-7). 
 
5.40.9  Dredging and reclamation can also have an adverse impact on the visual 
amenity of area and could have adverse effects on the hydrology of the 
Harbour and the Solent. Proposals will also need to take account of m arine 
archaeo logical sites ( see Policy D10). 
 
5.40.10  However the Policy recognises that there are particular types of proposals 
which may be necessary including: maintenance dredging to enable the 
continuing use of navigation channels for marine craft; and measures 
associated with necessary coastal protection works. Such proposals would 
be subject to the key consideratio ns set out in the Policy.  
 
5.40.11  A marine licence may be needed for activities involving a deposit or removal 
of a substance or object below the m ean high water springs mark. The 
Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is responsible for issuing marine 
licences under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Any works may 
also require consideration under The Marine Works (Environmental Impact 
Assessment)  Regulations 2007 (as amended). Early consultation with the 
MMO is advised .

364 6.0 IMPLEMENTATION  AND MONITORING  
INTRODUCTION  
 
6.1.1  The policies and proposals  of the Local Plan will be implemented through a 
number of mechanisms, which are outlined in this section and include:  
 
 The use of planning delivery mechanisms by the Local Planning 
Authority  including  determining planning applications, S upplementary 
Plann ing D ocuments  and Local Development Orders; and  
 Regular m onitoring to ensure that the policies and proposals outlined 
in the Plan are being implemented and if not, to understand the 
reasons for this and act accordingly.  
 
IMPLEMENTATION  
 
6.1.2  The policies an d proposals of the Local Plan will be implemented in three 
main ways:  
 
 The Development Strategy and strategic policies set the overall 
context and parameters for appropriate land uses and will guide the 
type, location and nature of future development propo sals across the 
Borough;  
 Strategic Development Sites and allocation policies allocate land for 
specific types of development and set site-specific  development 
criteria; and  
 General development policies set detailed criteria for types of 
development or specific planning issues, against which planning 
applications for development will be assessed.  
 
6.1.3  There are several mechanisms which can be used to deliver the policies 
and proposals of the Local Plan, which are set out below:  
Development Management  
6.1.4  All Local Plan policies will be used in the process of determining planning 
applications  by the Local Planning Authority.  Advice on submitting a 
planning application can be found on the Council’s website.219 Where there 
is unauthorised development the Council will, where appropriate, undertake 
enforcement action in line with its Corporate Enforcement Policy.  
Partnership Working  
6.1.5  The Council will undertake its many roles including service provider, policy 
make r and landowner to work with other  organisations at national, sub -
regional and local level s to implement the Local Plan policies. In fulfilling the 
Duty to Cooperate the Council will work with all the organisations listed 
below . In particular, the Local Pl anning Authority will continue to work

Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)  
6.1.6  The Borou gh Council will continue to review if there is a need for further 
SPDs to be  produced during the Plan Period. Details of SPDs are kept up -
to-date on the Council’s website  at: www.gosport.gov.uk/SPD  
Local Development Orders  
6.1.7  Local Development Orders  (LDOs) were introduced in the Planning  and 
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to simplify the planning process by 
removing the need for planning permission, where this is considered 
appropriate and proportionate. LDOs can apply to a specific type of 
development or permit any development in a designa ted area,  and may 
grant planning permission outright or with conditions. If a local authority 
wishes to make an LDO it must undertake public consultation on it and 
submit it with any modifications to the Secretary of State who can decide if 
he wants to int ervene. Once the Secretary of State is satisfied with the 
Order it can be adopted by the local authority.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
6.1.8  The Localism Act 2011 allows communities to produce a Neighbourhood 
Plan. This allow s residents, employees and businesses to wo rk together 
through a neighbourhood forum and provide a shared vision for their 
neighbourhood and shape the developme nt and growth of the local area . 
These plans can be used as the basis for determining planning applications. DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038  
366 Neighbourhood Plans220 are requi red to be in accordance with national 
planning policy and the Borough Council’s Local Plan as well as other legal 
requirements. Once written the plan will be independently examined and put 
to a referendum of local people for approval. If the plan is approv ed by a 
majority of those who vote it will be brought into force.  
 
6.1.9  In addition or alternatively these communities can make a Neighbourhood 
Development Order221 which will grant planning permission for certain types 
of development that they want to see. Neighbourhood Development Orders 
will need to be independently examined and put to a referendum of local 
people for approval. Neighbourhood Plans and the Developm ent Orders 
should not be used to promote less growth than identified in the Local Plan.  
 
MONITORING  
 
6.1.10  It is important that the Local Plan has clear arrangements for monitoring the 
implementation of the policies and proposals set out in the Plan. Monito ring 
is essential for an effective strategy and will provide the basis on which 
alternative approaches would be triggered. It is important that measurable 
outcomes are set out to assist this process.  Regular monitoring will be used 
to assess the Local Plan ’s impact and whether or not the delivery of the 
Local Plan Vision and Objectives are being achieved.  
 
6.1.11  The Authority  Monitoring Report (AMR) will be the main tool for monitoring 
progress. The Council has produced an AMR since 2005 and this will 
continue in order to successfully monitor the policies and proposal s of this 
Local Plan. The AMR is available online: www.gosport.gov.uk/AMR   
 
6.1.12  The Borough Council also produces a more detailed set of contextual 
indicators  set out in the Gosport Profile  online: 
www.gosport.gov.uk/gosportprofile   
 
6.1.13  Table 8 includes a number of monitoring output indicators in order to 
monitor the Local Plan. It may be necessary to monito r additional areas as 
the Plan is implemented, where applicable this will be set out in the AMR.

REVIEW  
 
6.1.14  The Local Plan has been prepared in a way that is flexible and a ble to adapt 
to change. However  it will be subject to continual monitoring to ensure that it 
remains relevant, effective and in accordance with national requirements. In 
addition, and in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF), a review of the Local Plan will be un dertaken within five years of 
adoption. At any stage when a partial or full update of the Plan is required 
this will be reported within the Council’s Authority Monitoring Report and the 
timetable for the review will be set out in the Local Development Sche me:

392 APPENDIX 2: HOUSING TRAJECTORY  
 
The housing trajectory identifies how Gosport’ s housing provision set out in P olicy 
D2: Development Strategy  will be met over th e plan period. It annualises the housing 
target of 3,344  from 2021 to 2038 to represent 197 dwellings per year. This 
annualised figure is then compared to the projected housing completions.  
 
The ‘Monitor ’ line shows how Gosport is performing in comparison to the required 
rate. It can be seen from the trajectory that Gosport is making provision for more that 
its annual requirement . It shows that by identifying additional supply of dwellings 
there is sufficient  flexibility to ensure that the target is met.  
 
The ‘Manage ’ line shows the additional housing requirement needed should the 
housing supply be inadequate to meet the annual requirement. It can be seen in 
Gosport’s case there is no ne ed to identify additional housing provision as the 
‘Manage ’ line is consistently below the rate of projected completions.DRAFT GOSPORT  BOROUGH  LOCAL PLAN  2038

394 APPENDIX 3: LOCAL LI ST OF HERITAGE ASSET S 
 
The Borough Council’s Local List of Heritage Assets is primaril y linked to Policy D10: 
Heritage Assets  of the Local Plan. The criteria relates to two types of locally 
important heritage assets:  
 
 Locally Listed Buildings; and  
 Parks and Gardens of Local Historic Interest . 
 
The criteria outlined below have been used to a ssess the Borough Council’s current 
Local List of Heritage Assets which can be found on the Council’s website. This list 
will be updated where new evidence is available for buildings and parks that 
demonstrate that they meet the various criteria for design ation as a historic asset . 
Other types of locally important historical assets could be included on the list during 
the Plan period. Such designations will be based on advice contained in the latest 
Historic England  guidance for local heritage listing222. All additional assets will be 
formally added to the list once approved by the relevant Council Board.  
 
Locally important archaeological sites which form the other main type of locally 
important heritage asset are not included on the Borough Council’s list ins tead 
details are found on Hampshire County Council’s Archaeology and Historic Building 
Record (AHBR)223. 
 
Locally Listed Buildings Criteria  
 
The Local List is a non -statutory list of buildings considered to be of historic 
architectural or townscape value located outside Conservation Areas which 
contribute to the character of the Borough. One primary criterion and a number of 
subsidiary criteria  are used to determine inclusion on the List.  
 
Primary Criterion   

 The Age and Condition of the Building.  
 
Age of Building  
  Condition  
Post 1950  Complete and unaltered and of significant landmark value  
1914–1950  Substantially complete and unaltered  
1840–1914  Only affected by reversible minor alterations  
1700–1840  All buildings where the style and form is clearly identifiable and 
there is the potential to restore the building and for it to make a 
positive contribution to its setting.  
 
Pre–1700  All buildings retaining more than 25% evidence of structural  
remains.  
Pre–1600  All surviving structures

395  
Subsidiary Criteria  
 
In addition to the primary criterion at least one of the following criteria would also 
need to be met to ensure inclusion on the List. Two criteria would need to be met for 
buildings post -dating 1914.  
 
 Historical Association  
 A building ’s significance ma y relate to its association with a famous person or 
event, (i.e. nationally known personalities who had direct association with a  
building, association with a nationally important event, or lived there for any length 
of time), or very well known local pers onalities with a long association. Buildings 
may also have been constructed as part of a notable historic event. For example, 
specialist military buildings associated with a nationally important period.   
 
 Part of the Historic Socio -Economic Development of an Area  
 Buildings which form an important part of the historic development of an area and 
which are of group or individual landscape value. This could also include buildings 
that reflect important aspects of the former social, economic or civic activity of an 
area (For example, town halls, chapels, workhouses, pubs and industrial buildings 
relating to important historic local industries).  
 
 Architectural Importance  
 Good examples of the local vernacular; built by a noted local/national 
architect/engineer /builder; examples of local town planning;  rare example or
