Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
102. What is the District like?
112.0.1 Sevenoaks isalarge District lying tothesouth east ofLondon with anoverall area ofjust
over 143square miles (370 square km). Itislong andrelatively narrow measuring 20miles north-south
byabout 7miles east-west. TheThames Gateway liestothenorth, Surrey andEast Sussex tothe
west andsouth andtherestofKent, including Tonbridge andTunbridge Wellstotheeast andsouth
east. Despite adjoining theouter edge ofLondon itispredominantly rural with 93% oftheDistrict
designated asGreen Belt.
2.0.2 Thequality ofthelandscape isadistinctive feature ofthearea. Thenational significance of
thelandscape isrecognised bytheinclusion of60% oftheDistrict within either theKent Downs (to
theNorth) orHigh Weald (totheSouth) Areas ofOutstanding Natural Beauty .There arealsoextensive
areas recognised fortheir nature conservation importance. Itisrare tofindsuch extensive areas of
high quality landscape soclose toLondon.
2.0.3 TheDistrict also hasanimportant historic andcultural legacy with 17nationally designated
historic parks andgardens including Knole House andPark. Sevenoaks also hasanumber ofhistoric
houses including Penshurst Place, Hever Castle andLullingstone Roman Villa.TheDistrict features
asubstantial legacy ofhistoric towns andvillages, with40Conservation Areas, 2,112listed buildings
and23scheduled ancient monuments.
2.0.4 The District’ spopulation is109,305 (2001 Census data) ofwhich about half liveinthe
settlements listed inTable 1.

2.0.5 Sevenoaks urban area istheprincipal settlement with thewidest range ofservices and
facilities. Ithasasuccessful town centre with agood range ofshops andservices. Itisanimportant
centre forcommuting toLondon andisthemain employment centre intheDistrict.2.What istheDistrict Like ?
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
12Figure 1:Location ofSevenoaks District
2.0.6 Swanley isthesecond largest settlement within theDistrict andislocated close totheedge
ofGreater London. Although itisanimportant employment centre and has good bus and rail
connections, itprovides fewer services and facilities than Sevenoaks. The town isdeveloped toa
higher density with less green space than other parts oftheDistrict.
2.0.7 Edenbridge isthemain centre intherural south oftheDistrict. Ithasagood range ofservices
and employment provision, butlacks some facilities e.g. asecondary school. Ithas good rail
connections butisless well-connected tothemain road network than Sevenoaks orSwanley .
2.0.8 Other larger villages include New Ash Green, which was built asaplanned village inthe
1960's, Hartley ,Otford andWesterham.
2.0.9 Half thepopulation liveinthe40orsovillages andhamlets thatarescattered throughout the
District. These vary inthesize ofpopulation, thenumber andrange ofservices available (such asa
primary school, village shop, doctor ’ssurgery ,community hall, recreation ground) and access to
public transport. However ,aswith many rural areas, theservices andfacilities arecontinually under
threat.2.What istheDistrict Like ?

Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
142.0.10 Whilst themain centres ofemployment areconcentrated around thelargest settlements,
there aresome significant major developed sites intheGreen Belt.
2.0.1 1Parts oftheDistrict areliable toflood. Historically ,flooding hasoccurred within thecatchments
oftheRivers Darent andEden. Areas withahigh probability offluvial flood risk(1in100year event)
areidentified inandaround Edenbridge, tothenorth ofSevenoaks, andalong theDarent Valley.
There arealso other areas which areatriskofmore localised flooding.
2.0.12 Major roads crossing theDistrict aretheM25, M26, M20, A25, A20andA21. These provide
access toGreater London, Gatwick, Heathrow andStansted airports, andtheChannel Ports aswell
asAshford andEbbsfleet international stations. Railservices arefocused onlinks toLondon though
services also serve stations towards theKent/Sussex coasts, Redhill, Uckfield andEast Croydon.
The proximity oftheDistrict toCentral London means that there arehigh levels ofcommuting,
particularly bytrain. Over 16% ofthose inemployment commute bytrain towork compared withfewer
than 6%intheSouth East asawhole.
2.0.13 Theageprofile oftheDistrict’ spopulation isslightly older than theSouth East average and
thetrend towards anageing population issettocontinue inthefuture. TheDistrict isdistinguished
byrelatively high levels ofhome ownership (76% compared to73% fortheSouth East asawhole),
arelatively high proportion ofhouseholds living indetached properties (34% compared to29% inthe
South East) andalowproportion living inflats (12% compared to18% fortheSouth East). These
factors, together with theproximity ofLondon, have animpact ontheaffordability ofhousing, with
average house prices forallproperties which arealmost £150,000 (Q22009) greater than theSouth
East average.
2.0.14 Unemployment intheDistrict isrelatively lowat1.8% (March 2011)compared to2.6% for
theSouth East, though incommon with other areas ithasrisen duetotheimpact oftherecession.
The2001 Census showed that76% ofthepopulation hadaqualification which issimilar totheSouth
East though higher than thenational figure of71%. Levels ofcarownership arehigh withover 44%
ofhouseholds owning twoormore cars (compared withnearly 38% fortheSouth East).
2.0.15 Prior totheeconomic downturn thelocal economy hadexperienced growth. Themajority
ofbusinesses aresmall and inservice orofficebased sectors. However ,local businesses face
problems ofrecruiting andretaining staffduetothehigh costofhousing andthepullofhigher salaries
elsewhere, especially inLondon. Theagricultural economy hastraditionally played animportant role
intheDistrict though farmers arediversifying their economic base byre-use ofexisting buildings and
thedevelopment ofnew enterprises thatdonotnecessarily relate totraditional farm uses.
2.0.16 Theoverall impression ofaffluence masks local pockets ofurban andrural deprivation. Six
outofthe74Lower Layer Super Output Areas, thesmallest area forwhich thelevel ofdeprivation is
measured, aremore deprived than theUKaverage. Five ofthese areas, including thetwoworst, are
within Swanley andoneisinHartley .2.What istheDistrict Like ?

3.2.10 The results oftheconsultation showed strong public support forprotection oftheGreen
Belt, fordevelopment tobedirected tobrownfield land, tothemost sustainable and accessible
locations andtowhere infrastructure andservices have most capacity andtofocus development on
built uptowns and villages. Italso showed support formore affordable housing, allocating more
employment land, protecting community services andfacilities, protecting open space, requiring high
standards ofdesign, energy efficient and sustainable building techniques and forpromoting more
sustainable transport choices through theplanning process.

20Issues and Challenges
3.2.18 Key issues thestrategy needs totackle aresetoutbelow .These arederived from
understanding thenature oftheDistrict; thedirection ofother strategies and plans, including the
Community Strategy; future trends revealed through research andlocal concerns expressed through
engagement with stakeholders asoutlined above.
1.Meeting future development requirements within anarea constrained bytheGreen Belt
TheDistrict hastoprovide fornew development. Ithasinthepast been able tomeet development
requirements without thelossofGreen Beltandthebackground studies(5)show future requirements
canbemetwhile continuing tomaintain theGreen Belt.
2.Making thebest useofpreviously developed land inurban areas
Locating development inexisting urban areas puts thefocus onmaking efficient useofexisting urban
land toensure thatitcontributes fully toproviding fornew development.
3.Conserving andenhancing thehigh quality ofthenatural andbuilt environment.
Sevenoaks hasalegacy ofhigh quality landscapes andhistoric features, which need tobeprotected
andappropriately managed forfuture generations.
4.Providing forfuture development inSevenoaks Urban Area
Inanarea lacking large towns Sevenoaks istheDistrict’ slargest settlement with thegreatest range
ofservices. The strategy sets outthefuture roleofthetown andestablishes thescope forfuture
development, while protecting itsenvironmental quality .
5.Improving Swanley
Swanley istheDistrict’ ssecond largest town. Itiswell-located close toM25 butthere areissues of
deprivation insome areas andthetown centre needs improvement. Consequently agreater emphasis
isplaced onregeneration
6.Thefuture fortherural areas
Over 90% oftheDistrict isrural. Thehigh quality oftherural environment needs tobeconserved and
enhanced while atthesame time ensuring thattheneeds ofrural communities aremetandtherural
economy cancontinue todevelop inasustainable way.
7.Improving theprovision ofaffordable housing
Housing isexpensive intheDistrict andstudies(6)show ahigh level ofneed from local people who
cannot affordtobuyontheopen market. Waysofincreasing provision ofhousing thatisaffordable
tolocal people areexamined.

6 SeetheStrategic Housing Market Assessment available attheevidence base pages oftheplanning policy
andlocal development framework section oftheSevenoaks District Council website (Sevenoaks.gov .uk)3.The Spatial Vision
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
218.Meeting thefuture housing needs ofdifferent groups
TheDistrict ischaracterised byfamily homes butpopulation forecasts show atrend towards agrowing
elderly population, with likely growth inhousing forpeople with special needs, and tosmaller
households.(7)The type offuture housing provision takes account ofthese emerging trends.
9.Maintaining adynamic economy
Asupply ofland isneeded tomeet future business needs. The background studies(8)show the
potential contribution from maintaining and making effective use ofexisting employment land and
from limited further development inSwanley .
10.Ensuring services andfacilities areprovided andmaintained tomeet theneeds ofthecommunity .
The District isnotalocation where large scale expansion isplanned butitisstillimportant toensure
services andfacilities areavailable tomeet thechanging needs ofthepopulation.
11.Responding tothechallenges posed byclimate change
The climate ischanging andfuture development intheDistrict needs toadapt tothepotential impact
ofclimate change andtominimise impacts thatcontribute toclimate change.
3.3The Spatial Vision
3.3.1 Alloftheabove have helped toshape theCore Strategy anditsspatial vision forthefuture
oftheDistrict. The vision issetoutbelow .
Sevenoaks District willprovide forfuture development requirements bymaking effective
useofurban land within existing settlements, while protecting theenvironment.
Itwill deliver anannual average of165 dwellings (net addition), equivalent to3,300
additional dwellings over theperiod 2006 to2026in asustainable way.Abalance ofnew
housing willbeachieved with increased provision ofaffordable housing, smaller homes
and housing designed tomeet theneeds ofolder people. Accommodation forgypsies
and travellers willalso beincreased.
The high quality natural built and historic environment willbeconserved and enhanced,
especially inthose parts oftheDistrict designated toprotect their distinct character .New
development throughout theDistrict willbeofahigh quality incorporating designs that
respond tothedistinctive local character ofareas ofhigh environmental quality ormake
apositive contribution totheenvironmental enhancement ofother areas. The design of
new development willincorporate sustainability principles taking into account potential
climate change. AGreen Infrastructure Network willbedeveloped including areas ofvalue
forbiodiversity ,open space and recreation.
Themajority ofnew housing development willbefocused intheurban areas ofSevenoaks
and Swanley .

developed sites within theGreen Belt, willcontinue tobeprotected anditsdistinctive
character willremain. Theseparate identity andcharacter ofindividually distinct villages
andtowns willbemaintained. Small scale affordable housing schemes adjoining existing
villages willbedeveloped tomeet identified local need. Anactive andvibrant rural economy
providing arange ofjobs andservices inrural areas willbesupported primarily based
onthere-use ofexisting buildings.

284. Location Policies
294.1The General Distribution ofDevelopment
4.1.1 TheDistrict must evolve toaccommodate thenew development required tomeet thechanging
housing needs ofthepopulation, support thelocal economy anddevelop services andfacilities needed
tosupport thelocal community .
4.1.2 The distribution ofdevelopment isconsistent with national planning policy and ingeneral
conformity with regional policy .Itconcentrates development ontheDistrict’ smain towns, which have
thegreatest range ofservices andfacilities tosupport thepopulation anapproach thatisconsistent
with theurban focus oftheSouth East Plan policy SP3.
4.1.3 The Green Belt which covers therural areas oftheDistrict aims tocheck theunrestricted
sprawl oflarge built-up areas, topreserve thesetting and special character ofhistoric towns and
assist insafeguarding thecountryside from encroachment. These objectives areparticularly important
inview oftheextensive area covered byAreas ofOutstanding Natural Beauty .Theprime consideration
insuch areas istheconservation ofthenatural beauty ofthelandscape.
4.1.4 The Green Belt isalso aimed atassisting urban regeneration, byencouraging therecycling
ofderelict andother urban land. This isparticularly important atSwanley town centre andtorealise
thepotential within Sevenoaks town centre andadjoining areas.
4.1.5 Italso remains theGovernment’ spriority tolocate development onpreviously developed land
and forthereasons setoutabove itisparticularly important tomeet thischallenge intheDistrict
where there aresignificant constraints onthedevelopment ofgreenfield land.
4.1.6 Development within thebuilt upareas must beachieved inthemost sustainable towns and
villages where employment, keyservices andfacilities andarange oftransport options areavailable.
The distribution ofdevelopment takes account oftheSettlement Hierarchy ,(10)which isbased ona
systematic assessment ofsuch factors forsettlements intheDistrict. Insummary thisisasfollows:
Sevenoaks Principal town
Swanley Secondary town
Edenbridge Rural Service Centre
New Ash Green, Otford andWesterham Local Service Centres
Villages listed inPolicy LO7 Service Villages
4.1.7 TheDistrict hasinthepast been able tomeet development requirements without theloss of
Green Belt andthechallenge istoestablish adistribution ofdevelopment thatcanbesatisfactorily
accommodated within themost sustainable settlements without undermining theGreen Belt. The
distribution strategy therefore takes account ofthefindings ofthetechnical studies, particularly their
findings regarding theability toaccommodate future development requirements inexisting settlements.
4.1.8 Thedistribution ofdevelopment also needs toavoid areas liable toflood. TheStrategic Flood
Risk Assessment shows that flooding from rivers isnotasignificant factor inmost ofthemain
settlements, except forpart ofEdenbridge. The housing land availability assessment has treated
flooding asaconstraint inaccordance with Government guidance.

30Housing Land Supply
4.1.9 TheCouncil hascarried outaStrategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) that
hasbeen updated to1April 2009. Theupdated assessment shows thatthehousing provision figure
of3,300 dwellings (2006-2026) fortheDistrict canbemetfrom within existing built upareas, enabling
theGreen Belttocontinue tobeprotected. Themain categories ofsupply areasfollows:
692 Completions (since 2006)
1,366 Outstanding Permissions (1)
978 Potential Allocations (2)
525 Small SiteAllowance (after firsttenyears only) (3)
3,561 Total
3,300 Core Strategy Housing Provision (20years @165perannum)
Notes
1. After adeduction hasbeen made toallow foranonimplementation ratebased
onpast trends. Outline planning permissions areincluded inthistotal following
assessment intheSHLAA
2. Based onsites assessed intheSHLAA
3. 75dwellings perannum based onpast trends. Small sites areless than 0.2ha.
4.1.10 The figures show asurplus of261dwellings inrelation totheDistrict’ shousing provision.
This isacomparatively robust supply because ahigh proportion (62% oftherequirement) ismade
upofdevelopment already built orwith planning permission. Assuming these elements arebuilt, and
adiscount hasalready been applied totheoutstanding planning permissions total, then theremaining
elements ofthesupply (potential allocations and small siteallowance) exceed thetotal needed to
meet theDistrict’ shousing provision by21%.
4.1.1 1The Housing Trajectory based onthefigures ispresented atAppendix 1.The trajectory
shows that theidentified supply exceeds therequirement bythegreatest extent over thefirstten
years. Inthisperiod, where thesupply ismade upofidentified deliverable anddevelopable sites, the
District provision, based ontheannual figure isexceeded by891units (or40%).
4.1.12 There areother sources ofsupply thattheCouncil willtake intoaccount inmonitoring and
managing thehousing supply over theCore Strategy period. Development from these sources will
bemonitored aspart oftheAnnual Monitoring Report andadded tothehousing land supply .These
are:1. Small sites inthefirsttenyears. Inaccordance with Government guidance thesupply does not
include afigure forsmall sites inthisperiod beyond outstanding permissions. However ,past
trends suggest thatsmall sitewindfalls areasignificant contributor tohousing completions and
theSHLAA concludes that thiswillcontinue inthefuture. Actual completions from small site
windfalls willcount towards meeting thehousing target once development iscompleted.
2. Affordable housing “exception sites” developed under Policy SP4, which cannot becounted as
contributing tothehousing land supply until after completion.
3. Redevelopment ofbusiness sites inurban areas formixed use
which may bepermitted under
Policy SP8.4.Location Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
314. Large windfall sites beyond thefirst tenyears. The SHLAA seeks toidentify large sites for
development during the Core Strategy period. However ,identifying inadvance sites for
development more than tenyears intothefuture isdifficult, particularly redevelopment sites in
urban areas. Itisnoteworthy thatalltheurban sites putforward inresponse totheSHLAA “call
forsites” were identified bytheir promoters fordevelopment inthefirsttenyears. Inthelonger
term theSHLAA willbeupdated toidentify theemergence ofpotential new urban housing land.
5. Reserve Land. Land atEdenbridge, formerly safeguarded tomeet long term development needs,
isre-designated asReserve Land inPolicy LO6 sothatitisavailable tobebrought forward for
development during theCore Strategy period ifrequired.
6. Development ofareas ofopportunity inSevenoaks town centre under Policy LO3 which may
include scope forsome housing aspart ofmixed usedevelopment.
7. Any additional contribution from safeguarded land atWesterham.
4.1.13 The distribution ofhousing based ontheidentified supply isshown inTable 2.The greatest
capacity forhousing development isidentified inSevenoaks urban area, followed bySwanley ,
Edenbridge and arange ofsmaller settlements, which isconsistent with focusing development
primarily onsettlements with thewidest range offacilities. Most ofthehousing total forthesmaller
settlements consists ofeither completions orcommitments intheform ofplanning permissions.
4.1.14 The distribution isweighted slightly more towards theRest ofKent than theLondon Fringe
subregion when compared with thedistribution based ontheSouth East Plan (98/80 dwellings per
annum infavour oftheRest ofKent compared to80/85 dwellings perannum intheSouth East Plan,
seepara 3.2.2 forfurther information onthesubregions). Most oftheDistrict liesoutside theLondon
Fringe area, including some parts adjoining London. Some flexibility inthedistribution isconsidered
justified forthefollowing reasons:
1. The District’ soverall requirement isexceeded;
2. The distribution isbased ontheSouth East Plan strategy ofanurban focus andonly oneofthe
District’ sthree main towns (Sevenoaks) isintheLondon Fringe;
3. Thedefined boundary oftheLondon Fringe only justexcludes theother twomain towns Swanley
andEdenbridge. Swanley inparticular isalocation thatisconsistent with thecharacteristics of
theLondon Fringe adjoining London and theM25. Ithas significant urban land available for
housing; and
4. Thesmall London Fringe shortfall (5dwellings perannum over theCore Strategy period) islikely
tobemade upfrom thefirstfour sources ofsupply identified above.
Employment Land andRetail Development
4.1.15 TheEmployment Land Review shows thatfuture employment land needs canbemetlargely
within existing employment sites provided thegreat majority ofthese sites areretained inemployment
use. Thedistribution ofemployment land isbased onexisting development andistherefore principally
atSevenoaks, Swanley andEdenbridge, including apreviously undeveloped siteatSwanley .Other
significant contributions come from theMajor Developed Sites intheGreen Belt. The distribution is
shown inTable 2.
4.1.16 The Retail Study update shows that, based onforecast future expenditure, there islimited
capacity forfurther development inSevenoaks, primarily later intheplan period. InSwanley there
willbelittle capacity based onexpenditure growth butscope fornew development toclaw back some4.Location Policies

4.2Development inSevenoaks Urban Area
4.2.1 The urban area that includes Sevenoaks town also extends tocover Riverhead, Dunton
Green, Bessels Green andChipstead andisthelargest intheDistrict. (See Figure 3).This section
relates tothewhole urban area although thescope fordevelopment willbemore limited inthesmaller
communities.4.Location Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
344.2.2 Inaregional context theSouth East Plan shows Sevenoaks asa“Secondary Regional Centre”,
reflecting itssignificance, butalso reflecting thefactthatthere areother larger centres elsewhere in
theregion, including those that, unlike Sevenoaks, arespecifically identified forsignificant change.
4.2.3 Inthecontext oftheDistrict therelative accessibility oftheurban area andrange ofservices
available means thatitisasustainable location fordevelopment andthetechnical studies suggest
there isscope fordevelopment intheexisting urban area. Butitscharacter varies greatly and
development needs totake place inawaythatdoes notharm high quality environments orundermine
thedistinctive character ofdifferent parts oftheurban area.
4.2.4 Sevenoaks issurrounded byGreen Belt, which preserves thesetting andspecial character
ofthehistoric town, constrains theexpansion ofthetown and safeguards thecountryside from
encroachment. Italso maintains theseparation oftheurban area from nearby settlements, including
Otford andSeal, retaining their separate identity .Inaddition itincludes significant green wedges that
help tobreak uptheextent ofbuilt development andcontribute tomaintaining theseparate character
ofindividual communities thatform partoftheurban area, including Riverhead, Dunton Green, Bessels
Green andChipstead. Much oftheopen land adjoining thetown isdesignated asAONB andflooding
isalso asignificant constraint onland tothenorth. Inview ofthese constraints andthescope for
development inthebuilt uparea theoption ofreleasing anyGreen Beltland adjoining theurban area
fordevelopment hasbeen rejected.
4.2.5 Provision fornew development intheurban area issummarised inTable 3.
4.2.6 Housing provision isbased onthefindings oftheStrategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment, including outstanding permissions, sites identified intheurban area andasmall site
allowance after thefirsttenyears. Itismade upasfollows:
119 Completions since 2006
743 Outstanding permissions
510 (ofwhich outline)
329 Identified sites
140 Small siteallowance
1,331 Total
4.2.7 Over 60% ofthehousing provision ismade upofcompletions and outstanding planning
permissions. Thelargest single component isanoutline permission foraphased development of500
units atWestKent Cold Store close toDunton Green railway station.
4.2.8 Themost accessible parts oftheurban area arethose within easy walking distance (800m)
ofthetown centre andmain railway station. Subject todesigns being appropriate tothearea higher
density development willbesuitable inthese areas, enabling more people toliveinlocations closest
toservices andfacilities. Policy ondensity ofresidential development iscontained inPolicy SP7.4.Location Policies

Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
364.2.9 Sites willbebrought forward forhousing development toenable theprovision tobemet
through theAllocations andDevelopment Management DPD. Past trends andtheStrategic Housing
Land Availability Assessment illustrate that small sites make asignificant contribution tohousing
provision within thetown. This istobeexpected given therelatively large size andthecharacter of
theurban area. Small sitedevelopment allows forthesensitive integration ofdevelopment intothe
distinctive character ofthetown andsuch opportunities willcontinue toarise.
4.2.10 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment included anassessment of“character
areas” inthetown. This identified thedistinctive features thatcontributed positively tothecharacter
ofdifferent parts ofthetown andused thisassessment toidentify which areas hadpotential forfurther
development totake place inasensitive way without harm totheir overall character .Theassessment
willbedeveloped into asupplementary planning document toassist inconsidering development
proposals inthetown.
4.2.1 1Sevenoaks has asignificant stock ofemployment land. The Employment Land Review
identified arange ofsites thatitconsidered suitable forretention inemployment use. Policy SP8 will
apply tothese areas and employment sites forretention willbedesignated through theAllocations
andDevelopment Management DPD. Modernisation andredevelopment ofexisting employment sites
willbeencouraged inaccordance with thepolicy toensure thatemployment land continues toadapt
tomeet theneeds ofthetown’ seconomy .
4.2.12 Retail development willremain focused primarily onthetown centre. Inview ofGovernment
guidance andthefindings oftheRetail Study (2009 Update), which concludes there isonly alimited
need forgrowth that canbeaccommodated inthetown centre, itisnotproposed toadd tooutof
centre provision.
4.2.13 There areseveral neighbourhood shopping centres within theurban area thathave arole
inoffering convenience shopping fortheir local communities. Theextent ofthese andpolicy onchange

fornew development willbeontheareas described below thatareshown diagrammatically .
1. WestofBligh's Meadow onthenorth western side ofthetown centre. Amixed usedevelopment
isproposed including residential flats, commercial, retail andcafé/restaurant use, together with
therelocated market. Thetown centre commercial uses willadjoin theBligh's Meadow carpark
and complement theexisting shopping provision. The development willbring more residential
development intothetown centre andimprove theappearance ofarelatively unattractive part
ofthecentre. Thescheme offersarange ofbenefits andwillbebrought forward early intheplan

2. East oftheHigh Street adjoining Buckhurst Way.This area primarily contains surface parking
and service yards. Most oftheland isCouncil-owned and offers scope forretail development
ofatleast thescale envisaged intheRetail Study together with related town centre uses closely
linked totheHigh Street. Redevelopment would need toprovide forreplacement decked car
parking. Inaccordance with thefindings oftheRetail Study thisisalonger term opportunity
proposed fordevelopment later intheCore Strategy period after 2019, although there could be
scope todevelop earlier ifjustified bydemand. Proposals willbeincluded intheAllocations and

4.3Development inSwanley
4.3.1 Swanley isthesecond largest town intheDistrict. Itisaccessibly located adjacent toJunction
3oftheM25 butdoes nothave aswide arange ofservices asSevenoaks. Taking these factors into
account itisplaced second inthesettlement hierarchy .New development willprimarily meet the
needs ofthetown anditssurrounding area andcontribute tomaintaining andenhancing itsrole.
4.3.2 Parts ofSwanley sufferfrom relatively high levels ofdeprivation and some areas ofpoor
environment. TheCouncil isworking with other agencies toachieve effective regeneration. TheLocal
Strategic Partnership, co-ordinated bytheCouncil, brings together awide range oforganisations with
aninterest inregeneration todevelop initiatives within theframework oftheCommunity Strategy .
The Council hasestablished theSwanley People First Partnership todeliver aSingle Regeneration
Budget programme, which ledtosome £1.64 million pounds ofexpenditure over theSRB period from
2001-5 andhascontinued thepartnership toprogress ongoing initiatives established under theSRB
anddevelop new opportunities. The objectives oftheSwanley People First Partnership areto:4.Location Policies

4.3.3 14separate projects were established that contribute toachieving theobjectives. These
covered awide range ofactivities andhave directly involved over 6,500 local residents. When the
SRB funding came toanend, many oftheprojects were continued insome form.
4.3.4 New development inthetown promoted through theCore Strategy willcomplement the

improved facilities inthetown centre andenvironmental improvements. TheStrategic Housing Land
Availability Assessment identifies significant redevelopment opportunities inthetown. Inaddition new
development inthetown willcontribute toacommunity fund tosupport local regeneration projects
(see theInfrastructure Delivery Plan Schedule inAppendix 4forfurther details).
4.3.5 Swanley issurrounded byGreen Beltland. Land tothesouth east isalso within theAONB
which should besafeguarded from encroachment, while tothenorth andnorth east theGreen Belt
plays animportant roleinseparating Swanley from thenearby communities ofHextable andSwanley

4.3.12 Swanley’ sposition adjacent totheM25 andA20 means thattraffic-generating development
inthetown hasthepotential toaffecttheStrategic Road Network (SRN). The Council hasundertaken
anassessment (based onthe Highways Agency’ ssuggested Reduced Transport Evaluation
methodology) oftheimpact ofdevelopment inSwanley ontheSRN. The assessment estimates that
thecumulative impact ofresidential development inSwanley ,beyond existing commitments, and
development ofanindustrial estate form ofemployment useontheBroom Hillsitewas likely tobe
relatively modest. However ,theassessment suggested that, without mitigation, development ofa
business park form ofdevelopment atBroom Hillmay have amore significant impact ontrafficlevels
ontheSRN. These broad conclusions from theassessment have been agreed with theHighways
Agency .
4.3.13 The development oftheBroom Hillsiteisimportant totheeconomy ofthetown. Itspotential
trafficimpact willbemitigated by:
Limiting thedevelopment toindustrial estate type uses (B1(c), B2,B8)unless adeveloper is
able todemonstrate, tothesatisfaction oftheCouncil and thehighways authority ,that the
development ofother types ofcommercial floorspace willnothave asignificant impact ontraffic
levels ontheStrategic Road Network.
Requiring thedevelopment toimplement aTravel Plan that may provide animproved buslink
between Swanley Town Centre, Swanley Station and theeast ofSwanley ,toserve theBroom
Hillsiteandother employment sites inthearea andlimit thenumber ofparking spaces toalevel
significantly below themaximum standard.
Requiring applications tobeaccompanied byaTransport Assessment and Travel Plan that
incorporate proposals tomitigate impact.
The development ofthesiteissubject toconfirmation bymeans ofatransport assessment that
thetransport impact onM25 Junction 3,taking account ofmitigation measures, isacceptable.
4.3.14 Development willalso need tominimise impact onBiodiversity Action Plan habitats and

4.3.16 Swanley isless well-served with open space than other parts oftheDistrict, despite the
valuable asset ofSwanley Park onthenorthern side ofthetown. TheOpen Spaces Study recommends

4.4.1 Edenbridge isthethird largest town andisthecentre foralarge rural area inthesouth west
oftheDistrict. Itexpanded inthe1960s when itwasdesignated asanoverspill area andhasdeveloped
along anorth-south axis. Itisless accessible tothemain road network than Sevenoaks orSwanley

twolarger towns.
4.4.2 Parts ofEdenbridge areliable toflood andthese willbeavoided inproviding fordevelopment

4.4.3 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment shows that there are significant
commitments fornew development within thetown, including schemes under construction, andfurther

4.4.5 Edenbridge does have anarea of“Safeguarded Land” west ofEnterprise Wayonthe
north-western side ofthetown that was originally released from theGreen Belt in1990 tomeet
potential long term development needs (see figure 6).The Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment, asupdated, shows that theDistrict canmeet itshousing provision without using the
safeguarded land. AstheCore Strategy gives preference tothedevelopment ofland within existing
built upareas andthehousing trajectory shows asubstantial surplus inthefirsthalfoftheplan period,
thesafeguarded land isnotproposed fordevelopment atthistime. The land does, however ,have
thepotential tocontribute tohousing provision intheDistrict inthelatter part oftheCore Strategy
period ifsufficient development does notcome forward tomeet theCore Strategy provision The
saved Local Plan policy towards safeguarded land states thatsuch land canonly bereleased through
afuture review ofthedevelopment plan which would entail quite alengthy process toensure its
release should itbeneeded.
4.4.6 The safeguarded land istherefore being re-designated asReserve Land tobesubject toa

Development inRural Settlements
4.5.1 TheDistrict contains arange ofsmaller settlements thathave amore limited range ofservices
than themain towns butstilloffersome services tomeet theday-to-day needs oftheir communities.
Theoverall amount ofdevelopment thatwillbeacceptable inthese settlements willgenerally beless
than inthemain towns duetotheir more limited range ofservices andreduced accessibility ,which
renders them lesssustainable locations formeeting thedevelopment needs oftheDistrict asawhole.
Inaddition thesmaller size ofthesettlements willmean that thephysical scope forlarger scale
development consistent with maintaining their character andprotecting theGreen BeltandAreas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty willbeless.
4.5.2 Asystematic assessment ofservices andfacilities available ineach settlement intheDistrict
forms thebasis fortheSettlement Hierarchy .Below Sevenoaks, Swanley andEdenbridge thefollowing
categories aredefined:
Local Service Centres. New AshGreen, Otford andWesterham .4.Location Policies

514.5.3 Some modest development would beacceptable within these settlements subject tolocal
environmental considerations.
4.5.4 New AshGreen was developed asanew community inthe1960s with itsown centre. The
centre hasproved tobelesssuccessful than other aspects ofthedevelopment andhassuffered from

thelocal community todevelop proposals foritsregeneration sothatitbetter meets theneeds ofthe
local community ,while retaining ascale appropriate tothesize ofthecommunity itisintended to

development willbeincluded aspartoftheregeneration scheme. Thefinal form ofdevelopment will
follow local consultation. Nosignificant scope fordevelopment exists elsewhere inthevillage outside
thecentre.
4.5.5 InOtford local environmental factors, including significant areas ofopen space, limitthescope
forfurther development. Thefuture emphasis islikely tobeprimarily onsmall sites.
4.5.6 Westerham hasthewidest range offacilities inthiscategory .Thehousing land availability
assessment hasnotidentified anylarge sites forfuture housing development within thesettlement
confines butWesterham does have land safeguarded forlong term development. This consists of
three relatively small sites, withacombined area of4ha:
1. Land adjoining Croft Road.
2. Theformer school sitetotheeast oftheallotments.
3. Allotments adjoining Churchill School.
4.5.7 Inview ofthesizeofthese sites theCouncil considers thatthey only have alimited value for
continued safeguarding asastrategic long term reserve fortheDistrict after 2026. Instead their future

unsuitable locations forpromoting development. Afewareas aresufficiently builtuptojustify adefined

564.5.28 Horse riding isasignificant recreational activity inrural areas oftheDistrict which offers
benefits torural communities buthorse-related activities (often referred toas“horsiculture”), including
stables andpaddocks, canhave landscape impacts thatrequire careful consideration. ASupplementary
Planning Document willbeproduced giving more detailed guidance ontheissue.
4.5.29 The Council isasupporter oftheNorth WestKent Countryside Partnership, which also
includes Kent County Council, theEnvironment Agency and adjoining Districts. Itwillcontinue to
support enhancement projects through theCountryside Partnership.
4.5.30 Over 60% oftheDistrict lieswithin either theKent Downs orHigh Weald AONB. Both AONBs
have produced Management Plans that have recently been updated. These setoutarange of
measures toprotect andenhance thedistinctive features ofeach AONB andtheCouncil willsupport
their implementation.
4.5.31 Thecountryside isalso aplace ofwork andrecreation. Therural economy hastraditionally
been dependent onagriculture buthasincreasingly diversified astheagricultural industry haschanged

585. Strategic Policies
595.1TheDesign ofDevelopment andConservation
5.1.1 Adistinguishing feature oftheDistrict isthehigh quality ofthenatural andbuilt environment.
Sevenoaks contains twoAONBs andother areas ofattractive landscape identified intheCountryside
Assessment. The built and historic heritage ofListed Buildings, Conservation Areas, Historic Parks
and Gardens, Scheduled Ancient Monuments and sites ofarchaeological interest, contribute tothe
special quality andcharacter ofmany parts oftheDistrict. Akeyresponsibility oftheplan istoensure
their continued protection, conservation and enhancement. The District’ stowns and villages also
include other areas ofhigh quality environment.
5.1.2 National policies provide fortheprotection ofkeyhistoric assets and these willbeapplied
rigorously across theDistrict toensure that itshistoric heritage ismaintained. Atalocal level
Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans will beused toprovide guidance on
distinguishing features ofthehistoric environment thatshould beprotected, together with identifying
opportunities forenhancement. Ageneral guidance document onConservation Areas willbeproduced
tocomplement thespecific guidance forindividual areas. The Council aims toproduce aListof
Buildings ofLocal Architectural orHistoric Interest during theCore Strategy period, tobeadopted as
aSupplementary Planning Document.
5.1.3 New development must beaccommodated without damaging thefeatures thatcontribute to
thequality oftheurban andrural environment. Therefore, itisimportant thatdevelopment isdesigned
torespect orimprove thecharacter and distinctiveness ofthearea inwhich itislocated. Guidance
willbeprovided atalocal level through Character Area Assessments covering themain urban areas
andVillage Design Statements andParish Plans forrural areas.
5.1.4 Good design hasacentral roleintheSustainable Community Plan. The“Green Environment”
theme aims toensure theDistrict isaplace where people can enjoy high quality rural and urban
environments andthequality ofnew development isseen asakeyfactor inmaintaining andenhancing
theoverall environmental quality oftheDistrict. The “Building forLife” criteria, produced bythe
Commission forArchitecture andtheBuilt Environment (CABE) provide awide-ranging andobjective
basis forassessing thequality ofnew housing. The criteria arelisted inAppendix 5and the
performance ofnew development against thecriteria willbeused asthekeyindicator formeasuring
success inachieving high quality design.
5.1.5 The strategic policy sets ageneral framework within which more detailed andlocally-specific
guidance canoperate, listed below under “Delivery Mechanisms”. Inaddition Saved Local Plan Policy
EN1 willcontinue toprovide adetailed basis forcontrol ofdevelopment until itisreplaced inthe
Allocations andDevelopment Management DPD.
Policy SP1
Design ofNew Development andConservation
Allnew development should bedesigned toahigh quality andshould respond tothe
distinctive local character ofthearea inwhich itissituated. Account should betaken of
guidance adopted bytheCouncil intheform ofKent Design, local Character Area
Assessments, Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans, Village Design
Statements andParish Plans. Inrural areas account should betaken ofguidance inthe
Countryside Assessment andAONB Management Plans .
Inareas where thelocal environment lacks positive features new development should
contribute toanimprovement inthequality oftheenvironment.5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
60New development should create safe, inclusive andattractive environments that meet the
needs ofusers, incorporate principles ofsustainable development and maintain and
enhance biodiversity .
The District’ sheritage assets and their settings, including listed buildings, conservation
areas, archaeological remains, ancient monuments, historic parks and gardens, historic
buildings, landscapes and outstanding views willbeprotected and enhanced.
Delivery Mechanisms:
TheCouncil willwork withlocal communities toproduce Village Design Statements, Parish Plans
and Character Area Assessments tobeadopted asSupplementary Planning Documents to
provide detailed locally-specific guidance tosupport thegeneral policy .
Conservation Area Appraisals have been produced foralloftheDistrict’ sConservation Areas,
some ofwhich have been replaced with Appraisals andManagement Plans. These willbekept
uptodate through regular review ,replacing theremaining Appraisals with Appraisals and
Management Plans, and adopted asSupplementary Planning Documents. General guidance
willalso beproduced asaSupplementary Planning Document, giving advice ondevelopment
inConservation Areas.
Development Briefs willbeproduced togive detailed design guidance onindividual sites.
TheCouncil willwork with Kent County Council andother partners tomaintain andupdate Kent

Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
615.2Sustainable Development, Climate Change andAirQuality
5.2.1 Government guidance intheSupplement toPlanning Policy Statement No.1 states, itis
generally accepted climate change isoccurring andthatitisaserious andurgent issue onwhich we
need toacttoreduce theemissions ofgreenhouse gases thatcontribute toclimate change. Itadds
thatplanning hasaroletoplay inreducing emissions andthatplanning also hasaroleinadapting
toanticipated climate change.
5.2.2 InOctober 2007, theCouncil signed theNottingham Declaration onClimate Change andhas
since adopted aCarbon Reduction Management Action Plan. TheCouncil isalsopreparing acorporate
Climate Change Strategy .Together withtheCore Strategy which promotes sustainable andresource
efficient development andseeks toreduce dependency ontheprivate motor car,these corporate
initiatives willensure that those living ,working atorvisiting theDistrict willreduce their carbon
emissions.
5.2.3 Themain issues forSevenoaks interms ofClimate Change mitigation are:
High average CO2 emissions: Carbon Dioxide emissions canoriginate from many sources with
themajority arising from theburning offossil fuels toprovide energy andtheuseofpetroleum
intransport. There isaconsiderably higher level ofdomestic CO2 emissions perperson in
Sevenoaks District than atcounty ,regional ornational levels.
High Energy consumption. Thetotal energy consumption inSevenoaks District isabove the
average forlocal authorities inBritain. Thepercapita energy consumption inSevenoaks District
is18% more than theSouth East average, 8%more than theKent average and10% more than
thenational average. TheCode forSustainable Homes andtheBREEAM standards require
mandatory energy reduction measures innew developments.
5.2.4 Inthecontext offuture development intheDistrict themain areas where there ispotential to
reduce emissions ofgreenhouse gases are:
Bylocating new development where itisaccessible toservices andfacilities thereby reducing
theneed totravel andrequiring new dwellings, employment uses, shops andservices toprovide
forsafe andconvenient public transport, walking andcycling, sothatreliance onthecarcanbe
reduced. This isakeyprinciple behind thestrategy forlocating development setoutearlier in
thedocument.
Byinvesting inpublic transport services andwalking andcycling facilities toincrease the
accessibility andattractiveness ofthese more sustainable transport modes.
Byincorporating sustainable construction principles, including renewable energy ,toreduce
emissions from new development.
5.2.5 Themain issues forSevenoaks interms ofadapting tofuture climate change are:
Flood risk, which isforecast toincrease duetomore extreme weather conditions. TheCouncil’ s
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment estimates theextent towhich the1:100 year flood plain will
increase duetoclimate change andthiswillbetaken intoaccount inensuring new development
isnotlocated inareas liable toflood. Inaddition there isscope forintroducing sustainable
drainage systems (SUDS) thatreduce surface water run-of ffrom development andthereby offer
thepotential toreduce theseverity offuture flooding.
Watershortages, which may result from more frequent summer droughts. Each ofthefourwater
companies operating inthedistrict areclassified aswater stressed andhave high levels of
average household water consumption. Parts ofSevenoaks District arebeing over-abstracted
andtherefore theamount ofgroundwater inthese areas isreducing. This reduction ingroundwater
canincrease thelikelihood andseverity ofdrought. Climate change ispredicted toreduce rainfall
within theSouth East which willinevitably place further pressure onanalready pressurised
region. TheCode forSustainable Homes andtheBREEAM standards require mandatory water5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
62usereduction measures innew developments which canmake acontribution, along with other
measures toreduce water consumption, inmitigating theimpact. Sevenoaks District Council
willassist theUKinachieving theobjectives oftheWaterFramework Directive bydelivering
appropriate actions setoutinRiver Basin Management Plans. Winter water storage reservoirs
andother sustainable land management practices which reduce summer abstraction, diffuse
pollution andrunoff,increase flood storage capacity andbenefit wildlife andrecreation willbe
encouraged.
Sustainable Construction andEnergy Generation
5.2.6 There isastrong local case forseeking animprovement intheoverall sustainability ,including
theenergy performance andwater consumption ofnew development.
5.2.7 TheCode forSustainable Homes isanationally recognised toolforassessing theincorporation
ofsustainability features innew housing. The Code ismade upofnine categories and includes
mandatory features atalllevels which ensures ahigh level ofsustainability including energy efficiency ,
water efficiency ,sustainable drainage and waste reduction. From 2010 new development willbe
required through theBuilding Regulations toreach theenergy standards setoutinCode Level 3and
after thatimprovements areplanned sothatby2016 allnew housing willbecarbon neutral (i.e.there
willbenonetemissions). Forcommercial andinstitutional development theBREEAM Standard is
used asanassessment tool, itassesses buildings against tencategories andalso hasmandatory
elements regarding carbon emissions andwater consumption. BREEAM canalso beused toassess
conversions tocommercial, industrial andresidential use.
5.2.8 The Council willinitially apply Code forSustainable Homes Level 3(progressing toCode
Level 4from 2013 andLevel 6by2016), andBREEAM “VeryGood” standard (increasing to“Excellent”
standards from 2013). High quality residential andcommercial schemes thatexceed thestandards
willbeencouraged.

5.2.9 Inrelation toimproving theenergy efficiency ofexisting development, theadopted Residential
Extensions Supplementary Planning Document outlines energy efficiency measures which canbe
incorporated. Sevenoaks District Council alsoactively supports theCER T(Carbon Emission Reduction
Target) programme tolocal residents through amixofdirect marketing andindirect marketing ofboth
theKent-wide discount scheme andactive promotion ofthelocal Energy Saving Trustadvice centre.
Further initiatives arebeing examined topromote retrofitting ofexisting homes. Inaddition, theCouncil
willpromote theincorporation ofcombined heat andpower anddecentralised energy inlarger scale
new development where feasible.5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
635.2.10 The South East Plan Policy NRM1 1requires local targets tobesetfortheprovision of
renewable anddecentralised energy .Code level 3cantheoretically beachieved without theuseof
renewable orlowcarbon energy resources although there isavery small margin oferror.Nevertheless,
inorder toreduce carbon emissions inadistrict which does notcurrently perform wellinthisrespect,
inaddition tomeeting Code level 3,initially aminimum 10% reduction ofcarbon emissions from
residential, commercial and institutional development must beachieved through theuse of
decentralised, renewable orlowcarbon technologies subject totechnological andfinancial feasibility .
Code level 4andabove arenotexpected tobeachieved through improvements tothebuilding fabric
alone butprogressive reductions inCO2 emissions willbeachieved through theuseofrenewables
over theplan period astheoverall Code level andBREEAM standard requirements increase.
5.2.1 1There areassociated costs withcomplying withtheCode forSustainable Homes levels and
BREEAM standards. Applicants willberequired tosubmit evidence ifthey feelthatcompliance isnot
technically orfinancially achievable having regard tothetype ofdevelopment involved anditsdesign.
Transport
5.2.12 Theemerging Transport Strategy issummarised inaboxfollowing paragraph 3.4.3, together
with itsrelationship totheCore Strategy .
5.2.13 Thedispersed rural nature ofSevenoaks District results inbusoperators finding itdifficult
torunmany commercially viable busservices andmany existing services aresubsidised byKCC.
Limited development inrural areas isunlikely toprovide acatalyst forimproved busservices serving
these areas. TheTransport Strategy suggests thatinnovative public andcommunity transport solutions,
such asdial-a-ride andcarpooling, willneed tobedeveloped inthese areas toimprove accessibility .
TheCouncil sets outitscommitment tomaintaining andimproving accessibility inrural communities
inCore Strategy policy L07.
5.2.14 Network Rail’sdraft Route Utilisation Strategies (RUSs) forKent (April 2009) andSussex
(May 2009), together with thepublished South London RUS (March 2008), consider thefuture
development ofallrailservices andlines serving Sevenoaks District andtake intoaccount housing
development policies intheSouth East Plan. TheRUSs findlimited scope forincreasing thecapacity
andfrequency ofpeak train services between Sevenoaks District andLondon, although theintroduction
ofdomestic services onHigh Speed One isexpected torelieve some oftheexisting overcrowding
because ofthereduction inpassengers travelling through Sevenoaks District. Opportunities exist to
promote greater train travel forjourneys other than commuting toLondon. Improving accessibility to
stations byallmodes andimproving thequality offacilities available atstations canhelp toachieve
this. Some improvements toSevenoaks and Swanley Stations willbedelivered through Network
Rail’s,Department forTransport backed, National Station Improvement Programme.
5.2.15 Walking andcycling arethemost sustainable forms oftransport. The Transport Strategy
promotes improvements towalking andcycling facilities andnetworks, especially within theurban
areas ofSevenoaks, Swanley and Edenbridge, toimprove thesafety and convenience ofthese
modes, andopportunities willalsobesought inconnection withnewdevelopment. Where opportunities
donotexist toprovide formal cycle routes along existing keyroads, thelocal authorities willinvestigate
thepotential foridentifying offroad cycle routes andencouraging cyclists tousesafer andlessbusy
roads, through appropriate signage.
5.2.16 Travel Plans canreduce reliance ontheprivate carbypromoting theopportunities for
travelling toandfrom sites bypublic transport, walking orcycling andbyoffering new opportunities
toreduce caruse, through theestablishment ofcarsharing services orcarclubs, forexample. The
Council willwork with existing employers andschools toencourage them toprepare Travel Plans
andwillrequire new developments toprepare andadopt them using Kent County Council’ sguidance
onTravel Plans (Transport Assessments andTravel Plans, October 2008) asthebasis fordetermining
when such plans willberequired. Policy LO4 includes specific provisions forTravel Plans inSwanley .5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
645.2.17 The Transport Strategy notes thattherelatively limited level ofdevelopment proposed in
Sevenoaks District intheplan period isunlikely tohave significant impacts onthelocal road network.
However ,thedetailed transport impacts ofdevelopment proposals willneed tobeassessed atthe
planning application stage andinsome instances development may beconditional onimplementation
ofspecific transport mitigation measures. The Council willalso work with Kent County Council to
review maximum parking standards fortheDistrict.
5.2.18 TheCouncil considers thatthere arebenefits from theconstruction ofeast facing sliproads
totheM25/M26 inrelieving trafficcongestion and potentially benefiting AirQuality Management
Areas, although further work isneeded toassess their impact. However ,theHighways Agency has
noplans atpresent todeliver thescheme andtheCore Strategy does notrelyonitsprovision. The
Transport Strategy includes aproposal, which theCouncil supports, towork withtheHighways Agency
tofindanappropriate solution tocongestion ontheA25 andaccess to/egress from theM25/26.
AirQuality
5.2.19 Poor airquality isanissue incertain parts oftheDistrict alongside main roads. Eleven Air
Quality Management Areas have been declared andtheCouncil hasanAirQuality Action Plan (2009)
thatincludes measures toimprove airquality .
5.2.20 Road trafficisthemain contributor topoor airquality andthelevel oftraffic,particularly
through trafficislargely outside thecontrol oftheDistrict. Policies intheLDF willhave some impact
ontrafficlevels though they canonly bepartofthesolution. Locating new development where itis
accessible toservices andfacilities willhave abeneficial impact inreducing theneed totravel, while
applying policies toretain services and facilities that meet alocal need together with promoting
alternatives tocartravel should also reduce theneed totravel bycartoreach essential services.
5.2.21 Future development should avoid adverse impact onairquality ,particularly inAirQuality
Management Areas where there isaneed toimprove airquality .Inareas ofpoor airquality careful

675.3Housing Policies
Provision ofAffordable Housing
5.3.1 The planning system hasanimportant part toplay inproviding affordable housing forthose
unable toaccess thehousing market. The need toprovide affordable housing isimportant fortwo
main reasons; firstly toenable people who cannot afford torent orbuyontheopen market tolivein
ahome thatissuitable fortheir needs andthatthey canafford, andsecondly toprovide housing for
people working indifferent aspects ofthelocal economy ,thus underpinning economic activity .
5.3.2 PPS3 sets outtheGovernment’ spolicy forsecuring theprovision ofaffordable housing, which
itdefines asincluding:
“social rented and intermediate housing provided tospecified eligible households whose needs are
notmet bythemarket.”
5.3.3 This plan uses thesame definition. Intermediate housing includes shared ownership butthe
definition excludes lowcost market housing. Affordable housing isexpected tobeprovided within
new housing schemes andPPS3 sets anational indicative threshold of15units forrequiring provision
tobemade, although thiscanbevaried based onlocal circumstances.
5.3.4 The South East Plan identifies aseries ofsub regional housing markets and Sevenoaks
District, together with Tonbridge andMalling andTunbridge Wells, lieswithin theWestKent housing
market area. AWestKent Strategic Housing Market Assessment hasbeen completed inaccordance
with Government guidance and isbeing taken into account inthecurrent review oftheCouncil's
Housing Strategy .Itshows ahigh level ofneed foraffordable housing across thehousing market
area and ashortfall incomparison with existing provision. Inview ofthelevel ofneed thestudy
recommends atarget ofatleast 40% affordable housing forallsuitable sites. Italso recommends
that authorities consider arange ofsitethresholds below 15units recognising that viability issues
may require lower target levels orcommuted sums fordelivery onalternative sites.
5.3.5 The provision ofaffordable housing isnotjustimportant inresponding tohousing need, itis
also important totheeconomy .TheWestKent Area Investment Framework identifies lackofaffordable
housing asafactor contributing tolabour supply shortages. Itistherefore important toincrease future
supply .
5.3.6 Inthelastfiveyears, 59% ofnew dwelling completions intheDistrict were onsites below the
Government’ sindicative 15dwellings threshold, with theproportion oflarger sites particularly lowin
rural areas. This means thatmost developments have notbeen required tocontribute toaffordable
housing andasaconsequence thenumber ofaffordable units achieved hasfallen short ofregional
guidelines. This trend ofarelatively high proportion ofcompletions onsmall sites islikely tocontinue.
5.3.7 Alower sitesize threshold is,therefore, required iftheproportion ofaffordable housing in
new housing developments istobeincreased inresponse tothelevel ofneed.
5.3.8 Toexamine theimpact ofalower sitesize threshold ontheviability ofhousing development
anAffordable Housing Viability Assessment hasbeen carried out.The assessment found that:
Fordevelopments of15units ormore a40% on-site affordable housing requirement would
maintain viability .
Fordevelopments of5-14 units there isroom foranon-site affordable housing requirement,
whilst maintaining viability .Maintaining the40% requirement could have anadverse impact on
viability andinstead theassessment recommends asliding scale approach with arequirement
of30% fordevelopments of10-14 units and20% for5-9units.5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
68Fordevelopments ofless than fiveunits anon-site contribution could notbejustified onviability
grounds. However ,there isscope forafinancial contribution towards off-site provision whilst
maintaining viability ofdevelopment. Theassessment recommends acontribution based onthe
equivalent ofproviding 10% affordable housing butthiswould only apply todevelopments
involving anetincrease inthenumber ofdwellings.
5.3.9 These findings areaccepted and form thebasis oftherequirements inPolicy SP3. Inview
ofthelevel ofneed theCouncil does notseeacase forsetting therequirement below themaximum
level thatwould maintain viability .
5.3.10 Provision foraffordable housing ondevelopments offiveunits ormore should bemade on
site. Inexceptional circumstances where itisdemonstrated totheCouncil’ ssatisfaction through an
independent assessment ofviability thatprovision inaccordance with thepolicy would notbeviable,
areduced level ofprovision may beaccepted or,failing that, afinancial contribution towards provision
off-site willberequired.
5.3.1 1Within theaffordable housing total, provision can include social rented and intermediate
housing (which includes shared ownership). Taking account ofthelevel ofneed theCouncil will
expect atleast 65% tobesocial rented. However onasite-by-site basis thespecific balance ofrent
andintermediate housing should address anyidentified local need andthesize andtype ofaffordable
housing provided should also reflect local need.
5.3.12 Financial contributions willbeused toincrease provision ofaffordable housing onother sites
intheDistrict, including enabling local housing schemes inrural parishes. Inaddition theStrategic
Housing Market Assessment recommends thatauthorities develop strategies tomake better useof
theexisting housing stock byproviding incentives toreduce thesubstantial under-occupation offamily
houses inthesocial rented sector and funding may also beused tosupport such initiatives. This
approach accords with South East Plan policy H6onmaking better useoftheexisting housing stock.
Asupplementary planning document willprepared togive guidance ontheimplementation ofpolicy
inthisarea including arrangements forfinancial contributions.
5.3.13 The Council willexpect theprovision ofaffordable housing tobesecured through the
involvement ofaRegistered Social Landlord who isoneoftheCouncil’ spreferred partners. Where
thisisnotthecase theCouncil willexpect theRSL tomeet thestandards required ofCouncil’ s
preferred partners.
5.3.14 Permission willberefused fordevelopment that makes nocontribution orinadequate
contribution toaffordable housing where provision could reasonably bemade under theterms ofthe
policy .
Policy SP3
Provision ofAffordable Housing
Inorder tomeet theneeds ofpeople who arenotable tocompete inthegeneral housing
market, theCouncil willexpect theprovision ofaffordable housing inalltypes ofresidential
development including specialised housing.(11)The location, layout and design ofthe

Affordable Housing inRural Areas
5.3.15 Even with alower threshold theopportunities toprovide additional affordable housing in
rural areas oftheDistrict aremore limited because there isless scope generally fornew housing
development. Government guidance inPPS3 allows forsmall scale affordable housing tobeprovided
through theuseofa“rural exceptions sitepolicy” under which small sites thatwould notnormally be
suitable fordevelopment because ofrestraint policies canbedeveloped solely foraffordable housing
toserve small rural communities. PPS3 adds that rural exception sites should only beused for
affordable housing inperpetuity .
5.3.16 Policy H3oftheSouth East Plan identifies aroleinincreasing affordable housing provision
forsmall scale affordable housing schemes within orwell-related torural settlements, possibly including
land which would nototherwise bereleased fordevelopment.
5.3.17 The Council’ sapproach totheconsideration ofrural exception sites isbased onfirstly
assessing need, then searching forsuitable sites andthen supporting thedevelopment ofanagreed
scheme.
5.3.18 The Council hasaprogramme ofrural housing needs surveys carried outthrough “Action
with Communities inRural Kent “.Where thesurvey shows evidence ofneed theCouncil willwork
with thelocal community andhousing providers toidentify andassist indelivering suitable sites that
meet thecriteria inPolicy SP4. The development ofGreen Belt land forrural exception sites willonly
beacceptable where there isevidence ofalocal need intheparish foraffordable housing, identified
through theneeds survey described above, thatcould notbemetbydeveloping nonGreen Beltland.
Sites released asanexception topolicy should bemade available exclusively foraffordable housing
tomeet strictly defined local needs inperpetuity .
5.3.19 Forthepurposes ofthepolicy local need isdefined asfollows:
The need ofthose unable togain access toexisting local accommodation suited totheir needs atan
affordable cost (the onus being onthehousehold toprove they cannot afford tobuy locally atcurrent
house prices within thelimits ofthedisposable income available tothem) and that fallwithin one or
more ofthefollowing categories:
those inthe Parish currently inaccommodation unsuited totheir circumstances forphysical,
medical, orsocial reasons and which isincapable ofbeing improved. “Improvement” inthis
context means any improvement achievable with grant assistance;
those who are dependants ofhouseholds who have been resident inthe Parish either fora
continuous period ofthree years oralternatively any five years outofthelast ten;
those who have been members ofhouseholds currently living inthe Parish and who have
recognised local connections, i.e.having family resident inthearea foraminimum oftenyears;
those employed full-time inthe Parish onother than ashort-term basis, orthose who will be
taking upsuch employment there, orthose who provide animportant service requiring them to
live locally.5.Strategic Policies

Affordable Housing inRural Areas
Small scale developments foraffordable housing only willbedeveloped tomeet local
needs identified through rural housing needs surveys. Thefollowing criteria willbeapplied
inidentifying sites:
a.thelocal need identified through therural housing needs survey cannot bemetbyany
other means through thedevelopment ofsites within thedefined confines ofasettlement
within theparish or,where appropriate, inanadjacent parish;
b.theproposal isofasize and type suitable tomeet theidentified local need and willbe
available atanappropriate affordable cost commensurate with theresults oftheappraisal.
The proposal isaccompanied byafinancial appraisal proving thescheme willmeet the
defined need. Schemes which propose anelement ofcross subsidy willnotbeacceptable;
c.theproposed siteisconsidered suitable forsuch purposes byvirtue ofitsscale and
issited within oradjoining anexisting village, isclose toavailable services and public
transport, and there arenooverriding countryside, conservation, environmental, or
highway impacts The initial and subsequent occupancy ofsites developed under this
policy willbecontrolled through planning conditions and agreements asappropriate to
ensure that theaccommodation remains available inperpetuity tomeet thepurposes for
which itwas permitted.
Delivery Mechanism:

recommends future provision should favour ofoneandtwobedroom units toaddress thecurrent
imbalance andrespond tofuture demographic change. While thesize profile ofnew dwellings will5.Strategic Policies

72only lead togradual change inthemake upoftheoverall housing stock, increasing theproportion of
smaller units innew development willover time lead toabetter balance between thehousing stock
andthesize ofdwellings needed inthefuture.
5.3.21 The lowproportion ofsmaller units inthehousing stock contributes totherelatively high
average price ofhousing intheDistrict. More small units should lead toanincrease intheproportion
ofrelatively lowcost market housing available tobuy,assisting those who arejustable toafford to
buyontheopen market.
5.3.22 TheStrategic Housing Market Assessment recommends targets formarket housing of20%
one bedroom, 30% two bedroom, 35% three bedroom and 15% four ormore bedroom and for
affordable housing itrecommends 35% one bedroom, 30% twobedroom and 35% three and four

mean that older people areremaining active forlonger ,anincrease inthenumber offrailelderly is
tobeexpected.
5.3.24 The housing stock needs toadapt tomeet therequirements ofanageing population. This
means providing new homes thatenable people tocontinue toliveindependently even though their
mobility may bereduced. The ability toadapt homes isoneofthe“Building forLife” criteria thatwill
beused inassessing new housing schemes (see policy SP1 and Appendix 5).While most older
people prefer toremain intheir own homes theageing population willalso mean some increased
provision willbeneeded ofhousing specifically designed forolder people including those with special

75Housing Density
5.3.30 Theproposed development strategy fortheDistrict isbased onmeeting future requirements
bydeveloping within existing settlements, particularly thelarger towns, rather than extending intothe
Green Belt. This approach depends onusing available sites within urban areas totheir fullpotential,
consistent with environmental factors. Using land efficiently means thateach sitecontributes more,
andless land intotal isneeded asaconsequence tomeet theDistrict’ sdevelopment requirements,
with beneficial effects forprotection ofthecountryside.
5.3.31 Higher density development willonly beappropriate inrelatively accessible locations where
residents willhave good access toservices. The policy reflects this, varying density according to
location.
5.3.32 Inallcases development willonly beacceptable where schemes arewell-designed anddo
notcompromise theoverall character ofthearea. Theappropriate density forindividual schemes will
vary taking account ofthecharacteristics ofthedevelopment siteand surrounding area. Allfigures

average. Itisdominated bytheservice sector withthehighest level ofemployment inwholesale and
retail trade followed bybusiness services. Nosector issubstantially over-represented incomparison
withtheregional average.
5.4.2 Sevenoaks isthelargest employment centre andisprimarily acentre forservice industries.
Swanley andEdenbridge also have significant concentrations ofemployment. Away from existing
settlements theMajor Developed Sites intheGreen BeltatFort Halstead andGlaxo Smith Kline in
Leigh arecentres fordefence-related andpharmaceutical industries respectively .Further development
tosupport these sectors willbesupported where itisconsistent with planning policy guidance on
Major Developed Sites.
5.4.3 The District asawhole remains relatively prosperous despite theimpact oftherecession
although unemployment hasrisen anddeprivation andlackofskills isanissue insome areas.
5.4.4 TheCouncil ispreparing anEconomic Development Action Plan, which sets outarange of
initiatives tosupport theDistrict’ seconomy .Keythemes include improved liaison withlocal businesses,
support fornewly forming andexpanding local firms, maintaining thesupply ofemployment land,
supporting initiatives toimprove skills, increasing theprovision ofaffordable housing, improving
transport through theTransport Strategy andsupporting therural economy andtourism.
5.4.5 TheLDF Core Strategy hasasignificant roleinimplementing theAction Plan intheprovision
itmakes fordevelopment. Other sections ofthisdocument cover economic development inthemain
towns, rural areas, transport andaffordable housing. With regard toemployment land, theEmployment
Land Review examines theDistrict’ sexisting stock ofemployment land forbusiness use. Itshows
thatthere isasignificant supply onawide range ofsites andthatthegreat majority isacceptably
located, although some sites areinneed ofmodernisation tomeet current business needs. The
review estimates future additional land requirements at0.3ha to1.5ha after allowance ismade for
thelossofunsuitable sites toother uses.
5.4.6 The limited deficit inemployment land supply canbemade upthrough intensification and
useofvacant land sothereview does notseeaneed torelease additional Greenfield land for
employment use, beyond thedevelopment ofasiteatSwanley thathaspreviously been identified.
5.4.7 Taking account ofthese findings theemphasis ofthepolicy isonretaining andmaking effective
useofexisting employment land. Support isgiven totheprinciple ofintensification andregeneration
ofexisting sites where necessary tobetter meet modern business needs. TheDistrict’ semployment
sites areseen asaflexible resource thatcanbeadapted, through redevelopment orchange ofuse

5.5Infrastructure Policy
5.5.1 Infrastructure canbedefined asthevarious services andfacilities thatarenecessary tohelp
build sustainable communities. The Council hastaken forward thedefinition ofinfrastructure from
theSouth East Plan. References tophysical, social andgreen infrastructure inpolicy SP9 should be
seen asapplying tothisdefinition. The definition setoutintheSouth East Plan (para. 5.22) includes
transport facilities, affordable housing (considered inother Core Strategy policies), education, health
services, social and community facilities, green infrastructure, public services, utilities and flood
defences (the fulldefinition issetoutintheglossary ofthisplan). New development cancreate a
need fornew andimproved infrastructure andinsome circumstances itsavailability may beafactor
indetermining where new development islocated. Supporting development withadequate infrastructure
isimportant forbalanced communities andtheneed forcommunity facilities isspecifically recognised
intheSevenoaks District Community Plan. Infrastructure improvements arealso required toresolve
existing identified deficiencies inSevenoaks District.
5.5.2 Government guidance requires Local Development Frameworks toidentify future requirements
needed tosupport theamount ofdevelopment proposed, taking account ofitstype anddistribution
andhow itwillbeprovided. This should take account ofexisting strategies andbeflexible enough to
recognise that theoptimum level ofinformation may notbeavailable from infrastructure providers
when LDF documents arebeing prepared.
5.5.3 AnInfrastructure Delivery Plan fortheDistrict hasbeen produced through engagement with
providers. Provision fornew development intheSevenoaks District isrelatively limited andthespatial
strategy oftheCore Strategy isbased onmaintaining theexisting pattern ofsettlement. TheCouncil
considers that there areonly asmall number ofinfrastructure improvements where ithas been
sufficiently demonstrated thatdelivery iscritical tothedelivery oftheCore Strategy .These are:
1. Education –additional capacity forprimary school places arerequired inSevenoaks andSwanley
after 2011/12 and 2012/13, respectively .This willbeprovided through extensions toexisting
primary schools.5.Strategic Policies

Network willberequired. Examples ofthemeasures that may berequired areincluded inthe
‘Swanley’ chapter oftheCore Strategy .
3. Open Space, Sport and Recreation –The Council’ sOpen Space, Sport and Recreation study
identifies anumber ofareas where thelevel ofprovision ofopen space, sport and recreation
facilities isnotsufficient tosupport further development. Improvements inprovision oraccessibility
willberequired, under policy SP10, tosupport development.
5.5.4 Inaddition tothese ‘critical’ infrastructure schemes, providers have identified arange of
improvements that they consider willserve theproposed development and overcome existing
deficiencies butwhich arenotconsidered tobecritical tothedelivery oftheCore Strategy .The
considerations thattheCouncil have taken intoaccount inmaking judgements about thecriticality of
infrastructure improvements aresetoutintheInfrastructure Delivery Schedule. SDC consider it
appropriate thatdevelopers make acontribution towards necessary infrastructure improvements and
community facilities thatareproportionate totheimpact ofdevelopment andmeets thetests ofCIL
Regulation 122(see para 5.5.7). The Council donotconsider thattheassessment ofascheme as
critical isanecessary prerequisite fortheseeking ofdeveloper contributions. Both those schemes
considered critical andnotcritical tosupport thescale anddistribution ofdevelopment proposed in
theCore Strategy aresetoutintheInfrastructure Schedule These arealso setoutintheInfrastructure
Schedule atAppendix 4.
5.5.5 The Council considers thattheoptimum level ofinformation hasnotbeen available from all
infrastructure providers during theprocess ofpreparing theInfrastructure Delivery Plan. Inresponse
tothis, theCouncil willtreat theInfrastructure Delivery Plan Schedule asa‘live’ document and will
identify theneed foramendments through theLDF monitoring and review process. Preparation of
theAllocations and Development Management DPD willprovide theopportunity forproviders to
assess the detailed infrastructure requirements fordevelopment sites. The Allocations and
Development Management DPD willsetoutthese detailed infrastructure requirements.
Planning Obligations
5.5.6 Where new infrastructure orinfrastructure improvements arerequired asaresult ofnew
development, theplanning system allows, through planning obligations, fordevelopers toprovide,
orappropriately contribute towards, theprovision ofthisnew orimproved infrastructure.
5.5.7 Government policy ontheuseofplanning obligations issetoutinCircular 05/05 andpart 11
oftheCommunity Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010. Regulation 122oftheCILRegulations 2010
sets outthree tests which should bemetinorder toensure thattheseeking ofplanning obligations
islegal. These tests are, ensuring that planning obligations are‘necessary tomake theproposed
development acceptable inplanning terms’, “directly related tothedevelopment” and ‘fairly and
reasonably related inscale and kind totheproposed development’. The effectoftheinfrastructure
investment may betoconfer some wider benefit onthecommunity butpayments should bedirectly
related inscale totheimpact which theproposed development willmake. Planning obligations should
notbeused solely toresolve existing deficiencies.
5.5.8 Through engagement ontheInfrastructure Delivery Plan fortheDistrict, anumber ofproviders
have indicated that they consider there tobeacase fornew development contributing towards
improvements, asthese willserve new populations resulting from development andresolve existing
deficiencies. The Council willbring forward aDeveloper Contributions SPD, which willsetoutthe
levels ofcontributions andmethodologies forcalculating contributions thattheCouncil willsupport.
5.5.9 The Council isalso requiring asignificant contribution from new housing towards affordable
housing andrequiring new development tomeet progressively tightening standards oftheCode for
Sustainable Homes and BREEAM. Inconsidering theappropriate level ofcontribution from new5.Strategic Policies

80development towards infrastructure theCouncil willtake into account theimportance ofensuring
provision foraffordable housing can bemade inaccordance with Policy SP3 and have regard to
viability issues.
5.5.10 InApril 2010, theGovernment published regulations fortheintroduction and operation of
theCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which empower ,butdonotrequire local planning authorities
tocharge developers astandard, locally set,sum forlocal andsub-regional infrastructure, dependent
onthetype and character ofdevelopment. Inorder toimplement CIL, local authorities arerequired
toproduce acharging schedule setting outtherates that developers arerequired topay,which is
subject toindependent examination.
5.5.1 1Currently theCouncil does notconsider thatthelevel ofinvestment ininfrastructure required
tosupport development inSevenoaks District warrants the introduction ofCIL. However ,CIL
Regulations place limits ontheuseofpooled contributions secured through planning obligations from
April 2014 (Regulation 123). If,through consultation with infrastructure providers, itwas deemed
necessary tointroduce CILtosecure infrastructure improvement necessary tosupport development
inSevenoaks District, theCouncil’ sInfrastructure Delivery Plan andproposed Developer Contributions
SPD would beused todevelop aCILcharging schedule.

Natural andsemi-natural space, e.g.woodlands, urban forestry ,scrubland, grasslands, wetlands,
nature reserves, wastelands.
Amenity green space, e.g.informal recreation spaces, green spaces
Provision forchildren andyoung people, e.g.equipped play areas, ballcourts, skateboard areas,

recommended that additional local provision bemade forchildren's plan areas and allotments in
various locations around theDistrict. The Council willbring forward aPlaying Pitch Strategy ,in
accordance with therecommendations oftheOpen Space, Sport andRecreation Study .
5.6.4 Proposals fornew sites recommended inthestudy aregenerally small-scale andintended
tomeet local needs. They willonly betaken forward where there isclear evidence ofsupport from
thelocal community .Additionally insome smaller villages with little provision forfurther development
increased open space provision may notbeviable.
5.6.5 The study included anassessment ofindoor sports facilities, which assessed thesupply of
anddemand forvarious different sports facilities intheDistrict. Itconsidered thequantity ,quality and
accessibility ofthese facilities. Itconcluded thatthere arenomajor deficiencies insports facilities in
thearea with theexception ofindoor tennis.
5.6.6 The Community Plan recognises theneed toprotect open spaces and promote theuseof
leisure facilities and open spaces. These areimportant inhelping tocreate green and healthy
environments. The Sevenoaks District Play Strategy 2007 –2010 acknowledges theimportance of5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
82play forchildren and young people and seeks toidentify ways inwhich play opportunities and
experiences canbeincreased andenhanced across theSevenoaks District. Itincludes anaction
plan which includes actions to:
Improve opportunities forplay andinformal recreation
Promote equality andsocial inclusion
Promote health andphysical activity
Improve community safety andreducing fearofcrime
Promote partnerships withtown andparish councils
5.6.7 National planning policy promotes thedevelopment ofGreen Infrastructure Networks through
local development frameworks. InSevenoaks District land identified through theOpen Spaces Study
willform akeyinput tothenetwork aswillaccessible open space inthecountryside. Land ofbiodiversity
value, willalso beakeyinput, including Biodiversity Opportunity Areas thathave been defined for
Kent based ontheSouth East England Biodiversity Strategy andtheKent Biodiversity Action Plan.
TheGreen Infrastructure Network willinclude consideration ofpossibilities forstrengthening linkages
between open spaces andpotential wildlife corridors, linking open spaces within urban areas, open
spaces connecting urban andrural areas andopen spaces within rural areas. TheGreen Infrastructure
Network willplayanimportant roleinhelping communities tobemore resilient totheeffects ofclimate
change. Provision fornewdevelopment avoids extending builtdevelopment intothecountryside and,
within urban areas, studies toidentify potential development sites have sought toavoid sites designated
fortheir wildlife value andopen spaces ofamenity orrecreational value. Consequently theimpact of
development ontheGreen Infrastructure Network islimited butwith therelatively limited provision
fordevelopment intheDistrict, thescope forcreating additional green infrastructure inassociation
withnewdevelopment isalsomore limited than areas withhigher development provision. TheCouncil
willwork with relevant organisations toexplore potential funding sources forenhancement ofthe
Green Infrastructure Network inaddition toseeking appropriate contributions from developers.
5.6.8 TheGreen Infrastructure Network willbedeveloped through theAllocations andDevelopment
Management DPD which willidentify areas ofvalue forbiodiversity ,open space, sport andrecreation
purposes andprotect them from development. Itwillalso bring forward proposals fornew sites to
address deficiencies inprovision identified intheOpen Space, Sport andRecreation Study where
they aresupported bythelocal community .
5.6.9 Wherever possible, theCouncil willseek opportunities, including through new development,
tocreate andextend green corridors andtoenhance thebiodiversity value ofopen space.
5.6.10 Residential development increases thedemand foropen space, sport andrecreation facilities
andthishasacumulative effectonexisting provision. Therefore, theCouncil willrequire theprovision
ofnew orimproved open space, sport andrecreation facilities ifdevelopment isproposed inareas
where there isadeficiency inexisting provision orinsituations where thedevelopment itself would
result inadeficiency inprovision. Local standards intheOpen Space, Sport andRecreation Study
willbeapplied indetermining whether there isadeficiency .Thedeveloper willalso need toshow
how new open space facilities willbemaintained.
Policy SP10
Green Infrastructure, Open Space, Sport andRecreation Provision
AGreen Infrastructure Network willbedeveloped ofaccessible multi functional green
space, primarily based onmaintaining andlinking existing areas ofopen space.5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
83Open space, sport and recreation facilities, including indoor sports facilities ofvalue to
thelocal community willberetained. Development may exceptionally beallowed where
replacement provision ofatleast equivalent value tothelocal community isprovided.
Residential development proposals inareas where there isanexisting shortage inopen
space provision, orwhere thedevelopment would otherwise result inashortage in
provision, willbeexpected tocontribute toovercoming theshortage, either through on
siteprovision orafinancial contribution tooffsiteprovision. Provision should include
arrangements formaintenance oftheopen space.
Forthepurposes ofthis policy ,open space includes amenity open space, parks and
formal gardens, natural andsemi natural open space, children's play areas, outdoor sports
facilities, churchyards andallotments.
Delivery Mechanisms:
The Allocations and Development Management DPD willsetoutproposals fortheGreen
Infrastructure Network which willinclude, areas ofvalue forbiodiversity ,opportunities and
locations forbiodiversity enhancement (including creation ofnew habitats) taking account of
defined Biodiversity Opportunity Areas, open space sites identified forretention under thepolicy ,
new areas ofopen space taking account ofthefindings oftheOpen Spaces Study ,opportunities
forlinking open spaces and areas ofbiodiversity value toimprove connectivity forpeople and
wildlife andtargets forimplementation andproposals foreffective long term management ofsites
forming part ofthenetwork.
The Local Standards setoutintheOpen Spaces Study willbeused todetermine whether a

5.7Biodiversity
5.7.1 Government guidance aims topromote sustainable development byensuring thatbiological
diversity isconserved and enhanced asanintegral part ofsocial, environmental and economic
development. The Kent Habitat Survey (2003) identified habitats ofimportance within theDistrict.
The District contains noSpecial Area ofConservation (SAC) orSpecial Protection Areas (SPA)of
European importance, buttheHabitat Regulations Assessment concludes thatthere may beavery
small impact ontheAshdown Forest SAC and SPAfrom additional development proposed inthe
Core Strategy fortheDistrict. Inaccordance withtherecommendations oftheAssessment theCouncil5.Strategic Policies
Sevenoaks District Council Core Strategy Adopted February 2011
84willsupport thework oftheHigh Weald AONB Joint Advisory Committee inmanaging recreational
pressures onAshdown Forest. Application ofPolicy SP10 willensure recreational open space remains
available tomeet local needs intheDistrict.
5.7.2 There are17Sites ofSpecial Scientific Interest, (SSSIs) within theDistrict, which areof
national importance fortheir biological orgeological interest, and 57Local Wildlife Sites, identified
bytheKent Wildlife Trust, which areofCounty-wide importance. Ancient woodlands areafeature of
thecountryside andarealso aparticularly richsource ofbiodiversity thatshould beafforded ahigh
level ofprotection. Acomprehensive survey oftheDistrict’ sAncient Woodlands isshortly tobecarried
out.
5.7.3 However ,biodiversity isnotconfined toprotected sites butoccurs throughout rural andurban
areas. Itistherefore important, andinaccordance with Government advice, thatBiodiversity Action
Plan priority habitats andspecies areprotected andenhanced wherever they occur .
5.7.4 Indesignating appropriate areas fordevelopment, theCore Strategy has ensured that
designated areas ofimportance forbiodiversity willnotdirectly beharmed and new development
should avoid damage totheecological value ofsuch areas. The extent and location ofdesignated
sites isshown inFigure 7.New development, whether onbrownfield orgreenfield sites, gives the
opportunity tocreate orrestore areas ofbiodiversity ,based onthepriority habitats andspecies set
outintheNational andKent Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) andonBiodiversity Opportunity Areas
thathave been defined forKent. TheCouncil willexpect such proposals tobeanintegral partofnew
development. Where there areopportunities, thedesign ofnew developments, including open spaces,
should incorporate habitat linkages that provide theopportunity toenhance biodiversity .Further
guidance canbefound in'Biodiversity ByDesign' andtheBiodiversity Appendix totheKent Design
Guide, 2006. Support willbegiven totheapplication ofagri-environment schemes, forestry ,flood
defence and other land management practices todeliver biodiversity targets, increase thewildlife
value ofland, reduce diffuse pollution, andprotect soilresources.
Policy SP11
BiodiversityThebiodiversity oftheDistrict willbeconserved andopportunities sought forenhancement
toensure nonetloss ofbiodiversity .
Sites designated forbiodiversity value willbeprotected with thehighest level ofprotection
given tonationally designated Sites ofSpecial Scientific Interest, followed byLocal Wildlife
Sites andsites oflocal importance forbiodiversity .Designated sites willbemanaged with
theprimary objective ofpromoting biodiversity whilst also providing forappropriate levels
ofpublic access.
Opportunities willbesought fortheenhancement ofbiodiversity through thecreation,
protection, enhancement, extension andmanagement ofsites andthrough themaintenance
and, where possible, enhancement ofagreen infrastructure network toimprove
connectivity between habitats .
