MM1  Policy para 
(3)(a) (3)  Where  there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of date at the time of 
making the decision, then the Council will grant permission unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise, taking into account whether:  
a) Specific policies in that Framework indicate that development should be restricted. The application  of 
policies in the  National Planning Policy  Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance 
provides a clear reason for refusing the development propo sed; or  
MM1  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.1.4  4.1.4  Local Planning Authorities are encouraged to include a policy within their Local Plan that embraces the 
presumption in favour of sustainable development.  Policy S1 meets this requirement and adopts the  
model wording suggested. When implementing Policy S1, local circumstances will be taken into account to 
respond to different opportunities for achieving sustainable development. In accordance with the 
NPPF policies in the NPPF that protect important natura l and heritage assets , the presumption will not 
automatically apply to policies relating to; habitats sites (including  sites protected under the Birds and 
Habitats Directives ) and/or , designated  as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) , development 
requiring appropriate assessment because of its potential impact on a habitats site8, land designated as 
Green Belt , or Local Green Space, the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated 
heritage assets , and or locations identified as at risk of flooding.

 Policy S2: Planning for the borough - our spatial development strategy  
MM2  Policy para s 
(1) to (3)  (1)  The housing requirement for Guildford is 562 dwellings per annum over the plan period (2015 – 2034).  
During the plan period (2015 -34), we will make  provision has been made  for at least 12,426  10,678 new 
homes ., Table S2a shows the contribution of all sources of housing supply, whilst the distribution  of supply 
across the spa tial locations is shown in Table S2b.  
 (2)  The delivery of homes is expected to increase over the plan period, reflective of timescales associated 
with the delivery of strategic sites and infrastructure. The housing target each year is as set out below, 
however, this is not a ceiling, and earlier delivery of allocated sites will be supported where appropriate, 
subject to infrastructure  provision.  
(2a)  Provision has been made  for at least 36,100 – 43,700 sq m of office and research and development (B1a 
and b) floorspace (net);  3.7– 4.1 hectares of industrial (B1c, B2 and B8) land (gross); and 41,000 sq m of 
comparison retail floorspace (gross).  
(3)  Provision has been made for  4 permanent pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 4 permanent plots for 
Travelling Showpeople (as defined by Planning Policy for Traveller Sites) within Guildford borough 
between 2017 and 2034. Whilst the needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showp eople who do not 
meet the planning definition fall outside this allocation, in order to meet their assessed needs the Council 
will seek to make provision for 41 permanent pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 4 permanent plots for 
Travelling Showpeople wh o do not meet the definition. The Council will also seek to make provision for 8 
permanent pitches to meet potential additional need of households of unknown planning status.

para 4.1.9a  
to 4.1.10  Reasoned justification  
4.1.9a  The figures set out in the Annual Housing Target table sum to a total of 12,426 homes. This is lower than 
the total supply of homes identified in the Land Availability Assessment as having potential to be delivered  
over the plan period. This buffer builds flexibility into the plan and demonstrates that our strategy is 
capable of delivering the target. It also adopts a phased target that gradually increases over time rather 
than the same annualised target of 654 home s each year. This is due to the likely rate of delivery, 
particularly on the strategic greenfield sites, which is dependent upon the delivery of necessary 
infrastructure expected to occur towards the end of the plan period. National policy requires that we meet 
objectively assessed housing needs, including any unmet need from neighbouring authorities, where it is 
practical to do so and consistent with achieving sustainable development. Guildford’s objectively assessed 
housing need has been based on a conside ration of the latest 2 016-based population  and household  
projections. Applied to this demographic housing need is a necessary uplift to take account of market 
signals and affordable housing need, assumptions of future economic growth, and an increased grow th in 
the student population.  
4.1.9ab  Our total housing supply over the plan period (2015 -2034) is indicated in the table below and will comprise 
homes from a variety of sources in addition to the Local Plan’s site allocations .

4.1.9b   National policy requires that we are able to demonstrate a rolling five year housing land supply from  the 
5 
 date of adoption.  This phased approach is necessary in order to ensure that the Council is able to 
demonstrate a rolling five -year supply of housing from the date of adoption, as required by national policy.  
This will alsomust  take account of both the deficit accrued until that point and includes a 20 per cent buffer 
moved forward from later in the plan period. Without a rolling five -year supply of homes  or where the 
Housing Delivery Test indicates that the delivery of housing was substantially belo w the housing 
requirement over the previous three years , the policies which are most  important for determining a 
planning application  relevant policies for the supply of housing would not be considered  up-to-date.  
4.1.10  This is still a higher level of development than experienced in Guildford borough during the previous Local 
Plan period, and represents an increase in new homes in line with the aims of NPPF and NPPG, and the 
best available information on the likely levels  of development to 2034. The phased approach is related to 
assumptions on the most likely rate of delivery only and do not in any way preclude the earlier delivery of 
these sites where this is sustainable to do  so. National policy states that where possibl e the deficit accrued 
since the start of the plan period should be met within the first five years. Given the step change in housing 
requirement compared to past delivery rates which have been constrained by Green Belt policy, the 
accrued backlog at the da te of adoption is significant. Whilst the plan includes numerous smaller sites 
capable of being delivered early in the plan period, there are a number of strategic sites that have longer 
lead in times. For these reasons, the backlog will be met over the pl an period, using the Liverpool 
approach to calculating a rolling five year housing land supply rather than the Sedgefield approach.  
4.1.11  Further details of the sites that are considered to be key to delivering the strategy are provided in the site 
allocations policy of the Local Plan and shown on the Policies Map. The key infrastructure requirements on 
which the delivery of the plan depends is set out in the infrastructure schedule included as Appendix C or 
the latest Infrastructure Delivery Plan . Details of all the sites that are expected to be delivered from now 
until the end of the plan period  are set out in the Council’s latest Land Availability  Assessment.  The 
expected phasing of sites is set out in the Housing Trajectory, included at Appendix 0 . This will be updated 
annually in the Council’s Monitoring Report.

 Policy S3: Delivery of development and regeneration within Guildford Town Centre  
MM3  New p olicy 
(whole 
policy)  POLICY S3: Delivery of development and regeneration within Guildford Town Centre  
 
Coordination of development in the Town Centre  
(1) Development proposals will be encouraged to seek opportunities to enable the future development 
potential of adjacent sites and not undermine their development potential.   
More e fficient use of land and the acceleration of housing delivery  
(2) Major applications will be expected to deliver a mix of uses and include residential development.  
Residential development in mixed use schemes will be expected to meet identified housing need.    
(3) Schemes must demonstrate that they have made the m ost efficient use of land both in terms of the 
quantum of development and the mix of uses.  
(4) In seeking to achieve more efficient use of land and/or accelerated housing delivery and/or regeneration, 
the Council will where appropriate utilise mechanisms s uch as its compulsory purchase powers.  
Place shaping and character and design of new development  
(5) New development will have regard to:  
a) the provisions of Policy D1;  
b) the historic environment, street pattern and topography;  
c) important views into a nd out of the town centre from the surrounding landscape;  
d) views within the town centre of important historic buildings and local landmarks.  
(6) Schemes must demonstrate high quality urban design and contribute wherever possible to achieving:  
a) mixed us e developments with active ground floor uses;  
b) defined public and private spaces which are well -enclosed;  
c) an attractive and safe public realm;  
d) legible routes that are easy to understand and to move through, and give priority to pedestrians and 
cyclists over motor vehicles;  
e) improved access and views to the River Wey.

 MM3  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.1.18  
to 4.1.25  Reasoned justification  
4.1.18  Our Corporate Plan (2018 -2023) identifies regenerating and improving Guildford town centre and other 
urban areas as one of three strategic priorities supporting its “Place Making” theme. Key projects to support 
this and the delivery of the Local Plan include:  
(a)  Facilitating the delivery of a major new mixed development in North Street  
(b)  Implementing  the vision of the Town Centre Regeneration Strategy  
(c)  Improving the public realm, including surfaces, in key town centre areas  
4.1.19  This policy and the Town Centre Regeneration Strategy will help deliver the following objectives:  
(a) enhance the vibrancy of Guildford Town Centre  
(b) create and foster high quality design  
(c) protect the town’s heritage and overall feel  
(d) respect existing townscape at both the street and roof level  
(e) create an enhanced and more positive public realm  
(f) reduce t he concrete environment atmosphere  
(g) realise the Council’s ‘drive to, not through’ concept to reduce the impact of traffic in the town centre, 
complementing future environmental improvements  
(h) link the Town Centre to the train station  
(i) open up the R iver Wey and improve connections to the river  
(j) assist in meeting Guildford’s housing demand  
(k) ensure schemes are sustainable and do not lock future development potential  
(l) promote and create an investment friendly environment  
4.1.20  Whilst the Counc il will play a key coordinating role aimed at achieving delivery of development and 
regeneration, working with partners such as Surrey County Council, Network Rail and the National Trust, 
the private sector is central to this process. It is important that schemes that seek planning permission are 
conceived and designed in a manner that considers regeneration opportunities beyond the boundaries of 
the site. Collaboration between adjacent and surrounding property owners in the Guildford town centre, 
including  efforts that seek to maximise regeneration opportunities through mutually supportive design 
elements, uses and access arrangements are supported.  
 
9 
 4.1.21  The delivery of housing in the town centre adds to its vitality and vibrancy. The Council regards t he town 
centre as critical in terms of meeting needs for main town centre uses. This includes high trip generating 
uses such as offices and retail, where there are opportunities to encourage linked trips and maximise the 
use of public transport networks. H owever, the town centre also represents the most sustainable location 
for new higher density housing. Whilst the Local Plan provides for sufficient sites to meet housing needs 
over the plan period, as part of regeneration efforts, more housing is likely to  come forward over the plan 
period. It is important that this occurs in a manner that makes the most of its central location and is thus 
developed at a density that maximises its sustainability benefits whilst responding to heritage, design and 
flooding co nsiderations. Consideration should also be given to the potential to minimise the provision of car 
parking where this can help optimise the density of development.  
4.1.22  The Council will support mixed use development, which can retain or re -provide retail , leisure and 
employment uses/floorspace in the town centre, in line with national and Local Plan policies. This will help 
ensure the efficient use of land and presents an opportunity to enhance the vitality of the town centre and 
increase delivery of home s in sustainable locations.  
4.1.23  Enhancing the vitality and vibrancy of the town centre cannot occur solely though more intense uses, nor 
greater numbers of residents. A quality public realm needs to support day -to-day activities, peoples’ well -
being, s afety and sense of place and forms the basis for the area’s attractiveness to residents, workers and 
visitors.  
4.1.24  The public realm includes publicly -owned streets, squares, pathways, parks, publicly accessible open 
spaces, right of ways, and any public  or private building and facilities that are accessible by all. Whilst parts 
of the town centre reflect high quality public environments, there are areas where this could be improved. 
This is often in areas that represent opportunities for regeneration and  intensification of development.  
4.1.25  The enhancement of the public realm and its amenity value will ensure the town centre becomes an even 
more attractive place to live, work and visit and will be a key component of the area’s regeneration. This 
could occur through a range of interventions such as improving surfacing of public space, providing more 
generous pedestrian environments, landscaping, street furniture, lighting and public art. The Council will 
seek contributions toward the improvement of the p ublic realm from developments, where appropriate. The 
Council will also continue working with Surrey County Council to implement measures that deliver public 
realm enhancements.

or Travelling Showpeople (as defined by Planning Policy fo r Traveller Sites) as set out in the latest Traveller 
Accommodation Assessment as well as to cater for the potential additional needs of households of unknown 
planning status.  These sites are for a mix of tenures and provided on a number of small sites an d as part of 
larger development sites to help create sustainable and mixed communities. Sites are also allocated within 
the Local Plan to contribute to meeting the assessed needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople who do not meet the Planning  Policy for Traveller Sites definition.

Justification 
paras 4.2.22  
and 4.2.23  4.2.22  The identified traveller accommodation target is set out in Policy S2 (3).  Sufficient sites are 
identified allocated within the Local Plan to meet  the target based on  the accommodation need identified in 
the TAA (2017)  for 4 permanent pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 4 plots for Travelling Showpeople 
up to 2034. There are also sufficient allocated sites to make provision for 8 permanent pitche s to meet 
potential additional  need of households of unknown planning traveller status. These allocated sites are for 
a mix of tenures and provided on a number of small sites and as part of larger development sites to help 
create sustainable and mixed comm unities.  
4.2.23  Whilst t The needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople who do not meet the Planning Policy 
for Traveller Sites  planning  policy  definition fall outside this target14allocation, . However, in order to meet 
their assessed needs , as demonstrated through the TAA (2017) findings,  we will seek to provide 41 
permanent pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 4 permanent plots for Travelling Showpeople who do 
not meet the planning policy  definition. A total of 59 Gypsy and Traveller pitches (net) and 8 Travelling 
Showpeople plots (net) have been identified in the site allocation policies.  We will also seek to make 
provision for 8 permanent pitches to meet potential additional need of households of unknown planning 
traveller status.Our The TAA (2017)  found no evidence of need for a transit site within our borough.  The 
Council will keep this position under review and, should the need for a transit site arise, will work with 
neighbouring authorities to address this. However, we will continue to wo rk with neighbouring authorities to 
address the issue of transit sites if necessary.

 Policy H 2: Affordable homes  
MM6  Policy para s 
(2) to (4a)  (2) The Council We will also seek affordable homes on sites providing five11 or more homes  (gross) , or sites 
of 0.17 ha or more regardless of the number of homes or where dwellings would have a combined gross 
internal floorspace of more than 1,000 square metres . WeThe Council  will seek at least 40 % per cent  of 
the homes on these sites as affordable homes.   
(2a) In Designated Rural Areas, the threshold where we will seek an affordable housing contribution of at least 
40% of the homes on these sites will be on sites providing more than 5 dwellings. For developments of 
between 6 and 10 dwellings inclusive (gr oss), a financial contribution in lieu of on -site provision of 
affordable housing will be sought which is of broadly equivalent value relative to on -site provision.  
(3) The tenure and number of bedrooms of the affordable homes provided on each qualifying s ite must 
contribute, to the Council’s satisfaction, towards meeting the mix of affordable housing needs identified in 
the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2015, or subsequent affordable housing needs evidence.  This 
currently includes a tenure split of at least 70% Affordable Rent, with the remainder being other forms of 
affordable housing. A minimum of 10% of the affordable homes provided on each site under this policy must 
be available for affordable home ownership, except where an exemption applies in  the NPPF.  Affordable 
Rent must be no more than the maximum level set out in our most recent housing guidance or strategy.   
(4) Affordable housing contributions may be provided off -site, or by payment in lieu where the Council agrees 
that on site provisio n and management would be impractical due to size and / or location of the 
development. Off -site provision or payment in lieu is expected to enable the same amount of additional 
affordable housing as would have been delivered on site. The agreed off -site p rovision must be completed 
before 50% of the market homes are occupied unless otherwise agreed by the Council. On developments 
in designated rural areas of between 6 and 10 dwellings inclusive (gross), the commuted payment in lieu 
of on -site affordable hou sing provision will be payable after completion of the units within the development.  
(4a)    If developers satisfactorily demonstrate that providing the amount of affordable housing required by this 
policy would not be economically viable, the Council will  consider the following to assist with delivering a 
scheme:  
(a) varying the tenure mix of the affordable housing (for example, more intermediate housing and less 
rented housing), size, and/or type of homes to be provided; and/or  
(b) reducing  the overall number of affordable homes.  
 
 
13 
 MM6  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.35  4.2.35  This policy applies to all new homes within the C3 Use Class.  This generally includes retirement homes, 
as well as self -contained studio flats for a single househol d, whether specifically aimed at students or not.  
It does not apply to residential institutions such as care homes and nursing homes.  Assisted living, extra 
care and other C2 residential developments may be required to make provision; these will be consi dered 
on a case -by-case basis.   
MM6  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.38  4.2.38  Land values and property prices are generally high across the borough, although with considerable 
variation.  Our viability evidence shows that the vast majority of housing dev elopments in most locations in 
the borough are viable providing an affordable housing contribution of 40 per cent.  Bearing in mind that 
viability assessment was undertaken in preparation of the Local Plan, the impact  of policies on 
development viability h ave been considered and are regarded as realistic. The need for a viability 
assessment at planning application stage will thus need clear justification by the applicant in line with 
paragraph 57 of the NPPF. Should this need be accepted, the Council will n eed to weigh the outcomes 
and implications of the viability assessment against all circumstances relating to the case as part of 
considering the acceptability of the proposal.  
MM6  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.40  4.2.40  There may be some circumstances where abnormal costs would make the scheme unviable to deliver.  
Where developers demonstrate to our satisfaction that providing the amount of affordable housing 
required by this policy would not be economically viable, we may consider the following to ass ist with 
delivering a scheme:  
(a) vary the tenure mix of the affordable housing (for example, more intermediate housing and less 
rented housing), size, and/or type of homes to be provided  
(b) reduce the overall number of affordable homes  
MM6  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.42  4.2.42  In calculating the number of affordable homes to be provided on a site, fractions of homes will sometimes 
be required .  In order to avoid requirements for fractions of homes we will therefore  round  up any  part 
requirement  of an affordable housing  dwelling in  line with common  convention  at 0.5  of a home,  and down  
at 0.4  or less .  A replacement home , would not therefore make any contribution as part of a development 
scheme , would count when determining whether the scheme meets the minimum threshold for which an  
affordable housing contribution is required,  although would not count when calculating the number of 
affordable units needed .

(1) and (2)  (1) Small  scale  affordable housing developments  in the Green Belt , which can include  including pitches for 
travellers Gypsies and Travellers not meeting the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites definition of a gypsy or 
traveller16, will be permitted to meet identified local affordable  housing needs provided that:   
a) the site adjoins or is closely related to, and in safe and reasonable walking distance of a defined or a non -
defined  rural settlement, and  
b) the number, size and tenure of homes would be appropriate to meet, or to contribute to meeting, the 
identified  affordable housing needs of the local community , and  
c) the affordable homes are all secured in perpetuity.  
(2)   The minimum number of market  homes to make a rural exception scheme viable will be permitted where:  
(a)  a developer demonstrates that the scheme would be unviable without the inclusion of market housing, 
and 
(b)  it does not inflate the threshold land value17, and  
(c)  it is suitabl y integrated into the rural exception development.  
MM7  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.49  4.2.49  We will work with parish councils, the Surrey Rural Housing Enabler and landowners to understand the 
affordable housing needs of people with a local connection to specific rural areas.  In applying this policy, 
consideration will be given to the needs of t he local community by accommodating households who  are 
current or recent f ormer residents of the Parish or  have a current employment or family connection  to it., or 
are current or recent former residents of the Parish.  We will also facilitate provision of  rural exception sites 
for local agricultural workers, and for local  settled  traveller s needs  who don’t meet the Planning Policy for 
Traveller Sites definition of gypsy or traveller  where such an accommodation  need is demonstrated  in line 
with Policy H3 (1 ). Traveller  rural exception housing  accommodation  will be provided on council -owned 
public pitches on small, suitably located sites in the Green Belt.   
MM7  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.2.52  4.2.52  There may be situations where a developer demonstrates that a rural exception scheme would be 
unviable.  In such situations, and where there are no alternative sites available to provide the identified 
local affordable housing needs (as required by national policy) we may consider permitting the minimum 
number  of market homes to make the scheme viable.  We may also consider allowing at least one market 
home where this would result in a significant improvement in the housing mix (tenure, type or size) or rent 
levels.  The inclusion of market housing must serve t o benefit the rural affordable housing stock and not 
inflate the “threshold land value”.  This is the minimum land value likely to trigger an owner to sell the land.

Policy P2: Green Belt  
MM9  Policy 
paragraphs  
(1) to (4)  (1) The Metropolitan Green Belt  will continue to be protected , as designated on the Policies Map, will continue 
to be protected against inappropriate development in accordance with the NPPF .  In accordance with 
national planning policy, the construction of new development will be considered inappropriate 
andInappropriate development will not be permitted unless very special circumstances can be 
demonstrated. Very spe cial circumstances will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by 
reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations.  
(2) Certain forms of development are not considered to be inappropriate .  Proposals will be permitted where 
they are consistent with the exceptions listed in national planning policy and, where relevant, also meet the 
following criteria: The construction of new buildings in the Green Belt will constitute inappropriate 
developm ent, unless the buildings fall within the list of exceptions identified by the NPPF. For the purpose 
of this policy, the following definitions will apply to those exceptions:  
Extensions or alterations  
(3) The extension or alteration of a building provided that it would not result in disproportionate additions over 
and above the size of the original building.  
(a)     The “original building” shall mean either:  
i.        the building as it existed on 1 July 1948; or  
ii.       if no building existed on 1 July 1 948, then the first building as it was originally built after this date  
 
 
16 
 Replacement buildings  
(4) The replacement of a building, provided the new building:  
(a) would be in the same use, and  
(b) is not materially larger than the one it replaces, and  
(c) is sited on or close to the position of the existing building.  
 
(b) A new building will only constitute a “replacement” if it is sited on or in a position that substantially 
overlaps that of the original building, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that an alternative position 
would not increase the overall impact on the openness of the Green Belt.  
Limited infilling  
(c) “limited infilling” shall mean:  
i. Limited infilling within the identified settlement boundaries, as designated on the Policies Map, of 
the following villages. Limited infilling may also be appropriate outside the identified settlement 
boundaries where it can be demonstrated that the site s hould be considered to be within the village.  
 
Albury, Compton, East Clandon, East  Horsley (south) , Gomshall, Holmbury St Mary, Peaslake, 
Pirbright, Puttenham, Ripley, Shere, West Clandon , and Worplesdon.  
 
ii. Limited infilling may also be appropriate outs ide the inset settlement boundaries, as designated on 
the Policies Map, of the following villages where it can be demonstrated that the site should be 
considered to be within the village.  
 
Ash Green, Chilworth, East Horsley, Effingham, Fairlands, Flexford,  Jacobs Well, Normandy, 
Peasmarsh, Ripley, Send, Send Marsh/ Burnt Common, Shalford, West Horsley and Wood Street 
Village.  
 
iii. Limited infilling may also be appropriate either outside the inset or identified settlement boundaries, 
orand in the following villages, where it can be demonstrated that the site should be  is as a matter 
of fact  considered to be  within the village:  
 
Artington, Eashing, Farley Green, Fox Corner, Hurtmore, Ockham, Seale, Shackleford, The Sands, 
Wanborough and Wisl ey. 
17 
 (3a) Certain other forms of development are also considered not inappropriate in the Green Belt provided they 
preserve its openness and do not conflict with the purposes of including land within it, and these are listed 
in the NPPF.  
MM9  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.3.21  4.3.21  For the purpose of this policy, the original building is defined as the building as it existed on 1 July 1948 or, 
if constructed after 1 July 1948, as it was built originally.  For the avoidance of doubt, if no building ex isted 
on 1 July 1948, then the original building is considered to be the first building as it was originally built after 
this date.  
MM9  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.3.23  4.3.23  Replacement buildings are expected to be sited on or close to the position of  the original building, unless it 
can be clearly demonstrated that an alternative position would reduce the overall impact on the openness 
of the Green Belt . 
MM9  Reasoned 
Justification 
para 4.3.25  4.3.25  In order to provide some certainty, settlement boun daries have nevertheless been identified for those 
villages that are of a scale and form that enable a boundary to be established with a degree of certainty.  
Proposals within these areas are considered to be in the village and limited infilling here would  be 
appropriate.  However, the built form of many of the villages extends wider than the boundary and, in 
some instances, proposals here may also be considered to be in the village.  These will need to be 
assessed on a case -by-case basis and, if considered  to be in the village, then limited infilling here would 
also be appropriate.  Those villages for which no boundary has been identified are listed in the policy and 
would also need to be assessed on a case -by-case basis.  There are a number of consideration s to take 
account of when assessing whether a site is located within the village. This includes factors such as the 
pattern of development, and the proposed development’s relationship to the built up area of the village and 
the surrounding countryside.

MM10  Policy para 
(1) (1) Within the area of countryside, as designated on the Policies Map, development will be permitted provided 
it: 
(a) requires a countryside location or where a rural location can be justified, and  
(b) is proportionate to the nature and scale of the site, its setting and countryside location, and  
(c) does not lead to greater physical or visual coalescence between the (i) Ash and Tongham urban area 
and (ii) either  Aldershot  or Ash Green village .

para 
4.3.34a  4.3.34a  Significant growth is planned to occur to the south eastern  corner of the previously defined Ash and 
Tongham urban area. Whilst an element of merging will occur between the urban area and the northern 
extent of Ash Green village, it is important that this is limited to this area to protect the separate identities 
of these settlements. Any development within the remaining area of land that is designated countryside will 
be strongly resisted.

 Policy P5: Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area  
MM12  Policy para 
(1) (1) Permission will only be granted for development proposals where it can be demonstrated that doing so 
would not give rise to adverse effects on the ecological integrity of the Thames Basin Heaths Special 
Protection Area (SPA), whether alone or in combination with other development. Where one or more 
adverse effects on the integrity of the SPA will arise, measures to avoid and mitigate these effects must be 
delivered and secured in perpetuity. These measures  are unlikely to be acceptable unless  must be agreed 
with Natural England  in accordance with South East Plan policy NRM6 . 
MM12  Policy para 
(2)(c) (2)(c)  Residential development of over 50 net new dwellings that falls between five and seven kilometres from 
the SPA may be required to provide avoidance and mitigation measures. This will be assessed on a case -
by-case basis and agreed in consultation  with Natural England.  
MM12  Policy para 
(3)(d) (3)(d)  Developments may secure or provide bespoke SANG.  Proposals for new SANGs will not  are unlikely to  
be acceptable unless agreed by Natural England. Large developments may be required to provide 
bespoke SANG.  
MM12  Policy para 
(4) (4) Where further evidence demonstrates that the integrity of the SPA can be protected using different 
distance thresholds or with alternative measures (including standards of SANG provision different to those 
set out in this policy) , the Council will agree  these must be agreed in consultation  with Natural England.  
MM12  Reasoned 
justification 
para 4.3.50c  4.3.50c  “Adverse effects on integrity” refers to the definition under the Habitats Regulations.  In line with the 
Habitats Regulations, development proposals should be screened to establish whether they are likely to 
have significant effects on the SPA.  All net n ew residential development up to five km from the SPA, and 
developments of over 50 net new residential units five to seven km from the SPA are considered likely to 
have a significant effect .  Where significant effects are likely,  and proposals must undergo Appropriate 
Assessment to identify measures that avoid, as a first step, and mitigate any adverse effects.  However, i If 
these  residential developments provide or contribute to appropriate SANG and SAMM measures  in 
accordance with th e Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area Avoidance Strategy (the strategy) , 
they will not be required to undergo Appropriate Assessment  it is likely that it can be concluded that no 
adverse effects on the integrity of the SPA will occur as a result of  increased recreational pressure . 
 
 
21 
 MM12  Reasoned 
justification 
para 4.3.54  4.3.54  In the zone of influence, beyond the exclusion zone and up to 5km (linear) from the SPA, a net increase in 
the number of residential units is likely to lead to increased re creational use of the SPA. Visitor surveys 
produced by Natural England demonstrate that 70 per cent of visitors to the SPA come from within this 
distance.  In order to avoid this impact, net new residential development must secure or provide Suitable 
Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG) and provide funding for Strategic Access Management and 
Monitoring (SAMM).  Proposals for student accommodation, care homes and other types of permanent 
accommodation not listed in paragraph 4.3.51 may not need to provide a voidance and mitigation 
measures.  This will be assessed on a case by case basis and agreed in consultation with Natural England.  
MM12  Reasoned 
justification 
para 4.3.60  4.3.60  The Council will consult with Natural England on  Pproposals for new SANGs  must be agreed by Natural 
England and . SANG proposals  will be expected to follow Natural England’s SANG guidelines.  Developers 
may propose bespoke SANGs that provide avoidance for their own developments, either within the 
development site or off -site in an app ropriate location.  The size requirements for new SANGs set out in 
the SANG guidelines often mean that SANGs cannot be delivered on smaller sites.  The Council therefore 
provides strategic SANGs which developers of smaller sites can pay a tariff to use.

(2) The sequential approach does not apply to proposed floorspace included in the site allocations in the Local 
Plan.  
(4)(3) The expansion of existing offices in  locations outside the town centre , and Strategic Employment Sites and 
Locally Significant Employment Sites  should be limited to 25% or less of the existing office and R&D 
floorspace.  and any development not limited in scale is to be directed to sequential ly preferable  locations.

 Policy D1: Place shaping  
MM2 3 Policy 
(whole 
policy ) POLICY D1: Place shaping  
(1)  All new developments must achieve high quality design and enhance the environment in which they are 
set. 
(2) Residential developments of 25 or more dwellings should:  
(a)  provide a harmonious, integrated mix of uses, where appropriate, that fosters a sense of community and 
contributes to inclusive communities that provide the facilities and services needed by them  
(b) provid e places for communities to meet and interact, such as play and recreation and other public spaces  
(c) be designed to facilitate and promote walking, providing a high quality environment for pedestrians, and 
where possible allowing short walking distances to amenities  
(d) create places that are easy to get to and through, foster active lifestyles, are easy to  understand and 
navigate, and feel safe during the day and night, and  
(e) be designed to facilitate the delivery of high quality communications infrastructure to support sustainable 
modern living, and  
(f) provide convenient and safe routes through the development and to nearby areas for pedestrians and 
cyclists.  
(3) All new developments will be required to achieve high quality design that responds  to distinctive local 
character (including landscape character) of the area in which it is set. Essential elements of place making 
include creating economically and socially successful new places with a clear identity that promote healthy 
living; they shou ld be easy to navigate, provide natural security through layout and design with attractive, 
well enclosed, and overlooked streets, roads and spaces with clear thought given to the interrelationship of 
land use to external space.   
(4) All new development i s expected to have regard to and perform positively against the recommendations 
set out in the latest Building for Life guidance and conform to the nationally described space standards as 
set out by the Ministry of Housing, Com munities and Local Government  (MHCLG).  
(5) New development shall be of a high quality and inclusive design, as per the Design Guide Supplementary 
Planning Document (SPD), and all new development will be required to address the following;  
Distinct local character  
(6) All new developmen t will be designed to reflect the distinct local character of the area and will respond and 
reinforce locally distinct patterns of development, including landscape setting. Proposals will take account 
29 
 of local design guidance contained within conservation area appraisals, DPD’s, neighbourhood plans and 
SPDs.  
(7) Given the size, function and proposed density of the strategic allocations it may not always be desirable to 
reflect locally distinct patterns of development. These sites must create their own ident ity to ensure 
cohesive and vibrant neighbourhoods.   
Safe, connected and efficient streets  
(8) All new development will be designed to ensure it connects appropriately to existing street patterns and 
creates safe and accessible spaces. Particular regard sh all be given to maximise opportunities for 
pedestrian and cycle movement and the creation of a high quality public realm.  
Network of green spaces and public places  
(9) All new development will be designed to maximise the opportunity for and linkages betwee n green spaces 
and public places, and include high quality landscaping that reflects the local distinctive character.  
Crime prevention and security measures  
(10) All new development will be designed  to reduce opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour.  
Access and inclusion  
(11) All new development will be designed to meet the needs of all users, this includes the setting of the 
building in the wider environment, the location of the building on the plot, the gradient of the plot, transport 
infrastructure and public realm.  
Efficient use of natural resources  
(12) All new development will be designed with regard to efficient use of natural resources including passive 
solar gain to maximise the use o f the sun’s energy for heating and cooling.  
Infrastructure to create smart places  
(13) All new development will be designed in a manner that:

to 4.5.18  4.5.8e  Our Corporate Plan (2018 -2023) identifies regenerating and improving Guildford town centre and other 
urban areas as one of three strategic priorities supporting its “Place Making” theme. Development within 
Guildford Town Centre will need to have regard to a very particular set of circumstances and this policy 
should be read in conjunction with Policy S3: Delivery of development and urban regeneration within 
Guildford Town Centre.  
4.5.8f  Innovation is a fundamental theme of the Council’s Corporate Plan and t he creation of smart places 
infrastructure across Guildford is a priority. In this regard, the Plan identifies the need for potential future 
technological and digital advances to be taken into account in planning, regeneration and development 
decisions.  
4.5.8g  The greater part of urban Guildford has good broadband and mobile phone signal connectivity. However, 
digital connectivity has been identified as a challenge by business, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, 
because of the reliance on copper wir e connections from street cabinets for many subscribers, download 
and upload speeds vary greatly.  
4.5.8h  The Council considers it essential that new development is planned and designed to enable appropriate 
digital infrastructure and to be at the forefron t of advances in broadband technology. Doing so will help 
ensure that Guildford borough remains a highly attractive location for businesses and residents alike and 
development supports delivery of the Government’s Industrial Strategy.  
4.5.8i   A flexible, but ambitious approach is regarded as appropriate in achieving development that supports 
innovation and is responsive to the rapid rate of change in relation to digital technology. The provision of 
FTTP is viewed a desired default technology, however it is  recognised that this may not be practical in all 
cases. Similarly, the Council’s aspiration is that connectivity speeds of at least 1Gbps offered by full 
(synchronous) FTTP could be achieved. FTTP and high quality connectivity will thus be encouraged in 
relation to new development, and particularly at development of major residential and employment sites.  
4.5.8j The Council will be working closely with external strategic partners like Superfast Surrey, and Network Rail 
to optimise fibre network interventi ons, including enabling the use of “dark” (unlit)  fibre and to promote 
32 
 further innovations relating to improving digital connectivity.

MM2 4 Policy 
(whole 
policy)  Sustainable development  
(1) Proposals for zero carbon development are strongly supported. Applications Proposals  for development, 
including refurbishment, conversion and extensions to existing buildings , are required to set out in a 
sustainability statement how they will  should include information setting out how  deliver: sustainable design 
and construction practice will be incorporated including (where applicable):  
(a) the efficient use of mineral resources and the incorporation of a proportion of r ecycled and/or secondary 
aggregates  
(b)  waste minimisation and reusing material derived from excavation and demolition  
(c)  the use of  materials both in terms of embodied carbon and energy efficiency landform, layout, building 
orientation, massing and la ndscaping  to reduce energy consumption the lowest level of carbon emissions 
(direct and embodied),  
(d)  the highest levels of energy and water efficiency andthat meets the highest national standard and  
(e)  measures that enable sustainable lifestyles for the occupants of the buildings  
(2) When meeting these requirements, the energy and waste hierarchies should be followed except where it 
can be demonstrated that greater sustainability can be achieved by utilising measures further down the 
hierarchy.   The S ustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) sets out 
guidance on appropriate standards and practice.  
(2a) Major development should include a sustainability statement setting out how the matters in this policy have 
been address ed. Smaller developments should include information proportionate to the size of the 
development in the planning application.  
33 
 Climate Change Adaptation  
(3)  All Ddevelopments should be fit for purpose and remain so into the future . Development proposals  
Proposals for major development are required to set out in a sustainability statement how they have 
incorporated adaptations for a changing climate and changing weather patterns in order to avoid increased 
vulnerability and offer high levels of resilience to the full range of expected impacts.   
Renewable, low carbon and decentralised energy  
(4) The development of low and zero carbon and decentralised energy, including (C)CHP* distribution 
networks, is strongly supported and encouraged.  
(5) Where (C)CHP dis tribution networks already exist, new developments are required to connect to them or 
be connection -ready unless it can be clearly demonstrated that utilizing a different energy supply would be 
more sustainable or connection is not feasible.  All new developments are required to connect to (C)CHP 
distribution networks where they exist, or incorporate the necessary infrastructure for connection to future 
networks, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that doing so is not feasible or that utilising a di fferent 
energy supply would be more sustainable.   
(6) Proposals for development within Heat Priority Areas as shown on the Policies Map and all sufficiently 
large or intensive developments must demonstrate that heating and cooling technologies have been 
selected in accordance with the following heating and cooling hierarchy unless it can be clearly 
demonstrated that an alternative approach would be more sustainable: demonstrate that (C)CHP has been 
given adequate consideration as the primary source of energ y. 
1   Connection to existing (C)CHP distribution networks  
2   Site wide renewable distribution networks including renewable (C)CHP  
3   Site wide gas -fired (C)CHP distribution networks  
4   Renewable communal heating networks  
5   Gas -fired communal heating networks  
6   Individual dwelling renewable heating  
7   Individual dwelling heating, with the exception of electric heating  
(7) All (C)CHP systems are required to be scaled and operated in order to maximise the potential for carbon 
reduction.  Developments that do not connect to or implement (C)CHP or communal heating networks 
should be ‘connection -ready’.  
(8) Energy statements must be provided to demonstrate and quantify how development will comply with the 
energy requirements of this policy. Guildford Boro ugh Council will work proactively with applicants on 
34 
 major developments to ensure these requirements can be met.  
Carbon reduction  
(9) New buildings must achieve a reasonable reduction in carbon emissions of at least 20 per cent  below the 
relevant Target Em ission Rate (TER) set out in the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended) (Part L) .  This 
should be achieved through the provision of appropriate renewable and low carbon energy technologies in 
the locality of the development  and improvements to the energy p erformance of the building . Where it can 
clearly be shown that this is not possible, offsite offsetting measures in line with the energy hierarchy 
should be delivered.  Proposals should set out how this will be achieved in an energy statement.    
(10) Retail units falling within Use Classes A1, A2, A3 and A4 in Guildford Town Centre are not subject to the 
carbon reduction requirement at paragraph (9).  
(11) Planning applications must include adequate information to demonstrate and quantify how proposals 
comply with the energy requirements at paragraphs 5 -10 of this policy. For major development, this should 
take the form of an energy statement.

 development and improvements  to the energy  performance  of the building .  This should be achieved after 
energy efficiency has been add ressed, in line with the Energy Hierarchy.  Technologies will be considered 
appropriate only where they would be effective.  The reduction in emissions is judged against a baseline of 
the relevant Target Emission Rate (TER) set out in the Building Regulatio ns.  For types of development 
where no TER is set out, reductions should be made against the typical predicted energy use of building 
services.  This The 20% figure  represents a minimum standard and where possible this should be

adopted highest national standard is the “optional requirement” set out in the building regulations in 
regulation 36 paragraph 2(b) of the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended) of 110 litres per occupant per

A3 Guildford (A320 Stoke interchange junction to A31 Hog’s Back junction) “Road Investment Strategy” 
scheme from that assumed in plan -making, or cancellation of the scheme, Guildford Borough Council will 
review  its transport evidence base to investigate the consequent cumulative impacts of approved 
developments and Local Plan growth including site allocations on the safe operation and the performance 
of the Local Road Networks and the Strategic Road Network. In the case of material delay in the 
anticipated completion and or a reduction in scope in the A3 Guildford scheme, the review will consider the 
period up to the revised date of completion of the scheme. This review will be undertaken with input as 
appropriat e from Surrey County Council and Highways England or any other licenced strategic highway 
authority appointed by the Secretary of State under the Infrastructure Act 2015. The outcome of this review

para 
4.6.18a  4.6.18a  The evidence at the time of the Examination of the Local Plan was that, without the  implementation of the 
A3 Guildford scheme, the cumulative impacts of the quantum and distribution of development in the Local 
Plan could be considered to become severe during the second half of the plan period. Nevertheless, the 
evidence also indicates th at individually, site allocations may be able to be occupied in whole or 
substantial part without creating a severe impact on the Strategic Road Network as there are potential 
alternative transport measures that may reduce or limit the impact of additional  traffic on the A3. A review 
will determine whether the proposed transport measures or additional transport measures can mitigate the 
40 
 cumulative impacts of development traffic on the A3 either during the period that the A3 Guildford scheme 
is delayed, in r esponse to a reduction in its scope or in the event of its cancellation. If a review determines 
that transport measures are not able to mitigate a severe impact on the A3 then a review of the Local Plan

4.6.48b  Main rivers  are watercourses designated as such by the Environment Agency; usually larger streams and 
rivers, but also including some smaller watercourses of significance. Main rivers should be protected and 
enhanced by a minimum  eight metre wide undeveloped buffer zone (measured from bank top) on both 
sides. Bank top is defined as the point at which the bank meets the level of the surrounding land. Eight 
metres is the minimum required for main rivers under the Thames Region land drainage byelaws. 
However, on greenfield sites where more land is available, it may be appropriate to include a larger buffer 
zone that varies in size and shape depending on the local circumstances. The provision of a buffer zone 
should also be supported b y a long term ecological management plan.
