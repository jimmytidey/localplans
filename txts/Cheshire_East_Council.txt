Cheshire East Local Plan
 
Local Plan Strategy 
2010 - 2030
Adopted 27 July 2017
Foreword
The Local  Plan is  the council's most important tool for shaping  development in  Cheshire  East over
the period  to 2030. This Local  Plan Strategy is  the first part of this new  Local  Plan and  supports the
council's priority of jobs-led  growth. The plan  has been  developed  to support the generation of jobs
focused around  Crewe  High  Growth City, the M6  Corridor  and the North Cheshire  Science Corridor.
In addition, there is  provision  for extended employment sites in  our main  towns.
This plan  is about developing  Cheshire  East to maintain its reputation as  the best place  to live  in the
north west, whilst providing  for our  younger  generation so  they can  live and work  in the area  they
grew  up in. It is  about the future, job  availability, excellent educational standards and  a great quality
of life. This plan, coupled  with the five year  housing  land  supply, is  also about protecting the residents
of Cheshire  East against unwanted, unsustainable and  unplanned  development.
The Inspector acknowledged  that this is  one  of the most complex  and  consulted-upon planning
documents he had seen  in his more than 20  years' experience. There has been a tremendous response
from our  residents and  other stakeholders during  the extensive 13  rounds  of public  consultation on
the proposals  in the plan  and I'm sure  it has  allowed  everyone  to feel they had  the opportunity to
have  their say. The council  received  a total of more  than 60,000 comments during  the various
consultations to arrive  at the finalised Local  Plan Strategy. This represents an  unprecedented level
of interest in  a council  consultation process.
Over the course  of plan  preparation, we  have  evaluated hundreds  of strategic sites to ensure
sustainability. This has  included  their accessibility to public  services, open  spaces  and transport, as
well as their potential impact on  heritage and  health. Contained in  this document is  the final list of 50
strategic sites, three strategic locations and  eight safeguarded sites. In arriving  at these sites, we
have  considered  comments from a  large  number  of stakeholders including  the residents of Cheshire
East, town and  parish  councils, the development industry and, of course, the planning  inspector.
I would  like to thank everybody  who has contributed to this process  and would  especially  like to thank
the large number of people  who responded to the consultations and who participated in the examination
process; the plan  is certainly a  better one  as a result of these contributions. Some people  will be
pleased  with the result and  others will  be less  satisfied; however  this plan  has taken all  views  into
consideration and  I firmly believe  it meets the requirements of Cheshire  East's residents both now,
and over  the period  to 2030.
Following on from the Local Plan Strategy, our next task is to prepare
the 'Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document' and  the
'Minerals and  Waste Development Plan Document'. These will  form
the second  and third parts of our  new  Local  Plan. They will  allocate
non-strategic sites to meet the remaining development requirements,
provide  further detailed policies  to assist in  determining planning
applications, and  set out our  approach  to minerals  and  waste
planning  in Cheshire  East.
Thank you  once  again  for your  interest and  continued involvement.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 2
 IntroductionOverview
1.1 The Local  Plan is  the Statutory Development Plan for Cheshire  East and  is the basis  for
determining planning  applications. This Local  Plan Strategy document sets out the overall  vision  and
planning  strategy for development in  the borough  and contains planning  policies  to ensure  that new
development addresses  the economic, environmental and  social  needs  of the area. It also  identifies
strategic sites and  strategic locations that will  accommodate most of the new  development needed.
1.2 The borough  is a generally  affluent area, especially  in the north and  is a sought-after place  to
live and do business. There are  however  some  pockets of deprivation, particularly in  Crewe.
1.3 The previous  overall  approach  to accommodating development, as  set out in  the Regional
Spatial Strategy, was  one of development restraint reflective of the extensive coverage  of Green Belt
in the borough  and the intention to foster urban  regeneration in  Greater Manchester and  Merseyside
in particular.
1.4 Like the country as  a whole  the borough  was hit by  the recent recession; house  building  rates
in Cheshire  East fell in  the late noughties to less  than half of those achieved  earlier  in the decade.
1.5 However  Cheshire  East remains  well placed  in terms of its inherent locational, environmental
and labour  force resources, to achieve  significant economic  growth in  the medium  to long  term.
1.6 Due to its various  attractions the borough  is a net importer of people  from neighbouring  areas.
1.7 The Local Plan seeks to meet the full objectively assessed needs for development. This includes
accommodating a  realistic element of economic  growth-derived development need.
1.8 Although there are  some  inevitable overlaps  with urbanised  neighbouring  places, particularly
south Manchester and  the Potteries, Cheshire  East’s  housing  market areas  are largely  contained
within the borough.
1.9 The borough’s  housing  needs  arise  across  the whole  plan  area. Those towns inset within the
Green Belt have  been  constrained from growing  for many  years  which  has inevitably impacted on
local retail and  other services.
1.10 However, good  and justifiable reasons  are needed  to change  the extent of the Green Belt.
The pre-requisite question that needs  to be  asked  is could  places  neighbouring  Cheshire  East
accommodate any  of the development needs  arising  in the borough  and so reduce  the need  to roll
back  Green Belt boundaries?
1.11 The answer  from neighbouring  local  authorities is  that they are  not in  a position to assist, and
they have  not asked  Cheshire  East Council  to accommodate any  of their development requirements
either.
1.12 There are  no other significant restraints that can  legitimately be  cited to justify holding  back
development in  Cheshire  East. The north eastern extremity of the borough  is within the Peak District
National Park but that area  is excluded  from the Local  Plan area  as the borough  council  is not the
local planning  authority there.
1.13 There are  no significant flood risks  in the borough  that are  an impediment to new  development
nor are there any  other naturally occurring  environmental features within Cheshire  East or  nearby
that present such  constraints. The effective operation of the Jodrell  Bank radio  telescope does  not
pose  a significant restriction on  new  development.
1.14 The Local  Plan seeks  to accommodate a  proportion of the local  development pressures  at
the Green Belt-constrained towns by  rolling  back  Green Belt boundaries  around  these settlements.
Enabling development in  this way  also  contributes to the overall  sustainability of these places.
3 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Introduction1.15 However, overall  there is  some  redistribution of the growth arising  in the Green Belt towns to
settlements elsewhere  in the borough  – particularly to those in  the centre and  south.
1.16 A revised  Strategic Green Gap policy  is proposed  in the vicinity of Crewe  and Nantwich to
ensure settlements here do not coalesce whilst still leaving appropriate scope for further development
in the plan  period  and beyond. The exact boundaries  of this revised  Strategic Green Gap will  be
determined through the Local  Plan Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
1.17 Following the previous  constraints to development in  the borough  it is inevitable that there will
be some  delay  in achieving  economic  growth and  gearing  up the delivery  of new  development.
1.18 The plan  proposes  housing  and employment development in  a variety of locations and  sizes
of site that provide  an appropriate range  and choice  of opportunities. Some of these development
locations are  required  to be  serviced  by significant new  infrastructure.
1.19 The delivery  of development sites is  programmed  to reflect their infrastructure requirements
and the likely  availability of associated funding.
1.20 The financial viability of the range  of development sites is  generally  good  across  the borough
and the council  is committed to maximising  developer  contributions to infrastructure delivery  by
introducing the Community Infrastructure Levy.
Background
1.21 Its vibrant and  successful economy, rich  natural environment and  strong sense  of community,
makes  Cheshire  East one  of the best places  to live  and work  in the UK.
1.22 The borough  has a strong industrial heritage: the railway  industry in  Crewe, the silk  industry
in Macclesfield and  Congleton, and  the salt industry of Middlewich  and Nantwich.  Not only  has that
resulted in  the distinctive physical  and cultural landscapes  that are  seen  today, but it has  also set the
foundations for the strong entrepreneurial culture which  continues to permeate through the area.
1.23 In conjunction with historic industrial centres, vibrant and  historic market towns located
throughout the borough, with their attractive and  varied  townscapes and  concentrations of listed
buildings, provide  high  quality living  and working  environments, and  are a key part of the borough’s
visitor economy.  Many  are also  designated as  conservation areas. Their rich  historic environment
provides  the focus for vibrant and  locally  distinct communities, with a  strong sense  of place  and self. 
They also  provide  a valuable  link to rural  communities, which  are equally  vital to the wider  economy
and local  identity.  Their conservation and  enhancement is  extremely important, to ensure  that
communities remain  genuinely sustainable, retain their individual character and maintain their important
economic  function.
1.24 The richness  and diversity of the built and  cultural heritage, and  highly  attractive townscapes
and landscapes  provides  Cheshire  East with its own  very  unique  character and  identity.
1.25 The objective for the future of Cheshire  East is  to deliver:
Sustainable, Jobs-led Growth and Sustainable, Vibrant Communities.
1.26 This Local Plan Strategy is the spatial interpretation of that vision and  sets out how the economy
can continue to thrive by  providing  new  land  for development, whilst minimising  the impact on  the
natural environment.
1.27 The overall  growth proposition is  to deliver  at least 36,000 new  homes  and around  31,000
additional jobs  by 2030. These figures represent a  pro-growth policy  position that is  forecast to see
the borough's population grow  by around  58,100 people. Policies in  this plan  will also make  sure  that
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 4
 Introductionthe right mix  of new  homes  is provided  to meet the needs  of a growing  workforce and  support both
current and  future employers.  This is  set within the demographic  context that Cheshire  East will  have
a 65%  increase  in the population aged  65 and above, and  a 134%  increase  in the population aged
85 and above  over  the plan  period.
1.28 The Local Plan Strategy has been built up over many years of evidence gathering and following
extensive consultation with residents. It aims  to make  the most effective use  of land  and development
across  the borough  to deliver  the overall  vision.  The plan  has been  guided  by the extensive body  of
evidence detailed in Appendix D and the findings of Sustainability Appraisals and  Habitats Regulations
Assessments carried  out at each  key stage of the plan's evolution.
1.29 The policy  principles  underpinning  the vision  are to:
Develop  brownfield sites, where  possible, to minimise  the use  of greenfield, Strategic Green
Gap, open  countryside or  Green Belt sites.
Ensure a  town-centre first policy  to support our  main  urban  centres and  deter out of town
development.
Deliver  new  homes  of the right quality, in  the right location at the right price; providing  access
to low  cost and  affordable housing  to support our  growing  economy.
Support new  development with the right new  infrastructure; our  plan  proposes  at least eight
miles  of new  roads  and substantial upgrades  to our  overall  transport network.
Focus new  housing  development in  strategic locations through the creation of a  new sustainable
urban  village  and urban  extensions, rather than a  dispersed  growth model  that would  undermine
the well  defined character and  strengths of our  market towns and  smaller  villages.
1.30 There are  50 strategic sites, 3  strategic locations and  8 safeguarded sites proposed  in this
plan.
1.31 All potential sites have been fully considered against policy principles and vision, the extensive
evidence base in its entirety, national planning policy and  the findings from the Sustainability Appraisal
and Habitats Regulations Assessments as  well as information received  from the many  consultation
events. This is  a complex  process  but the selection of sites and  strategic locations proposed  in this
plan are considered  to be  the most appropriate when  considered  against the reasonable  alternatives
and will facilitate the delivery  of the overall  vision  and strategic priorities set out in  the plan.
1.32 The council  has carefully considered  and taken account of, where  appropriate, the wide  range
of comments received  at each  stage. Further detail on  the preparation of the Local  Plan is  contained
within Appendix F: 'The Local  Plan for Cheshire  East'  and Appendix G: 'Evolution of the Local  Plan
Strategy' .
1.33 Cheshire  East is  part of the Cheshire  and Warrington Local  Enterprise Partnership (LEP),
which  is made  up of business, local  authority, academia  and voluntary sector representatives. The
vision of the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership is to make Cheshire and  Warrington
the best performing economy outside of the South East and the Local Plan Strategy seeks to contribute
towards achieving  that vision. The Local  Enterprise Partnership can  access  funding from central
government to deliver  its objectives and  overall  vision.
1.34 Extensive dialogue  and engagement from all  neighbours  has taken place  over  the course  of
the evolution and  development of the plan, thereby ensuring  delivery  on the Duty to Co-operate.
Wide-ranging partnerships with the Cheshire  and Warrington Local  Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and
partners in  Staffordshire and  Greater Manchester are  key to continued success  and this plan  both
complements those of our  LEP neighbours  in Greater Manchester and  Staffordshire, and  delivers
fully towards the Cheshire  and Warrington LEP ambitions.
1.35 This plan  sets out a  core  ambition, the overall  strategic approach  to accommodating growth
including  the identification of strategic sites and  locations for development. It also  sets out policy
principles  to be  worked  up in more  detail at the next stage of the plan-making  process. More  detailed
policies  will flow as  part of the next stage of the Local  Plan through the development of the Site
5 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
IntroductionAllocations and  Development Policies Document and  the Minerals  and Waste Development Plan
Document.
1.36 This plan  is strongly underpinned  by a need  to improve  transport connections across  the
borough. New  projects are  planned  in all towns as  part of the plan, to address  congestion issues.
These include  the Congleton Link  Road, South Macclesfield Link  Road, and  improvements on  the
A51, A530 and  A500 Barthomley Link.
1.37 The focus remains  on protecting Green Belt, open  spaces  and the best agricultural land  to
make  sure  that growth is  sustainable. However, some  alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundary
have  been  required  to provide  the development land  needed  to deliver  the vision.
1.38 The identification of safeguarded land  between the urban  area  and the inner  boundary  of the
Green Belt means  that the permanence  of the new  Green Belt boundary  will be secured. The
safeguarded land  is not proposed  for development in  this plan  but may be required  post 2030  if a
future review  of the plan  identifies further needs  for development.
1.39 In total, the plan  makes  detailed boundary  amendments to the Green Belt that exclude  an
area of around  1.5% of the total previous  area  of Green Belt in  the borough.
1.40 A new  settlement is  also  proposed  to mitigate some  of the impact on  existing Green Belt.
1.41 Protecting the quality of the environment is  essential to the plan.  The plan  needs  to make
sure there are  the right levels  of Green Belt to protect from urban  sprawl, and  provide  sufficient levels
of fertile agricultural land  to support the rural  economy.  The plan  also  needs  to nurture the local
ecology  and protect the natural countryside and  landscape  enjoyed  by residents and  visitors alike.
1.42 The borough's heritage and  cultural assets are  key to the future as  well as a trail to the past.
They provide  a vital contribution to the overall  visitor economy, which  has a turnover of £700m  per
year. They are  also  treasured by  residents, and  provide  a valuable  overall  contribution to quality of
life in  the borough. Key considerations incorporated in  this plan  include  continued protection of over
76 conservation areas, 47  grade  1, 179  grade  2* and 2,412 grade  2 listed buildings, and  supportive
policies in relation to the cutting edge  science research and worldwide heritage associated with Jodrell
Bank.
1.43 This plan  will provide  for at least 36,000 new  homes  by 2030. This does  not mean  house
building to meet a false target, but a  considered approach  to meeting the needs of future demographic
changes  and to make  sure  that current and  future employers  have  a skilled, local  workforce who  can
support their growth.
1.44 New homes are required to respond, not only to population increases and economic migration,
but also  to reflect the changing  nature of the way  in which  our communities are  living. People are
living  longer  and whilst overall  this is  clearly  desirable, it does  mean  we need  to rise  to the challenge
of ensuring  there is  the right mix  of accommodation, including  Self Build and  Key Worker  Housing,
to meet the needs of a changing population; particularly to make sure that as  many people as possible
remain  independent for as  long  as possible. This is  a core  element of our  vision  for a  vibrant,
sustainable community, but it does  also  mean  we need  to provide  the right amount of future
accommodation of the right type, in  the right location.  At the next stage of the Local  Plan process
through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document, there will  be much  more  detailed
policies  about the quality, type, size  and tenure mix  of our  proposed  housing  strategy.
1.45 Cheshire East currently benefits from excellent quality health and education provision, however
this plan  will also  make  sure  that our  education and  health provision  is enhanced  and developed  to
meet the growing  and changing  needs  of our  communities.

 IntroductionOnly by ensuring through this Local Plan Strategy that all these elements are  balanced
and harmonised will we secure a  healthy and prosperous future for the borough.
 
The Context of the Local Plan Strategy
1.46 Cheshire  East is  a unitary authority with borough  status; created as  part of local  government
reorganisation in  2009  it covers  the eastern part of the historic county of Cheshire. As a  unitary
authority, the council  is responsible  for all  local  government functions including  education, housing,
planning, highways, leisure  and  recreation, environmental health, adult and  social  services  and
through its Health and  Wellbeing  Board, responsibilities for health in  partnership with the NHS and
other agencies  (police, fire and  the voluntary sector).
1.47 The borough  of Cheshire  East is  bounded  by Cheshire  West and  Chester to the west;
Warrington and  the Greater Manchester conurbation to the north; Shropshire and  the North
Staffordshire conurbation of Stoke-on-Trent and  Newcastle-under-Lyme  to the south; and  the Peak
District National Park to the east.
1.48 Cheshire  East is  a large  borough, with many  towns, villages  and rural  areas  with over  100
town and  parish  councils. The towns and  villages  vary  greatly in  character and  each  face differing
issues  and needs  for the future. The borough  also has an extensive rural  area  with a  successful rural
and agricultural based  economy. Cheshire  East as  an entity currently has  an emerging  sense  of place
and identity that this Local  Plan Strategy aims  to address.
1.49 The Local  Plan, when  it is fully adopted, will  be the complete Development Plan for Cheshire
East (replacing  earlier  plans  prepared  by the former districts and  the county council)  and its policies
will form the basis  for planning  decisions  in the borough. The Local  Plan will  cover  a range  of matters
including:
How much  employment land  is needed  and where  it should  be provided;
Protecting and  improving  important open  areas  and providing  new  ones;
How many  new  homes  will be required  and where  they should  be located;
Providing new  transport infrastructure including  roads, cycle  routes and  footpaths; and
How town centres and  community facilities in  the borough  could  be improved.
1.50 The Local Plan Strategy is the first part of the Cheshire East Local Plan. It sets out the strategic
priorities for the future development of the area together with a suite of planning policies and proposals
designed  to deliver  sustainable development.
1.51 The Local  Plan Strategy sets out how  the council  will deliver  sustainable, jobs  led growth by
making the most effective use of land and development across the borough. The economy in Cheshire
East is  already  one of the most successful in  the North of England. The Local  Plan Strategy will  make
sure the right foundations are  in place  to sustain this success  over  the plan  period.
1.52 The Local  Plan Strategy covers  all of the borough  of Cheshire  East with the exception of the
area in the Peak District National Park. Figure 1.2 shows  the borough  in context.

Diagrams and Maps
1.53 The presentation of this document is  illustrated with a  series  of diagrams  and maps. These
have  been  produced  to aid  readers’  understanding of the plan  area  and the spatial application of the
plan’s  policies  and proposals.
1.54 As this is  the strategic part of the Local  Plan, a  number  of the proposals  are being  put forward
for broad  locations with the precise, on the ground, boundaries to be defined later in the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Document.
1.55 Figure 1.1 'Cheshire East Local  Plan Strategy Key Diagram' shows  the approximate location
of all  the spatially specific policies  and site proposals  in the plan.
1.56 In Chapter 15  there are  Ordnance Survey based  maps  of each  town showing  the development
related proposals, as  well as commitments (strategic developments that already  have  permission)
and larger  scale  maps  of each  site and  strategic location. These maps  are presented for illustrative
purposes.
1.57 The definitive spatial application of the proposals that are land allocations and the consequential
policy  boundary  changes  are to be  shown  on the new  Policies Map. This will  be an update of the
combined Proposals Maps produced as part of the previous  Local Plans adopted by the former district
and county councils.

Spatial Portrait2 Spatial Portrait
2.1 The Spatial Portrait sets out what Cheshire  East and  the surrounding  area  is like in 2014. It
looks at  'Cheshire East's Key Characteristics'  before painting a  picture of each of its  'Principal Towns' ,
'Key Service Centres'  and   'Local Service Centres'  followed by  a brief overview  of the  'Other
Settlements and  Rural  Areas' . Finally, the Spatial Portrait looks  at the characteristics of and  linkages
with the  'Surrounding Areas' .
Cheshire East's Key  Characteristics
2.2 The key   'Economic' ,  'Social' ,  'Environmental'  and  'Connectivity'  characteristics of the borough
are set out in  the sections below.
Economic
2.3 The economy  of Cheshire  East is  diverse  and generally  vibrant.  The Borough provides  7% of
the economic  output in  the North West(1) and 7.6% of the region’s  businesses  - the highest share  of
any North West Unitary or  District authority(2).  Its residents make  up a significant proportion of the
'knowledge economy' workforce that drives  the region: around  68,000 of its residents work  in
managerial  or professional occupations -  which  is higher  than in  any other North West unitary or
district authority apart from Manchester(3).  Cheshire  East performs better than the regional  and UK
averages  in skill levels(4), business  start ups(5) and knowledge-based  employment(6).
2.4 The number  of people  employed  in the chemical  and pharmaceutical industry and  in Research
and Development (R&D) is significantly above  the Great Britain average with particular concentrations
in the former Macclesfield district, for example  AstraZeneca(7). There is  a relative abundance  of jobs
(significant net inflows of commuters, in  other words)  in Crewe, Handforth and  Knutsford, whereas
Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich, Poynton and  Sandbach face a  relative shortage of jobs  (a significant
net commuting outflow). Macclesfield and Nantwich have more modest net outflows, whilst Wilmslow’s
inflows and  outflows are  broadly  equal(8). The rural  nature of the borough  is reflected in  the relatively
high number  of people  employed  in agriculture which  is above  the England average(9).
Labour Force
2.5 The 2013  Strategic Housing  Market Assessment data shows  that over  two-thirds (69%)  of
Cheshire  East's economically  active residents' place  of work  is in the borough.
2.6 An estimated 173,500 people  were  working  in Cheshire  East in  2012, as  either employees  or
working proprietors. Of those working as employees (167,000), 69% were full-time and 31%  part-time.
13% of employees  worked  in the health and  social  work  sector, with professional, scientific and

of the employee  total(10).
Income Levels
2.7 The latest available  average  (mean)  household  income  figure (2010)  for Cheshire  East is
£39,900 per  year, however  there are  significant differences in  income  levels  across  the borough(11).
Seven towns and  major  settlements have  a mean  income  below  the Cheshire  East average; of these,
five (Alsager, Congleton, Crewe, Nantwich and  Sandbach) are  in the south of the borough; only
Handforth and  Macclesfield are  in the north. Conversely, high  mean  incomes  are more  prevalent in
the north of the borough; Knutsford, Poynton and  Wilmslow are  all above  the Cheshire  East average
(as is Middlewich  further south). Mean  incomes  are also  above  the borough  average  in Cheshire
East’s  rural  areas. This is  shown  in Figure 2.1 below.
Figure 2.1 Mean Average Yearly Household Income in Cheshire East (£)
Skills
2.8 The borough  has major  educational assets, in  terms of skills  development and  knowledge
transfer, in  the form of Manchester Metropolitan University at Crewe  and three Further Education
colleges: South Cheshire, Reaseheath and Macclesfield. Jodrell Bank is of great scientific significance
as a leading  facility for radio-astrophysics and  scientific research  in the UK.
Manchester Airport
2.9 The closeness  of Manchester Airport provides  considerable  economic  benefits to the borough
by providing  access  to national and  international markets as  well as supporting a  substantial number
of jobs, both directly and  indirectly.  In 2011, the Airport was  estimated to contribute £627  million  of
Gross Value  Added for the North West Region, supporting over  17,000 onsite jobs  and 40,000 in  the
wider  sub-region(12).

2.10 Mineral  extraction plays  an important role  in both the local  and wider  economy. The mineral
resources  worked  in Cheshire  East are  silica  or industrial sand, construction sand, sandstone, salt
(in brine)  and peat. Permitted mineral  sites are  situated across  the borough  as illustrated in  Figure
2.2 below.

Waste  Management
2.11 Evidence shows  that about 870,000 tonnes of waste were  generated in  Cheshire  East in  2009.
This is  predicted to fall to about 797,000 tonnes by  2030  (13). The principal  types of waste arising  in
Cheshire  East are  municipal  (including  household), commercial  and industrial (C&I), construction,
demolition and  excavation (CD&E) and  hazardous. The way  in which  waste is  managed  has been
changing  significantly with decreasing  amounts being  disposed  of to landfill and  increasing  amounts
being  recycled.

Retailing
2.12  Cheshire  East has  a diverse  retail offer, ranging  from a  mix of central and  out-of-town multiple
retailers in  our larger  towns, to stronger niche  independent retailing in  some  of our  smaller  towns. 
In common  with most of the country, some  of our  town centres have  struggled in  the face of changing
consumer  trends, particularly the growth in  retailing via  the internet and  competitor destinations
offering a  larger  mix of retail and  leisure.  However, there is  evidence  that new  investment can
recapture a larger share of local consumer expenditure and footfall, which is an  approach being driven
forward through regeneration programmes  led by the council  with the support of our  business
communities.
Visitor Economy
2.13 The visitor economy  is an important contributor to the Cheshire  East economy  with about
10,000 jobs  associated with the tourism industry and  a turnover of £700  million(14).  Major  attractions
include  Tatton Park, Jodrell  Bank, Lyme  Park, Quarry Bank Mill, the canal  network and  the Peak
District National Park.  There are  14 National Trust properties in  Cheshire  East and  one partially
located in  the borough. Little Moreton Hall, Nether Alderley Mill, Tatton Park, Lyme  Park and  Quarry
Bank Mill  are all examples  of National Trust properties. Additionally, the extensive footpath, cycleway
and bridleway  network is  a key attraction of the borough.

 Spatial Portrait2.14 The Strategic Housing  Market Assessment (SHMA) 2010  and 2013  Update considered  that,
on the basis  of migration and  travel to work  data, Cheshire  East is  an appropriate geography  for
planning  purposes  over  which  to assess  and meet housing  requirements and  comprises  of three
functional housing  market areas: one  focused on  the former Macclesfield district exhibiting strong
interactions with the South Manchester market; a  second  focused on  the former Crewe  and Nantwich
district being  largely  self-contained; and  a third centred around  Congleton. The subsequent Housing
Development Study (2015)  concludes  that Cheshire  East comprises  two functional sub-market areas
suggested by  the data: a  southern part which  is strongly linked  to North Staffordshire and
Stoke-on-Trent, and  a northern part which  is closely  linked  with Greater Manchester. At the Borough
scale  there are  noticeable market interactions with North Staffordshire and  South Manchester (see
Figure 2.5).
Population
Figure 2.6 Population Pyramid for Cheshire East 2012  (Mid
Year  Estimates)2.15 Cheshire  East has  a population of
372,100,  51%  (189,700) are  female and  49%
(182,400) are male(15). This represents 0.66%
of the population of England and  Wales. The
population pyramid  in Figure 2.6 shows  the
age distribution of Cheshire  East residents. It
reveals  a lower  than average  proportion of
both males  and females for residents under
the age  of 40  compared  to England and
Wales. The proportions are  particularly low
(greater than one  percentage point below  the
England and  Wales  average)  for residents
aged  20 to 34.  Conversely, Cheshire  East
has an above  average  proportion of residents
within each  of the five year  age bands  over
the age  of 40.  The relatively low  proportion
of people  of working  age and relatively high
proportion of older  people  has implications for
the housing  needs  of the population and  for the future economic  prosperity of the borough.
2.16 Over the ten year  period  from July  2001  until June  2011, an  estimated 157,000 people  moved
into Cheshire  East and  141,800 people  moved  out of the borough. These estimates include  people
immigrating and  emigrating and  those moving  within the UK.  The result is  a net in-flow of 15,200
people  (an average  of around  1,500 each  year).  Net migration was  higher  in the early  part of this
ten year  period: for example, the average  net migration per  year  between July  2001  and June  2006
was around  1,900, compared  to 1,200 between July  2006  and June  2011(16).
Households
2.17 Information from the 2011  Census  of population shows  that the average  household  size  in
Cheshire  East was  around  2.29 people.  Housing  need  is expected to increase  as a result of national
trends, including  predicted increases  in the population and  changes  to household  sizes  resulting from
an increased  number  of divorces  and separations, and  an ageing  population.  The 2011  Interim
Household  Projections show  an increase  in the number  of households  from 159,600 in  2011  to
170,000 in  2021.  This equates to an  average  increase  of around  1,050 households  per year  between
2011  and 2021.
House Prices
2.18 House  prices  across  Cheshire  East and  its former Districts have  increased  dramatically over
the period  1996  to 2012  from median  house  prices  of £59,833 in  1996  to £174,950 in  the autumn of
15 ONS mid-year  population estimates 2012.
16 ONS mid-year  population estimates 2002  to 2011: Components of population change.
15 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Spatial Portrait2012, with median  prices  peaking  at £185,843 during  2007(17). This represents an  increase  of 192%
in median  house  prices  over  a 16 year  period. 
2.19 Cheshire  East has  a ratio of lower  quartile house  prices  to lower  quartile earnings  of 6.51(18). 
This means  that the price  of a house  at the top end  of the cheapest quarter of all  houses  costs 6.51
times the earnings  of a person  who earns  the most out of the lowest quarter of all  earnings.  In terms
of relative affordability, the borough  is ranked  the sixth least affordable district in  the North West(17).
Deprivation
2.20 The Index of Multiple Deprivation data (IMD 2010)  combines  a number  of economic, social
and environmental indicators to assess  and identify levels  of deprivation in  a particular area.  These
indicators are  then combined  to provide  an overall  score  identifying the level  of deprivation at a  Lower
Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
2.21 Of the 231  LSOAs (pre-2011)  in Cheshire  East, 23  are amongst the 25%  most deprived  in
England. Fourteen of these are  in Crewe, three are  in Macclesfield and  one is in each  of Alsager,
Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and  Wilmslow.  Five of these LSOAs, all  in Crewe, are
amongst the 10%  most deprived  in England. Conversely, 121  of the 231  LSOAs in  Cheshire  East
are amongst the 25%  least deprived  in England, including  71 that are  amongst the 10%  least
deprived(19).
Environmental
Landscape Character
2.22 Cheshire  East’s  landscape  is characterised by  the contrast between the extensive flat lowland
plain  and gently rolling  farmland bordered  to the west of the borough  with the distinctive sandstone
ridge and to the east by the rising Pennine foothills. The landscape is characterised by  glacial deposits,
river valleys  with wooded  cloughs, unimproved  features including  mosses, heaths, meres  and a 
number  of designated parkland  estates.  There is  also  a diverse  and valued  range  of flora and  fauna
in the borough.
Nature Conservation
2.23 Key nature conservation sites are  shown  in Figure 2.7 below.
2.24 The most prominent environmental designations in  Cheshire  East are:
The Peak District National Park;
1 Special Protection Area;
2 Special Areas of Conservation;
3 Ramsar  designations (spread  across  nine  component sites);
33 Sites of Special Scientific Interest;
2 National Nature Reserves;
416 Sites of Biological Importance / Local  Wildlife Sites;

Historic Environment and Heritage
2.25 Cheshire  East contains a  valued, varied  and unique  heritage, which  includes  a number  of
cultural and  environmental assets. These assets include  Macclesfield's industrial heritage, Crewe's
railway  heritage, Tegg's Nose  Country Park, Lindow  Man  at Lindow  Moss, Bickerton and  Peckforton
Hills, Beeston Castle, the canal  network, historic towns and  parts of the Peak District National Park,
amongst others.  Other unique  attractions include  a wealth of Historic Parks and  Gardens. The
borough  also  has a rich archaeological  resource  from the prehistoric period  to the Second World
War, including  sites such  as the Bridestones Neolithic chambered  tomb, the Roman  and medieval
saltworking remains  of Middlewich  and Nantwich, the Saxon Sandbach Crosses  and the defences
of the former airfield at RAF Cranage. The borough’s  historic built environment is  complex  due, for
the most part, to the size  and diversity of the area.  Constituent areas  are heavily  influenced by  their
geological, landscape  and  topographical character, which  invariably  has heavily  influenced their
purpose, character and  identity.
2.26 Formal cultural designations present in  Cheshire  East include:
76 conservation areas  of varying  size and scale;
2,638 listed buildings  covering  different gradings;
108 scheduled  monuments;
17 registered parks  and gardens  of historic interest;
1 registered battlefield;
10 areas  of archaeological  potential and  6,708 sites of archaeological  importance; and
387 locally  listed buildings.

Green Belt
2.27 Cheshire  East has  around  400 square  kilometres of land  designated as  Green Belt, located
in the northern and south eastern parts of the borough. These form part of the Green Belts surrounding
Greater Manchester and  the Potteries conurbations.
Carbon Dioxide Emissions
2.28 Statistics indicate that, in  2011, Cheshire  East’s  residents, commerce  and industry and  other
non-residential energy  uses  resulted in  carbon  dioxide  emissions  of 3.159m tonnes. This equates to
8.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions  per person, which  is more  than the regional  average  of 7.0 tonnes per
person. However, CO2 emissions  per person  have  fallen in  recent years  from 10.6 tonnes in  2005
and 9.2 tonnes in  2010(20). This has  implications for local, regional  and national air  quality.
Connectivity
2.29 The extensive road  network in  the borough  includes  the M6  Motorway, which  runs  north to
south through the centre of the borough  and the M56  running  east to west at the northern end  of
Cheshire  East.  The M56  links  to the M6  in the north of the borough.
2.30 The rail  network is  accessible  from 22  railway  stations across  the borough. Crewe  and
Macclesfield are  on separate branches  of the West Coast Main  Line, giving  access  to Greater
Manchester and  London  Euston. Central government has  announced  plans  for a  High  Speed 2  rail
route from London, through the borough  and up to Manchester and  beyond. The initial preferred route
from the Department for Transport follows the West Coast Main  Line, via  Crewe, before passing  to
the west of Middlewich  and through the High  Legh  area  before splitting, with a  line going  north over

of the economic  impacts of High  Speed Rail  but wants to keep  environmental impacts to a  minimum.
2.31 Historic transport routes crisscross  the borough  in the form of canals, railways  and historic
roadways, further enriching the built heritage of the borough and influencing aspects of the townscape
and development of towns and  villages.  A number  of landmark  structures are  associated with the
canals  and railways, not least the viaducts across  the Dane  Valley  to the east of Holmes  Chapel  and
at Bollington.  Many  canal  structures are  listed, including  bridges, locks  and mileposts. The Trent and
Mersey  and Macclesfield canals  are both designated as  extensive, linear  conservation areas.
2.32 In addition, Manchester Airport lies immediately to the north of the borough, offering worldwide
services.

Principal Towns
2.33 The Principal Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield are  the largest settlements in  the borough.
They provide a wide  range of services and opportunities for employment, retail, education and leisure.
They serve  large  catchment areas  with high  levels  of accessibility and  public  transport provision.
However, the two towns are  very  different in  their history, character and  urban  form.
19 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Spatial PortraitCrewe
2.34 Crewe  is the largest town in  Cheshire  East, with a  population of 73,400(21). It is  a major
employment centre with a  diversified base  in education, manufacturing, services  and distribution. 
Major  employers  include  Bentley Motors, Mornflake, Leighton Hospital and  Manchester Metropolitan
University. Crewe  is the primary  shopping  centre in  the south of the borough, but the town centre is
in need  of major  investment. The town is  also  noted for the award  winning  Crewe  Business Park,
regarded  as the country's first 'green business  park'.
2.35 Crewe  evolved  around  the growth of the railways, with
the opening  of the station in  1837  and the first works  in 1840. 
Soon the industry was  employing  thousands of people  and new
housing was built alongside the expanding railway works. Within
the centre of the town, the Town  and  Indoor Market Halls,
churches  and chapels  and later, the Queens Park and  Lyceum
Theatre were  all developed  as part of the emerging  social
infrastructure of the burgeoning  town. 
2.36 Crewe  is often referred to as  the 'Gateway to the North
West'.  It was  established as  a major  railway  hub in the late
1830s  and it remains  a significant railway  interchange on  the West Coast Main  Line  with over  1.1
million passengers changing trains per year(22). As a consequence of the existing railway infrastructure,
there are  problems  with railway  lines  forming significant barriers  to connectivity within the town.
2.37 Crewe's unemployment rate is higher than the borough average(23). In addition, Crewe residents
have  the lowest average  (mean)  income  within Cheshire  East(11). Several parts of Crewe  are
particularly disadvantaged(19) and in parts of the town, male  life expectancy is  around  10 years  less
than in  some  of the more  affluent areas  of Cheshire  East; for females, the gap  is nearly  15 years(24).
Macclesfield
2.38 Macclesfield is  the second  largest town in  Cheshire  East, with a  population of 52,500(21). It is
situated in  the north eastern part of the borough  on the River  Bollin.  It is  close  to the borders  of
Greater Manchester to the north, and  the Peak District to the east. Macclesfield is  a unique  town,
with a  proud  history as  a centre for commerce  and  business. This is  best evidenced  through
Macclesfield’s  role in the silk  trade and  the town continues to play  a leading  role on the international
stage through the science  and pharmaceutical industries.
2.39 Macclesfield was  established as  a settlement in  the 13th Century and  later developed  around
the silk  and textiles industries. Situated on  the River  Bollin, the early  mills  were  located alongside  the
river, utilising the damp conditions and the power of the river for mill machinery.  Present day industries
include  pharmaceuticals, plastics, architectural and  engineering  services  and advertising and  market
research(10). One of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca, is  located at the
Hurdsfield Industrial Estate in  Macclesfield and  also  at nearby  Alderley Park. In addition, many
residents work  in Greater Manchester.(25)
2.40 Today, Macclesfield stands as  a bustling town centre with a  number  of unique  attractions,
including  the Silk Museum  and the heritage centre, cobbled  streets lined  with independent shops  and
galleries, all  on the doorstep of the rolling  hills of the Peak District.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 20
 Spatial Portrait2.41 Macclesfield has  an important retail centre with just
under  500 shops. The centre of Macclesfield, characterised
in part by  its cobbled  and meandering  streets and  narrow
lanes, is  essentially a  medieval  street pattern, partly overlaid
by later phases  of the town’s  growth. Although the northern
part of Cheshire East is largely very prosperous, Macclesfield
suffers localised  problems, with some  areas  of the town
experiencing  multiple deprivation(19). Its unemployment rate
exceeds  the borough  average(23).
2.42 There are  a high  number  of listed buildings  and
structures concentrated in  the centre of the town and  also
many  that are  quite widely  distributed.  Much  of the town centre is  designated as  a conservation area
and there are  also several  outlying conservation areas.  A number  of buildings  are also locally  listed.
This illustrates the historic importance and  significance of the town and  reflects the strong identity,
character and  picturesque qualities of Macclesfield.
2.43 As a former mill town, Macclesfield’s character and aesthetic are also proving to be its greatest
burden; congestion, narrow  roads  and clear  issues  of connectivity between the rail  station, town
centre and  a number  of strategic employment sites  mean  that opportunities for development are
limited.
2.44 The town is  well served  by bus routes. The railway  station is  on the West Coast Main  Line
with direct regular  services  to Stoke-on-Trent, Birmingham, Manchester and  London  Euston.
Key Service Centres
2.45 Cheshire  East is  characterised by  its many  smaller  towns, each  with its own  distinctive history,
character and  form. These towns lie  at the heart of the borough, and  their vitality and  growth is
essential for the prosperity of the borough  as a whole. Such towns serve  as Key Service Centres for
a wider  locality and  usually  have  a good  range  of facilities including  shops, schools  and cultural and
leisure  facilities.
2.46 The Key Service Centres of Cheshire  East are: Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford,
Middlewich, Nantwich, Poynton, Sandbach and  Wilmslow.
Alsager
2.47 Alsager is  a small  town in  the south east of the borough  with a  population of 11,800(21). It lies
east of Crewe  and is close  to the Potteries conurbation to the south.  It was  a small  farming village
until the 19th Century when, due  to its rail  connections and  rural  character, it became  popular  with
managers  from the nearby  Potteries.  During  the Second World  War, a  large  armaments factory was
built outside the town at Radway  Green and  the town grew  to house  the influx of factory workers.
This site, now  with a  range  of occupiers, remains  the town's largest employment location. 
2.48 Alsager town centre stretches along  the main  street and
has about 100  retail units.  In addition, the town centre includes
the recently remodelled Milton Park, a large area of public open
space. Parts of the town are  characterised by  spacious
tree-lined streets with attractive villas  and  designated as
conservation areas.
2.49 The number  of jobs  available  within the area  is low(8), although the unemployment rate is
lower  than the Cheshire  East average(23). Income levels  are generally  below  the Cheshire  East
average(11). One of the major  employers  in the town, Twyford, has  closed  its manufacturing operation
(although its distribution operation remains  open).
21 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Spatial Portrait2.50 The town is  served  by several  bus routes that provide  access  to Crewe, Hanley, Kidsgrove,
Nantwich and  Sandbach.  The railway  station, which  is a short walk  from the town centre, provides
links to Crewe  and  Stoke-on-Trent, Derby, Lichfield and  on to Northampton, Milton Keynes and
London  Euston.  Junction 16  of the M6  motorway is  a short distance away.
Congleton
2.51 Congleton is  a large  market town with a  population of 26,700(21). It
lies on the River  Dane  in the east of the borough. In its early  days, it was
an important centre of textile production, especially lace and leather gloves. 
Currently, the principal  industries in  Congleton include  the manufacture of
airbags.  There are  a number  of light engineering  factories and  sand
extraction occurs  on the Cheshire  Plain, although many  of the town's
residents work  in Manchester, Macclesfield and  Stoke-on-Trent(25).
2.52 Congleton has a reasonably vibrant town centre with about 260 retail
units.  Planning permission  was  granted in  February 2012  for a  retail
development in  the town centre that will  increase  the town's attractiveness.
The development will take the form of an extension to the Bridestones Centre
through to Mill  Street, providing  a new  home  for the town's market.
2.53 The town is  served  by several  bus routes and  has its own  railway  station with direct services
between Stoke-on-Trent and  Manchester.  The M6  motorway is  a short distance away.
Handforth
2.54 Handforth is  a suburban  area  on the northern edge  of Cheshire  East with a  population of
6,600(21). In the 1950s, two overspill  housing  estates were  built in  the area  to re-house  people  from
inner  city Manchester.
2.55  The town has  a small  shopping  centre containing about 70  retail units. The Handforth Dean
Retail Park to the east of Handforth contains a  number  of large  format retailers.
2.56 Average  (mean)  household  income  levels  are the third
lowest in  Cheshire  East (out of 25  settlement areas)(11). A large
proportion of jobs  in Handforth are  located at the Stanley Green
industrial estate and  the Handforth Dean  Retail Park. There is
a very high level of in-commuting, particularly from Stockport(25). 
There is  a smaller, but still substantial volume  of out-commuting
(with the majority of residents working  outside Handforth)(26).
2.57 There is  no direct road  access  between the settlement of Handforth and  Handforth Dean. 
Access to the Retail Park is  only  available  from the A34 bypass. Once constructed, the A555
Manchester Airport Eastern Link Road will provide quick road access to the airport and M56 motorway,
about 4  km to the north-west. Handforth has  its own  railway  station with two trains per  hour  serving
Crewe  and Manchester. Regular  buses  serve  Macclesfield, Manchester, Stockport and  Wilmslow.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 22
 Spatial PortraitKnutsford
2.58 Knutsford is  said  to be  named  after King Canute, who  by tradition
forded the nearby  River  Lily. The town later prospered  in the 18th and 19th
Centuries and  has many  historic buildings. Today, Knutsford has a distinctive
character and identity and contains a number of employment areas including
the Parkgate Trading  Estate, Longridge  Trading  Estate, Booths Park,
Radbroke  Hall and others. The town has  a population of 13,300(21). It lies
in the north east of the borough  approximately 19km  to the south west of
Manchester and  18km  north west of Macclesfield.  After the Second World
War, overspill  housing  estates were  created in  the town to accommodate
families from Manchester.  The town has  one localised  pocket of deprivation
which  ranks  among  England’s  most deprived  25%(19).
2.59 Within the town centre, there are  over  200 retail units, making  it an
important shopping  centre in  the borough. There is  a linear  high  street
aligned  by historic buildings  of various  periods, but principally  Georgian, many  of which  are listed
and within the conservation area.  The town thrived due  to its close  relationship with nearby  Tatton
Park, one  of the key  heritage assets in  Cheshire  East and  the ancestral home  of the Egerton family.
Knutsford contains many  buildings  of architectural and  historic importance.
2.60 There are  daytime bus  services  linking  Knutsford with Altrincham, Macclesfield, Northwich
and Wilmslow.  The railway  station is  centrally located and  has one  train per  hour  to Chester,
Manchester, Northwich and  Stockport. There are  significant levels  of out-commuting to Manchester,
Trafford and  Cheshire  West & Chester(25).
Middlewich
2.61 Middlewich  is a market town with a  population of 13,700(21). It dates back  to prehistoric times
with salt extraction from the Iron Age and  throughout Roman  times to the present day  with British
Salt employing  around  125 people. The salt industry and  the canals  remain  important culturally and
economically. The closeness  to the M6  motorway has  led to the creation of a  large  distribution and
business  park  at Midpoint 18.
2.62 The town centre has  about 80  retail units and  is centred
on Wheelock Street. In recent years  tourism has  become
increasingly  important, with the annual  Folk and  Boat Festival
being  a notable attraction. The Trent and  Mersey  Canal  runs
through the town and  is an important tourism and  recreational
resource. The canal  is a conservation area, with a  number  of
listed structures and  the Murgatroyd Brine Works  nearby, which
is both listed and  a scheduled  monument.
2.63 Although a  railway  line passes  through the town, it is
currently used  solely  for freight movements.  There is  no railway  station or  passenger  rail service
within the town; during  the development of the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document,
an area of land will be safeguarded to explore the potential delivery of a new train station. Bus services
provide  access  to Crewe, Holmes  Chapel, Congleton, Northwich, Sandbach and  Winsford.  The M6
motorway is  a short distance away, linked  to the town by  the A54.  An Eastern Bypass for Middlewich
has been  partially constructed in  recent years.  The construction of the final section linking  to the
A533 Booth Lane  to the south of the town will  open  up further land  for employment development as
well as improving  environmental conditions in  the town centre.  The timing of this project, which  is
largely  dependent upon  private sector funding, is  currently being  programmed. There is  also  the
longer-term need  for improvements to the A54, predominantly in  Cheshire  West and  Chester’s  area,
to improve  the strategic link  between the M6  and Winsford.
23 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Spatial PortraitNantwich
2.64 Nantwich is  a historic market town with a  population of 18,000(21). It dates back  to Roman
times, when  it was  a centre for the production of salt.  Nantwich has  a thriving town centre with about
250 mainly  independent units.  The town contains more  than 100  listed buildings, and  has the largest
concentration of historic buildings  in the borough.  It is  also  a popular  destination for tourists and
visitors drawn  from its large  rural  hinterland.
2.65 The centre of Nantwich is  in essence  a planned
Elizabethan town, largely  rebuilt as  a consequence  of a fire in
1583; the re-build  being  partly financed by  Elizabeth I.  This has
resulted in  a re-created original  street pattern and  a number  of
fine timber framed buildings  dating from the 16th Century
onwards. There are  also  a number  of elegant Georgian and
Victorian buildings. The centre of Nantwich contains a  number
of listed buildings  and is designated as  a conservation area.
The town was  also prominent in  the Civil  War and besieged  until
the Parliamentary victory in  January  1644. The battlefield is
designated and  lies to the north of the town.
2.66 Nantwich railway  station lies  on the Crewe  to Cardiff line  by way of Shrewsbury.  Bus services
are relatively good  with regular  services  to residential areas  of the town and  to Crewe.
Poynton
2.67 Poynton’s  origins  lie as a small  mining  village. However, the decline  of mining  and  its
accessibility to Greater Manchester led  to significant growth during  the 20th Century. Much  of the
mining  infrastructure has  therefore been  lost as  the town expanded, but remnants of the associated
landscape  still exist. It has  a population of 13,000(21) and lies in the north eastern corner  of the
borough, 11km  north of Macclesfield and  8km  south of Stockport. 
2.68 The shopping  centre has  about 120  retail units.  A programme  of
environmental improvements has  recently been  completed in  the town
centre.
2.69 Two buses  per hour  serve  the town, providing  links  to Bollington,
Stockport and  Macclesfield.  The railway  station is  on the western side
of the town and  has  one  train per  hour  serving  stations between
Manchester and  Stoke-on-Trent. 
Sandbach
2.70 Sandbach is  a market town with a  population of 18,100(21). Its origins  date back  to Saxon
times and it is widely famed for its weekly Thursday market and the ancient Saxon Crosses.  It contains
a number  of areas  and features of historical and  architectural value  as well as encompassing  several
significant areas  of local  environmental importance.  The town grew  around  truck manufacturing
industries, but since  their closure  in 2002  there have  been  significant changes  in its employment base
with considerable  losses  of manufacturing jobs.
2.71 At its heart are  the characterful cobbled  market square  and Anglo Saxon crosses, which  are
both listed and  a scheduled  monument, along  with a  number  of other key  listed buildings.  The wider
town centre is  also  designated as  a conservation area, with a  number  of other prominent buildings.
The town also  has strong associations with Sir George Gilbert Scott.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 24
 Spatial Portrait2.72 The town centre has  about 190  retail units.  Sandbach is  now  the headquarters of Cheshire
East Council, which  is the town's largest employer.  
2.73 There is  a railway  station on  the edge  of the town providing  services  to Crewe, Manchester
and Manchester Airport.  There are  also  frequent bus  services  to Congleton, Crewe, Northwich and
Macclesfield.  The town lies  adjacent to junction 17  of the M6  motorway.
Wilmslow
2.74 Wilmslow, with a  population of 23,900(21) lies in the north of the borough. The town is  noted
for its high  quality housing  and shopping  as well as the historic Quarry Bank Mill  and Styal Estate,
making it a sought-after location. Wilmslow has developed beyond its historic core and has substantial
late Victorian and  Edwardian suburbs.
2.75 The town centre has  about 230  retail units and  is also
served  by the out-of-town Handforth Dean  Retail Park.  The
town has  a strong office sector both within the town centre and
also on a number of large peripheral office parks. A large number
of residents work in Manchester, with other significant commuter
flows to Stockport, Trafford and  Macclesfield town(25). The
nearby  Manchester Airport is  also  a major  employer.
2.76 The town has  easy  road  access  to the M60  and M56
motorways.  Manchester Airport is  5km  to the north.  Access
will be improved when the western section of the Manchester Airport Eastern Link Road is completed. 
Wilmslow has a local bus network serving destinations including Knutsford, Macclesfield, Manchester
Airport, Manchester and  Stockport.  The railway  station is  on the West Coast Main  Line  and is served
by local and long-distance services.  Direct destinations served include London  Euston and Manchester
Piccadilly.
Local Service Centres
2.77 Local  Service Centres are  small  towns or  large  villages  which  provide  a range  of services  and
facilities to meet the needs  of local  people, including  those living  in nearby  settlements. They typically
have  a range  of shops, health and  leisure  facilities, and  employment opportunities.
2.78 Local  Service Centres in  Cheshire  East are  Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury,
Chelford, Disley, Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes  Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and
Wrenbury.
Other Settlements and Rural Areas
2.79 The remaining  other settlements and  rural  areas  contain fewer facilities, if any. As a  result,
people  living  in these communities generally  have  to travel to larger  centres for jobs, schools, health
care and other services.

The Potteries
2.80 North Staffordshire is  known  as ‘The Potteries’ after the porcelain  industry that made  the area
world  famous. The Stoke-on-Trent and  Newcastle-under-Lyme  joint Core  Strategy identifies that the
area faces significant economic and social difficulties and that these issues persist, despite government
intervention, ongoing  investment and  the considerable  efforts of many  stakeholders to effect the
transformation of the area.
2.81 The sub-region’s  topography and  historical development has  meant that the conurbation has
developed  as an unusual  collection of distinct but connected settlements rather than a  conventional
single centre city structure. However the nature of this settlement pattern has, to some extent, amplified
the adverse  impacts of several  decades  of economic  decline, decentralisation of services  and
employment, and  out migration.
2.82 However, the Core  Strategy also  identifies the many  assets of the area  including: the valuable
canal  network, serving  the region's growing  leisure  and tourism industries; the historical landscapes,
townscapes and  buildings  of the sub  region, which  are irreplaceable, not only  for their intrinsic
architectural and  aesthetic value  and their contribution towards creating a  collective sense  of place
and civic pride, but also  for their contribution towards making the sub-region an economically attractive
and competitive focus for inward  investment.
2.83 The North Staffordshire Green Belt surrounds  Stoke and  Newcastle with its northernmost
extent covering  part of Cheshire  East (known  locally  as the South Cheshire  Green Belt) –  south of
Alsager and  Congleton and  south east of Crewe.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 26
 Spatial Portrait2.84 Housing  regeneration continues as  a key policy  initiative in  the Potteries despite the reduction
in government housing  market renewal  monies  as there remains  a high  proportion of residential
properties in  sub-standard condition.
2.85 Despite its economic  difficulties, the Potteries is  still a  focus for employment. Travel-to-work
flows are  particularly pronounced  from the Cheshire  East towns of Alsager, Congleton and  Crewe. 
Although with respect to the latter two towns, there is  an even  greater reverse  flow(25).
Greater Manchester
2.86 Greater Manchester comprises  the areas  of ten Metropolitan Borough Councils. However  the
main  commercial  focus is  Manchester City Centre and  the adjoining  city of Salford. The City Centre
is the pre-eminent office, retail, cultural and  educational location which  has also  seen  substantial
residential development in  recent years  particularly in  the form of apartments. Salford, particularly
the Quays area, has  also  experienced  a great deal  of regeneration particularly attracting media
industries and  other cultural activities. Trafford Park (within Trafford Metropolitan Borough) is  the
largest industrial estate in  Europe.
2.87 The latest draft Greater Manchester Strategy identifies that Manchester’s  population is  the
fastest growing  in the UK which  presents a  massive  opportunity to link  the jobs  created with providing
places  to live  that encourage  people  to stay and  contribute to success. But it also  presents huge
challenges, including  an ageing  population and  concentrations of unemployment coupled  with low
skills. Planned changes to the welfare system mean that demand for services  will only increase unless
there are  radical  reforms that improve  the effectiveness of services, increasing  the self-reliance of
Greater Manchester's residents and  reducing  demand  for those services.
2.88 The south side  of the Greater Manchester conurbation is  generally  quite affluent and  includes
the substantial retail attraction of the Trafford Centre and  nearby  business  opportunities at Trafford
Park and Carrington. Manchester Airport is the third largest UK airport and is already a major employer.
However  this is  set to increase  significantly with the development of Airport City. Although the Airport
is linked  to the M56  motorway, further road  connections on  the Stockport / Cheshire  East boundary
are needed  as part of the South East Manchester Multi Modal  Strategy (SEMMMS) proposals. These
comprise  the A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road, but there are  associated schemes, including
connecting to the Poynton Relief Road  in Cheshire  East.
2.89 Greater Manchester is  surrounded  by Green Belt, which, on  the south side  of the conurbation,
extends into Cheshire  East covering  the northern third of the borough  and known  locally  as the North
Cheshire  Green Belt.
2.90 Manchester City Centre is  a major  travel to work  destination from all  around  the conurbation
and beyond, including  from the northern parts of Cheshire  East. More  locally, on  the south side  of
Greater Manchester, there are  daily  commuting movements into Cheshire  East, especially  to the high
technology and  pharmaceutical industries in  the north of the borough. Added to this mix  are movements
associated with the Airport which  are set to increase  following the implementation of planned
developments.
2.91 Previous regional plans  have placed a high priority on urban regeneration in Greater Manchester
with a  particular focus on  housing  in the City Centre and  nearby  inner  city areas, as  well as the areas
that are  suffering the most from de-population and  derelict land  in the north and  east of the city. This
policy  focus has  been  replicated in  the Core  Strategies of the relevant local  authorities and  inevitably
(due to the inherent lack  of greenfield sites) is  heavily  dependent on  the redevelopment of previously
developed  land. Not surprisingly, the delivery  of this policy  approach  was  hit by  the post-2007
recession, but in  the immediately preceding  years  was remarkably  successful.  The latest draft of the
Greater Manchester Strategy considers  a move  away  from the previous  policy  approach  and seeks
to review  the land  supply  to support growth in  those locations most attractive to the market. This
recognises  that failure to provide  appropriate sites in  areas  where  the market wants to invest, both
in housing  and employment uses, risks  Greater Manchester losing  development and  investment to
other areas.
27 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Spatial PortraitCheshire West  and Chester
2.92 The Borough of Cheshire  West and  Chester was  created in  2009  at the same  time as  Cheshire
East and  is an area  of wide  contrasts. The generally  affluent historic city of Chester is  sub-regionally
important for its retail and  visitor attractions. There are  also  numerous  smaller  towns that grew
significantly through industrial activity and  each  has pockets of deprivation, including  Northwich and
Winsford. Both these towns developed  from the on-going  salt extraction industry and  relate quite
closely  to Cheshire  East, especially  Middlewich, in  terms of access  to local  jobs  and services.
2.93 The emerging  Cheshire  West and  Chester Local  Plan (Part One) aims  to regenerate and
improve Northwich and Winsford and recognises the interdependence of these towns with Middlewich
that is  encompassed  by joint working  through the Weaver  Valley  Partnership Board. The emerging
Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan also identifies an opportunity for housing development adjacent
to Middlewich  on land  within Cheshire  West. However, it is  presently considered  that this site is  not
required  to meet Cheshire  West and  Chester's development needs. If such  land  is to be  developed
in the future, then road  improvements around  the north of Middlewich  (in Cheshire  West) are  likely
to be  required.
2.94 It is recognised  that there are  cross  boundary  movements of waste in  both directions between
Cheshire West and Chester and its neighbouring areas. The emerging Local Plan will identify sufficient
land to meet Cheshire West and Chester’s predicted waste management requirements and safeguard
consented waste management facilities including Kinderton Lodge near Middlewich.  Mineral  resources
of sand, gravel, salt and  brine  are extracted in  Cheshire  West and  Chester and  the emerging  Local
Plan seeks  to provide  a continued supply  of these, contributing to sub-national (regional)  supply
guidelines.
Warrington
2.95 In 1968, Warrington was  designated as  a New  Town, primarily  to take economic  advantage
of its unique  position at the hub  of the region's transportation network, evidently aided  by the arrival
of the region's motorways. Warrington has  evolved  from being  a medium-sized  industrial town to the
home  of major  national and  international companies.
2.96 The emerging  Warrington Core  Strategy highlights that since  the end  of the New  Town  era,
strategic planning  policies  have  sought to arrest outward growth of the town. This is  partly through
recognition that Warrington is  nearing  its natural limits of expansion  and partly acknowledging  that
the New  Town  development had  remarkably  little effect on  the older  urban  areas  of inner  Warrington.
Recent efforts to date have  therefore focused on  regenerating and  'restructuring' the older  core  of
the town. The Warrington Core  Strategy intends to continue with this approach  and to help  to create
a strong identity for the town.
2.97 Warrington attracts commuters from a  wide  area  due to its high  concentration of businesses
and good  transport connectivity. However, the main  flow involving  Cheshire  East is  that of Warrington
residents travelling to work  in Knutsford(25).
Peak District, High Peak and Staffordshire Moorlands
2.98 The Peak District National Park covers  parts of Derbyshire  and Staffordshire as  well as the
north eastern extremity of Cheshire  East Borough. The National Park has  its own  planning  authority
and development plans. The Peak District National Park is  also  a key tourism brand  for Cheshire
East. The designation of the National Park excludes  the main  settlements in  High  Peak Borough.
The furthest north is  Glossop which  looks  mainly  towards Greater Manchester. New  Mills  and Whaley
Bridge are  adjacent to the north east boundary  of Cheshire  East and  do have  linkages  to Cheshire
East, particularly the Macclesfield area.  They are  also  served  by the A6, as  is Chapel-en-le-Frith,
and will benefit from transport improvements identified by  the A6 Corridor  Study. Further south is  the
spa town of Buxton which is a visitor attraction in its own right and one that is located close to Cheshire
East for day  trips.  The emerging  High  Peak Local  Plan seeks  to establish and  consolidate Buxton
as England’s  leading  spa town.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 28
 Spatial Portrait2.99 The proximity of the National Park is  an important consideration for the location of future
development in  both High  Peak and  Cheshire  East as  the landscape  is an important tourist attraction
which  helps  the economy  of both areas.  Increased levels  of development in  the northern parts of
Cheshire  East will  serve  to reduce  pressure  for growth in  the High  Peak area, helping  to limit potential
increases  in the use  of the A6 particularly in  the Disley  area  and impact on  the setting of the National
Park.
2.100 The National Park is  a complex  tapestry of different landscapes  but there are  three distinct
areas: the less  populated upland  moorland  areas  and their fringes (the Dark  Peak and  Moorland
Fringes); the most populated lower-lying  limestone grasslands  and limestone dales  and the Derwent
and Hope  Valleys  (the White Peak and  Derwent Valley); and  the sparsely  populated mixed  moorland
and grassland  landscapes  of the south west (the South West Peak).
2.101 The National Park Authority identifies challenges  that broadly  fall into seven  closely  related
themes:
Landscapes  and conservation
Recreation and  tourism
Climate change  and sustainable building
Homes, shops  and community facilities
Supporting economic  development
Minerals
Accessibility, travel and  traffic
2.102 In essence, the Park Authority is  seeking  to meet the everyday  needs  of local  residents, as
well as catering for visitors, controlling mineral  extraction and  balancing  all this with the task of
protecting the attractive landscape  of the area.
2.103 Staffordshire Moorlands  District is  partially within the National Park but the area  to the south
west that borders  Cheshire  East is  outside the Peak District and  is characterised by  an orientation
mainly  towards Stoke-on-Trent. The former mining  town of Biddulph is  the main  settlement bordering
Cheshire  East. The nearby  Cheshire  East towns provide  a counter attraction for Biddulph residents
in terms of shops  and  services. The emerging  Staffordshire Moorlands  Core  Strategy seeks  to
strengthen and  consolidate Biddulph town centre.
Shropshire
2.104 Shropshire is  a largely  rural  area. The Shropshire Core  Strategy identifies the need  for the
county’s  market towns and  rural  settlements to become  more  sustainable places  that are  resilient to
meet the challenges  of the 21st Century. The Core  Strategy identifies five spatial zones  reflecting the
individual  distinctiveness of different parts of Shropshire; the north east zone  borders  Cheshire  East.
Within this zone, Whitchurch is  the nearest key  settlement to Cheshire  East with which  it is well
connected by  road  and rail (it is  on the Crewe  to Cardiff line). Whitchurch has  a range  of services
including  a community hospital and  numerous  local  employers. There is  a modest level  of two way
commuting between Whitchurch and  Nantwich / Crewe  (and  on to Manchester) and  Shropshire
Council's strategy for Whitchurch provides  significant levels  of new  employment land, including  a
new business  park  to the south of the town, partly as  an attempt to reverse  this situation.

Duty to Co-operate
31 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Duty to Co-operate3 Duty to Co-operate
3.1 In preparing  the Local  Plan Strategy, the council  complied  with the 'Duty to Co-operate', as
introduced by the Localism Act 2011 and the National Planning Policy Framework. Activities undertaken
include:
Consultation with key  stakeholders : the council  has engaged  and co-operated with the
prescribed  organisations and  authorities, as  set out in  the legislation and  regulations, and  in
compliance  with its adopted Statement of Community Involvement;
Collaboration and cooperation in plan making:  the council  continues to work  jointly with
partners to address  key planning  issues  across  the area; and
Consideration of cross boundary impacts: The council  has engaged  proactively with
neighbouring and  other related authorities in considering and addressing strategic and site-specific
cross-boundary  impacts arising  from both Cheshire  East's plans, and  others' plans.
3.2 It should  be noted that this Duty is  an ongoing  process  and does  not stop with the adoption of
the Local  Plan Strategy. The on-going  basis  for future co-operation will  vary  according  to the degree
of cross-boundary  synergy  that exists and  the related extent of collaboration that is  appropriate.
Where close joint working  is needed the council will develop memoranda of understanding to formalise
relationships and  guide  future actions.
3.3 The council  already  has a strong and  established record  of commitment of collaboration and
cooperation with neighbouring  authorities and  other key  stakeholders. For example, the council  is
actively involved  with the Cheshire  and  Warrington Local  Enterprise Partnership on  a range  of
initiatives, has  worked  closely  with Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council  in relation to the former
Woodford Aerodrome development, and  will continue to play  an active role  on groups  relating to
Manchester Airport, HS2 and  South East Manchester Multi Modal  Study (SEMMMS).
3.4 Part of the role  of the Local  Plan Strategy is  to address  the wider  implications of the local  policy
approach  and to manage  cross-boundary  effects together with those plans  and strategies of other
authorities and agencies. A number of potential cross-boundary impacts have been taken into account
in the preparation of the Local  Plan Strategy including:
Housing  growth and  regeneration -  to ensure  that Cheshire  East provides  for its own  housing
needs, whilst limiting any  impacts of this on  the adjoining  authorities' ability to regenerate their
own urban  housing  areas.
Gypsy and  Traveller  and Travelling  Showpeople -  to assess  the need  for and  provision  of
accommodation.
Employment development -  to ensure  that Cheshire  East provides  sufficient employment land
to meet its own  legitimate economic  growth aspirations without undermining  investment in
neighbouring  areas.
Transport -  to mitigate the congestion effects of development generated movements.
Green Belt -  to minimise  the loss  of Green Belt land  in the borough  in ways  consistent with the
sustainable location of new  development and  balanced  with retaining the openness  of the
countryside in  the long  term.
Infrastructure -  to establish the means  to provide  for all  the infrastructure needed  to help  deliver
the development proposed  in the plan.
National Park / Recreation -  to protect the natural attractions of the area  and cater sensitively
for visitor trips.
Minerals  - to ensure  an appropriate supply  of Cheshire  East's key  mineral  resources  is planned
for, including  a contribution towards the North West's sub-national aggregate apportionment.
Waste -  the need  to deal  appropriately with locally-generated waste in  ways  that minimise
dependence  on neighbouring  areas.
3.5 Progressive iterations of this plan have directly addressed specific cross  boundary issues raised
by neighbouring  authorities and  consultees. Full details of the changes  / shared  understandings are
summarised  below:

The Case  for Growth
35 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
The Case for Growth4 The Case  for Growth
4.1 The government has  stated that ‘Britain has  lost ground  in the world’s  economy, and  needs  to
catch up. If we  do not act now, jobs  will be lost, our  country will  become  poorer  and we will find it
difficult to afford the public  services  we all want. If we  do not wake  up to the world  around  us, our
standard of living  will fall, not rise'(27).
4.2 Cheshire  East is  at the heart of the largest single  economic  area  outside of the capital with long
established linkages  to the Manchester and  Liverpool  City Regions, North Staffordshire and  North
Wales. Its connectivity and closeness to Manchester and Liverpool  airports and its integral relationship
to the motorway network and  West Coast Mainline  makes  the borough  uniquely  positioned to deliver
sustainable economic  growth.
4.3 The top priority for Cheshire  East Council  is to increase  the borough's economic  and social
wellbeing  in a way  that is  cohesive  and sustainable. The Local  Plan Strategy is  therefore vital in
driving  and supporting the development of jobs  in the borough  and the infrastructure and  housing
that is  needed  to support that employment. Through the Local  Plan, Cheshire  East has  to make  sure
that there is  sufficient land  allocated for business, retail, leisure  and other commercial  developments
to ensure  that jobs  led growth is  delivered.
The Case  for Growth
Growth in  Cheshire  East is  both necessary  and beneficial for the following reasons:
To accord  with the government's growth agenda  and national planning  policy
To help achieve the ambition of the Local Enterprise Partnership for Cheshire and Warrington
to be  the best performing regional  economy  outside of the South East
To build  upon  the economic  success  of Cheshire  East and  attract more  inward  investment
To provide  more  diverse  employment including  well paid  highly  skilled  jobs
To generate greater expenditure in  local  shops  and services  so spreading  improved
prosperity to many  local  people
To provide  a range  of new  homes  including  much  needed  affordable housing
To retain young  people  and attract suitably qualified employees  to live  and work  locally,
limiting travel congestion
To provide  more  opportunities for skills  and personal  development
To help  deliver  much  needed  local  regeneration schemes
To provide  improved  physical  infrastructure and  other services  that are  accessible  to all
To provide  improvements to the built and  natural environment
To promote a  thriving rural  economy  and tourism industry
4.4 The government has invited Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) to produce Strategic Economic
Plans (SEPs) for their areas  as the basis  of funding negotiations to drive  economic  growth. The
Cheshire  and  Warrington SEP includes  a number  of transformational projects in  Cheshire  East
including  High  Growth City, which  focuses on  linking  Crewe  and Macclesfield by  way  of Congleton
to create a  ‘corridor  of opportunity'. The sustainable growth aspirations set out in  the Local  Plan
Strategy are a key element in meeting the ambition of a LEP and fulfilling Cheshire East's sub-regional
role.
4.5 The economy  of Cheshire  East already  makes  an impressive  contribution to the Gross Value
Added figures in  the sub-region. The Gross Value  Added (GVA) figure for Cheshire  and Warrington
is around £21.9 billion(28) with the sub-region employing an  estimated 444,100 people (as of 2012)(29).

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 36
 The Case for GrowthCheshire  East already  makes  an impressive  contribution to the sub-regional  and regional  economies:
its GVA is around £9.2bn (2012 estimate), which equates to 7.0% of the North West region’s economic
output. As of 2012, an  estimated 173,500 people  were  working  in Cheshire  East, as  either employees
or working  proprietors(29). The overall  ambition of the Local  Plan Strategy is  to further strengthen the
borough's economy.
4.6 Cheshire  East performs better than the regional  and UK averages  in skill levels, business  start
ups and knowledge-based  employment. The borough  has major  educational assets, in  terms of skills
development and  knowledge  transfer, in  the form of Manchester Metropolitan University at Crewe
and three Further Education colleges  - South Cheshire, Reaseheath and  Macclesfield. The council
also has aspirations for a  University Technical  College  in Crewe. The Local  Plan Strategy is  therefore
growth orientated in  order  to retain and  build  upon  Cheshire  East's existing skills  and knowledge
base, providing  and building  on the existing knowledge  economy  and high  value  jobs  in the future.
4.7 The extent to which  a location provides  access  to markets and  a skilled  workforce will  impact
on attracting inward  investment into an  area. Individuals make  decisions  on where  they wish  to live,
taking into account the quality of housing  and the environment. Consequently, the availability of good
housing  and a high  quality environment influence decisions  about business  location, investment and
growth. Increases in  local  expenditure on  goods  and services  can also  lead  to further jobs  being
created in  the borough  and overall  increases  in local  prosperity.
4.8 If we  do not provide  sufficient housing, commercial  or employment opportunities, economic
growth will  be constrained because  new  businesses  will decide  not to locate in  Cheshire  East, whilst
house  prices  will increase, exacerbating the affordability problem. In areas  of high  cost housing,
employers  have  particular difficulty in  recruiting to lower  paid  posts, restricting economic  growth. The
consequences  may  be significant in  personal  and environmental terms with lower  paid  workers  being
forced to live  in areas  of cheaper  housing  outside Cheshire  East but travelling long  distances into the
borough  to work.
4.9 Furthermore, there are  clear demographic challenges in the borough, with a declining proportion
of working  age  population. The Housing  Development Study (2015)  identifies that managing
demographic  change  will become  an increasingly  important issue, with the population in  Cheshire
East of pensionable  age and above  continuing to grow  from 70,300 in  2010  to 115,900 by  2030. In
order to support these demographic changes, growth is  required to attract inward investment, to retain
people  of working  age in the borough  and attract new  people  of working  age to live  in Cheshire  East.
This will  in turn increase  the amount of disposable  income  in the borough  to support local  services,
town centres and  the vitality and  vibrancy  of local  communities.
4.10 An adequate supply  of a range  of housing  plays  a fundamental role  in building  a successful
economy. Despite the recent economic  recession, our  evidence  shows  that need  for housing  over
the next 20  years  is likely  to outstrip supply  unless  we increase  the amount of new  housing  provided
through the Local  Plan Strategy, in  particular housing  that meets local  needs  and is affordable to
people  who  should  live or work  in the borough.
4.11 Housing  development also  makes  an important contribution to the local  economy  in its own
right. It creates employment and  skills  development opportunities for construction workers  and also
generates increased retail expenditure in the local community. The Centre for Economics and Business
Research  has estimated that if new  housebuilding  across  the UK were  to rise  to 300,000 annually
by 2015  (95,000 new  houses  were  built in  2010), it would  add some  201,000 extra permanent jobs
in construction and  contribute £75  billion  to the UK's Gross Domestic Product.
4.12 The NPPF (March 2012) states that the planning system should: 'proactively drive and support
sustainable economic development to deliver the homes, businesses and industrial units, infrastructure
and thriving local  places  that the country needs. Every effort should  be made  objectively to identify
and then meet the housing, business and other development needs of an area, and respond positively
to wider  opportunities for growth. Plans should  take account of market signals, such  as land  prices
and housing  affordability, and  set out a  clear  strategy for allocating sufficient land  which  is suitable
37 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
The Case for Growthfor development in  their area, taking into account the needs  of the residential and  business
communities'.
4.13 The Local  Plan Strategy seeks  to enable  growth through providing  a range  of sustainably
located development sites that are  attractive to economic  investment. The Local  Plan Strategy also
brings  forward at an  early  stage the necessary  infrastructure that services  new  sites and  facilitates
more  efficient use  of existing commercial  premises. It also  sets out how  the council  will use its own
land and financial resources  to deliver  sustainable economic  growth in  the borough. Policies in  the
Local  Plan Strategy will  safeguard existing businesses  and encourage  inward  investment into the
borough  supporting the promotion of the Borough as  a place  to do  business.
4.14 A strong economy  offering sustainable growth is  essential in  maintaining the borough’s
prosperity in  a fast changing  world. However, it is  important that economic  growth achieves  the other
elements of sustainable development as  set out in  the NPPF.
4.15 The Local  Plan Strategy, as  the spatial expression  of the borough  council's Sustainable
Community Strategy, will  deliver  on a number  of key  priorities for action, including  creating the
conditions for business growth, unlocking the potential of towns (in particular Crewe and Macclesfield),
supporting young  people  whilst preparing  for an  increasingly  older  population, and  ensuring  a
sustainable future by  providing  appropriate housing, employment land, infrastructure and  community
facilities to meet future needs. The Local  Plan Strategy will  also  deliver  a number  of the outcomes
set by  the council's Three Year  Plan (2013  to 2016)  including  promoting local  communities as  strong
and supportive, providing  a strong and  resilient economy, promoting a  green  and sustainable place
and a good  place  to live  and work.
4.16 The council’s  objective is  not economic  growth at any  price; rather it is  the sustainable
development of Cheshire East. Sustainable development concerns the effective balance of economic,
social  and  environmental factors; in  many  ways  these factors are  intertwined as  the attractive
environment of the borough  is key to its economic  success.  If the attractive environment were  to be
degraded  there would  be both social  and economic  repercussions.
4.17 Accordingly, the aspiration of the Local  Plan Strategy is  to secure  future economic  prosperity
but to do  so in harmony  with the existing characteristics and  strengths of the borough  wherever
possible. On occasion, however, the implication of growth is  that new  policies  and proposals  are
required  in response. The Local  Plan Strategy contains bold  proposals  for new  communities in
locations across  Cheshire  East as  a better means  of meeting future development needs. Equally,
revisions  to the Green Belt are  necessary  for towns such  as Macclesfield to maintain their role  and
status –  a departure from past policies  of development constraint at any  cost.
4.18 The NPPF requires  that plans  be aspirational but realistic; furthermore they should  address
the spatial implications of changes  on economy, society and  the environment. Whilst the policies  of
the plan  will inevitably be  time limited, the proposals  within it, for new  development and  infrastructure
will endure  for much  longer. In many  ways, the developments planned  now  will only  mature in  the
2030s  or 2040s. Planning ahead  over  a 30 to 40  year  time horizon  is seldom  easy; indeed  some
would  question whether the conventional model  of economic  growth that underpins  much  of the plan
will remain  valid  by the middle  of the 21st Century. Some might even  suggest that the continuing rise
of world  population combined  with advancing  climate change  point to an  altogether more  challenging
future in  which  competition for diminishing  food, water and  fuel resources  predominates.
4.19 Sustainable development is  therefore the best preparation for a  future whose  defining
characteristic is  uncertainty. The Local  Plan Strategy unashamedly  promotes economic  development
– but does  so in a way that builds  upon  existing strengths wherever  possible. New  development will
be necessary, but environmental assets will  be protected wherever  possible.
4.20 Therefore the plan  seeks  to consolidate on  what is  best about the borough  – but this is  not a
plan for standing still –  it is forward thinking, determined to plan  effectively for future needs, and
dedicated to providing  new  and innovative solutions where  appropriate.

Vision5 Vision
5.1 Economic prosperity is  fundamental to a  healthy and  sustainable borough. In order  to pursue
wider  community goals  of providing  good  quality and  affordable housing, building  a better, more
sustainable transport system, providing  improved community facilities, improving educational attainment
and investing in  our vibrant town centres, a  strong economy  is absolutely vital.
5.2 It is also  recognised  that the borough’s  outstanding environment, including  its attractive
countryside, its vibrant market towns and  villages  and its many  heritage assets, is  highly  valued  by
residents and  also  plays  an important part in  attracting inward  investment.
5.3 With these principles  in mind, the Local  Plan Strategy sets out how  a stronger economy  and
sufficient housing of the right type to meet our future needs will be delivered  in a way that is appropriate
environmentally and  socially.
5.4 To accommodate the needed  growth in  jobs  and houses, new  development is  necessary. The
Local  Plan Strategy will  make  sure  that development takes place  in areas  that are  well connected to
existing urban  areas; that incorporates green  infrastructure and  the latest building  technology,
generates a  minimal  carbon  footprint; promotes waste recycling; and  enables  healthy living. 
5.5 The pursuit of sustainability in  Cheshire  East does  not mean  stopping urban  change  or
employment growth; it means  growing  at a  sensible  pace, with as  low as practical environmental
impact and  reduced  waste, in  a community that is  economically  robust, which  can deliver  the services
and infrastructure that residents need, and  that promotes the well-being  of all  of its citizens.
5.6 The Local  Plan Strategy is  one of jobs  led growth, focusing particularly on  the two Principal
Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield, and  the larger  towns that form Key Service Centres. Growth,
however, should  not be  at the expense  of the attractive environment that is, of course, a  key asset
in drawing  investment to the borough. Good quality, well  designed, sustainable development is
therefore at the heart of the Local  Plan Strategy and  vision  for the borough.

 VisionVision for Cheshire East in 2030
In 2030 and beyond, Cheshire East will be an economically prosperous area, with a well educated
and skilled  labour  force benefiting from a  strong and  diverse  employment base  and  high
employment levels. It will  continue to benefit from its strategic location close  to the Greater
Manchester and  Potteries conurbations and  adjoining  the Peak District National Park, with
excellent road  and rail links  to the rest of the country. Based on  its landscape  and heritage assets
and historic market towns, the importance of the area  as a visitor and  tourism destination will
have  increased.
Cheshire  East will  continue to be  a desirable  place  to live, with a  beautiful, bio-diverse  and
productive countryside and  unique  towns and  villages, each  with their own  identity and  character
influenced by  such  factors as  the silk  industry, salt extraction, our  agricultural heritage and
associated historic markets, the growth of the railways  and many  other factors that result in  a
wealth of history and  culture.
Well designed  new  employment and  housing  development will  have  been  developed  to fully
meet identified needs  in locations that reduce  the need  to travel. The infrastructure to support
this growth will  have  been  delivered  in partnership with other organisations, whilst maximising
and enhancing  those built and  natural features most valued  across  the borough. In the main,
new development will  have  been  directed to the Principal Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield to
support regeneration priorities, and  to the Key Service Centres of the borough  which  provide  a
good range of services and facilities. In addition, a new sustainable village will have been created
in the north of the borough, which will provide a new  economic focus, benefiting from its closeness
to Manchester Airport and  Greater Manchester. This development will  help  meet housing  needs
for the borough  and provide  a range  of community infrastructure in  a well designed, sustainable
and green  environment.
Stronger and  safer communities will  have  been  created with a  high  quality of life, good  access
to education, jobs, services, shops  and public  transport and  an appropriate range  of housing  to
meet its needs, including  those of an  ageing  population. People will  lead  healthy and  active
lifestyles benefiting from improved  access  to sporting facilities, high  quality open  spaces, play
areas, allotments and  the open  countryside. A green  infrastructure network will  have  been  created,
increasing  the provision  of accessible  green  spaces, supporting flora, fauna and  improving
general  wellbeing.
Cheshire East will have made a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and  tackling
climate change  through the high  energy  efficiency of new  and existing buildings; generation of
renewable  energy; and  sustainable patterns of development that enable  a high  proportion of
people to travel by public transport, cycle or on foot. Extensively available fast telecommunications
links will have  enabled  business  users  to efficiently work  wherever  they are  located.
The supply  of important natural mineral  resources  such  as silica  sand  and salt will  be achieved
in the most sustainable way  possible. Waste will  be reduced  and managed  sustainably; being
utilised as  a resource  wherever  possible.
Our many  areas  of landscape  value, sites of nature conservation importance, characteristic
waterways and  heritage assets will  have  been  conserved,  and  enhanced  through appropriate
development that recognises  the importance of both designated and  non-designated assets
within their setting and  safeguarding them for future generations.

6.3 Cheshire  East will  be an engine  for growth and  will promote a  dynamic, prosperous  economy.
We have  a wide  variety of successful industries in  the area  including  the advanced  engineering
industry which  includes  Bentley Motors and  the pharmaceutical industry including  AstraZeneca, but
we need to be proactive, by ensuring that we exploit new opportunities, build on our current successes
and create a  climate that is  attractive for business  investment and  growth, not just in  our larger  towns
but also  in our smaller  towns and  rural  communities. We  want to create thriving town and  village
centres that are  sustainable and  that continue to deliver  essential services, infrastructure, retail,
leisure  and employment opportunities.
6.4 To achieve  these ambitions, there is  a need  to create the conditions required  for jobs  led growth
including  the need  to create the right business  environment.
Strategic Priority 1
Promoting economic prosperity by creating conditions for business growth
This will  be delivered  by:
1. Providing a  viable  and flexible supply  of quality employment land  and premises, including
business  parks  and strategic sites, to attract new  and innovative businesses, to enable
existing businesses  to grow, to bring  empty plots into economic  use and to create new  and
retain existing jobs.
2. Promoting the vitality, viability and  accessibility of our  town centres to create thriving
destinations for retail, culture and  leisure  to satisfy a  growing  population and  attract visitors
from further afield.
3. Supporting major  regeneration schemes  in the town centres of Crewe  and Macclesfield in
order  to provide  an enhanced  retail and  leisure  offer and  improved  environmental quality.
4. Improving the economy  in rural  areas  by supporting the development of rural  enterprise,
diversification of the rural  economy, sustainable tourism, mineral  working, broadband
connectivity, and  the continued importance of farming and  agriculture.
5. Capitalising on  the accessibility of the borough, including  improved  transport links  with the
Manchester City Region  and Manchester Airport, improved  transport infrastructure such  as
Crewe Railway Station; and maximising the opportunities that may be offered by High Speed
2 Rail Links  (HS2).
6. Securing excellent educational facilities to meet the needs of the current and future population
of all  ages, to improve  educational attainment and  provide  a wide  skills  base.
7. Supporting flexible working  and investment in  new  communication technologies, to allow
home  working  and to support businesses  reliant on  e-technology.
8. Supporting high  quality design  and securing  improvements to the built and  natural
environment.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 44
 Strategic Priorities6.5 Cheshire  East is  committed to meeting the needs  of its local  communities and  providing  the
infrastructure, services  and facilities required  to create sustainable and  stronger communities, whilst
recognising  that Cheshire  East covers  a large  geographical  area  and contains a  large  number  of
towns and  villages, each  with its own  local  character and  distinctiveness.
Strategic Priority 2
Creating sustainable communities, where all members are  able to contribute and where
all the infrastructure required to support the community is provided
This will  be delivered  by:
1. Providing for the full, objectively assessed  housing  needs  for the borough  to support
economic  growth and  to meet housing  needs:
i. Ensuring that a substantial majority of new housing  is provided in sustainable locations
such  as Crewe, Macclesfield and  the Key Service Centres;
ii. Ensuring that there is  an appropriate mix  of house  types, sizes  and tenures including
affordable housing  to meet the borough's needs;
iii. Enabling vulnerable  and older  people  to live  independently, longer.
2. Ensuring that development provides the opportunity for healthier lifestyles through provision
of high quality green infrastructure and cultural, recreational, leisure and  sports opportunities.
3. Working  with infrastructure providers  to make  sure  that infrastructure to support the
community is  provided; this will  include  local  health and  social  care  facilities, indoor  and
outdoor leisure  and recreation facilities, greenspaces, education, transport, superfast
broadband, mobile  and other ICT connectivity, water, waste and  energy.
4. Improving links  between existing and  new  neighbourhoods  by giving  priority to walking,
cycling  and public  transport and  providing  a genuine  choice  of transport modes  and
supporting community integration.
5. Ensuring that all  new  development is  well designed, has  regard  to local  character and
context, and  is sustainable and  energy  efficient.
6.6 The environment of Cheshire  East is  unusually  rich and varied  and its high  quality natural and
man-made  heritage is  a key asset, attractive to both residents and  visitors. The Local  Plan Strategy
will maintain and  enhance  the assets that make  a fundamental contribution to the quality of life in
Cheshire  East. Development will  also provide  the opportunity to enhance  and contribute to the quality
of the environment.
Strategic Priority 3
Protecting and enhancing environmental quality
This will  be delivered  by:
1. Respecting the character and  distinctiveness of places, buildings  and landscapes  through
the careful design  and siting of development.
2. Maintaining and  enhancing  the character and  separate identities of the borough’s  towns
and villages.
3. Reducing  the borough's impact on  climate change  by:
i. sustainable patterns of development;
ii. prudently managing  natural resources;
iii. promoting renewable  energy;
45 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Strategic Prioritiesiv. encouraging  water efficiency;
v. using  energy  efficiently; and
vi. avoiding  developing  land  that may  be at risk  from the effects of climate change.
4. Addressing the local  causes  of water, air, light, noise  and all other forms of pollution and
the contamination of land, reducing  the impact on  local  communities and  meeting the
requirements of the Water Framework Directive.
5. Conserving  and enhancing  the natural and  historic environment ensuring  appropriate
protection is  given  to designated and  non-designated assets, including  their wider  settings.
6. Providing new  and maintaining existing high  quality and  accessible  green  infrastructure to
create networks of greenspace  for people, flora and  fauna and  allow  species  adaptation
and migration.
7. Establishing clearly defined Green Belt boundaries that take into account the need to promote
sustainable patterns of development and  include  "safeguarded land" which  can meet the
longer  term development needs  of the borough  stretching beyond  the plan  period.
8. Providing a supply of mineral resources including suitable alternatives in the most sustainable
way possible  without unacceptable environmental costs.
9. Managing waste in the most sustainable and environmentally sensitive way possible through
its prevention and  utilisation as  a resource, driving  it up  the waste hierarchy.
6.7 Good transport links  are crucial  for a  successful economy, thriving towns and  rural  areas  and
a good  quality of life for all  our residents. We  want to make  sure  that our  transport system enables
people  to get to the places  they want to, when  they want to; that people  can walk  and cycle  as a real
alternative to the car  and that our  transport system is  integrated across  all modes  of transport.
Strategic Priority 4
Reducing the need to travel, managing car  use and promoting more sustainable modes
of transport and improving the road network
This will  be delivered  by:
1. Building homes  that are  close, or  easily  accessible, to where  people  work, shop, access
services  and enjoy  recreational activities.
2. Ensuring development gives  priority to walking, cycling  and public  transport in  its design.
3. Supporting safe and  secure  access  for mobility and  visually  impaired  people.
4. Encouraging travel by  sustainable means  in order  to reduce  congestion.
5. Developing  improved  transport and  infrastructure networks.
6. Enhancing the role  of key  railway  stations, including  the role  of Crewe  as a national rail
hub.
7. Promoting and  investing in  passenger  transport services  and infrastructure.
8. Providing additional transport infrastructure to improve  connectivity.

Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development7 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable
Development
7.1 The World  Commission  on Environment and  Development defined sustainable development
as ‘development that meets the needs  of the present without compromising  the ability for future
generations to meet their own  needs’  (Bruntland Commission, 1987). The concept of sustainable
development acknowledges  that we  must develop  both economically  and socially, but in  a way that
is in accordance  with a  whole  range  of environmental concerns  including  nature conservation, energy
efficiency, conserving  future resources, purity of air, earth and  water, archaeology, agricultural land,
landscape  and countryside protection.
7.2 The NPPF foreword states that  'the purpose  of planning  is to help  achieve  sustainable
development. Sustainable  means  ensuring  that better lives  for ourselves  don't mean  worse  lives  for
future generations. Development means  growth . . . So sustainable development is  about positive
growth -  making  economic, environmental and  social  progress  for this and  future generations' .
7.3 There are  three dimensions  to sustainable development: economic, social  and environmental.
The NPPF clarifies that these roles  should  not be  undertaken in  isolation, because  they are  mutually
dependent. Therefore, to achieve  sustainable development, economic, social  and  environmental
gains  should  be sought jointly and  simultaneously through the planning  system.
7.4 The Framework goes  on to confirm that there should  be a presumption in  favour of sustainable
development, which  all plans  should  be based  upon  and reflect this presumption with clear  policies
to guide  how  the presumption will  be applied  locally.
7.5 The Cheshire  East Local  Plan Strategy is  a positive, pro-growth strategy that seeks  to deliver
the amount of development required  in the borough  up to 2030  in a sustainable way. It is  consistent
and in general  conformity with the NPPF. For the avoidance  of doubt this is  set out in  the following
overarching, all  embracing  policy  on the achievement of sustainable development.
Policy MP 1
Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development
1. When considering  development proposals  the council  will take a  positive approach  that
reflects the presumption in  favour of sustainable development contained in  the National
Planning Policy Framework. It will  always  work  proactively with applicants to find joint
solutions which  mean  that proposals  can be approved  wherever  possible, and  to secure
development that improves  the economic, social  and environmental conditions in  the area.
2. Planning applications that accord  with the policies  in the Development Plan (and, where
relevant, with policies  in Neighbourhood  Plans) will  be approved  without delay, unless
material considerations indicate otherwise.
3. Where there are  no policies  relevant to the application or  relevant policies  are out of date
at the time of making  the decision, the council  will grant permission, unless  material
considerations indicate otherwise, taking into account whether:
i. Any adverse  impacts of granting permission  would  significantly and  demonstrably
outweigh the benefits, when  assessed  against the policies  in the National Planning
Policy Framework taken as  a whole; or
ii. Specific policies  in that Framework indicate that development should  be restricted.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 48
 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable DevelopmentJustification
7.6 The National Planning Policy Framework contains a  Presumption in  Favour of Sustainable
Development. This presumption is  considered  to be  the golden  thread running  through both plan
making  and decision  taking. The Local  Plan Strategy is  the principal  planning  policy  document for
the Cheshire  East Local  Plan (the Development Plan) and  therefore reflects the National Planning
Policy Framework in  making  clear  that development which  is considered  sustainable will  be approved
without delay.
7.7 Policy MP 1  makes  sure  that the Local  Plan Strategy is  based  upon  the Presumption in  Favour
of Sustainable Development, as  required  by the National Planning Policy Framework. The policies
in the Local  Plan Strategy provide  clear  guidance  on how  the Presumption in  Favour of Sustainable
Development will  be applied  locally.
7.8 The Local  Plan Strategy policies  will be supplemented by  the Saved Local  Plan Policies (in
accordance with their consistency with the National Planning Policy Framework) until they are replaced
by policies  in the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document and  the Minerals  and Waste
Development Plan Document. Should Neighbourhood Plans be produced in the borough (in conformity
with the contents of the Local  Plan Strategy) then their policies  will also  be relevant.
7.9 Further policies  setting out how  sustainable development principles  will be applied  in Cheshire
East are  included  in Chapter 9 'Planning for Sustainable Development' .

Planning for Growth8 Planning for Growth
8.1 One of the core  principles  of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is  that planning
should  'proactively drive  and  support sustainable economic  development to deliver  the homes,
business  and industrial units, infrastructure and  thriving local  places  that the country needs. Every
effort should  be made  objectively to identify and  then meet the housing, business  and  other
development needs  of an  area, and  respond  positively to wider  opportunities for growth. Plans should
take account of market signals, such  as land  prices  and housing  affordability, and  set out a  clear
strategy for allocating sufficient land  which  is suitable for development in  their area, taking account
of the needs  of the residential and  business  communities' .
8.2 The NPPF also  states that Local  Plans should  meet objectively assessed  needs  unless  there
would  be significant adverse  impacts or  where  the NPPF indicates development should  be restricted.
Key evidence  of need  in relation to the economy  includes  the Employment Land  Review  and local
business  surveys, whilst population forecasts and  other key  evidence  to assess  housing  need  and
capacity has  come  from the Housing  Development Study 2015  and  the Strategic Housing  Land
Availability Assessment (SHLAA) 2012.
Policy PG 1
Overall Development Strategy
1. Provision will be made for a minimum of 380 hectares of land for business, general industrial
and storage and  distribution uses  over  the period  2010  to 2030, to support growth of the
local economy.
2. Sufficient land  will be provided  to accommodate the full, objectively assessed  needs  for the
borough  of a minimum  of 36,000 homes  between 2010  and 2030. This will  be delivered  at
an average  of 1,800 net additional dwellings  per year.
Justification
Jobs
8.3 The Cheshire  East Employment Land  Review  (2012)  highlights that Cheshire  East is  a key
economic  driver  for the North West. The local  economy  provides  7% of the North West's economic
output(1) and contains 7.6% of its businesses, the highest proportion of any unitary district in the North
West(2).
8.4 The Employment Land  Review  and the Alignment of Economic, Employment and  Housing
Strategy Report (2015)  are the primary  sources  of evidence  related to the requirements for employment
land. They use  a variety of methods to forecast the requirements for new  employment land  up to
2030. The Employment Land  Review  considers  the annual  average  rates of take-up of employment
land over  the past 25  years, as  well  as forecasting future demand  for employment land  using
econometric data and  population forecasts. It also looks at the annual average  amount of employment
land lost to other uses  over  the past 15  years.
8.5 Using  all the available  information, and  in accordance  with the 2004  ODPM Guidance Note on
Employment Land  Reviews, the study gives  a range  for the amount of employment land  that will  be
required  between 2009  and 2030.  This range  is between 278  hectares and  324 hectares, which
includes  a flexibility factor of 30%  to reflect Cheshire  East's aspirations for employment-led growth.
8.6 The Alignment of Economic, Employment & Housing  Strategy Report (AEEHS) (2015)  used
updated econometric projections, which  pointed to a  significantly greater employment growth rate
over the plan  period  than the Employment Land  Review’s  econometric projections did. The AEEHS
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 52
 Planning for Growthused  a methodology that is  largely  in line with the assumptions and  approaches  used  in the
Employment Land  Review, but concluded  that a  20%  flexibility factor was  more  appropriate, given
the use  of more  optimistic employment forecasts. The AEEHS results suggest employment land
totalling 378  hectares will  be required  over  the plan  period.

8.8 The housing  requirement set out in  Policy PG 1  responds  to the Housing  Development Study
(2015)  and aims  to meet the full objectively assessed  need  for an  additional 36,000 dwellings  that is
predicted to arise  in Cheshire  East over  the 2010  – 2030  period. The Housing  Development Study
has used  the Department for Communities and  Local  Government (CLG) 2012-based  household
projections as  a ‘starting point’ and  applied  a 10-year  migration trend. The study also  projected
economic  activity rates up  to 2030  and assumed  that there are  no further falls in  unemployment. It
considered  the evidence  on market signals  along  with the need  for affordable housing  and for older
people (including C2 bed spaces). It then sought to identify the appropriate balance – between working
residents and  the number  of people  working  in the borough  – that is  necessary  to achieve  jobs growth
of around  31,000 (an  average  of 0.7% jobs  growth a  year). Such a  balance  requires  both migration
flows and  commuting flows to be  sustainable over  the plan  period.
8.9 The Housing  Development Study concludes  that Cheshire  East is  an appropriate geography
for planning purposes over which to assess and meet housing requirements. The study also concludes
that Cheshire  East comprises  two functional sub-market areas  suggested by  the data to reflect the
former Macclesfield Borough and  a second  sub-area  reflecting the former Crewe  & Nantwich and
Congleton areas.
8.10 The CLG 2012-based  household  projections (period  2012-2037)  were  used  as the ‘starting
point’ for determining the objectively assessed  need  for housing. This links  in with paragraphs  15
and 16 of the Planning Practice Guidance which  makes  clear  that:
“Household projections published by the Department for Communities and Local
Government should provide the starting point estimate of overall housing need”.
(PPG 2015, Paragraph 15)
“The 2012-2037  Household Projections were published on the 27  February 2015, and are  the
most up to date estimate of future household growth”. (PPG 2015, Paragraph 16)
8.11 Following the completion of the Housing  Development Study (2015), the council, in  line with
the Planning Practice Guidance (ID-2a-016), has  considered  the latest available  information from the
2014-based household projections (period 2014-2039) published by CLG in July 2016. These represent
a modest reduction which  does  not warrant a  change  to the planned  approach  in the dwellings
projection set out in  Policy PG 1  'Overall Development Strategy'.

this Local  Plan Strategy are  not included  in this figure
53 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Growth8.12 Having taken the CLG 2012-based projections as its ‘starting point’, the Housing Development
Study tested alternative migration trends, concluding  that a  10-year  migration trend best represented
long-term change. The study also  projected economic  activity rates up  to 2030, based  on Census
data for Cheshire East and Office for Budget Responsibility projections. It assumes  that unemployment
stays at its March 2015 level and makes allowances for vacancies, second homes and  “double-jobbing”
(people  holding  multiple jobs). The study also  considered  the latest evidence  on market signals  (as
required  by Planning Practice Guidance). In doing  so, it used  Office for National Statistics area
classification data and CLG Index of Multiple Deprivation data to identify areas with similar  demographic
and economic  characteristics to Cheshire  East. The market signals  analysis  compared  Cheshire  East
to these areas  - Cheshire  West & Chester, the East Riding  of Yorkshire, Wiltshire and  North Somerset
– and to England. The study identified that, on  the whole, market signals  do not indicate any  need
for an  upward  adjustment to housing  need: house  price  trends and  affordability trends in  Cheshire
East are  close  to those for England and  are typically in  line with those for the comparator areas;
average  rents and  increases  in rents are  broadly  in line with England and  the comparator areas; the
proportion of households  that are  overcrowded  is lower  than in  England (and  most comparator areas)
and rose  more  slowly  during  2001-11  than in  most of these other areas; and  whilst the rate of
development has  been  relatively low  in recent years, it was  higher  than the England average  for
2001-11. Nevertheless, there has  been  an increase  in concealed  families over  the period  2001-11,
which  the objective assessment of housing  need  has addressed, and  homelessness  - by increasing
projected household  growth by  344 (an average  of 17  per annum)  over  the plan  period  (2010-2030).
The study identifies a  total affordable housing  need  of a minimum  of 7,100 dwellings  (an average  of
355 per annum), which  is included  in the objective assessment of housing  need  of at least 36,000
dwellings.
8.13 The Alignment of Economic, Employment and  Housing  Strategy Report concluded  that net
jobs growth of around 31,400 jobs would be ambitious yet realistic for the 20-year period  (2010-2030);
this represents a  jobs growth rate of around  0.7% per  annum. This is  consistent with Cheshire  East’s
previous long-term economic performance, the council’s Local Plan Strategy and  the economic growth
vision  of the Cheshire  & Warrington Local  Enterprise Partnership.
8.14 The Housing  Development Study notes that, in  meeting any  shortfall in  workers  over  the plan
period, there has  to be  an appropriate balance  between migration flows and  commuting flows, to
ensure  that both are  sustainable over  the long  term. Based on  the assumption that net in-migration
will average  2,600 per  annum  over  the 20  year  plan  period  (which  is equivalent to the highest level
recorded  in any single  year  since  1991  and considerably  greater than the 2001-11  average  of around
1,700 per  annum), net in-commuting would  need  to increase  by an average  of 400  commuters per
annum  over  the same  period. On this basis, net commuting would  rise from 1,400 (at the time of the
2011  Census)  to around  9,000 by  2030; to put this in  context, the number  of jobs  located in  Cheshire
East is  projected to rise  by around  31,000, from 197,000 to 228,000 over  the plan  period, so  even  in
2030  net commuting would  account for less  than 5%  of the total projected jobs.  Considering  all of
the evidence, the Housing  Development Study has  concluded  that the objectively assessed  need  for
housing  in Cheshire  East is  36,000 dwellings  over  the plan  period  (2010-2030). It is  also  important
to recognise  that, as  well as yielding  extra population and  workers, any  increase  in housing  will also
help to address  market signals  and increase  the likely  provision  of affordable housing.
8.15 The outputs from the Housing  Development Study work  represent only  one of the elements
that have  been  considered  by the council  in determining its housing  requirement. The council  has
also considered the findings of the Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing Strategy Report
(2015), the Strategic Housing  Land  Availability Assessment (SHLAA), the pre-recession  levels  of
house building and other wider policy considerations before determining what the appropriate housing
requirement is  for Cheshire  East.
8.16 Around 2,200 sites were  considered  as part of the Strategic Housing  Land  Availability
Assessment (Update 31  March  2012). Of these approximately 1,600 sites were  considered  suitable
for housing  during  the following 15  years. These 'suitable' sites could  potentially provide  a total of
nearly  50,000 dwellings  over  the 15  year  period, of which  about 7,200 homes  would  be on brownfield
sites with a  further 4,800 on  sites that are  a mix of brownfield and  greenfield land. This work
demonstrates a  theoretical capacity for new  housing  in the borough. An updated assessment of
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 54
 Planning for Growthhousing  permissions  and commitments has  been  completed to a  base  date of 31  March  2016. This
has been  used  to inform a  housing  trajectory for the plan  period  which  does  include  the envisaged
delivery  timing of all  the sites proposed  in the plan. The trajectory is  reproduced  in Appendix E.
8.17 Using  an overall  housing  need  target of 36,000 dwellings  for the borough  over  the plan  period
would  equate to an  average  net increase  of around  1,800 dwellings  per annum. Setting this annual
level to apply  from 2010  is a significant step change in the housing requirement for the area compared
with past policy  requirements. However  this overall  level  of housing  is considered  necessary  and
appropriate to meet the council  and government’s  growth agenda.  In arriving  at this total figure,
consideration has  been  given  to the capacity of the area  to accommodate growth and  an appropriate
balance has been struck which minimises the impact on the environment, infrastructure and the Green
Belt, whilst providing for objectively assessed needs. It is considered that a  significantly higher growth
strategy for housing, to facilitate even  greater economic  growth, would  be unsustainable in  overall
terms as  it would  have  an unacceptable impact on  the local  environment, the intended role  of the
Green Belt and  the cumulative capacity of local  infrastructure.
8.18 The council  fully intends to meet the requirement of delivering  36,000 dwellings  over  the plan
period, taking into consideration a  number  of key  components of supply, which  includes  commitments
(as at 31  March  2016), completions (between 01  April 2010  and 31 March  2016), contributions from
Strategic Sites and  Locations, proposed  Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document and
a small  sites windfall allowance.  The full extent of these contributions and  their role  in meeting and
exceeding  the housing  requirement (allowing  for a  robust level  of plan  flexibility) is  summarised  below
and set out fully within Appendix E.

8.19 The overall basis of the plan is to enable economic growth in Cheshire East. The local economy
suffered, along  with the rest of the country, during  the recent recession. The annual  rate of house
building dipped to a low of less than 500 dwellings in 2010/11 compared  to the annualised development
plan target of 1,150 applicable  at the time. This contraction in  the house  building  industry is  shown
in starker terms when  the new  annualised  average  figure of 1,800 is  applied  immediately from 2010.
The selection of land  for residential development within the site allocations will  need  to take account
of both the overall  housing  requirement and  the need  to redress  past shortfalls in  delivery  since  2010.

Planning for Growth8.20 As part of considering  options to removing  land  from the Green Belt, collaboration working
with neighbouring authorities has  explored the extent to which such  authorities could assist in meeting
Cheshire  East’s  housing  requirements. The outcome of those discussions  is that none  of these
authorities are  in such  a position.
8.21 Further information in  relation to the housing  completions and  commitments is  set out in
Appendix A: 'Proposed Growth Distribution' .
Settlement Hierarchy and Visions
8.22 It is important to make  sure  that the places  where  development takes place  have  good  access
to jobs, health and community services, education, shops, leisure, open space, and sport and recreation
facilities. If it is  easy  to walk, cycle  or use public  transport to get to facilities, the number  and length
of car  journeys  and carbon  dioxide  emissions  (the primary  cause  of global  climate change), can  be
reduced. For that reason, the bulk  of new  development should  take place  in Principal Towns  and Key
Service Centres where  access  to services  is generally  easier.
Principal Towns
8.23 The Principal Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield provide  opportunities for employment, retail
and education, and  allow  access  to services. They serve  a large  catchment area  with high  levels  of
accessibility and public transport provision. The two towns have a distinct history, character and urban
form, and  both provide  opportunities for sustainable future jobs  led growth. The town centres of both
Crewe  and Macclesfield will  be the main  focus for high  quality convenience  and comparison  retail,
supported by  a range  of services, leisure, tourism, office and  other town centre uses, including
residential.
Crewe
8.24 The key  objective for Crewe  is to take advantage of its prime  location for connectivity and
significantly increase  the amount and  type of employment that is  available  in the town. Crewe  and
its surrounding  area  are situated in  a unique  location that is  attractive to investors. The town is  a
strategic gateway to the North West, with excellent communication links  to other parts of the country
by road, rail  and air (via Manchester Airport). Crewe  also  benefits from an  advanced  engineering  /
manufacturing skills  base  and a supply  of available  development land.
8.25 The All Change  for Crewe  and High  Growth City regeneration initiatives set out ambitious
plans  for Crewe's growth, with the aim  of making  it a nationally significant economic  centre by  2030.
Vision for Crewe
By 2030, as  a gateway to the North West, Crewe  will be a nationally significant economic  centre;
one of the leading  advanced  engineering  and  manufacturing centres in  England; and  a
sought-after place  to live  and do business  in Cheshire. Crewe  will be recognised  for its vibrant
and diverse  knowledge  based  economy; high  quality communication and  sustainable transport
linkages; many  physical development opportunities; attractive heritage, environmental and cultural
assets that contribute to liveability; and  its high  quality image  and perception generated through
strong leadership.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 56
 Planning for GrowthMacclesfield
8.26 Macclesfield is  the borough's second  largest town and  the main  town in  the north of Cheshire
East, with strong economic  links  to South Manchester.
8.27 An Economic Masterplan for the town was  adopted by  the council  in 2010  with the aim  of
sustaining the town’s  performance as  one  of the most successful in  the regional  economy. The
Masterplan identified two key  elements for the future success  of the town. Firstly, the redevelopment
of the town centre to provide a greater retail offer, and secondly, the delivery of the South Macclesfield
Development Area providing  opportunities for physical  and economic  development.
Vision for Macclesfield
By 2030, Macclesfield will  continue to be  a unique, distinctive and  appealing  destination set in
a visible  landscape  setting, with a  vital and  vibrant town centre, where  the community comes
together to enjoy  a wide  range  of facilities and  events, along  with its rich  history and  heritage
assets. It will  be a town where  businesses  thrive and  where  there is  a good  range  of shopping
and leisure  activities both during  the day  and the evening. It will  be a safe and  desirable  place
with sustainable development, where  people  want to come  to live, work  and play.  Our vision  for
employment sees  Macclesfield as  the centre of bio  science  manufacturing in  Europe; this will
be focused at the current AstraZeneca site in  Hurdsfield.
Key Service Centres
8.28 Cheshire  East is  characterised by  its distinctive historic towns each  with their own  history,
character and  charm. These towns lie  at the heart of the borough, and  their vitality and  growth is
essential for the future prosperity of Cheshire  East. These towns serve  as Key Service Centres for
a wider  locality with a  good  range  of facilities including  shops, schools, and  cultural and  leisure
facilities.
8.29 The Key Service Centres of Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Middlewich, Nantwich,
Poynton, Sandbach and  Wilmslow provide  a range  of services  and opportunities for employment,
retail and  education. They serve  a wide  catchment area  and contain public  transport links. The Key
Service Centres will  deliver sustainable economic growth that can meet the aspirations of the borough
and local  communities.
Vision for Key  Service Centres
The Key Service Centres will see growth, with high quality homes and business premises provided,
where  smaller  independent traders and  tourism initiatives will  continue to thrive and  where  all
development will  contribute to creating a  strong sense  of place.
57 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for GrowthLocal Service Centres
8.30 The Local  Service Centres of Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury, Chelford, Disley,
Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes  Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and  Wrenbury  provide  a
range  of services  and facilities that help  meet the needs  of local  people, including  those living  in
nearby  settlements. Each has  a primary  school  and, in  the case  of Holmes  Chapel  and Shavington,
a secondary  school. Alderley Edge has  one private secondary  school  for girls. In many  cases, they
also have  a limited range  of shops, health and  leisure  facilities, and  employment opportunities. New
development is  required  to meet local  needs  and help  retain services  and facilities so  that residents
can continue to enjoy  these benefits and  reduce  the need  to travel elsewhere. This may  require  small
scale  alterations to the Green Belt in some circumstances, which will be pursued as necessary through
the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
Vision for Local Service Centres
In the Local  Service Centres, some  modest growth in  housing  and employment will  have  taken
place  to meet locally  arising  needs  and priorities, to reduce  the level  of out-commuting and  to
secure  their continuing vitality. This may  require  small  scale  alterations to the Green Belt in  some
circumstances.
Other Settlements and Rural Areas
8.31 The remaining  settlements have  fewer facilities than the Local  Service Centres, if any. As a
result, people  living  in these communities generally  have  to travel to larger  centres for jobs, schools,
health care  and other services. New  development in  these settlements will  help  to sustain these local
services.
Vision for Other Settlements and Rural Areas
By 2030, some  small  scale  residential and  employment development will  have  taken place  in
these settlements, to help  to retain and  sustain local  services  and to reduce  the need  to travel.
The rural  economy  will have  grown  stronger and  diversified, based  primarily  on agriculture but
supplemented by  appropriate small-scale  tourism and  visitor facilities in  appropriate locations,
food related businesses, recreation and  other knowledge-based  rural  businesses, making  use
of ICT connectivity. At the same  time, our  many  areas  of landscape  value, sites of nature
conservation importance and  heritage assets and  their settings will  have  been  maintained and
enhanced.

 Planning for GrowthSettlement Hierarchy
Policy PG 2
Settlement Hierarchy
Principal Towns
In the Principal Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield, significant development will  be encouraged
to support their revitalisation, recognising  their roles  as the most important settlements in  the
borough. Development will  maximise  the use  of existing infrastructure and  resources  to allow
jobs, homes  and  other facilities to be  located close  to each  other and  accessible  by public
transport.
Key Service Centres
In the Key Service Centres, development of a  scale, location and  nature that recognises  and
reinforces the distinctiveness of each  individual  town will  be supported to maintain their vitality
and viability.
The Key Service Centres are  Alsager, Congleton, Handforth, Knutsford, Middlewich, Nantwich,
Poynton, Sandbach and  Wilmslow.
Local Service Centres
In the Local  Service Centres, small  scale  development to meet needs  and  priorities will  be
supported where  they contribute to the creation and  maintenance of sustainable communities.
The Local  Service Centres are  Alderley Edge, Audlem, Bollington, Bunbury, Chelford, Disley,
Goostrey, Haslington, Holmes  Chapel, Mobberley, Prestbury, Shavington and  Wrenbury.
Other Settlements and Rural Areas
In the interests of sustainable development and  the maintenance of local  services, growth and
investment in  the other settlements should  be confined to proportionate development at a  scale
commensurate with the function and  character of the settlement and  confined to locations well
related to the existing built-up extent of the settlement. It may  be appropriate for local  needs  to
be met within larger  settlements, dependent on  location.
Justification
8.32 The Determining the Settlement Hierarchy  paper  considered  existing settlements in  Cheshire
East and  set out the structure and  definition of the settlement hierarchy. This approach  has been
tested at various  consultation stages in  the development of the Local  Plan Strategy.
8.33 Locating the majority of new  development needs  in, on  the edge  of, or  close  to the borough’s
Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres will  enable  the maximum  use of existing infrastructure and
resources  and allow  homes, jobs  and other facilities to be  located close  to each  other. This has  the
potential to reduce  the amount of people  reliant on  travel by  car and can support existing public
transport modes. The Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres also  have  the greatest potential to
generate economic  growth.
8.34 In Local  Service Centres and  other settlements and  rural  areas, the Local  Plan Strategy
approach  is to support an  appropriate level  of small  scale  development that reflects the function and
character of individual  villages. Small scale  growth may  be appropriate where  it supports the creation
of stronger local  communities and  where  a clear  need  exists, which  is not more  appropriately met in
a larger  nearby  settlement. Development will  be restricted to locations well  related to the built-up
59 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Growthextent of these settlements. The identification of such  sites will  achieved  through the allocation of
suitable sites and / or the designation of settlement boundaries addressed as part of the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Development Plan Document and  / or in Neighbourhood  Plans, where
these come  forward. In the case  of Goostrey which  adjoins  Holmes  Chapel, a  larger  Local  Service
Centre, it is  anticipated that development needs  will largely  be provided  for in  Holmes  Chapel.
8.35 The Local  Plan Strategy also  includes  the North Cheshire  Growth Village  at Handforth. This
new village will be designed  to the highest environmental standards, acting as best practice examples
for future design  and construction. It will  embody  sustainable development principles  including:
High quality amenities including  shops, schools  and sports facilities
A network of green  open  spaces, parks  and gardens
Employment opportunities close  at hand
Renewable on-site energy production capable of supplying heat and power to every  home where
appropriate
User-friendly public  transport systems, encouraging  people  to use   buses, cycles  and walkways
Efficient recycling  and waste management
8.36 The National Planning Policy Framework states 'the supply  of new  homes  can sometimes be
best achieved  through planning  for larger  scale  development, such  as new settlements or  extensions
to existing villages  and towns that follow the principles  of Garden Cities. Working with the support of
their communities, local  planning  authorities should  consider  whether such  opportunities provide  the
best way  of achieving  sustainable development. In doing  so, they should  consider  whether it is
appropriate to establish Green Belt around  or adjoining  any such  new  development'.
8.37 The Local  Plan Strategy also  includes  Other Local  Plan Strategy Sites at Wardle   Employment
Improvement Area and  Alderley Park Opportunity Site. At Alderley Park Opportunity Site, residential
development may  come  forward where  it is demonstrated to be  necessary  for the delivery  of the life
science  park, in  accordance  with Local  Plan Strategy Site LPS 61.
Key Evidence
1. Determining the Settlement Hierarchy
Green Belt and Safeguarded Land
8.38 The council  recognises  the important role  of the Green Belt in  the borough, particularly in
preventing its towns and  settlements from merging  into one  another, safeguarding the countryside
and concentrating development into its urban  areas.  The National Planning Policy Framework states
that 'the fundamental aim  of Green Belt policy  is to prevent urban  sprawl  by keeping  land  permanently
open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are  their openness  and permanence '.
8.39 Cheshire  East has  around  400 square  kilometres of land  designated as  Green Belt, located
in the northern and south-eastern parts of the borough. These form part of the Green Belts surrounding
Greater Manchester and  the Potteries conurbations.  Within the southern and  eastern parts of the
borough, all of our  major settlements are located beyond the outer edge of the Green Belt surrounding
the Potteries.  However, in  the north of the borough, the Green Belt surrounding  Greater Manchester
is much  wider  and a number  of significant settlements are  inset within the Green Belt. Historically,
the Green Belt boundaries  were  drawn  very  tightly around  these settlements, leaving  little space  for
future development.
8.40 Draft proposals  for Green Belt in  the area  were  first drawn  up in the 1960s  to prevent the
outward spread  of development from Greater Manchester and  the Potteries.  Detailed boundaries
for the North Cheshire  Green Belt were  defined through a  series  of Local  Plans in  the 1980s  and
detailed boundaries  for the South Cheshire  Green Belt were  defined in  the 1980s  and early  1990s.
8.41 The general  extent of the existing Green Belt will  be maintained, but to achieve  sustainable
development over a period of several decades, some alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundaries
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 60
 Planning for Growtharound  settlements in  both the north and  south of the borough  have  been  necessary  through this
Local  Plan Strategy.
Policy PG 3
Green Belt
Green Belt is  a designation for land  around  large  built-up areas, which  aims  to keep  land
permanently open  or largely  undeveloped.
1. The purposes  of the Green Belt are  to:
i. check  the unrestricted sprawl  of large  built up  areas;
ii. prevent neighbouring  towns from merging  into one  another;
iii. safeguard the countryside from encroachment;
iv. preserve  the setting and  special  character of historic towns; and
v. assist urban  regeneration by  encouraging  the recycling  of derelict and  other urban
land.
2. Within the Green Belt, planning permission will not be granted for inappropriate development,
except in  very  special  circumstances, in  accordance  with national policy.
3. The construction of new  buildings  is inappropriate in  Green Belt. Exceptions to this are
i. buildings  for agriculture and  forestry;
ii. provision  of appropriate facilities for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation and  for
cemeteries, as  long  as it preserves  the openness  of the Green Belt and  does  not
conflict with the purposes  of including  land  within it;
iii. the extension or  alteration of a  building  provided  that it does  not result in
disproportionate additions over  and above  the size  of the original  building;
iv. the replacement of a  building, provided  the new  building  is in the same  use and not
materially larger  than the one  it replaces;
v. limited infilling in  villages, and  limited affordable housing  for local  community needs
under  policies  set out in  the Local  Plan; or
vi. limited infilling or  the partial or  complete redevelopment of previously  developed  sites
(brownfield land), whether redundant or  in continuing use  (excluding  temporary
buildings), which  would  not have  a greater impact on  the openness  of the Green Belt
and the purpose  of including  land  within it than the existing development.
4. Certain other forms of development are  also  not inappropriate in  Green Belt provided  they
preserve  the openness  of the Green Belt and  do not conflict with the purposes  of including
land in Green Belt. These are:
i. mineral  extraction;
ii. engineering  operations;
iii. local transport infrastructure that can  demonstrate a  requirement for a  Green Belt
location;
iv. the re-use  of buildings  provided  that the buildings  are of permanent and  substantial
construction; and
v. development brought forward under  a Community Right to Build Order.
61 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Growth5. The extent of the existing Green Belt(33) remains  unchanged, apart from the removal  of land
from the Green Belt associated with the following sites (shown  in Figure 8.1):
i. Site LPS 14  ‘Land  East of Fence Avenue, Macclesfield’

xxvi. Safeguarded Land  LPS 59  ‘Land  at Upcast Lane  / Cumber  Lane, Wilmslow’
6. In addition to these areas  listed for removal  from the Green Belt, it may  also  be necessary
to identify additional non-strategic sites to be  removed  in the Site Allocations and
Development Policies Document.
7. Green Belt boundaries  will be identified on  the Adopted Policies Map  of the Local  Plan.
Justification
8.42 As set out in  Chapter 4 'The Case  for Growth'  and Policy PG 1  'Overall Development Strategy' ,
and evidenced through the Housing  Development Study (2015), the Employment Land Review (2012)
and the Alignment of Economic, Employment and Housing Strategy Report (2015) there are significant
identified needs  for market and  affordable housing, as  well as for new  employment land  provision
within Cheshire  East.
8.43 The National Planning Policy Framework requires  that ' Local  planning  authorities should
positively seek  opportunities to meet the development needs  of their area ' and  that ' Local  Plans
should  meet objectively assessed  needs, with sufficient flexibility to adapt to rapid  change, unless:
(i) any adverse  impacts of doing  so would  significantly and  demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when
assessed  against the policies  in this Framework taken as  a whole; or  (ii) specific policies  in this
Framework indicate development should  be restricted ''.
33 As defined in  the Borough of Crewe  and Nantwich Local  Plan, the Congleton Borough Local  Plan and  the Macclesfield
Borough Local  Plan
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 62
 Planning for Growth8.44 The National Planning Policy Framework also states ' Once established, Green Belt boundaries
should  only  be altered in  exceptional circumstances, through the preparation or  review  of the Local
Plan'.
8.45 The Green Belt Assessment Update (2015)  has considered  the contribution each  parcel  of
Green Belt land  adjoining  settlement boundaries  makes  to the purposes  of the Green Belt.  In the
north of the borough, there is  very  little scope  to meet these needs  from towns and  villages  inset
within the Green Belt boundary, or  from urban  areas  inside  the Green Belt boundary.  As set out in
the Green Belt Assessment Update, a  proportion of the proposed  development arising  from
development needs  within areas  inset within the North Cheshire  Green Belt is  already  channelled  to
locations within Cheshire East beyond the outer Green Belt boundary. Directing additional development
to locations beyond the outer Green Belt boundary would lead to unsustainable patterns of development
and would  not provide  sufficient new  development in  the areas  of need.
8.46 The Green Belt has  been  a very  successful instrument in  limiting the expansion  of urban  areas
and encouraging  the recycling  of derelict and  other urban  land.  In addition, many  of the settlements
do not have  a significant industrial legacy  and are not blighted by  large  areas  of derelict industrial
land contributing to a potential supply of appropriately re-usable land for redevelopment. Consequently,
there are  not sufficient sites likely  to be  available  to deliver  enough  market and  affordable housing
to meet anywhere  near  the identified housing  needs  and not enough  opportunities for key  additions
to the employment sites portfolio.
8.47 Without alterations to the detailed Green Belt boundaries, the amount of new  development
that could  be planned  for in  the north of the borough  would  be very  low. It is  considered  that such  a
low level  of development would  have  severe  consequences  including:
Demand  for new  housing  outstripping supply, further increasing  house  prices  and a lack of new
affordable housing  provision  leading  to young  people  and key workers  being  unable  to stay in
the area.
An increasingly  ageing  population as  young  people  leave  and an absolute reduction in  the
number  of people  of working  age.
Difficulty in attracting inward investment and economic growth. In areas of relatively unaffordable
housing, employers  have  difficulty in  recruiting to lower  paid  positions.
Increases in  traffic and  congestion as  people  unable  to live  close  to their place  of work  are forced
to travel longer  distances for employment and  the smaller  working-age  population living  locally
would  also  mean  more  people  commuting in  to the area.
A decline  in the vibrancy  and vitality of town centres and  some  local  services  and facilities
becoming  unviable.
8.48 The importance of allocating land  to go some way to meeting the identified development needs
in the north of the borough, combined  with the consequences  for sustainable development of not
doing  so, constitutes the exceptional circumstances required to justify alteration of the existing detailed
Green Belt boundaries, whilst maintaining the overall  general  extent of the Green Belt.
8.49 In the south of the borough, there is  a particular need  to allow  an extension of the Radway
Green employment area  in the Green Belt. This is  a particularly successful business  site which  has
diversified from its munitions origins, is  short of available  space  land  and is well located near  to the
M6 Motorway.

 Planning for GrowthSafeguarded Land
8.50 Green Belt boundaries are intended to endure over the longer-term.  Therefore, when  reviewing
Green Belt boundaries, it is  important to draw  the new  boundaries  having  regard  to potential
development needs  arising  well beyond  the Plan period.
8.51 Consequently, it is  necessary  to identify areas  of 'safeguarded land' that are  between the
urban  area  and the new  Green Belt boundary  in order  to meet these potential long-term development
requirements and  avoid  the need  for another review  of the Green Belt at the end  of this plan  period.
Policy PG 4
Safeguarded Land
Safeguarded land  is land  between the existing urban  area  and the inner  boundary  of the Green
Belt that may  be required  to meet longer-term development needs  stretching well  beyond  the
period  of the Local  Plan.
1. Safeguarded land  is not allocated for development at the present time.
2. Safeguarded land is outside of the urban area and therefore policies relating to development
in the open  countryside will  apply.
3. Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive development of safeguarded
land will not be  permitted.
4. Development of safeguarded land  for uses  other than those appropriate in  the open
countryside will  not be  permitted, unless  a review  of the Local  Plan has  taken place  to
allocate the land  following an  assessment of the need  for development at that time, and
the identification of the most appropriate locations for development to take place.
5. The areas  of safeguarded land  are (shown  in Figure 8.2):
i. Safeguarded Land  LPS 19  ‘South West Macclesfield’ (95.7 hectares)
ii. Safeguarded Land  LPS 35  ‘North Cheshire  Growth Village  Extension’ (14  hectares)
iii. Safeguarded Land  LPS 39  ‘Land  south of Tabley  Road, Knutsford’ (11  hectares)
iv. Safeguarded Land  LPS 40  ‘Land  north of Tabley  Road, Knutsford’ (11  hectares)
v. Safeguarded Land  LPS 41  ‘Land  adjacent of Booths Hall, Knutsford’ (8.7 hectares)
vi. Safeguarded Land  LPS 52  ‘Woodford Aerodrome, Poynton’ (22  hectares)
vii. Safeguarded Land  LPS 58  ‘Land  at Heathfield Farm, Wilmslow’ (9  hectares)
viii. Safeguarded Land  LPS 59  ‘Land  at Upcast Lane  / Cumber  Lane, Wilmslow (15
hectares)
6. In addition to these areas  of safeguarded land  listed; it may  also  be necessary  to identify
additional non-strategic areas  of land  to be  safeguarded in  the Site Allocations and
Development Policies Document.
Justification
8.52 The National Planning Policy Framework requires that, when amending  Green Belt boundaries,
Local  Planning Authorities should  'where  necessary, identify in  their plan  areas  of safeguarded land
between the urban  area  and the Green Belt, in  order  to meet longer-term development needs  stretching
well beyond  the plan  period '. They should  also 'make  clear  that the safeguarded land  is not allocated
for development at the present time. Planning permission  for the permanent development of
safeguarded land  should  only  be granted following a  Local  Plan review  which  proposes  the
development ' as well as 'satisfy themselves that Green Belt boundaries  will not need  to be  altered at
the end  of the development plan  period ''.
65 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Growth8.53 The development needs  beyond  this plan  period  will be determined through future reviews  of
the Local  Plan. In the absence  of guidance  on the amount of land  that should  be safeguarded, a
balanced  approach  is required  that gives  confidence on  the permanence  of the Green Belt boundary
whilst minimising  the impact on  the Green Belt and  making  the most efficient use  of land.
8.54 Within the South Cheshire  Green Belt area, the main  settlements of Congleton and  Alsager
are located adjacent to, but beyond the Green Belt. There is a significant supply  of potential non-Green
Belt land  in these areas  and therefore no  need  to designate safeguarded land  to ensure  permanence
of the South Cheshire Green Belt boundary. Within the North Cheshire Green Belt, the main settlements
are inset within the Green Belt and  do not have  the same  expansion  options on  non-Green Belt land.
It is therefore necessary  to include  areas  of safeguarded land  to make  sure  that the North Cheshire
Green Belt boundaries  will not need  to be  altered again  at the end  of the plan  period.
8.55 A number  of Local  Plans have  indicated that a  15 year  plan  period, followed by  5-10  years
worth of safeguarded land  will ensure  that the Green Belt boundary  retains a  degree  of permanence.
As safeguarded land  is only required  in the North Cheshire  Green Belt, the development requirement
for the northern sub-area  in this plan  period  has been  projected forward beyond  2030  to determine
the amount of safeguarded land  required.
8.56 Consideration has  been  given  to the likely  availability of land  beyond  2030. Whilst it is  difficult
to identify specific land  that may  become  available  so far into the future, there is  a range  of evidence
to suggest that there will be a continued and  reliable source of recycled and other land for development
post 2030. There may also be other further options available to accommodate development including:
Channelling development to locations within the inner Green Belt boundary, with the opportunities
arising  from the renaissance  of our  adjacent conurbations;
Channelling  development to locations beyond  the outer edge  of the Green Belt boundary  in
Cheshire  East. It is  anticipated that HS2 will  prove  decisive  in supporting the case  for significant
future growth and  development in  the southern part of the borough, centred around  Crewe,
Alsager, Congleton and  Middlewich. As evidenced  by the volume  of sites submitted through the
Local  Plan process  and Strategic Housing  Land  Availability Assessment, it is  clear  that there
will continue to be  a significant stock of potential development sites in  areas  beyond  the Green
Belt post 2030.
8.57 Given the desire  to protect the countryside and  minimise  the impact on  the Green Belt, it is
appropriate to provide  only  the minimum  amount of safeguarded land  needed  to make  sure  that
Green Belt boundaries  do not need  to be  altered again  in the next plan  period. Considering  the
potential options for accommodating development post 2030, it is  considered  that there are  grounds
for a modest reduction in  the timescale for projecting forward needs, to provide  for between 8-10
years  of safeguarded land. Factors in  relation to future housing  densities have  also been  considered,
including  an ageing  population, increased  provision  of smaller  units and  enabling  higher  densities
through improved  urban  design. It is  considered  that there are  sufficient grounds  for assuming  future
housing  densities of between 30  and 40 dwellings  per hectare. A range  of scenarios  have  been  tested
using the parameters on time period for projections and housing densities, which result in a requirement
of between 155  ha and 244 ha of safeguarded land. Overdependence on  any single  influence is  not
appropriate given  the timescales and  variables  involved, and  a mid-point of 200  hectares is  selected
to take account of all  factors concerned.
8.58 At the end  of the plan  period, the continued supply  of recycled  and other land  for development
as well as the other options to accommodate development and  the use  of the identified safeguarded
land if required, will  be sufficient to ensure  that the Green Belt boundary  will not need  to be  reviewed
again  at this time.

Planning for GrowthStrategic Green Gaps
8.59 Maintaining and  enhancing  the character and  separate identities of the borough’s  towns and
villages  is a key priority of the Local  Plan Strategy
Policy PG 5
Strategic Green Gaps
1. Areas between the following settlements are  defined as  Strategic Green Gaps:
i. Willaston / Wistaston / Nantwich / Crewe;
ii. Willaston / Rope  / Shavington / Crewe;
iii. Crewe  / Shavington / Basford / Weston; and
iv. Crewe  / Haslington.
2. These areas  are shown  on Figure 8.3. The detailed boundaries  of the Strategic Green Gaps
will be defined through the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document and shown
on the Adopted Policies Map.
3. The purposes  of Strategic Green Gaps are  to:
i. Provide long-term protection against coalescence;
ii. Protect the setting and  separate identity of settlements; and
iii. Retain the existing settlement pattern by  maintaining the openness  of land.
4. Within Strategic Green Gaps, Policy PG 6  'Open Countryside' will apply. In addition, planning
permission  will not be  granted for the construction of new  buildings  or the change  of use  of
existing buildings  of land  which  would:
i. Result in erosion  of a physical gap  between any of the settlements named in this policy;
or
ii. Adversely affect the visual  character of the landscape; or
iii. Significantly affect the undeveloped  character of the Green Gap, or  lead  to the
coalescence  between existing settlements.
5. Exceptions to this policy  will only  be considered  where  it can  be demonstrated that no
suitable alternative location is  available.
Justification
8.60 Within the areas  to the south, east and  west of Crewe, there are  a number  of neighbouring
towns and  villages  in close  proximity to each  other. As Crewe  has grown  throughout the 20th Century,
erosion  of the gaps  between Crewe, Nantwich and  a number  of smaller  settlements has  caused
settlements to merge  into the urban  area  in some  cases, and  very  narrow  gaps  to remain  in other
cases.
8.61 The identification of Crewe  as a spatial priority for growth brings  significant opportunities for
this area, but also  some  challenges. As Crewe  grows  to fulfil its potential it will  become  increasingly
important to maintain the distinctive identity of Nantwich and  other nearby  settlements and  to prevent
them from merging  into a  Greater Crewe  urban  area. Accordingly it is  not just the narrowest of gaps
that are  important –  to maintain the sense  of separation a  broader  area  of open  land  is necessary  –
including  that adjoining  smaller  settlements.
8.62 As set out in  the ‘New  Green Belt and  Strategic Open Gaps’ study, strong and  strategic
long-term policy  protection is  required  to maintain the existing gaps  between Crewe  and Nantwich,
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 68
 Planning for Growthand between Crewe  and other settlements that are  at risk  of coalescence  resulting from the future
growth of Crewe.
8.63 The detailed boundaries of the Strategic Green Gaps will be defined through the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Document and  shown  on the Adopted Policies Map. This will  allow  for the
full spatial definition of the policy  and its delineation to an  Ordnance Survey base. Until that time, the
Green Gap boundaries, as  defined in  the saved  Policy NE.4 of the Borough of Crewe  and Nantwich
Replacement Local  Plan will  remain  in force, apart from where  specific changes  are proposed  in this
document through the allocation of Local  Plan Strategy sites, or  where  significant development
proposals  (10 or more  residential units / 1,000 + sq.m. floorspace) adjacent to the urban  area  have
an uncontested planning  permission  (or have  been  completed). The land  to north of Moorfields,
Willaston currently has  planning  permission  for residential development (13/3688N) but remains  in
the Green Gap pending  the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment. The judgment of the Supreme
Court will  subsequently be  reflected in  the detailed boundary  of the Strategic Green Gap defined
through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document and  shown  on the Adopted Policies
Map.
Figure 8.3 Strategic Green Gaps
8.64 The gaps  identified in  this policy  are considered  to be  the strategic gaps  required  to prevent
coalescence, primarily  arising  from the growth of Crewe. The Site Allocations and  Development
Policies Document will  consider  whether there are  further, more  localised  gaps  that require  additional
policy  protection through a  Local  Green Gaps policy.

Planning for GrowthOpen Countryside
8.65 The protection of the open  countryside from urbanising  development is  a principal  objective
of the Local  Plan Strategy.
Policy PG 6
Open Countryside
1. The Open Countryside is  defined as  the area  outside of any  settlement with a  defined
settlement boundary(34).
2. Within the Open Countryside only  development that is  essential for the purposes  of
agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation, public  infrastructure, essential works  undertaken
by public  service  authorities or  statutory undertakers, or  for other uses  appropriate to a  rural
area will be permitted.
3. Exceptions may  be made:
i. where  there is  the opportunity for limited infilling in  villages; the infill of a  small  gap with
one or two dwellings  in an otherwise built up  frontage elsewhere; affordable housing,
in accordance  with the criteria contained in  Policy SC 6  ‘Rural  Exceptions Housing  for
Local  Needs’  or where  the dwelling  is exceptional in  design  and sustainable
development terms;
ii. for the re-use  of existing rural  buildings  where  the building  is permanent, substantial
and would  not require  extensive alteration, rebuilding  or extension
iii. for the replacement of existing buildings  (including  dwellings)  by new  buildings  not
materially larger  than the buildings  they replace;
iv. for extensions to existing dwellings  where  the extension is  not disproportionate to the
original  dwelling;
v. for development that is  essential for the expansion  or redevelopment of an  existing
business;
vi. For development that is  essential for the conservation and  enhancement of a  heritage
asset.
4. The retention of gaps  between settlements is  important, in  order  to maintain the definition
and separation of existing communities and  the individual  characters of such  settlements.
5. The acceptability of such  development will  be subject to compliance  with all  other relevant
policies  in the Local  Plan. In this regard, particular attention should  be paid  to design  and
landscape character so the appearance and distinctiveness of the Cheshire East countryside
is preserved  and enhanced.
Justification
8.66 The Cheshire  countryside is  highly  valued  by residents, visitors and  businesses  alike. From
the sandstone ridge, across  the Cheshire  Plain and  up to the Peak District Fringe, the borough's
countryside is  cherished  for its scenic, recreational, aesthetic and  productive qualities. Much  of the
land is fertile and  Cheshire  East is  a vital area  for food production. It is  the preservation of the
countryside that is  the key  objective of this policy.
34 Settlement boundaries  will be reviewed  and defined through the production of the Site Allocations and  Development
Policies DPD and  neighbourhood  plans. Until then, the spatial extent of settlement boundaries  are those defined in
the saved policies and proposals maps of the existing local plans for Crewe and Nantwich, Macclesfield and Congleton
and amended to include sites detailed in  this Local Plan Strategy, except safeguarded land. Table 8.3 shows settlements
with a  boundary  defined in  the saved  policies  and proposals  maps  of the existing local  plans  and where  these are
amended  by sites detailed in  this Local  Plan Strategy.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 70
 Planning for Growth8.67  The Open Countryside comprises  that part of the Local  Plan area  outside of identified
settlements. Development in  the Open Countryside will  normally  be unacceptable unless  it can  be
shown  to be  essential to local  needs  and the rural  economy  and cannot be  accommodated within
existing settlements.
8.68 As part of this policy, the gaps  between settlements will  be protected from inappropriate
development, to make  sure  that the existing communities retain their separation and  definition, along
with their individual  character, whilst the intrinsic character and  beauty of the countryside will  be
recognised  and protected.
8.69 The spatial extent of Open Countryside is  defined as  the area  outside of any  settlement with
a defined settlement boundary. Settlement boundaries are defined in the saved policies of the Borough
of Crewe  and Nantwich Replacement Local  Plan, Congleton Borough Local  Plan First Review  and
the Macclesfield Borough Local  Plan; settlement boundaries  will remain  unchanged  apart from where
specific sites are  proposed  within this document (except safeguarded land), until detailed boundaries
are established through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document and  / or
Neighbourhood  Plans. Table  8.3 shows  settlements with a  defined settlement boundary  and any
amendments to these settlement boundaries   associated with the allocation of sites in  this Local  Plan
Strategy.

8.70 For clarification, the Open Countryside policy will also apply  to areas designated as safeguarded
land in policy  PG 4.
8.71 The National Planning Policy Framework recognises that there will be cases where exceptions
can be made  to countryside policies, including  'the exceptional quality or  innovative design  of the
dwelling' . Criteria for meeting this test are  set out in  the National Planning Policy Framework.
Key Evidence

Planning for GrowthSpatial Distribution
8.72 The overall  level  of development between 2010  and 2030  is set out in  Policy PG 1  'Overall
Development Strategy' . Given the diverse  nature of settlements in  Cheshire  East, each  with different
needs  and constraints, it is  appropriate to set indicative levels  of development by  settlement.
8.73 These figures are  intended as  a guide  and are neither a  ceiling  nor a target.  In addition to
completions since  2010  and current commitments (e.g. planning  permissions), provision  will be made
to allocate sufficient new  sites(35) in each  area  to facilitate the levels  of development set out in  this
policy.
Policy PG 7
Spatial Distribution of Development
1. The Principal Towns  are expected to accommodate development as  shown:
i. Crewe: in  the order  of 65  hectares of employment land  and 7,700 new  homes;
ii. Macclesfield: in  the order  of 20  hectares of employment land  and 4,250 new  homes;
2. The Key Service Centres  are expected to accommodate development as  shown:
i. Alsager: in  the order  of 40  hectares of employment land  and 2,000 new  homes;
ii. Congleton: in  the order  of 24  hectares of employment land  and 4,150 new  homes;
iii. Handforth: in  the order  of 22  hectares of employment land  and 2,200 new  homes;
iv. Knutsford: in  the order  of 15  hectares of employment land  and 950 new  homes;
v. Middlewich: in  the order  of 75  hectares of employment land  and 1,950 new  homes;
vi. Nantwich: in  the order  of 3 hectares of employment land  and 2,050 new  homes;
vii. Poynton: in  the order  of 10  hectares of employment land  and 650 new  homes;
viii. Sandbach: in  the order  of 20  hectares of employment land  and 2,750 new  homes;
ix. Wilmslow: in  the order  of 10  hectares of employment land  and 900 new  homes;
3. The Local Service Centres  are expected to accommodate in  the order  of 7 hectares of
employment land  and 3,500 new  homes.
4. The Other Settlements and Rural Areas  are expected to accommodate in  the order  of 69
hectares of employment land  (figure including  the 61  hectare Employment Improvement
Area at Wardle)  and 2,950 new  homes  (including  Alderley Park).
Justification
8.74 The distribution of development between the various  towns of the borough  is informed by  the
Spatial Distribution Update Report. This has  taken into account the following considerations:
Settlement Hierarchy
Various  consultation stages including  the Town  Strategies, Development Strategy and  Emerging
Policy Principles
Green Belt designations
Known development opportunities including the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment
Infrastructure capacity
Environmental constraints
Broad sustainable distribution of development requirements
35 Through Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic Locations in  this document and  further non-strategic sites in  the Site
Allocations and  Development Policies Document
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 76
 Planning for Growth8.75 The distribution also  takes into account the core  planning  principles  set out in  the National
Planning Policy Framework, which  states that planning  should  take account of the varied  roles  and
character of different areas, and  actively manage  patterns of growth to make  the fullest possible  use
of public  transport, walking  and cycling  and focus significant development in  locations that are  or can
be made  sustainable.
8.76 Settlement boundaries  for each  of the settlements in  Policy PG 7  are as defined in  the saved
policies  of the Borough of Crewe  and Nantwich Replacement Local  Plan, Congleton Borough Local
Plan First Review  and the Macclesfield Borough Local  Plan, and  are as amended  by the sites detailed
in this Local Plan Strategy document. Further amendments to settlement boundaries will be undertaken
through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
8.77 Cheshire  East is  a high  quality place  to live  and work. The Local  Plan Strategy seeks  to
manage  change  over  the plan  period  to make  sure  that it reinforces the advantages the area  already
possesses, in  a sustainable way. Table  8.4 presents an  indicative distribution for the levels  of the
settlement hierarchy in the borough. The figure for Local Service Centres will be further disaggregated
in the Site Allocations and  Development Policies DPD and  / or Neighbourhood  Plans.

77 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Growth8.78 Appendix A provides  further detail about the distribution of development in  Cheshire  East. It
should  be noted that the actual levels  of employment land  and housing  development shown  in Policy
PG 7  are below  the numbers  proposed  in the Spatial Distribution of Development Policy. This is  to
provide  flexibility and  to allow  for a  proportion of slippage, such  as developments occurring  after the
plan period, or  for sites coming  forward at lower  densities than currently expected.
8.79 The Housing  Development Study suggests that, on  the basis  of migration, travel to work  and
other data, Cheshire  East is  an appropriate geography  for planning  purposes  over  which  to assess
and meet housing  requirements and  comprises  two functional housing  sub-market areas: one  is
focused on  the former Macclesfield district and  exhibits strong interactions with Greater Manchester
market; the second  is focused on  the former Crewe  & Nantwich district and  Congleton districts, and
has noticeable market interactions with North Staffordshire and  Greater Manchester.
8.80 The council  recognises  the importance of Green Belt in  the borough  in terms of its function
and the original  reasons  for its allocation. The Green Belt in  the north of the Borough is  drawn  tightly
around existing settlements. Additionally, the north of the borough is under pressure from development
spreading  out from the Greater Manchester conurbation. Despite this there remains  an identified
need  in the north of the borough  for both market and  affordable housing  to meet the Macclesfield
functional housing  market area  and also  to deliver  employment land  in the borough. The Local  Plan
Strategy therefore has  allocated a  small  number  of sites concentrated in  particular areas  to minimise
the impact on  the Green Belt.
8.81 The approach  of the Local  Plan Strategy has  been  to focus development in  the Principal
Towns  of Crewe  and Macclesfield, delivering  the aspirations set out in  'All Change  for Crewe' and
meeting the housing  market and  employment requirements of Macclesfield, whilst limiting the impact
on the Green Belt.
8.82 It is also  appropriate to direct a  significant proportion of development to the remaining
higher-order  centres (the Key Service Centres), which  provide  a good  range  of services  and
opportunities for employment, retail and  education alongside  good  public  transport links.  New
development in the Key Service Centres will help  to sustain services and facilities in these settlements
and assist in  improving  the vitality and  viability of their retail centres against a  backdrop  of an  ageing
population and  increased  competition from out-of-town and  online  retailing.  In the Key Service
Centres, an appropriate level of new employment provision is  planned, in order to allow for employment
growth to meet local  needs  and reduce  the need  to travel.
8.83 Outside of the Green Belt areas, substantial development in the Key Service Centres recognises
the role  of these towns in  the provision  of essential services. For Key Service Centres surrounded
by Green Belt, the scale  of development proposed  is limited so  that the fundamental objectives of
the Green Belt are not compromised whilst meeting an appropriate proportion of locally-arising needs. 
This is  essential to provide  new affordable housing  and new jobs and to sustain services  and facilities
in the settlements.
8.84 The focus of development around  Key Service Centres that are  not surrounded  by Green Belt
has been  to encourage  future inward  investment and  sustain the vitality and  vibrancy  of those towns. 
Development in  towns such  as Congleton will  result in  additional investment, both in  infrastructure
and services, including  the delivery  of the Congleton Link  Road, which  will provide  for additional land
for development and  investment into the town.
8.85 The North Cheshire  Growth Village  at Handforth East will:
Provide access  to services  and employment opportunities located in  Manchester
Provide access  to services  and facilities in  Handforth
Effectively meet a  significant proportion of the needs  of the northern Green Belt towns, due  to
its closeness  to a number  of settlements
Provide the funding to support the delivery  of infrastructure improvements required  to support
the economic  growth of Cheshire  East
Reduce  the impact of the release  of Green Belt on  existing communities

9.1 Cheshire  East has  the exciting opportunity to deliver  successful sustainable development and
support the growth of vibrant sustainable communities through the growth envisaged  within the
borough. The concept of sustainability is  an extremely complicated one  with many  interwoven factors
needing to be  addressed to ensure a successful approach. The UK Sustainable Development Strategy
Securing the Future  sets out five guiding  principles  of sustainable development: living  within the
planet's environmental limits; ensuring  a strong, healthy and  just society; achieving  a sustainable
economy; promoting good  governance; and  using  sound  science  responsibly.
Policy SD 1
Sustainable Development in Cheshire East
In order  to achieve  sustainable development in  Cheshire  East, the following considerations to
development will  apply. Development should  wherever  possible:
1. Contribute to creating a  strong, responsive  and competitive economy  for Cheshire  East;
2. Prioritise investment and  growth within the Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres;
3. Contribute to the creation of sustainable communities;
4. Provide appropriate infrastructure to meet the needs  of the local  community including:
education; health and  social  care; transport; communication technology; landscaping  and
open  space; sport and  leisure; community facilities; water; waste water; and  energy;
5. Provide access  to local  jobs, services  and facilities, reflecting the community's needs;
6. Ensure that development is  accessible  by public  transport, walking  and cycling;
7. Provide safe access  and sufficient car  parking  in accordance  with adopted highway
standards;
8. Support the health, safety, social  and cultural well-being  of the residents of Cheshire  East;
9. Provide a  locally  distinct, high  quality, sustainable, well  designed  and durable  environment;
10. Contribute towards the achievement of equality and  social  inclusion  through positive
cooperation with the local  community;
11. Use appropriate technologies to reduce carbon emissions and  create a low carbon  economy;
12. Incorporate sustainable design  and construction methods;
13. Support the achievement of vibrant and  prosperous  town and  village  centres;
14. Contribute to protecting and  enhancing  the natural, built, historic and  cultural environment;
15. Make  efficient use  of land, protect the best and  most versatile agricultural land  and make
best use  of previously  developed  land  where  possible;
16. Encourage the reuse  of existing buildings; and
17. Prioritise the most accessible  and sustainable locations.
Justification
9.2 The National Planning Policy Framework definition of sustainable development is: “meeting
the needs  of the present without compromising  the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs". The Framework outlines an  approach  to sustainable development which  seeks  to foster
positive growth leading  to economic, environmental and  social  progress  whilst finding the means  to
accommodate new  ways  by which  we will earn  our living  in a competitive world. The Framework
establishes the need  to balance  these aims  and  provide  for the needs  of a  rising, longer  living
population, whilst responding  to the changes  that new  technologies offer us  and ensuring  that our
lives, and  the places  in which  we live them, can  change  for the better.
9.3 Whilst the Local  Plan Strategy includes  the presumption in  favour of sustainable development
as a 'golden thread' running through the strategy, Policy SD 1  seeks to further define the considerations
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 82

Sustainable Development Principles
1. All development will  be expected to:
i. Provide or  contribute towards identified infrastructure, services  or facilities. Such
infrastructure should  precede  the delivery  of other forms of development, wherever
possible;
ii. Contribute positively to an  area’s  character and  identity, creating or  reinforcing local
distinctiveness in  terms of:
a. Height, scale, form and  grouping;
b. Choice  of materials;
c. External design  features;
d. Massing of development - the balance between built form and green/public spaces;
e. Green infrastructure; and
f. Relationship to neighbouring properties, street scene  and the wider neighbourhood;
iii. Respect and, where  possible, enhance  the landscape  character of the area. Particular
attention will  be paid  toward significant landmarks  and landscape  features;
iv. Respect, and  where  possible  enhance, the significance of heritage assets, including
their wider  settings;
v. Avoid  the permanent loss  of areas  of agricultural land  quality of 1, 2  or 3a, unless  the
strategic need  overrides  these issues;
vi. Be socially  inclusive  and, where  suitable, integrate into the local  community;
vii. Avoid  high  risk flood areas, or  where  necessary  provide  appropriate mitigation
measures;
viii. Use appropriate design, construction, insulation, layout and  orientation to create
developments that:
a. Are resilient to climate change;
b. Minimise  energy  use;
c. Use natural resources  prudently;
d. Promote the use, recovery  and recycling  of materials;
e. Integrate or  allow  future integration of renewable  energy  technologies;
f. Discourage  crime  and anti-social behaviour;
g. Minimise  trip generation;
h. Minimise  waste and  pollution; and
i. Are water efficient.
83 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Planning for Sustainable Development2. In addition to the above  principles, residential development will  be expected to:
i. Provide open  space, of an  extent, quality, design  and location appropriate to the
development and  the local  community;
ii. Provide access to a range(37) of forms of public transport, open space and key services
and amenities(38); and
iii. Incorporate measures  to encourage  travel by  sustainable modes  of transport such  as
walking, cycling  and public  transport.
3. In addition to the principles  in point 1  above, employment development will  be expected to:
i. Provide an  attractive setting to development in  order  to create an  attractive and
successful place  to work, with minimum  impact on  the surrounding  area;
ii. Provide a flexible development that can serve  a range of sizes and types of employment;
and
iii. Maximise  opportunities for access  and deliveries  by a range  of forms of sustainable
transport.
4. In addition to the principles in point 1 above, retail/town centre development will be expected
to:
i. Provide high  quality pedestrian and  cycle  facilities, including  secure  cycle  parking;
ii. Be located so  as to reduce  the need  to travel, especially  by car, and  to enable  people
as far as  possible  to meet their needs  locally; and
iii. Provide good  town centre linkages, by  walking, cycling  and public  transport, if the
development is  located on  the edge  or out of town.
Justification
9.4 Planning, through the Local  Plan Strategy, has  a key role in addressing  the impacts of climate
change  in terms of both mitigation and  adaptation. The Local  Plan Strategy sets out a  minimum
requirement of 36,000 new  homes  and  the accommodation of a  minimum  of 380  hectares of
employment land by 2030, which could considerably raise the amount of carbon emissions  and impact
on the wider  environment unless  adequate measures  are introduced to combat this. Directing
development to the most sustainable locations and  thus improving  accessibility and  reducing  the
need  to travel through the spatial strategy will  have  a significant impact on  climate change  at the local
level. However, individual  development proposals  must themselves also  play  a key role in mitigating
the causes  and adapting to the effects of climate change.
9.5 Table  9.1 provides  a guide  to the appropriate distances for access  to services  and amenities.
A methodology for the assessment of walking  distances has  been  informed by  that of the North West
Sustainability Checklist (now  revoked), which  has been  backed  by the Department for Communities
and Local  Government (DCLG) and  World  Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). These distances are  actual
distances using  public  highways  and footpaths. The distances are  considered  appropriate for the
region  and  have  been  used  for the purposes  of informing the Sustainability Appraisal and  the
accessibility of proposed  developments.
9.6 In assessing  the distances to services  and amenities, consideration will  also  be given  to the
quality of the pedestrian, cycle  or other transportation routes.
37 As a guide, a  range  is considered  to be  within the maximum  recommended  distance of a  bus stop; a  multi-functional
open  space; and  a convenience  store, in  addition to four or  more  other services  or amenities, dependent on  location.
38 Recommended  distances are  set out in  Table  9.1 below. The council  will have  regard  to proposed  improvements to
services  and amenities that are  to be  brought forward as  part of the development.

10.1 Sufficient appropriate infrastructure is  crucial  to the well-being  of any  society. From the roads,
railways  and cycle  paths that cross  the borough  to schools, health care  facilities and  the pipes  below
ground  that provide  us with water, gas  and telecommunications, a  fully operational, well-planned,
well connected and  well-maintained infrastructure has  to be  at the heart of good  planning, now  and
into the future. Infrastructure is  also  essential for economic  development, to underpin  the jobs-led
growth strategy.
10.2 The timely provision  of infrastructure is  associated with the need  which  arises  directly as  a
consequence of that development. It is important to ensure that development is adequately supported
by appropriate infrastructure, whether using existing or through new provision. Delivering or improving
infrastructure on  time is  therefore extremely important in  ensuring  that roads, local  services  and
facilities can  cope  with added  demand.
Policy IN 1
Infrastructure
1. Infrastructure delivery  will take place  in a phased  co-ordinated manner  guided  by the
Infrastructure Delivery  Plan and  any additional site specific requirements to support the
Local  Plan Strategy proposals. These will  include  mechanisms  for the funding and  delivery
of physical, social, community, environmental and any other infrastructure required to support
development and  regeneration. The Infrastructure Delivery  Plan will  be kept under  review
and if necessary  revised  as and when  required. Cheshire  East Council  is working  in
partnership with infrastructure providers  and other delivery  agencies  to provide  essential
infrastructure to deliver  the Local  Plan.
2. The council  will also  require  new  and improved  social  and community facilities, utilities
infrastructure and  other infrastructure to be  provided  in a timely manner  to meet the needs
of new development as they arise so as to make  a positive contribution towards safeguarding
and creating sustainable communities, promote social  inclusion  and reduce  deprivation.
3. The Community Infrastructure Levy  (CIL), upon  adoption of the Charging  Schedule, will  be
used to pool developer contributions towards local and strategic infrastructure that will serve
a wider  area  than any  one development in  particular. Further information is  set out in  Policy
IN 2 'Developer Contributions'.
Justification
10.3 The term 'infrastructure' is  broadly  used  for planning  purposes  to cover  all the service
requirements that are  needed  to make  places  function efficiently and  effectively and  in a way  that
creates sustainable communities. Infrastructure is  commonly  split into three main  categories, defined
as:
1. Physical: the broad  collection of systems and  facilities that house  and transport people  and
goods, and  provide  services  including:
Transportation networks -  including  public  transport, road  networks, provisions  for walking
and cycling;
Water -  including  wastewater treatment and  water supply, including  fire hydrants;
Flood risk  management;
Energy -  including  heat, gas, electricity;
Telecommunications networks -  telephones, mobile  phones, broadband  and other new
communication technologies;
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 88
 InfrastructureWaste provision  - including  domestic waste and  recycling, commercial  and construction
waste;
Public realm  - street lighting, seating, planting.
2. Green: the physical  environment within and  between our  cities, towns and  villages. A network
of multi-functional open  spaces  including  formal parks, gardens, woodlands, green  corridors,
waterways and  open  countryside.
 
3. Social and  Community: the range  of core  learning, well-being, sports and  other activities. It can
include  the provision  of:
Health facilities -  including  hospitals, doctors and  dentists surgeries;
Social care;
Education -  including  schools, colleges  and skills  training
Social and  community facilities -  including  places  of worship, community centres, support
for community groups  and projects;
Leisure  facilities -  indoor  and outdoor, including  sports pitches and  changing  facilities;
Cultural facilities -  including  libraries, museums, theatres and  heritage.
10.4 Improvements to infrastructure will be fundamental to achieving the vision for the development
of Cheshire  East up  to 2030  and are necessary  to deal  with existing deficiencies and  to cater for a
growing  and  ageing  population. The proposed  growth of Cheshire  East must be  supported by
improvements to physical, social  and green  infrastructure.
10.5 Improved connectivity forms a vital part of the Local Plan Strategy in terms of assisting economic
growth and  improving  the environment. As well  as maximising  the benefits of Crewe  as a national
rail hub, substantial new  road  infrastructure will  be required  to open  up the east of Cheshire  and
better connect the M6  with main settlements and surrounding major  roads. At this stage, only corridors
of interest or  preferred routes for new  roads  are indicated. Detailed alignments will  be included  in the
Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
10.6 It should  be recognised  that the delivery  of the full range  of infrastructure needs  of existing
and new  communities is  dependent on  partnership working  between a  variety of public  and private
sector agencies. Throughout the preparation of the Local Plan Strategy, discussions have taken place
with key  infrastructure delivery  partners and  will continue to take place  through the production of the
Local  Plan.
10.7 Where new  development creates a  need  for new  or improved  infrastructure, contributions
from developers  will be sought to make  the development acceptable on  the impact on  local  services.
10.8 The infrastructure requirements of development proposals  will be assessed  on their own
individual  merits; but in  some  circumstances there will  be a necessity to view  individual  applications
collectively in  assessing  the combined  off site requirements in  line with the Infrastructure Delivery
Plan.
10.9 Strategic infrastructure requirements are  set out in  the Local  Plan Strategy and  in the
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Whilst particular infrastructure needs have been identified, it is recognised
that there needs  to be  flexibility to allow  the council  to seek  developer  contributions through Section
106 agreements and  other mechanisms  for infrastructure needs  that emerge  during  the plan  period.
10.10 The council  intends to locally  introduce the Community Infrastructure Levy  (CIL) approach
to Developer  Contributions. The Levy  will partly replace  Section 106  provisions  and is a charge  based
on the floor area  of new  developments. The charge  rates will  be set out in  a Charging  Schedule which
will be implemented after the adoption of the Local  Plan Strategy.

Developer Contributions
1. Developer  contributions will  be sought to make  sure  that the necessary  physical, social,
public  realm, economic  and green  infrastructure is  in place  to deliver  development.
Contributions will  be used  to mitigate the adverse  impacts of development (including  any
cumulative impact). Such contributions will help facilitate the infrastructure needed to support
sustainable development.
2. Development proposals  will be expected to provide  a contribution towards the cost of
infrastructure. Subject to statutory processes and regulations, contributions may be  collected
towards:
i. Initial costs, e.g. design  and development work  and pump  priming  of projects or
programmes;
ii. Capital costs;
iii. Ongoing revenue  such  as the management and  maintenance of services  and facilities;
iv. Any other infrastructure related costs permitted by  law and identified as  a local  need;
v. Contributions will  be collected through Section 106  agreements and  / or through a
Community Infrastructure Levy  once  a Charging  Schedule is  in place; and
vi. Until a  Charging  Schedule is  in place, contributions from Section 106  agreements may
be pooled  to meet the costs of strategic infrastructure, where  this meets the legal  tests
as set out in  the Community Infrastructure Levy  Regulations. Once the Charging
Schedule is  in place, Section 106  agreements will  continue to be  used  for site specific
costs and  affordable housing.
Justification
10.11  Any Section 106  planning  obligations can  only be taken into account in  determining planning
applications where  they meet the following tests from Regulation 122  of the CIL Regulations 2010:
Necessary  to make  the development acceptable in  planning  terms;
Directly related to the development; and
Fairly and  reasonably  related in  scale  and kind  to the development.
10.12 Developer contributions secured through planning obligations are no longer able to be pooled
from more  than five different obligations to deliver  the provision  of a  certain project or  type of
infrastructure. This restriction, from Regulation 123 of the CIL Regulations 2010, is intended to ensure
that local  planning  authorities use  CIL instead of planning  obligations to secure  contributions for
infrastructure that serves  a wider  area  than just the specific development site or  group  of sites.
10.13 The Community Infrastructure Levy  (CIL), upon  adoption of the Charging  Schedule, will  be
used  to pool  developer  contributions towards local  and strategic infrastructure that will  serve  a wider
area than any  one development in  particular.
10.14 The CIL is  a locally  set standard charge  that can  be applied  to new  development to fund
infrastructure. It is  calculated in  £ per sq m of new  buildings  or extensions and  is based  on the fact
that the value  of land  or property typically rises  as a result of development. Whilst the charge  can be
varied  by area  and type of development on  the basis  of viability evidence, there are  no other reasons
for setting differential CIL charges.
10.15 Cheshire  East Council  have  identified, in  an Infrastructure Delivery  Plan, what strategic
infrastructure is  needed  to support the amount and  distribution of growth proposed  in the Local  Plan
Strategy, and  how  much  it will  cost, including  the funding shortfall identified after taking account of
already  committed funding. Before developer  contributions can  be sought through CIL to make  up at
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 90
 Infrastructureleast part of this shortfall, a  Levy  Charging  Schedule will  be published, consulted on, examined  and
adopted, establishing a  Levy  Charge.
10.16 CIL may be used to fund the provision, improvement, replacement, operation or  maintenance
of infrastructure that arises  as a result of increased  development related demand. The following types
of infrastructure may  be considered  for funding through CIL, although the list is  not exhaustive. These
are:
a. Roads  and other transport facilities;
b. Flood defences;
c. Schools and  other educational facilities;
d. Improvements to public  realm;
e. Medical  facilities;
f. Sporting and  recreational facilities;
g. Open spaces.
10.17 The provision  of affordable housing  or financial contributions towards affordable housing
cannot currently be  secured  through CIL. Such contributions are  secured  through S106 agreements.
10.18 Work  on the Cheshire  East CIL will  commence  following the adoption of the Local  Plan
Strategy or  sooner  if considered  appropriate. It is  expected that at this stage, the council  will have  a
greater understanding of the infrastructure requirements for Cheshire  East.
10.19 The government has  stated that parish  councils  can receive  15%  of CIL payments, capped
at £100 per dwelling. This is raised to an uncapped 25% where  the parish council has a Neighbourhood
Plan. The money is  paid directly to the parish council, to be spent on  community infrastructure projects
of their choosing.

11.1 The Cheshire  East economy  is already  the most successful in  the North of England. This
Local  Plan Strategy will  ensure  the right foundations are  in place  to sustain this success  over  the
next twenty years.
11.2 The vision  for economic  growth is  encapsulated with the vision  of ‘East Cheshire, Engine of
the North’. This strategic framework builds  on the existing asset base  and sets out a  growth plan  over
the plan  period.
11.3 The vision  for economic  growth captures two concepts which  represent the diversity and
strength of the borough:
Crewe High Growth City/M6 Corridor –  a growth proposition for the south of the borough
centred around Crewe as  a Principal Town but linking to a  wider set  of growth ‘nodes’
using the M6  Corridor as  a key attractor and asset  to support our ambition.
North Cheshire Science Corridor  -  to secure North East Cheshire as  a location of national
and global significance for advanced scientific analysis and research, particularly
pharmaceuticals R&D, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, radio-astrophysics and astronomy.
 
Crewe: High Growth City
11.4 As the largest town in  South Cheshire, Crewe  is already  the area’s  primary  population centre
and its major  economic  hub. Its 5,000 businesses  include  concentrations of professional services,
distribution, logistics and  advanced  engineering  built on  its rich  rail and automotive heritage. It is
located in  not only  one of the most prosperous  parts of the region  but the best connected, creating
the perfect location for job  creation, growth and  development.
11.5 The jobs-led  vision  encapsulated by  this Local  Plan Strategy provides  the opportunity for
decentralisation of the economy  outside of London  and the South East, creating a  ‘hub’  of investment
in science, automotive and  rail engineering. The recent £1  billion  investment announced  by Bentley
Motors secures  Crewe’s  place  as a premier  location for excellence  in manufacturing and  engineering.
11.6 Linked  by the M6  Growth Corridor, expansion  of employment land  in Congleton will  lead  to
future investment in  the bedrock  of manufacturing and  engineering  which  is key to the town’s  heritage
and future prosperity.  Major  investment in  infrastructure in  Congleton via  a new  link road  is also
proposed  alongside  the expansion  of employment space  and new  housing  development.
North Cheshire Science Corridor
11.7 North East Cheshire, as  part of a  wider  North West Science & Technology  cluster, has  the
potential to become  a UK lead  specifically to aid  commercialisation of innovation in  the ‘Key
Enabling’(39), 'Great Eight'(40) and  ‘Health-Science’ technology fields. The area  is host to a  net
concentration of globally  significant companies  which  represent a  hotbed of intellectual capacity and
entrepreneurship. Cheshire  East has  particularly high  levels  of R&D activities within Great Britain,
with Cheshire  East accounting for 36.9% of the region’s  R&D jobs  and 3.3% of the country’s  (GB)
R&D jobs.(41)
39 The ‘Key Enabling Technologies’  are: ‘Advanced Materials’, ‘Biosciences’, ‘Electronics, Sensors and  Photonics’, and
‘Information and  Communication Technology  (ICT)’. See: Enabling Technologies  Strategy, Technology  Strategy
Board.

 Enterprise and Growth11.8 This success is founded on an outstanding track record of creating and building new businesses
and attracting investment in  a high  quality environment with the advantage of global  connectivity,
both physical  and digital.  The focus of the council  and this Local  Plan Strategy will  be to nurture and
strengthen our science  and technology base to create a Super-Hub of global companies and  a growing
base  of SMEs for north Cheshire.  Our vision is that by 2030, the North East Cheshire Science Corridor
will sit clearly  within a  flourishing science  and technology ecosystem spanning  across  Cheshire  and
Warrington.
11.9 There will  be a Super-Hub of global  companies  and a growing  base  of SMEs delivering  a
dynamic  model  of open  innovation and  growth from high  quality and  well connected locations.
11.10 With globally  significant companies  working  alongside  world-leading  research  institutions,
there will  be an established network of innovation in  science  and  technology, underpinned  by
revolutionary and  innovative finance tools to promote a  growing  base  of enterprising and  high  growth
SMEs.
11.11  At the heart of this hotbed of science  and technology will  be a continually high-skilled  and
entrepreneurial workforce, nurtured through a network of leading research institutions and specialised
education facilities.
11.12 The Local Plan Strategy provides a vital tool to interpret our wider vision into a spatial planning
framework, which  will be complemented by  a wider  investment strategy and  delivery  plan  for the
borough.
11.13 The Local  Plan Strategy will  support delivery  of the Economic Growth vision  by:
Providing the right sites in the right locations with the right infrastructure, enhanced by the highest
quality of life –  to attract the best talent.
Increasing the supply  of business  incubation, including  premises  and targeted business  support
– making  best use  of existing employment sites and  brownfield development in  town centres.
Maximising  the potential of major  employment sites such  as Alderley Park and  Hurdsfield to
create the conditions for open  innovation and  science-led  collaborations.
Ensure a  housing  offer of the highest quality providing  a major  incentive for a  highly  qualified
workforce to live  and locate in  the area.
Create stronger public  transport and  wider  connectivity linked  to Manchester Airport, the M6
corridor  and the Manchester conurbation.
Protect and  improve  the quality of the environment, to provide  the wider  quality of life factors
required.
11.14 Across the borough  there is  a need  for sustainable, jobs  led growth, in  conjunction with
planning  ahead  to 2030  and beyond; additional opportunities for growth will  be assessed  as they
arise. It is  anticipated that the majority of future employment growth opportunities will  be to the south
of the borough, with the north exhibiting distinct trends in  science  and service  sector growth. As a
result, we  do not support high  levels  of housing  growth to the north of the borough.

Enterprise and GrowthEconomic Prosperity
11.15 Cheshire  East's economy  is characterised by  a broad  range  of industries and  services, with
particular strengths in  pharmaceuticals, financial businesses  and advanced  engineering, whilst the
rural nature of the borough  is reflected in  the relatively high  number  of people  employed  in agriculture
and tourism.
Policy EG 1
Economic Prosperity
1. Proposals for employment development (Use  Classes  B1, B2 or  B8) will  be supported in
principle  within the Principal Towns, Key Service Centres and  Local  Service Centres as
well as on employment land  allocated in  the Development Plan.
2. Proposals for employment development on non-allocated employment sites will be supported
where  they are  in the right location and  support the strategy, role  and function of the town,
as identified in  Settlement Hierarchy, Spatial Distribution of Development and  in any future
plans, including  Neighbourhood  Plans, where  applicable.
 
Justification
11.16 The National Planning Policy Framework states that " to help  achieve  economic  growth, local
planning  authorities should  plan  proactively to meet the development needs  of business  and support
an economy  fit for the 21st Century ".
11.17 Cheshire  East's employment policy  seeks  to encourage  growth in  the borough  and secure
a greater number  of jobs  for its resident workforce. The Cheshire  East Local  Plan will  be focused on
delivering  growth, including  ensuring  that there is  an appropriate balance  between jobs, services  and
facilities and  homes, creating a  more  sustainable pattern of development in  the borough.
11.18 Policy EG 1  supports the delivery  of opportunities for the provision  of employment land  that
may come forward in the Principal Towns, Key Service Centres and Local Service Centres, in addition
to the employment land  that is  allocated in  the Local  Plan Strategy. This policy  will contribute to the
achievement of the strategic objective to promote economic  prosperity by  creating conditions for
business  growth. The potential for employment growth in  the visitor economy  is dealt with in  Policy
EG 4  'Tourism'.

Rural Economy
Outside the Principal Towns, Key Service Centres and  Local  Service Centres, developments
that:
1. Provide opportunities for local  rural  employment development that supports the vitality of
rural settlements;
2. Create or  extend rural  based  tourist attractions, visitor facilities and  recreational uses;
3. Encourage the retention and  expansion  of existing businesses, particularly through the
conversion  of existing buildings  and farm diversification;
4. Encourage the creation and  expansion  of sustainable farming and  food production
businesses  and allow  for the adaption of modern  agricultural practises;
5. Are considered  essential to the wider  strategic interest of the economic  development of
Cheshire  East, as  determined by  the council; or
6. Support the retention and  delivery  of community services  such  as shops  and public  houses,
and village  halls
Will be  supported where  the development:
i. Meets sustainable development objectives as  set out in  policies  MP 1, SD 1  and SD 2  of
the Local  Plan Strategy;
ii. Supports the rural  economy, and  could  not reasonably  be expected to locate within a
designated centre by  reason  of their products sold(42);
iii. Would  not undermine  the delivery  of strategic employment allocations;
iv. Is supported by  adequate infrastructure;
v. Is consistent in  scale  with its location and  does  not adversely  affect nearby  buildings  and
the surrounding  area  or detract from residential amenity;
vi. Is well  sited and  designed  in order  to conserve  and where  possible  enhance  the character
and quality of the landscape  and built form; and
vii. Does  not conflict with Policies PG 3, PG 4, PG 6, PG 7, SE 3, SE 4, SE 5, SE 6  and SE 7
of the Local  Plan Strategy.
 
Justification
11.19 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning policies  should  support
economic  growth in  rural  areas  in order  to create jobs  and prosperity by  taking a  positive approach
to sustainable new  development '.
11.20 The rural  economy  provides  a wide  range  of important goods  and services, including  clean
water, biodiversity, recreational space and opportunities, food energy and carbon management. Rural
land is a vital resource  for mitigating and  adapting to the various  challenges  of climate change, such
as drought and  flooding. The countryside is  also  home  to settlements and  communities, where
economic  activities include  agriculture and  other farm based  industries, as  well  as businesses
associated with countryside pursuits, including  rural  tourism and  leisure. Beyond farming, the rural
economy  in Cheshire  East supports many  businesses, including  wholesale  and retail trade, repairs,
manufacturing, health and  social  work, horse-related enterprises (breeding, training and  livery)  and
real estate, renting and  business  activities.

Policy EG 3
Existing and Allocated Employment Sites
1. Existing employment sites will  be protected for employment use  unless:
i. Premises are  causing  significant nuisance  or environmental problems  that could  not
be mitigated; or
ii. The site is  no longer  suitable or  viable  for employment use; and
a. There is  no potential for modernisation or  alternate employment uses; and
b. No other occupiers  can be found(43).
2. Where it can  be demonstrated that there is  a case  for alternative development on  existing
employment sites, these will  be expected to meet sustainable development objectives as
set out in  Policies MP 1, SD 1  and SD 2  of the Local  Plan Strategy. All opportunities must
be explored  to incorporate an  element of employment development as  part of a  mixed  use
scheme.
3. Subject to regular  review, allocated employment sites will  be protected for employment use
in order  to maintain an  adequate and  flexible supply  of employment land  to attract new  and
innovative businesses, to enable  existing businesses  to grow  and to create new  and retain
existing jobs.
 
Justification
11.22 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'policies should  avoid  the long  term
protection of sites allocated for employment use  where  there is  no reasonable  prospect of a  site being
used  for that purpose' .
11.23 In order  to provide  a range  of employment sites, particularly for inward  investment and  limit
the need  for development on  greenfield land, it is  vital that existing employment sites, premises  and
allocations that are  viable  for continued employment use  are safeguarded. This will  make  sure  that
job opportunities are  maintained and  the economic  health of the borough  is protected. The release
of viable  employment sites or  premises  to other uses  may  only  be made  where  their loss  would  not
cause  harm  to business  or employment opportunities, or  where  there are  unacceptable amenity
impacts for local  residents.
11.24 For clarification, this policy  applies  to all  sites currently in  use for employment purposes  (B1,
B2 and  B8 uses  in the Use  Classes  Order) as  well as sites allocated for such  uses.
11.25 There are  already  a number  of key  employment areas  in the borough, including  Alderley
Park, Hurdsfield Industrial Estate, Bentley Motors, Radbroke  Hall, Jodrell  Bank, Booths Hall  and
43 To demonstrate that no  other occupiers  can be found, the site should  be marketed at a  realistic price  reflecting its
employment status for a  period  of not less  than 2  years. The council  will require  evidence  that a  proper  marketing
exercise  has been  carried  out including  a record  of all  offers and  expressions  of interest received.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 98
 Enterprise and GrowthMidpoint 18. These are  of particular significance to the economy  in Cheshire  East, collectively
employing  over  13,000 personnel. The following provides  an overview  of their contribution to the
borough's strong economic  base  together with additional key  sites that form part of the borough's
employment land  portfolio:
Alderley Park - Currently AstraZeneca’s  largest research  facility and  the company’s  global
centre for cancer  research. A development framework has  been  developed. The objective of
this document is  to maximise  the employment potential of the site to deliver  a life science  vision,
and also  to look  at wider  uses  for all  aspects of the site, which  would  meet community/local
need.
Hurdsfield Industrial Estate, Macclesfield - As the largest traditional industrial estate in
Cheshire  East, it is  home  to a number  of major  multinational companies, including  AstraZeneca
and BASF Performance Products Ltd. This industrial estate accommodates an  important
concentration of activity. Work  is ongoing  to maximise  the employment uses  and land  uses  on
the Hurdsfield Estate, to ensure  it plays  its role  in delivering  our economic  vision  for the borough
and create growth opportunities for local and new  companies seeking to locate in North Cheshire.
Bentley Motors, Crewe  - This is  the town's largest private sector employer, currently employing
3,500 people. As the company’s UK headquarters, the site is home to all  aspects of car production
from design, engineering, manufacturing, quality, and  sales  and marketing. Following an
announcement in  July 2013  of an  £800m  investment by  the company  to manufacture its new
Sport Utility Vehicle, plans  for significant growth at the site are  expected alongside  the creation
of 1,000 new  jobs. With advanced  manufacturing accounting for 12.3%(44) of employment in
Cheshire  East, the Bentley site is  at the centre of this growing  sector, and  is responsible  for a
growing  supply  chain  in the nearby  area.
Radbroke Hall, Knutsford  - The site currently accommodates the UK Strategic Centre for
Barclays Bank Plc and  is home  to the Global Infrastructure and  Service Delivery  Teams. The
site is at the forefront of a growing IT and financial / insurance service industry, of which Cheshire
East has  a higher  concentration than in  the North West region  as a whole.
Jodrell Bank, Holmes Chapel  - prominently located in  the heart of Cheshire  East this is  a
unique  site, which  is of both historical and  scientific significance as  a leading  facility for radio
astrophysics and  scientific research  in the UK.  The Discovery  Centre also  offers an  important
contribution to the Cheshire  East visitor economy. The site is  also  on the UK National Shortlist
for UNESCO in  a bid for World  Heritage Status due  to its potential outstanding universal  value.
Booths Hall, Knutsford  - Booths Hall  combines  an 85 hectare parkland  setting with flexible,
high quality office accommodation, which  is home  to a growing  number  of small  high  growth,
high tech companies  and major  multinationals. The site offers a  quality employment location in
the heart of Cheshire, with good  links  into public  transport and  road/rail links. The park  is a major
contributor to Knutsford and  the wider  regional  economy  with many  leading  international and
knowledge-based  businesses  located there. 80%  of the existing occupiers  operate in  Cheshire
East's growth sectors.
Midpoint 18, Middlewich  - This is a mixed use business park currently home to major companies
such  as Wincanton and  Kuehne + Nagel. The current development footprint provides  128,130
square metres of mixed employment use, including office, distribution, and manufacturing space.
Crewe Green Business Park, Crewe -  This is  the largest business  park  in Crewe; it is  over  27
hectares and  accommodates employers  such  as Air Products, Busch GVT, Wulvern  Housing
and DEFRA. Crewe  Green Business Park, and  Crewe  Gates and  Weston Road  industrial areas
are adjacent to each other and form together a diverse, influential and important area of economic
activity.
Crewe Gates Industrial Estate, Crewe -  The largest industrial area  within the largest town in
Cheshire  East. Employers located here  include  Expert Logistics, JTI UK, 20:20 Mobile  and
Bargain Booze Headquarters.
Waters  Corporation, Wilmslow -  Waters Corporation have  recently completed the construction
of a mass  spectrometry headquarters located at the 15  hectare Stamford Lodge  site. This facility
44 2011  Census.
99 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Enterprise and Growthwill provide  employment to over  500 employees  committed to the support and  development of
mass  spectrometry systems. Waters is  a world  leader  in this field of scientific innovation.
Sanofi Aventis, Holmes Chapel -  Sanofi is  a global  integrated healthcare leader  in the
pharmaceutical industry. The site, prominently located on the edge of Holmes Chapel, is a centre
of excellence  for the manufacture of inhalation products for the worldwide  market.
11.26 Whilst the Local  Plan Strategy seeks  to retain these key  employment areas, it also  provides
opportunities for further inward  investment at other established locations such  as Radway  Green,
Congleton Business Park, Radnor  Park Trading  Estate and  others. The Local  Plan Strategy also
seeks to unlock major new employment sites including Basford East and West and other developments
to meet both latent demand  and future projected growth. A range  of employment sites are  allocated
around Crewe and in the south of the borough to facilitate economic growth and deliver the aspirations
set out by  'All Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City'.

Tourism
11.27 Nationally, tourism generates £90  billion  of direct spending, provides  1.36 million  jobs  and
is the fifth or sixth biggest sector of the UK economy  in most years. The visitor economy is an important
contributor to businesses  and communities in  Cheshire  East, bringing  13.2 million  visitors to the
borough  each  year, generating around  £700m  a year  for the local  economy  and employing  about
10,000 people, with food and  drink, accommodation and  shopping  accounting for most of these jobs
(45). The rich  and varied  natural and  historic environment, and  the beauty and  character of the wider
countryside, plays  a vital role  in the visitor economy  of Cheshire  East. These borough-wide  assets
will be protected and  where  possible, enhanced  to help  drive  the visitor economy  as well as for their
own sake. As part of the plan  for growth it is  important that the visitor economy  is able  to maximise
its contribution to the economy, employment and  quality of life of Cheshire  East.

Tourism
1. The Local  Plan Strategy will  protect and  enhance  the unique  features of Cheshire  East that
attract visitors to the area, including  their settings, whilst encouraging  investment. This will
be achieved  through:
i. The protection of Cheshire  East's tourist assets, such  as Tatton Park, Quarry Bank
Mill, Little Moreton Hall, Macclesfield Silk Museum, Jodrell  Bank, the Peak District
National Park (adjoining the plan area), Alderley Edge, the Gritstone Trail, Tegg’s Nose
Country Park, Sandstone Ridge and the waterways that support appropriate sustainable
tourist related development;
ii. Protecting visitor attraction sites;
iii. Promoting the enhancement and  expansion  of existing visitor attractions and  tourist
accommodation, and  the provision  of new  visitor and  tourism facilities, in  sustainable
and appropriate locations;
iv. Encouraging sustainable transport to tourist and  cultural sites;
v. Encouraging and  promoting opportunities for new  tourist attractions in  the historic and
natural environment in  sustainable and  appropriate locations; and
vi. Improving access  to our  natural and  historic landscapes  through enhancing  our vital
public  rights of way  network
2. Proposals for tourist development of an  appropriate scale, including  attractions and  tourist
accommodation, will  be supported within the Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres.
3. Proposals for tourist development outside the Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres
will be supported where:
i. Either:
a. They are  located within a  Local  Service Centre; or
b. They are  located within an  existing or  replacement building; or
c. There is  evidence  that the facilities are  required  in conjunction with a  particular
countryside attraction;
ii. And:
a. The scale, design  and use of the proposal  is compatible with its wider  landscape
or townscape setting and  would  not detract from the character or  appearance  of
the area; and
b. It would  not be  detrimental to the amenities of residential areas; and
c. The proposals  are served  by adequate access  and infrastructure; and
d. The site has  access  to local  services  and employment.
Justification
11.28 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local  Plans should  'support sustainable
rural tourism and  leisure  developments that benefit businesses  in rural  areas, communities and
visitors, and  which  respect the character of the countryside' .
11.29 The National Planning Policy Framework supports this agenda  through a  range  of policy
directives to support:
Sustainable rural  tourism;
101 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Enterprise and GrowthCompetitive town centres;
Sustainable transport;
High quality design;
Inclusive communities;
Enhancement of the natural environment; and
Enjoyment of the historic environment.
11.30 Together these policies  underpin  the Cheshire  East approach  to sustainable tourism and
our ambition is to maximise its contribution to the economy, employment and quality of life in Cheshire
East.
11.31 The visitor economy covers a wide range of activities across a variety of themes and locations
in Cheshire  East. Attractions such  as Tatton Park, Jodrell  Bank and  Little Moreton Hall  may  be
considered  visitor destinations in  their own  right; leisure  based  visits might cross  the borough  over  a
variety of canal, cycle  or public  footpath networks; and  culture and  recreational activities may  take
visitors to parks  and gardens, market towns, and  festivals across  the borough.
11.32 Visits to and  within the borough  generate economic  activity and  support jobs  and industries.
By maintaining and  improving  infrastructure associated with the visitor economy, including  green
infrastructure and  improvements to the rights of way  network, communities are  better able  to access
active leisure  opportunities and  participate in  the cultural and  social  life of the borough.
11.33 Enabling residents and visitors to access, understand and engage with the heritage, landscape
and cultural assets of the borough  promotes a  sense  of place  and pride  in communities that alongside
an attractive cultural, recreational and  leisure  offer, can  be effective in  attracting highly  skilled
individuals  and  businesses  to locate in  the area  and  may  contribute to long  term prosperity,
regeneration and  support for services.
11.34 Whilst it is  important to support our  visitor economy, it is  also  important to protect those
assets that make  the borough  attractive to visitors including  landscape, public  realm  and heritage. In
particular, it is  important to minimise  the impact generated by  tourism travel.
11.35 Planning has  a key role to play  in enabling  and encouraging  more  of our  10.3 million  day
visitors to stay longer  and spend  more  by:
supporting the industry to increase  the number  of overnight stays;
promoting good  design  in the built environment and  public  space;
protecting the quality of natural and  historic landscapes;
improving  the provision  of arts and  heritage; and
enhancing  the visitor experience  through improvements to the public  realm.

11.36 The council  advocates a  clear  'town centre first' approach  for its Principal Towns  and Key
Service Centres. It is  fully supportive of the government's aims  to promote the vitality and  viability of
town and  other centres as  important places  for communities.  They are  a major  focus for employment
and drivers  of economic  growth.

Cheshire  East's economic  prosperity and  the focus will  be on the continued development of the
centres as  commercial, retail, visitor and  leisure  hubs.
Policy EG 5
Promoting a  Town Centre First Approach to Retail and Commerce
1. The council  will support the following hierarchy  of retail centres in  Cheshire  East:
i. The Principal Towns will be the main focus for high quality comparison retail, supported
by a range  of retail, service, leisure, tourism, office and  other town centre-type uses,
including  residential.
ii. In the Key Service Centres, there will be a focus on the improvement of the convenience
and comparison  retail offer, with the potential to strengthen and  enhance  the retail
offer, where  suitable, as  well as diversification to other uses  such  as offices, services,
leisure, cultural and  residential, as  appropriate.
iii. In the Local  Service Centres, there will  be a focus on  convenience  and comparison
retailing of an  appropriate scale, plus  opportunities for service  uses  and small-scale
independent retailing of a  function and  character that meets the needs  of the local
community.
iv. In the other settlements and  rural  areas  of the borough, there will  be a focus on
providing  retail and  services  of appropriate scale  and nature to meet the needs  of the
local community.
2. Town  centres will  be promoted as  the primary  location for main  town centre uses  including
retail, leisure, cultural and  office development.
3. The use  of upper  floors in  town and  other centres for non-retail uses  will be supported,
where  appropriate.
4. The retention and  enhancement of the borough's markets will  be encouraged.
5. Small parades  of shops  will be protected where  they are  important to the day-to-day needs
of local  communities.
6. Proposals that help  develop  the evening  and night-time economy  in the Principal Towns
and Key Service Centres will  be supported, where  any negative impacts on  amenity are
addressed.
7. Proposals for main  town centre uses  should  be located within the designated town centres
or on other sites allocated for that particular type of development.  Where there are  no
suitable sites available, edge-of-centre locations must be  considered  prior  to out-of centre
locations.  Edge-of-centre and  out-of-centre proposals  will be considered  where:
i. there is  no significant adverse  impact on  the vitality and  viability of the surrounding
town centres; and
ii. it is demonstrated that the tests outlined in  current government guidance  can be
satisfied.
iii. The sequential approach  will not be  applied  to applications for small  scale  rural  offices
or other small  scale  rural  development in  line with the government guidance.
 
Justification
11.38 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning policies  should  be positive,
promote competitive town centre environments and  set out policies  for the management and  growth
of centres over  the plan  period'. It goes  on to state that 'local planning  authorities should:
103 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Enterprise and Growthrecognise  town centres as  the heart of their communities and  pursue  policies  to support their
viability and  vitality;
define a network and hierarchy of centres that is resilient to anticipated future economic changes;
promote competitive town centres that provide  customer choice  and a diverse  retail offer and
which  reflect the individuality of town centres;
set policies  for the consideration of proposals  for main  town centre uses  which  cannot be
accommodated in  or adjacent to town centres'.
11.39 It is important to determine appropriate policies  for retailing, focused on  town centres, as
they are  often a  central part of community identity and  contain the shops, services, pubs, restaurants,
leisure, entertainment and  other facilities that people  wish  to access  locally, as  well as businesses,
employment and  homes.  Town  centres are  generally  accessible  by a wide  range  of transport modes
and provide  the greatest opportunity for linked  trips. Proposals for leisure  facilities should  also  refer
to Policy SC 1  'Leisure and  Recreation' in  the Local  Plan Strategy.
11.40 The council  has developed  a retail hierarchy  of centres based  on the Determining Settlement
Hierarchy  Study.  The Study looks  at a  range  of factors to determine the role  and function of the
borough's settlements and  confirms their place  in the hierarchy, which  is made  up of Principal Towns,
Key Service Centres, Local  Service Centres and  other settlements.  This approach  defines where
new development is  best located in  the borough.
11.41 In order  to fully meet the identified needs  of the borough, suitable sites for main  town centre
uses  will be allocated in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document. 
11.42 Until they are  reviewed, the existing boundaries  and retail allocations will  remain  as they are
in the 'saved' policies  of the Congleton Borough Local  Plan First Review, the Borough of Crewe  &
Nantwich Replacement Local  Plan and  the Macclesfield Borough Local  Plan.
11.43 All town centre boundaries, Principal Shopping Areas and  primary  and secondary  frontages
will be defined in the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document, and shown on the Adopted
Policies Map.  Detailed policies  defining which  uses  will be permitted in  these locations will  also  be
included  in the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
11.44 The council  is keen  to preserve  and enhance  the vitality and  viability of its existing town
centres.  Therefore, it is  important to make  sure  that proposals  for town centre uses  located outside
of these town centres do  not have  a significant adverse  impact on  these existing centres.  These
impacts could  include  an increase  in the number  of vacant units and  a reduction in  turnover. More
information on  town centre impacts can  be found in  government guidance, but the council  will apply
the sequential test set out in  paragraph  26 of the NPPF when  determining retail applications with a
floorspace in  excess  of 2,500 square  metres.

12.1 Cheshire  East is  committed to meeting the needs  of its local  communities and  providing  the
infrastructure, services  and facilities required  to create sustainable and  stronger communities, whilst
recognising  that Cheshire  East covers  a large  geographical  area  and contains a  large  number  of
towns and  villages, each  with its own  local  character and  distinctiveness, which  must be  considered.
12.2 We also  want to put local  people  at the heart of decision  making  for their community and
provide  them with the ability to identify and  meet their own  needs, embracing  the spirit of localism.
12.3 The Local  Plan Strategy will  provide  a significant number  of new  homes  in all parts of the
borough, to 2030, to support economic  growth and  sustainable development. It will  make  sure  that
there is  an appropriate mix  of house  types, sizes  and tenures provided  across  the borough.
12.4 The council  also  faces challenges  in enabling  people  of all  ages  to make  provision  for their
own care  needs  wherever  possible. Good housing  is essential for achieving  this aim. Housing  should
be readily  adaptable in  the face of changes  in the circumstances of its occupiers. In addition, specific
provision  should  be made  to meet the diverse  needs  of the borough. This can  range  from bespoke
housing with an element of care, through to whole life housing, the obligation to build more bungalows
and positive encouragement for dependent relative annexes.
12.5 The Local  Plan Strategy will  strive for a  decent quality of life for all  residents and  will contribute
to the achievement of equality and  social  inclusion. It will  seek  to reduce  poverty and  to enable  older
people  to live  independently for longer  in order  to achieve  a better quality of life for all.  It will  seek  to
improve human health and  achieve a high quality of life by maximising opportunities to access facilities
and open  space  thereby encouraging  a healthy and  active lifestyle.
12.6 Cheshire East Council will work with infrastructure providers to make sure that the infrastructure
required  to support the community is  provided, including: local  health and  social  care  facilities; leisure
and community facilities; education; transport; broadband, mobile  and other ICT connectivity; water;
waste water; and  energy.
Leisure
12.7 Leisure  opportunities bring  together members  of a community who  work, live  and play  within
an area.
12.8 Leisure  and sports facilities and  green  spaces  such  as parks  and allotments can  help  to
enhance  everyone’s  life. Such provision  is important for residents' social, mental and  physical  health
and well-being  and to the achievement of sustainable communities.

assessment has  clearly  proven  them to be  surplus  to requirements to local  community
needs  or unless  alternative provision, of equivalent or  better quality, is  to be  made.
2. Support and  promote the provision  of better leisure, community and  recreation facilities,
where  there is  a need  for such  facilities, the proposed  facilities are  of a type and  scale
appropriate to the size  of the settlement, are  accessible  and support the objectives of the
Local  Plan Strategy. The council  will:
i. Encourage facilities that serve  the borough  as a whole, and  facilities that attract large
numbers  of people, to be  located, where  possible, within or  adjoining  Crewe  or
Macclesfield town centres;
ii. Require  facilities serving  Key Service Centres to be  located in  or adjacent to their town
centre or  highly  accessible  locations;
iii. Require  facilities intended to serve  the everyday  needs  of a community or
neighbourhood  to be  in or adjacent to the centres of Local  Service Centres or  other
settlements; and
iv. Encourage the development of shared  service  centres that combine  public  services,
health and  community functions in  modern  accessible  buildings.
3. Support proposals  for facilities that would  not be  appropriate to be  located in  or adjacent
to centres, provided  they are  highly  accessible  by a choice  of transport, do  not harm  the
character, amenity, or  biodiversity value  of the area, and  satisfy the following criteria:
i. The proposal  is a facility that:
a. supports a  business  use;
b. is appropriate in  an employment area; or
c. supports an outdoor sports facility, education or related community / visitor facility;
or
d. supports the visitor economy  and is based  on local  cultural or  existing visitor
attractions.
4. Work  with agencies, services  and businesses  responsible  for providing  facilities to make
sure that the needs  and demands  of communities are  met.
5. Make  sure  that appropriate developments contribute, through land  assembly  and financial
contributions, to new  or improved  facilities where  development will  increase  demand  and /
or there is  a recognised  shortage of local  leisure, community and  recreation facilities.(46)
Justification
12.9 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Planning Authorities should 'allocate
a range  of suitable sites to meet the scale  and type of  . . . leisure  . . . development needed  in town
centres. It is  important that needs  for . . . leisure  . . . are  met in  full' and 'deliver sufficient community
and cultural facilities and  services  to meet local  needs' .  The policy  covers  indoor  leisure, community
and recreation facilities.  Community halls  for example  can be a focus for indoor  recreation such  as

107 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Stronger Communitiesbowls  and exercise  classes. Policy SE 6  in the Sustainable Environment Chapter covers  outdoor
open  space  such  as parks  and allotments.
12.10 Major  facilities that attract a  large  number  of people  should  be sited in  accessible  locations,
and the council  will encourage  such  facilities to be  located within or  adjoining  the two principal  towns
of Crewe  and Macclesfield, where  this is  possible. If this is  not possible, other accessible  locations
include  town centres. Smaller facilities should  be located close  to existing centres where  possible,
or close to the communities they are serving. Where sites are not available in centres, other accessible
locations will  be acceptable subject to their impact on  surrounding  uses. Accessibility is  a critical
issue  for community facilities as  they are  used  by all groups, including  those without access  to a car
and those with restricted mobility. Young  people  and elderly  persons  can be disadvantaged in  terms
of accessibility to community facilities and therefore accessibility by public transport and  safe pedestrian
routes are  essential.
12.11  Focusing major  facilities in  town centres not only  ensures  good  standards of accessibility
but also  helps  to ensure  vibrant and  viable  town centres. Major  out-of-town centre leisure  facilities
are not encouraged, however, it is  accepted that some  facilities serve  a very  local  need  or will only
be viable  in locations outside centres. Consequently, the policy  seeks  to ensure  that their impact is
not harmful to the surrounding  area.
12.12 The council  will work  with other agencies  and the voluntary and  private sectors, to secure
more  and better facilities through joint working.  Shared centres where  public  health facilities, council
offices, libraries, police  and  other services  are in one  building  can  be cost-effective and  more
convenient for the public  and are, therefore, supported.
12.13 Although facilities may  become  surplus  to requirements based  on their current use, this may
allow  other leisure  and recreation needs  of local  communities to be  met through their re-use.

Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities
In order  to provide  appropriate sports facilities for the communities of Cheshire  East, the council
will:
1. Protect existing indoor  and outdoor sports facilities, unless:
Either:
i. They are  proven  to be  surplus  to need(47); or
ii. Improved alternative provision(48) will be created in  a location well  related to the
functional requirements of the relocated use  and its existing and  future users.
And in  all cases:
iii. The proposal  would  not result in  the loss  of an  area  important for its amenity or
contribution to the character of the area  in general; and
2. Support new  indoor  and outdoor sports facilities where:
i. They are  readily  accessible  by public  transport, walking  and cycling; and
ii. The proposed facilities are of a type and scale appropriate to the size  of the settlement;
and
iii. Where they are listed in an action plan in any emerging  or subsequently adopted Sports
Strategy.
3. Make  sure  that major  residential developments contribute, through land  assembly  and / or
financial contributions, to new  or improved  sports facilities where  development will  increase
demand  and/or there is  a recognised  shortage in  the locality that would  be exacerbated by
the increase  in demand  arising  from the development.
Justification
12.14 Publicly accessible  urban  open  space, play  and sports facilities all  have  a vital role  to play
in helping  to promote more  healthy lifestyles.
12.15 The existing outdoor and  built sports facilities of the borough  represent important assets
serving  the communities in  which  they are  located and  in some  instances the wider  area. This
importance relates to their function and  also  the amenity value  and the contribution these facilities
make  to providing  green  spaces  within the area.
12.16 Any proposal  affecting an  indoor  or outdoor sports facility will  be judged  in relation to any
emerging  or subsequently adopted Indoor Sports Strategy or  Playing Pitch Strategy.
12.17 The type and  scale  of development appropriate to a  settlement will  depend  upon  a number
of factors:
47 As identified in  an adopted and  up to date Needs  Assessment.

and Sport England policy.

The classification of the settlement within the settlement hierarchy;
The proximity of other settlements and  facilities; and
Accessibility and  infrastructure considerations, for example, traffic impact.
12.18 In terms of the development of appropriate facilities, this will  be determined through evidence
from the Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy process, other work  with the community
and sports bodies, to determine a  particular club  or community’s  needs.  The council  is expected to
introduce the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the balance between what monies are collected
between Section 106 agreements (S106) and CIL will  be part of this process.  The level of contributions
will be determined through the S106 and  CIL setting agenda.

Health and Well-Being
12.20 Health, well-being  and safety are  major  issues  on the local  and national agenda, and  are
closely  interrelated. Health is  about more  than access  to medical  treatment and  services. It is  about
lifestyle, including  routine exercise  and fitness for all  ages  and interests. It is  also  about living  in a
safe environment and feeling part of the community. The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment approach
to addressing  health issues  includes  these wider  determinants of health and  should  be used  to inform
planning.
12.21 The planning  system can  play  an important role  in facilitating social  interaction and  creating
safe, healthy and  inclusive  communities.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 110

Health and Well-Being
The council  and its partners will  create and  safeguard opportunities for safe, healthy, fulfilling
and active lifestyles by:
1. Working  in partnership with the health and  social  care  providers  to improve  health across
Cheshire  East and  reduce  inequalities;
2. Requiring  Screening or  Rapid  Impact Assessments as  part of the application process  on
all major  development proposals. This will  involve  a review  of the possible  health impacts
of a policy  or proposal. Screening should  include:
i. Who may  be affected by  the proposal;
ii. What determinants of health may  be affected; and
iii. What further evidence  is needed  to inform the recommendations.
Screening will  determine if a  full Health Impact Assessment is  required. The council  will
seek contributions towards new or enhanced health and social care facilities from developers
where  development results in  a shortfall or  worsening  of provision;
3. Ensuring new  developments provide  opportunities for healthy living  and improve  health and
well-being through the encouragement of walking  and cycling, good housing design (including
the minimisation of social isolation and creation of inclusive  communities), access to services,
sufficient open  space  and other green  infrastructure, and  sports facilities and  opportunity
for recreation and  sound  safety standards;
4. Improving education and  skills  training and  encouraging  life-long learning;
5. Protecting existing community infrastructure and  ensuring  the provision  of a network of
community facilities, providing  essential public  services  together with private and  voluntary
sector facilities, to meet the needs  of the local  community;
6. Ensuring all  development is  designed  to create safe environments by:
i. Ensuring the natural surveillance  of streets and  public  spaces;
ii. Providing convenient, well  designed, all  weather, safe access  and movement routes
for all;
iii. Promoting activity that is  appropriate to the area, by  encouraging  a diversity of uses
(where  appropriate) to extend activity to ensure  the safe use  of spaces  during  the day
and night;
iv. Encourage green  spaces  and play  areas  to be  located away  from main  roads;
v. Creating a  sense  of ownership  by providing  a clear  definition between public  and
private realm;
vi. Ensuring security measures  are sympathetically incorporated into the design;
vii. Ensuring the layout and  use of new  developments are  appropriate and  compatible
with an  area. Any new  open  space  should  be well defined, flexible and  purposeful;
and
viii. Strongly encouraging  the reuse  of vacant and  derelict buildings  and spaces;
7. Promoting the role  of communal  growing  spaces  including  allotments, garden  plots within
developments, small  scale  agriculture and  farmers' markets in  providing  access  to healthy,
affordable, locally  produced  food options.
Justification
12.22 The Health and  Social Care  Act 2012  places  a duty upon  local  authorities to take such  steps
as it considers  appropriate for improving  the health of the people  in its area.
111 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Stronger Communities12.23 One of the Core  Principles of the National Planning Policy Framework states that planning
should  'take account of and  support local  strategies to improve  health, social  and cultural wellbeing
for all, and  deliver  sufficient community and  cultural facilities and  services  to meet local  needs' .
12.24 Life expectancy in  Cheshire  East is  higher  than regional  (North West) and  the national
(England) averages.  Life expectancy at birth for females is  83.3 years, compared  to 81.5 years  in
the North West and  82.9 years  nationally. Life expectancy at birth for males  is 80.1 years, compared
to 77.4 in  the North West and  78.9 nationally(49). However, there are  pockets of poor  health: there is
a gap of around  10 years  in male  life expectancy and  nearly  15 years  for female life expectancy
between some  of the local  areas  within Cheshire  East(50).
12.25 Population projections produced  by the Office for National Statistics and  locally  produced
population forecasts produced  for the Local  Plan both suggest that the number  of people  aged  65
years  and over  will continue to increase, with those aged  85 years  and over  likely  to increase  at the
fastest rate.  This is  partly due  to increased  longevity, but is  also  a consequence  of the age  structure
of the population and  in particular the ageing  of the large  number  of people  born  during  the post World
War 2 baby  boom.
12.26 Having  timely and  easy  access  to a range  of health and  social  care  services  and community
infrastructure is  a key issue  for local  people  and creating opportunities for healthier and  more  active
lifestyles is  part of evolving  national policy. The Joint Strategic Needs  Assessment highlights that
'adult participation in  physical  activity, as  measured  through sport and  active recreation, in  Cheshire
East is generally similar to the national average, whilst activity rates are lowest in Crewe and Nantwich
and highest in  Macclesfield. Physical activity is  important in  childhood  to support healthy growth and
development, psychological  well-being  and social  interaction. Obesity in  childhood  can lead  to risks
of coronary  heart disease, strokes and  poor  mental health in  later life, all  causes  of premature death.
Across Cheshire  East, 8.2 per  cent of all  children  were  obese  in 2010  although this is  less than the
national average  (9.6 per  cent)' (51).
12.27 Encouraging residents to live a healthy lifestyle involves the provision of facilities to encourage
regular  exercise, maximising  the opportunities provided  by the natural landscape  of the borough  to
improve  their health.  The Public Health Outcomes Framework for England (2013)  sets the context
for local  areas  to decide  what public  health interventions they will  make. It sets out two overarching
outcomes:
i. Increased life expectancy; and
ii. Reduced  differences in  life expectancy and  healthy life expectancy between communities.
12.28 Section 17  of the Crime  and  Disorder  Act 1998  requires  local  authorities to do  all they
reasonably  can to prevent crime  and disorder  and stipulates that the prevention of crime  and the
enhancement of community safety are  matters that a  local  planning  authority should  consider  in its
plans  and decisions. Crime  and the fear of crime  have  a great impact on  quality of life and  general
well-being, meaning  that designing  high  quality and  safe developments is  an important aspect of
creating places  where  people  want to live, work  and play.  A contributory factor to improving  safety
is to create and  sustain a  ‘sense  of place’, where  people  take pride  in their surroundings. It will  also
be important to ensure  that new  developments are  designed  to a high  standard and  incorporate the
key principles  of good  design  as set out in  ‘By Design’  (DETR 2000). The production of a  Design  and
Access Statement is  an important part of development proposals  (see  Policy SE 1  'Design'). 
Developers  should  request Crime  Impact Statements (CIS) from their relevant Police Crime
Commissioner  body  (PCC) to assist with the completion of the 'safer communities' section of the
Design  and Access Statement.
12.29 Any future Cheshire  East Council  policy  on Health Impact Assessments will  set out when  a
HIA is  required  in relation to new  development.  This policy  (SC 3)  will then be  applied  to new
development in  relation to Criterion 2.

Residential Mix
12.30 A neighbourhood  with a  mix of housing  tenures, types and  sizes  will be more  able  to meet
the changing  needs  and aspirations of its residents, through changing  life stages, household  shapes
and sizes  or changes  in income. Providing greater housing  choice  increases  the opportunities for
households  to remain  within their communities and  promotes social  equality and  inclusion  by easing
geographical  constraints on  the search  for appropriate homes.
Policy SC 4
Residential Mix
1. New residential development should  maintain, provide  or contribute to a  mix of housing
tenures, types and  sizes  to help  support the creation of mixed, balanced  and inclusive
communities. This could  include  Key Worker  Housing  and people  wishing  to build  or
commission  their own  home.
2. To meet the needs  arising  from the increasing  longevity of the borough’s  older  residents,
the council  will require  developers  to demonstrate how  their proposal  will be capable  of
meeting, and  adapting to, the long  term needs  of this specific group  of people. This would
include  the provision  of a variety of dwelling  types and  other measures  to support Health
and Wellbeing  and independent living  through new  developments that recognise  the needs
of older people, those with dementia and other vulnerable people; this will include developing
dementia-friendly communities.
3. Development proposals  for accommodation designed  specifically for the elderly  and people
who require  specialist accommodation will  be supported where  there is  a proven  need; they
are located within settlements; accessible  by public  transport; and  within a  reasonable
walking  distance of community facilities such  as shops, medical  services  and public  open
space.
 
Justification
12.31 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'to deliver  a wide  choice  of high  quality
homes, widen  opportunities for home  ownership  and  create sustainable, inclusive  and  mixed
communities, local  planning  authorities should:
plan for a  mix of housing  based  on current and  future demographic  trends, market trends and
the needs  of different groups  in the community (such  as, but not limited to, families with children,
older  people, people  with disabilities, service  families and  people  wishing  to build  their own
homes);
identify the size, type, tenure and range of housing that is required in particular locations, reflecting
local demand' .
12.32 In order  to create mixed, balanced  and inclusive  communities, provision  will need  to be  made
for a  variety of housing  tenures, types and  sizes. An appropriate mix  of housing  will need  to be
provided within individual developments, proportionate to the scale of development proposed. Smaller
113 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Stronger Communitiesschemes  will need  to contribute to the mix  of housing  across  the wider  area. The mix  of housing  will
be expected to include  properties for key  workers  and for those who  wish  to self build  or commission
their own  home. The council  will keep  a register of those who  are seeking  to acquire  serviced  plots
of land  in the plan  area  to build  homes  for themselves to occupy  and will seek  to supplement this
with information from secondary  data sources  to obtain a  robust assessment of demand  for this type
of housing. Further details of how  this housing  mix will be taken into consideration will  be set out in
a Supplementary Planning Document and  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
12.33 Facilitating more  balanced  communities, comprising  a range  of ages, household  types and
incomes  may  also help  achieve  wider  social  policy  goals, such  as reducing  concentrations of income
poverty and  social  exclusion.
12.34 The council  will work  in partnership, with developers  and registered providers, to provide
accommodation with a greater range of tenure options that is of good quality and good design, offering
longevity and  flexibility for the changing  needs  of ageing. Appropriate sites to meet this specific
housing  need  will be identified within the Strategic Sites of the Local  Plan Strategy and  the Site
Allocations and  Policies Development Plan Document. The council  may  also seek  a proportion of the
overall  housing  land  target to be  developed  as bungalows  or houses  suitable for older  person
households.
12.35 In the interests of sustainability and  to ensure  that new  housing  provision  is sited in  the most
appropriate location, the council  will require  proposals  for the elderly  and/or specialist housing
accommodation to be  supported by  evidence  that there is  a proven  need  for such  accommodation.
12.36 The council  will encourage  the completion of Building for Life Assessments to ensure  high
quality residential development that meets the needs  of all.
12.37 Neighbourhood  Plans can  play  an important role  in securing  an appropriate housing  mix.
Their policies  can reflect more  local  evidence  regarding  the need  for particular types of housing.

Affordable Homes
1. In residential developments affordable housing  will be provided  as follows:
i. In developments of 15  or more  dwellings  (or 0.4 hectares) in  the Principal Towns  and
Key Service Centres at least 30%  of all  units are  to be  affordable;
ii. In developments of 11  or more  dwellings  (or have  a maximum  combined  gross
floorspace of more  than 1,000 sq.m) in  Local  Service Centres and  all other locations
at least 30%  of all  units are  to be  affordable;
iii. In future, where  Cheshire  East Council  evidence, such  as housing  needs  studies or
housing  market assessments, indicate a  change  in the borough’s  housing  need  the
above  thresholds and  percentage requirements may  be varied;
2. Units provided  shall  remain  affordable for future eligible  households  or for the subsidy  to
be recycled  for alternative affordable housing  provision;
3. The affordable homes  provided  must be  of a tenure, size  and type to help  meet identified
housing  needs  and contribute to the creation of mixed, balanced  and inclusive  communities
where  people  can live independently longer;
4. Affordable homes  should  be dispersed  throughout the site, unless  there are  specific
circumstances or  benefits that would  warrant a  different approach;
5. Market and  affordable homes  on sites should  be indistinguishable and  achieve  the same
high design  quality;
6. The council  will seek  to improve  choice  and increase  supply  of affordable homes  to reflect
that housing  markets change  over  periods  of time and  therefore the products that are  made
available  to help  people  access  rented and  other affordable housing  need  to change  to
meet these market conditions;
7. In exceptional circumstances, where  scheme  viability may  be affected, developers  will be
expected to provide  viability assessments to demonstrate alternative affordable housing
provision(53). The developer  will be required  to submit an  open  book  viability assessment.
In such  cases, the council  will commission  an independent review  of the viability study, for
which  the developer  will bear  the cost. In cases  where  such  alternative affordable housing
provision  is agreed  there may  be a requirement for the provision  of 'overage' payments to
be made. This will  reflect the fact that the viability of a  site will  be agreed  at a point in  time
and may  need  to be  reviewed, at set point(s) in  the future;
8. Affordable housing is required to be provided on-site, however, in exceptional circumstances,
where  it can  be proven  that on-site delivery  is not possible, as  a first alternative, off-site
provision  of affordable housing  will be accepted; as  a second  alternative a  financial
contribution may  be accepted, where  justified, in  lieu of on-site provision.
9. Affordable housing  and tariff style contributions will  not be  sought from any  development
consisting only  of the construction of a  residential annex  or extension to an  existing home.
Justification
12.39 The National Planning Policy Framework states that where  Local  Authorities have  identified
that affordable housing  is needed, they should  'set policies  for meeting this need  on site, unless
off-site provision  or a financial contribution of broadly  equivalent value  can be robustly justified and
the agreed  approach  contributes to the objective of creating mixed  and balanced  communities. Such
policies  should  be sufficiently flexible to take account of changing  market conditions over  time' .
53 Alternative affordable housing  provision  could  include  lower  provision  or provision  of alternative affordable housing
tenures.
115 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Stronger Communities12.40 'Affordable housing' and  'Affordable homes' are  considered  to be  that as  defined in  the
National Planning Policy Framework.
12.41 A community's need  for an  appropriate balance  and mix of housing, including  the provision
of affordable housing, is  recognised  at national level  as a material consideration in  determining
planning  applications for housing  development. Government policy  seeks  to create sustainable
communities that offer a  wide  range  of housing  types and  tenures and  are socially  inclusive.
12.42 The council  is keen  to enable  people  to live  independently at all  stages of their lives  and to
reduce  cultures of dependency.  The council  is also  keen  to enable  people  to buy  a home  of their
own and promote wider  home  ownership. It also  encourages  families to grow  and move  into homes
that match their current and  future aspirations. There needs  to be  a wider  choice  of housing  that can
support people  when  they are  older  and allow  them to remain  independent for as  much  of their life
as possible. Affordable housing  is a means  of achieving  these goals; it can  support broader  home
ownership  through initiatives such  as housing  designed  specifically for first time buyers  and can allow
families to grow  through fixed discount and  shared  ownership  housing. Securing housing  at the right
price  supports a  flexible and  dynamic  labour  market and  enhances  the wider  growth agenda. Housing
that meets the needs  of older  people  will be increasingly  important as  longevity improves; the right
kind of housing, bungalows  or directly supported housing  promotes independence  and reduces  the
need  to fall back  on the care  system. Consequently, a  good  range  of housing  that meets local  needs
is vital to the overall  strategy.
12.43 Although the borough  has a stock of good  quality housing  with relatively low  vacancy  rates,
in many  areas  there is  an imbalance  in the type and  tenure of available  housing. There is  a need  to
make  sure  that future housing  development in  Cheshire  East helps  to support economic  growth by
providing  for a  range  of income  groups. This includes  housing  for households  seeking  open  market
dwellings  and those requiring  affordable housing  (including  social  rented, affordable rent, shared
ownership  housing, discounted housing  for sale  and increased  diversity of options through intermediate
tenures). Such an  approach  will help  to maintain long-term community sustainability and  enhance
the quality of life for local  residents.
12.44 The Housing  Development Study shows  that there is  the objectively-assessed need  for
affordable housing for a minimum of 7,100 dwellings over the plan period, which equates to an average
of 355  dwellings  per year.
12.45 To help  address  housing  need, the council  will seek  affordable housing  from residential
developments in  accordance  with the stated thresholds.
12.46 All development involving  the provision  of housing  that meets the thresholds will  be required
to make  provision  for affordable housing, unless  there are  exceptional viability circumstances which
make  this impossible. Land  values  used  in any viability assessments will  be expected to take account
of planning  obligations.
12.47 The council will  normally require the affordable housing to be delivered without public subsidy
and provided  on site. In exceptional circumstances and  where  it can  be justified, as  a first alternative,
affordable housing  will be accepted off-site; this must be  on a site that is  agreed  with the Council  as
being  in a suitable location, relative to the housing  need  to be  met. In exceptional circumstances and
where  it can  be justified, as  a second  alternative, a  financial contribution will  be accepted. Where a
financial contribution is  sought, the Council  will seek  to use  a standard methodology which  will be
detailed in  additional guidance  and  based  on evidence  such  as the Strategic Housing  Market
Assessment, local  housing  needs  surveys  and other housing  market studies.
12.48 The council will seek the balance of housing that best meets local needs and the characteristics
of the site. Currently, this is  65%  affordable (or  social)  rent housing  and 35%  intermediate affordable
housing. The council  may  refine both the headline  percentage, tenure split and  any geographical
variation as  the plan  progresses. Any future requirements will  be determined through evidence  such
as the Strategic Housing  Market Assessment and  local  housing  needs  surveys.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 116
 Stronger Communities12.49 Affordable housing requirements must also be balanced with other requirements for transport
infrastructure, community facilities, open  space  and sustainable construction. However, it should  be
stressed that the provision  of affordable housing  will be additional to any  requirements outlined in  the
council's Charging Schedule under the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) - see Policy IN 2. Following
the Written Ministerial Statement of the 28  November  2014  and subsequent updates to the Planning
Practice Guidance there are  specific circumstances where  contributions for affordable housing  and
tariff style planning  obligations (Section 106  planning  obligations) should  not be  sought from small
scale  and self-build development as  reflected in  point 1  (ii) of Policy SC 5.
12.50 The Draft Core Strategy and CIL Viability assessment (2013) noted that greenfield residential
development is  generally  viable  at the current time at a  30%  affordable housing  requirement. The
assessment acknowledges  challenges, however, in  respect of the viability of brownfield development
in meeting the 30%  requirement with particular issues  around  the urban  area  of Crewe. Point 7  of
Policy SC 5 allows for the viability of schemes to be a key consideration in demonstrating an alternative
affordable housing  provision  alongside  an open  book  viability assessment, in  order  to consider
schemes  on a case  by case  basis.
12.51 In Crewe  it may  also  be more  appropriate to divert funding for affordable housing  into
provisions  for the improvement of existing stock within the urban  area, rather than the provision  of
new houses. This will  not only  make  best use  of available  resources  but have  regeneration benefits
as well.
12.52 Where viability assessments are  submitted, to demonstrate that an  alternative provision  of
affordable housing  should  be provided, they will  be evaluated independently, such  cost being  borne
by the developer. In cases  where  such  alternative affordable housing  provision  is agreed, there may
be a requirement for the provision  of 'overage' payments to be  made. As viability assessments are
relevant to a  particular point in  time, this would  be linked  to reviews  of the viability assessment, at
certain points within the site's lifetime. Such a  requirement will  be related to the site's size; its
characteristics; market conditions and  other relevant factors.
12.53  Further explanation, regarding  how  this policy  and Policy SC 6  'Rural Exceptions Housing
for Local  Needs' will  operate, will  be included  in a Supplementary Planning Document on  Affordable
Housing.

Rural Exceptions
12.54 Approximately 30% of Cheshire East's population live in Local Service Centres (LSCs), Other
Settlements and rural areas. The provision of additional housing is vital to the creation and maintenance
of sustainable communities in  rural  areas. Further supply  is required  to address  the cost of housing,
and to enable  newly  forming households  to remain  in their communities. Additional housing  can also
help to improve  the viability of existing or  potential local  services.
Policy SC 6
Rural Exceptions Housing for Local Needs
Rural Exceptions affordable housing will be  permitted as an exception to other policies concerning
the countryside, to meet locally  identified affordable housing  need, subject to all  of the following
criteria being  met:
117 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Stronger Communities1. Sites should  adjoin  Local  Service Centres and  Other Settlements and  be close  to existing
employment and  existing or  proposed  services  and facilities,including  public  transport,
educational and  health facilities and  retail services;
2. Proposals must be  for small  schemes; small  schemes  are considered  to be  those of 10
dwellings  or fewer(54). Any such  developments must be  appropriate in  scale, design  and
character to the locality;
3. A thorough site options appraisal  must be  submitted to demonstrate why  the site is  the most
suitable one. Such an  appraisal  must demonstrate why  the need  cannot be  met within the
settlement;
4. In all  cases, proposals  for rural  exceptions housing  schemes  must be  supported by  an
up-to-date(55) Housing  Needs  Survey(56)  that identifies the need  for such  provision  within
the parish;
5. Occupancy will, in  perpetuity, be  restricted to a  person  in housing  need  and resident or
working  in the relevant parish, or  who has other strong links  with the relevant locality in  line
with the community connection criteria as  set out by  Cheshire  Homechoice, both initially
and on subsequent change  of occupancy. This could  include  Key Workers  and Self Build;
6. The locality to which  the occupancy  criteria are  to be  applied  is taken as  the parish, unless
otherwise agreed  with Cheshire  East Council;
7. To ensure  that a  property is  let or  sold  to a person  who  either lives  locally  or has strong
local connections in  the future, the council  will expect there to be  a 'cascade' approach  to
the locality issue  appropriate to the type of tenure. Thus, first priority is  to be  given  to those
satisfying the occupancy  criteria in  relation to the parish, widening  in agreed  geographical
stages(57).
Cross Subsidy
8. Proposals must consist in  their entirety of affordable housing  that will  be retained in
perpetuity. In exceptional circumstances, proposals  that intend to include  an element of
market housing, or  plots for open  market sale, may  be acceptable, if they meet all  of the
above  criteria, along  with the criteria below:
i. Such proposals  will only be permitted where  it can  be demonstrated that the site would
not be  viable, as  a rural  exception site, without cross  subsidy. The developer  will be
required  to submit an  open  book  viability assessment. In such  cases, the Council  will
commission  an independent review  of the viability study, for which  the developer  will
bear the cost;
ii. The Council  will not accept aspirational land  value  as justification for allowing  a higher
proportion of market value  units;
iii. The assessment must show that the scale of the market housing component is essential
for the successful delivery  of the rural  exception affordable housing  scheme  and that
it is based  on reasonable  land  values  as a rural  exception site and  must not include
an element of profit;
iv. The majority of the development must be  for rural  exception affordable housing; and
v. No additional subsidy  is required  for the scheme.
54 The scale  of a Rural  Exception site should  broadly  reflect the affordable housing  need  appropriate to the parish  in
which  it is situated. The housing  need  identified in  the local  housing  needs  survey  is an important factor, however, if
a higher  housing  need  is identified (greater than 10  dwellings), then it will  be considered  appropriate for development
of more  than one  site to meet this need.
55 Within the last five years.
56 Cheshire  East Council  has up-to-date Housing  Needs  Surveys for many  rural  areas  which  may  be utilised. Where
an up-to-date survey  does  not already  exist, the applicant must conduct a  survey, based  on the Cheshire  East Council
model  survey, in  conjunction with the parish  council  where  possible.
57 Generally this is  taken as  the parish  and then parish  plus  adjoining  parishes.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 118
 Stronger CommunitiesJustification
12.55 The National Planning Policy Framework states that in  rural  areas  'local planning  authorities
should  be responsive  to local  circumstances and  plan  housing  development to reflect local  needs,
particularly for affordable housing, including  through rural  exception sites where  appropriate. Local
planning  authorities should  in particular consider  whether allowing  some  market housing  would
facilitate the provision of significant additional affordable housing to meet local needs' . Whilst paragraph
89 states ‘a local  planning  authority should  regard  the construction of new  buildings  as inappropriate
in Green Belt. Exceptions to this are: . . . and  limited affordable housing  for local  community needs
under  policies  set out in  the Local  Plan’ .
12.56 This policy  allows  for the allocation of, or  granting of planning  permission  for, small  sites
comprising  affordable housing  to meet local  needs  as an exception to normal  policies. The policy
sets out the criteria against which  such  proposals  will be evaluated and  under  what circumstances
schemes  solely  for affordable housing  may  be permitted.
12.57 The council  recognises  the particular difficulties in  securing  an adequate supply  of housing
for local  needs  in rural  areas.  Where it can  be demonstrated that a  proposed  development will  meet
a particular locally generated need that cannot be  accommodated in any other way, affordable housing
will be allowed  as an exception to normal  policy.
12.58 A number of rural exception sites have been successfully delivered in Cheshire East. However,
the delivery  of such  schemes  can be slow  and the council  is keen  to facilitate a  higher  provision  of
affordable homes  in rural  areas  in the future with a  view  to maintaining sustainable communities and
meeting their specific needs. This includes  the provision  of housing  for key  workers  such  as those
involved  in health, education or  emergency  services. It is  also  recognised  that Self Build could  be a
way of delivering  affordable housing  in rural  areas.
12.59 The provision  of small  scale  market development in  conjunction with affordable units will
help enable  more  development sites to come  forward to meet local  demand. The provision  of a small
number  of market units will  also help  maintain communities where  development would  not otherwise
occur. Such schemes  will, however, only  be permitted where  viability assessments or  some  other
clear  reason  demonstrates that this is  the only  way that affordable housing  to meet local  needs  can
be delivered  on the site. The council  would  expect such  schemes  to be  developed  with support from
parish  councils  and the Rural  Housing  Strategy.
12.60 Strong links(58) are currently identified as  those who:
Currently live, or  have  lived, within the boundaries  of the parish  or adjoining  parish  and have
done  so for at least one  of the last two years  or three of the last five years.
Have  immediate family (sibling, son, daughter, parent, step parent or  adoptive parents) who  are
currently living  within the boundaries  of the parish  or adjoining  parish  and have  done  so for at
least five years.
Have  a permanent contract of employment within the parish  or adjoining  parish.

Stronger CommunitiesGypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople
12.62 Many  Gypsies, Travellers  and Travelling  Showpeople wish  to find and  buy their own  sites
to develop  and manage, but have  often been  unable  to secure  planning  permission  to do  so.  Others
require  space  to rent for pitching caravans  – usually  on sites owned  and run by a Local  Authority. 
An increase  in the number  of approved  sites will  help  to meet demand  for affordable Gypsy, Traveller
and Travelling  Showpeople accommodation.  A more  settled existence can  benefit many  members
of these communities in  terms of access  to health and  education services  and employment, and  can
contribute to greater integration and  social  inclusion  within local  communities.
Policy SC 7
Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople
1. Sites will  be allocated or  approved  to meet the needs  set out in  the most recent Gypsy and
Traveller  Accommodation Assessment (GTAA).  Current evidence  suggests there is  a need
within the borough  for:
i. A transit site of between 5  and 10 pitches for Gypsy and  Travellers;
ii. 69 additional permanent residential pitches for Gypsy and  Travellers; and
iii. 13 additional plots for Travelling  Showpeople in  the period  2013  to 2028.
2. To ensure  that proposals  for Gypsy and  Traveller  and Travelling  Showperson sites are
sustainable and  acceptable in  terms of location and  design, the following considerations
will be taken into account:
i. Proximity of the site to local  services  and facilities;
ii. Access to public  transport;
iii. Safe pedestrian, cycle  and vehicular  access  onto the site;
iv. Appropriate pitch sizes;
v. Adequate provision  for parking, turning and  servicing;
vi. Adequate provision  for storage and  maintenance, particularly where  needed  for
Travelling  Showpeople;
vii. Mix of accommodation types and  tenures;
viii. Impact on  the character and  appearance  of the surrounding  area;
ix. Impact on  the Green Belt(59);
x. Impact on  the historic environment.
3. There will  be a presumption against the loss  of existing permanent consented Gypsy,
Traveller  or Travelling  Showpersons sites where  this would  exacerbate or  result in  an
identified shortfall unless  suitable replacement provision  of equal  or enhanced  value  are
provided.
Justification
12.63 The Department of Communities and  Local  Government's Policy for Travellers  states that
'Local planning  authorities should  set pitch targets for Gypsies and  Travellers  and plot targets for
Travelling  Showpeople which  address  the likely  permanent and  transit site accommodation needs  of
Travellers  in their area, working  collaboratively with neighbouring  local  planning  authorities' . It goes
on to suggest that 'local planning  authorities should  ensure  that Traveller  sites are  sustainable
economically, socially  and environmentally' .

13.1 The environment of Cheshire  East is  unusually  rich and varied  and its high  quality, natural
and man-made  heritage is  a key asset, attractive to both residents and  visitors. The Local  Plan
Strategy will  maintain and  enhance  this asset that makes  a fundamental contribution to the quality
of life in  Cheshire  East. Development provides  opportunities to enhance  and contribute to the quality
of the environment.
13.2 This section sets out positive policies  to ensure  that development will  protect and  enhance
Cheshire  East's built and  natural environment and  will make  sustainable use  of resources. These
policies  take account of the contribution that an  attractive environment can  make  to a  successful
economy  and the well-being  of local  communities.

Quality of Place
13.3 High quality design  is not just about how  a development looks  but also  whether it is  successful
in its context, whether it functions well, whether it is  enduring  and of high  quality, and  lastly, whether
it contributes toward broader  sustainability objectives. To  deliver  safe, secure, attractive and  healthy
places  in which  to live, work, visit and  spend  time, development should  seek  to improve  the quality
and appearance  and biodiversity value  of an  area  and the way  it functions.
13.4 Achieving high  quality design  should  be a key objective of all  those involved  in delivering
sustainable development. Development should  take the opportunities available  to improve  the quality
and appearance  of an  area  and the way  it functions.

good  planning, and  should  contribute positively to making  places  better for people.”
13.6 The National Planning Policy Framework also  states that 'Permission should  be refused for
development of poor  design  that fails to take the opportunities available  for improving  the character

Design
Development proposals  should  make  a positive contribution to their surroundings  in terms of the
following:
1. Sense of place
i. Ensuring design  solutions achieve  a sense  of place  by protecting and  enhancing  the
quality, distinctiveness and  character of settlements;
ii. Ensuring sensitivity of design  in proximity to designated and  local  heritage assets and
their settings;
iii. Ensuring that places  are designed  around  the needs  and comfort of people  and not
vehicles, so  that layout, street design  and parking  is in accordance  with the principles
set out in  Policy CO 1  and Manual  for Streets;
iv. Ensuring that proposals  are underpinned  by character and  design  assessment
commensurate with the scale  and complexity of the development;
v. Encouraging innovative and  creative design  solutions that are  appropriate to the local
context; and
vi. Ensuring a  high  quality public  realm  that enhances  conditions for pedestrians and
cyclists and  creates opportunities for social  interaction.
2. Managing  design  quality
i. Ensuring for larger  scale  and more  complex  developments that design  proposals  have
positively responded  to the Design  Review  process(62);
ii. Ensuring for major  developments that Masterplanning and  Design  Coding  forms an
integral part of the design  process;
iii. Ensuring that housing  developments achieve  Building for Life 12  (or as updated)
standard; and
iv. Encouraging sustainable construction practices including the use of appropriate recycled
and sustainable materials of high  quality.
3. Sustainable urban, architectural and  landscape  design
i. Encouraging the introduction of passive  environmental design  principles  and climate
change  adaptation features in  the orientation of buildings  and spaces  and detailed
design;
ii. Encouraging sustainable modes  of travel through appropriate design;
iii. Reducing  energy  and water usage  through appropriate design;
iv. Encouraging the use  of renewable/low carbon  energy  technology, as  appropriate; and
v. Encouraging the use  of green  infrastructure.
62 A Supplementary Planning Document will  be produced  to help  define what is  considered  to constitute ‘larger  scale
and more  complex  developments’ and  to set out the options for Design  Review  to fulfil the requirements of this criteria.

iii. Ensuring that site layout and  design  minimises  the opportunity for crime.
 
Justification
13.7 Cheshire  East has  a unique  character and  sense  of place  and  it is  important that new
development responds  positively to it. High  quality design  should  be the aim  of all  those involved  in
the development process  and should  be considered  at the earliest possible  stage.  Development
proposals should, therefore, consider the wider character in addition to that of the site and  its immediate
context, to ensure  that it reinforces the area  in which  it is located.  Where there is  the opportunity to
improve  the area, the design  should  secure  a positive new  character, enhancing  both its appearance
and the way  that it functions.
13.8 A genuinely  sustainable form of development should  be underpinned  by sustainable urban,
architectural and  landscape  design.  Both outline and  detailed proposals  should  demonstrate their
performance in respect to sustainable design, commensurate with the type and  scale of the application.
13.9 Development should  have  due  regard  to the site and  wider  setting in  respect to layout,
movement and  connections, scale  and height, landscape  character, townscape character and  in their
appearance  both in  terms of architectural quality and  materials. Development should  also  ensure
high levels of passive surveillance of streets, spaces and parking through the arrangement and design
of buildings, streets and  spaces  and the activity within them. Boundary treatments and  hard  surfaces
are equally  important to successful design.
13.10 In rural  areas, particular attention should  be paid  to landscape  character, the local  vernacular
and the peculiar  characteristics of the locality. These will  vary  considerably  within Cheshire  East and
new development should  be designed  with a  distinctive sense  of place  in mind.
13.11  Consequently, it is  important that new  development has  a strong design  vision, formed early
in the process, in  order  to create a  strong sense  of place  and to fully address  both the opportunities
and constraints of the site and  the wider  area.
13.12 Proposals for new  development should  express  how  the design  achieves  this in  the Design
and Access Statement.  This should  not merely  be a statement of what the proposal  is or looks  like
but must set out the ‘story’ of the design  (i.e. the design  process  that has  been  followed) and  how  it
has evolved  and strengthened. The design  process  can be summarised  as:
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 126
 Sustainable EnvironmentStage 1: analysis: research  and analyse  the physical, environmental, economic  and social
considerations. Identify issues  and opportunities, not just for the site but the wider  area  (extent
dependent on  the scale  and complexity of the proposals);
Stage 2: concepts: Establish the design  vision, set out the principles  and parameters and
potentially several  sketch options (depending  on the nature and  scale  of the development) 
Potential stage for design  review;
Stage 3: Design  development: test and refine the design, potentially including selecting a preferred
approach  (if several  options have  been  developed  in stage 2). Ironing out of issues  highlighted
and strengthening of the scheme;
Potential stage for design  review  and/or consultation;
Stage 4: final design: Final refinement and  preparation of the final design  and assembly  of all
supporting material including  visual  representations appropriate to the scale  and type of
application (potentially 2D  and 3D).

Efficient Use  of Land
1. The council  will encourage  the redevelopment / re-use  of previously  developed  land  and
buildings.
2. The council  will manage  development to protect previously  developed  land  where  it can  be
clearly  demonstrated that either the landscape  amenity or  biodiversity value  of the site has
become  of a high  value  and as such  would  be compromised  through redevelopment of the
site.
3. All windfall development should:
i. Consider  the landscape  and townscape character of the surrounding  area  when
determining the character and  density of development;
ii. Build upon  existing concentrations of activities and  existing infrastructure;
iii. Not require  major  investment in  new  infrastructure, including  transport, water supply
and sewerage. Where this is  unavoidable, development should be appropriately phased
to coincide  with new  infrastructure provision; and
iv. Consider the consequences of the proposal for sustainable development having regard
to Policy SD 1  and Policy SD 2
4. Development should  safeguard natural resources  including  high  quality agricultural land
(grades  1, 2, and  3a), geology, minerals, air, soil  and water.
 
127 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable EnvironmentJustification
13.15 The National Planning Policy Framework identifies the efficient use  of land  as one of the
core land  use planning  principles  which  encourages  ‘the effective use  of land  by re-using  land  that
has been  previously  developed  (brownfield land), provided  that it is  not of high  environmental value’ .
13.16 Not all  areas  of previously-developed  land  will however  be suitable or  appropriate for built
development, nor  for the whole  curtilage to be  developed. The council  will therefore seek  to resist
inappropriate development where development would cause harm to the character of the surrounding
area. The council  recognises  that there is  a presumption in  favour of sustainable development in
accordance  with paragraph  14 of the National Planning Policy Framework. The council  will therefore
seek  to ensure  that, where  possible, development is  making  the best use  of land  and  existing
infrastructure, and that resources  are being managed prudently and efficiently. It is not always possible
to predict where  sites and  buildings  will become  available  and therefore it is  not always  possible  to
allocate such sites for development. At the same time, the council would like to see these sites brought
back  into use, not only  in relation to the prudent use  of resources  but also  to make  sure  that an  area
is not blighted by  dereliction and  vacancy, and  to reduce  opportunities for any  criminal  and anti-social
activity to take place  on the site. The council  recognises  that good  design  is an important aspect of
sustainable development and  therefore when  planning  for any  development, including  windfall sites
'it is important to plan  positively for the achievement of high  quality and  inclusive  design  for all
development, including  individual  buildings, public  and private spaces  and wider  area  development
schemes ' (NPPF).
13.17 The NPPF states that " Local  planning  authorities should  take into account the economic  and
other benefits of the best and  most versatile agricultural land '". Cheshire  is a major  food producing
county and  fertile soil  is a limited and  finite resource  that cannot easily  be repaired  or replicated.
Accordingly whilst some  reduction of agricultural land  is inevitable if new  development is  to proceed,
its loss  should  be minimised. The needs  of future generations for all  forms of development should
be balanced  against the inevitable requirement to provide  food for future needs.
13.18 Cheshire  East has  a wealth of mineral  resources; these must be  worked  where  they are
found (see  Policy SE 10). The ability to access  key minerals  should  be safeguarded.

Cheshire  Plain containing a  number  of meres, ponds  and marshes; variety is  provided  as a result of
the closeness  of the Peak District to the east and  the Mid-Cheshire  Ridge  to the west.  The natural
environment of the borough  is diverse, supporting a  variety of habitats, flora and  fauna.
13.20 The natural environment is  one of the borough's greatest assets and  is highly  valued  by
residents and  visitors alike. Protecting and  enhancing  the environment that makes  Cheshire  East
special  is a key aspiration of the Local  Plan.

Biodiversity and Geodiversity
(63)
1. Areas of high  biodiversity and  geodiversity value  will be protected and  enhanced.
Enhancement measures  will include  increasing  the total area  of valuable  habitat in  the
Borough, and  linking  up existing areas  of high  value  habitat to create 'ecological stepping
stone sites', ‘wildlife corridors’  and 'Nature Improvements Areas'. Ecological networks and
connectivity are  vitally important in  sustaining sites and  addressing  the impacts of climate
change.
2. Development proposals  which  may  adversely  affect the integrity of a  site with one  or more
of the following international designations will  not be  permitted:
i. Special Protection Areas (SPAs)
ii. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs)
iii. Ramsar  sites
iv. Any potential Special Protection Areas (SPAs), candidate Special Areas of Conservation
(SACs) or  proposed  Ramsar  sites
v. Sites identified, or required, as compensatory measures for adverse effects on  European
sites, candidate Special Protection Areas, possible  Special Areas of Conservation,
and listed or  proposed  Ramsar  sites
unless it has been demonstrated that there are no alternative solutions, there are imperative
reasons  of overriding  public  interest and  that compensatory measures  will be provided  to
ensure  the overall  coherence  of the network of SPAs and  SACs are  protected or, in  the
case  of deleting a  Ramsar  site or  restricting its boundaries, by  creating additional nature
reserves  for wildfowl to compensate for any  loss of wetland resources  as far as  possible.
3. Development proposals  which  are likely  to  have  an adverse  impact on  a Site of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSI), a  National Nature Reserve  or the Peak District National Park
fringe will  not normally  be permitted. Where an  adverse  effect on  the site’s  notified special
interest features is  likely, an  exception should  only  be made  where  the benefits of the
development, at this site, clearly  outweigh both the impacts that it is  likely  to have  on the
features of the site that make  it of special  scientific interest and  any broader  impacts on  the
national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest.
4. Development proposals  which  are likely  to have  a significant adverse  impact on  a site with
one or more  of the following local  or regional  designations, habitats or  species  will not be
permitted except where  the reasons  for or  benefits of the proposed  development outweigh
the impact of the development:
i. Local  Nature Reserves
ii. Sites of Biological Importance (SBI) or  Local  Wildlife Sites
iii. Regionally  Important Geological and  Geomorphological Sites (RIGGS)
iv. Designated Wildlife Corridors
v. Habitats and  species  within the Cheshire  Biodiversity Action Plan
vi. National priority species  and habitats (commonly  known  as ‘UK BAP priority habitats
and species’) published for England under the requirements of Section 41 of the Natural
Environment and  Rural  Communities Act 2006

ix. Nature Improvement Areas
5. All development (including  conversions  and that on  brownfield and  greenfield sites) must
aim to positively contribute to the conservation and  enhancement of biodiversity and
geodiversity and  should  not negatively affect these interests. When appropriate, conditions
will be put in  place  to make  sure  appropriate monitoring is  undertaken and  make  sure
mitigation, compensation and  offsetting is  effective.
6. Development proposals  that are  likely  to have  a significant impact on  a non-designated
asset or  a site valued  by the local  community identified in  a Neighbourhood  Plan or  the Site
Allocations and  Development Policies documents will  only  be permitted where  suitable
mitigation and / or  compensation is provided to address the adverse impacts of the proposed
development, or  where  any residual  harm  following mitigation/compensation, along  with
any other harm, is  clearly  outweighed by  the benefits of the development.
 
Justification
13.21 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'planning permission  will be refused for
development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats including ancient woodland
and the loss  of aged  veteran trees outside ancient woodland, unless  the need  for, and  the benefits
of, the development in  that locality clearly  outweighs the loss'. It also  states that 'to minimise  impacts
on biodiversity and geodiversity, planning policies should: plan for biodiversity at a landscape-scale...;
identify and map components of the local ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international,
national and locally designated sites...; promote the preservation, restoration and re-creation of priority
habitats, ecological  networks and  the protection and  recovery  of priority species  populations...; and
aim to prevent harm  to geological  conservation interests' .
13.22 The National Planning Policy Framework also  states that 'The planning  system should
contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by . . . minimising impacts on biodiversity
and providing  net gains  in biodiversity where  possible, contributing to the government's commitment
to halt the overall  decline  in biodiversity, including  by establishing coherent ecological  networks that
are more  resilient to current and  future pressures' .
13.23 The Natural Environment White Paper 'The Natural Choice: Securing the Value  of Nature'
states that 'We want to create a  resilient and  coherent ecological  network at national and  local  levels
across England….To make this happen, the government will put in place a clear institutional framework
to support nature restoration. This means: establishing Local  Nature Partnerships….Creating new
Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) and  strengthening support through the planning  system '.
13.24 Local Plan Strategy Policy SE 3 seeks to make sure that there is no overall  loss of biodiversity
and geodiversity and  seeks  to utilise avoidance, mitigation, compensation and  offsetting strategies
to achieve  this. Biodiversity offsetting is  described  in the Natural Environment White Paper 'The
Natural Choice: securing the value  of nature' as 'conservation activities designed  to deliver biodiversity
benefits in compensation for losses in a measurable way. Good developments incorporate biodiversity
considerations in  their design  but are  still likely  to result in  some  biodiversity loss. One way  to
compensate for this loss  is by offsetting: the developer  secures  compensatory habitat expansion  or
restoration elsewhere' .
13.25 The level  of biodiversity offsetting required  could  be determined by  means  of assessments
undertaken in  accordance  with the Department for Environment, Food and  Rural  Affairs (DEFRA)
metric contained in  Biodiversity Offsetting Pilots published  in March  2012  as applied  in the Defra
offsetting pilot projects. Biodiversity offsetting could  be delivered  by developers  in partnership with
various  partners including  conservation organisations, local  landowners  and the borough  council.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 130
 Sustainable Environment13.26 The designation of international, national and  local  sites is  an on-going  process, therefore
the above  policy  will equally  apply  to any  sites selected or  designated subsequently to the adoption
of the Local  Plan.  Conversely, the policy  will not apply  to any  site de-selected after the adoption of
the Local  Plan. Sites of Biological Importance are  being  resurveyed; they will  then be  designated as
Local  Wildlife Sites. At the time of producing this document, there are therefore sites that are designated
as Sites of Biological Importance (which  have  yet to be  resurveyed)  and sites that are  designated as
Local  Wildlife Sites (which  have  been  resurveyed.)
13.27 The policy  recognises  that in  rare  and closely  defined circumstances, proposals  that have
an adverse  impact on  a European site (or  equivalent for planning  policy  purposes)  may  be permitted.
This aligns  with the legal  framework governing  these designations of international importance.
13.28 Construction Management Plans, landscaping, green infrastructure and  open space proposals
should  be submitted to the council  during  the planning  application process  as part of sustainable
development proposals  for any  sites in  close  proximity to European designated sites.
13.29 The importance of biodiversity has  been  a common  theme within Neighbourhood  Plans in
Cheshire  East. Where supported by  local  evidence, there is  an opportunity for communities to identify
sites of nature conservation importance as  Local  Green Space designations to further support the
aims  of Policy SE 3.

Landscape
13.30 Cheshire East has  a rich and diverse landscape. To the east, the land rises from the Cheshire
Plain into the Pennine foothills and  the Derbyshire  and Staffordshire boundaries. In the south east,
it includes the southern part of the Sandstone Ridge that runs north-south from Frodsham to Whitchurch
and the rolling  landscape  of the Shropshire boundary. The Plain itself consists of a  mosaic  of clay
plain, heathland, meres  and mosses, shallow  river  valleys  – Weaver, Wheelock, Dane  and Bollin,
and salt related landscapes  around  Middlewich  and Sandbach. Much  of the Plain has  a pastoral
landscape  of hedgerows, hedgerow  trees and  ponds, which  provides   an impression  of a well wooded
landscape, but in  fact woodland  cover  is one of the lowest in  England and  many  of the hedgerow
trees are  slowly  disappearing  from the landscape.
131 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable EnvironmentPolicy SE 4
The Landscape
1. The high  quality of the built and  natural environment is  recognised  as a significant
characteristic of the borough. All development should  conserve  the landscape  character
and quality and should where possible, enhance and effectively manage the historic, natural
and man-made  landscape  features that contribute to local  distinctiveness of both rural  and
urban  landscapes.
2. Development will  be expected to:
i. Incorporate appropriate landscaping  which  reflects the character of the area  through
appropriate design  and management;
ii. Where appropriate, provide  suitable and  appropriate mitigation for the restoration of
damaged  landscape  areas;
iii. Preserve and  promote local  distinctiveness and  diversity;
iv. Avoid  the loss  of habitats of significant landscape  importance;
v. Protect and  / or conserve  the historical and  ecological  qualities of an  area;
3. In Local  Landscape  Designation Areas, Cheshire  East will  seek  to conserve  and enhance
the quality of the landscape  and to protect it from development which  is likely  to have  an
adverse  effect on  its character and  appearance  and setting. Where development is
considered  to be  acceptable in  principle; measures  will be sought to integrate it into the
landscape  character of the area  by:
i. Protecting, restoring and  enhancing  the character and  appearance  of the local  area
through suitable planting, landscape  and / or woodland;
ii. Making  suitable provision  for better public  access  to, and  enjoyment of, the Local
Landscape  Designation Areas;
4. Where development may  affect a  local  or national(64) designation a  full understanding of
the context, characteristics and significance should be provided and informed by the Cheshire
East Landscape  Character Assessment, Historic Landscape  Assessment and  the Local
Landscape  Designation Study. In Local  Landscape  Designation Areas, Cheshire  East will
seek to conserve and enhance the quality of the landscape and to protect it from development
which  is likely  to have  an adverse  effect on  its character and  appearance.
Justification
13.31 The conservation of the intrinsic character and  beauty of the countryside is  a core  planning
principle  in the NPPF and  it is important to understand the characteristics of the local  landscape  and
how development may  affect it. Development should  contribute to the enhancement of landscape
character, both urban  and rural  and should  also  protect and  manage  the historic, natural features
and characteristics that contribute to local  distinctiveness.
13.32 The Cheshire  East area  is a significant landscape  asset in  the North West which  is enjoyed
and valued  for, amongst other things, its ecological, recreational, agricultural, conservation and
aesthetic aspects. This is  reflected in  both the quantity and  quality of landscape  designations which
protect specific areas  and in the high  profile given  to the environment in  the council’s  key objectives.
13.33 Landscape  encompasses  all outdoor space, from town centre pedestrian precincts, to the
open  countryside: all  forms of development impact upon  the landscape  to some  degree  and this
needs  to be  assessed  to determine its significance, ensure  development is  designed  to integrate into
its setting and  to identify possible  mitigation (be  they proposals  for stables, householder  applications,

 Sustainable Environmentnew residential development, business parks, new town centre buildings, public art, telecommunications
masts, wind  farms, nursing  homes, nurseries, new  retail, overhead  power  lines, new  recreational
landscapes  such  as golf courses  and many  others).
13.34 Whilst all  of Cheshire  East’s  landscapes  are of value, some  landscapes  are also recognised
as being  of particular importance and  have  been  identified as  Local  Landscape  Designation areas;
these areas  sit within the framework of the Landscape  Character Assessment. Criteria for defining
the special  qualities of these areas  include: distinctiveness, perceptual character, landscape  and
scenic  quality, natural character, cultural character and  function. Further guidance  and/or design
advice  will be published  for areas  of particular distinctiveness such  as the Peak District Fringe and
the Alderely Edge sandstone escarpment.
13.35 The impacts of proposed developments upon existing landscape and views of the surrounding
area should  be assessed  as part of the planning  process.  This can  include  assessing  the suitability
of landscape  schemes  (often submitted as  part of a  planning  application), and  negotiating any
improvements.  With larger  projects, for example  mineral  applications, this can  involve  a series  of
meetings and  site visits with the applicant’s  planning  consultants to provide  advice.

Trees, Hedgerows and Woodland
13.36 Woodland, trees and  hedgerows  within Cheshire  East are  important visual  and ecological
assets, which  not only  provide  a significant contribution to the borough's local  distinctiveness but also
play a role in mitigating and  addressing  climate change  and supporting biodiversity.
133 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable EnvironmentPolicy SE 5
Trees, Hedgerows and Woodland
Development proposals  which  will result in  the loss  of, or  threat to, the continued health and  life
expectancy of trees, hedgerows  or woodlands  (including  veteran trees or  ancient semi-natural
woodland), that provide a significant contribution to the amenity, biodiversity, landscape character
or historic character of the surrounding  area, will  not normally  be permitted, except where  there
are clear  overriding  reasons  for allowing  the development and  there are  no suitable alternatives.
Where such  impacts are  unavoidable, development proposals  must satisfactorily demonstrate
a net environmental gain  by appropriate mitigation, compensation or  offsetting.
The council  will seek  to ensure:
1. The sustainable management of trees,woodland and  hedgerows  including  provision  of new
planting within the infrastructure of new  development proposals  to provide  local
distinctiveness within the landscape, enable  climate adaptation resilience, and  support
biodiversity;
2. The planting and  sustainable growth of large  trees within new  development as  part of a
structured landscape  scheme  in order  to retain and  improve  tree canopy  cover  within the
borough  as a whole.
Justification
13.37 The National Planning Policy Framework states that ‘planning  permission  should  be refused
for development resulting in  the loss  or deterioration of irreplaceable  habitats, including  ancient
woodland  and the loss  of aged  or veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, unless  the need  for,
and benefits of, the development in  that location clearly  outweigh the loss’. Trees  will be assessed
in accordance  with the council’s  Amenity Evaluation Checklist for Trees  and  where  appropriate
protected by  the imposition of Tree  Preservation Orders (TPOs) to safeguard their amenity value  and
planning  conditions to ensure  protection and  prevent damage  during  the development process.
13.38 'Trees in Townscape', a guidance  document produced by the Trees and Design Action Group,
states that ‘ trees make  places  work, look  and feel better. As well  as playing  a role in climate proofing
our neighbourhoods  and supporting human  health and  environmental well-being, trees can  also help
to create conditions for economic  success. With over  80 per cent of the UK’s  population living  in
urban  settings, trees in  and around  built-up areas  – which  many  call the ‘urban  forest’ –  have  become
a key component of the infrastructure that makes  places  work, look  and feel better’.
13.39 The government's Forestry and Woodlands Policy Statement 2013 states that  ‘the protection
of the UK’s  trees, woods  and forests, especially   ancient woodland  is a top priority’ and ‘ new  and
better managed  woodland  also  has a role in making  our rural  and urban  landscapes  more  resilient
to the effects of climate change’
13.40 The UK Forestry Standard  (UKFS) 2013  also  sets out the government's approach   to
sustainable forestry and  helps  inform planning  decisions  by summarising  the legislation which  affects
trees and  woodlands, clarifies the role  of the Forestry Commission  and LPAs in  respect of woodlands,
setting appropriate standards  and  sets appropriate standards for woodland  management  or  creation
when  covered  by planning  legislation.
13.41 The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK NEA) provides  an analysis  of the UK’s  natural
environment in  terms of the benefits provided  to society and  continued economic  prosperity. The
Ecosystem approach encompasses social, economic and environmental factors that are interdependent
with biodiversity and  various  benefits that trees and  woodlands  provide.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 134
 Sustainable Environment13.42 Trees  and hedgerows  are an important element of the landscapes  and townscapes of the
area, where  they can  make  a valuable  contribution to visual  amenity. They may  have  historic
importance, as  part of wider  designed  landscapes  or be keys  to the history of the landscape  by
identifying former highways, settlements or  field boundaries. They may  also  have  ecological  value,
by providing  habitats for legally  protected and  priority species. It is  essential that the presence  of
existing trees be considered at an early stage in  the development process and that where appropriate,
provision  is made  for new  tree planting. Whilst trees can  be seen  as a constraint, with sympathetic
design  they can  enhance  a development.
13.43 Therefore development proposals  which  will result in  the loss  of trees or  hedgerows  that
provide  a significant contribution (including  trees or  woodlands  subject of a  Tree  Preservation Order,
hedgerows  which  are classed  as ‘important’ under  the Hedgerow  Regulations, those classified as
UK priority habitat) will  be discouraged.
13.44 The council  will encourage  proposals  which  seek  to increase  the planting of woodland  and
hedgerows  to introduce positive sustainable woodland  management -  particularly in  urban  areas  and
the urban  fringe, where  this will  contribute to the enhancement of landscape  character, amenity,
recreation, health and  welfare of residents, biodiversity, geological  and  historical conservation,
ecosystem services, tourism and  the economic  regeneration of the borough.

Green Infrastructure
13.45 Green infrastructure is  a network of multi-functional green  spaces, urban  and rural, which
are capable  of delivering  a wide  range  of environmental and  quality of life benefits for local
communities.  Green infrastructure has  a potentially important role  to play  in mitigating the impacts
of extreme weather events, particularly extended heat waves. In addition, green  infrastructure helps
support biodiversity and  makes  an important contribution to the quality of the environment. Access
to beautiful and  well-maintained green  spaces  such  as parks  and gardens, country parks  and wildlife
areas, supports both physical  and mental health and  well-being.
Policy SE 6
Green Infrastructure
Cheshire  East aims  to deliver  a good  quality, and  accessible  network of green  spaces  for people
to enjoy, providing  for healthy recreation and  biodiversity and  continuing to provide  a range  of
social, economic  and health benefits. This will  be done  by:
1. Linking  the various assets of Cheshire East’s unique landscape – its upland fringes, Cheshire
Plain, lowland heath, parkland estates, rivers, canals and watercourses, valleys and cloughs,
meres  and mosses, trees and  woodland  and wildlife habitats and  its distinctive towns and
villages  and their urban  fringe.
i. This network of green  infrastructure assets should  be safeguarded, retained and
enhanced  through the development of green  networks/wedges and  corridors.
135 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable Environmentii. Areas identified as  having  a shortage or  opportunities for the provision  of green
infrastructure should  be a particular focus for enhancement.
iii. Any development should  contribute to the creation of a  good  quality, integrated and
accessible  multi-functional network of green  spaces.
2. Safeguarding green  infrastructure assets to make  sure  that:
i. Development does  not compromise  their integrity or  potential value;
ii. Developer  contributions are  secured  wherever  appropriate in  order  to improve  their
quality, use  and multi-functionality; and
iii. Opportunities to add  to the green  infrastructure network are  maximised  through
partnership working.
3. Working  with partners, to support the potential of strategic green  infrastructure assets to
contribute to the aims  of the wider  green  infrastructure. The strategic green  infrastructure
assets(65) identified in  Cheshire  East are:
i. Weaver, Bollin, Dane  and Wheelock river  corridors  including  cloughs  and floodplains
ii. Macclesfield, Shropshire Union  (including  the Llangollen  and Middlewich  branches)
and Trent and  Mersey  canals
iii. Meres  and Mosses  Nature Improvement Area and  Local  Nature Improvement Areas
iv. Heritage town parks  and open  spaces  of historic and  cultural importance
v. Public rights of way, cycle  routes and  greenways
vi. Country parks  and estate parklands
vii. Peak Park Fringe
viii. The Cloud, Congleton Edge and  Mow  Cop  upland  fringe (connected by  the Gritstone
Trail)
ix. Sandstone Ridge
x. The ecological  network of habitats identified in  Policy SE 3
4. Strengthening the contribution that sport and  playing  fields , open  space  and recreation
facilities make  to Cheshire  East’s  green  infrastructure network by  requiring  all development
to:
i. Protect and  enhance  existing open  spaces  and sport and  recreation facilities;(66)
ii. Encourage multiple use  and improvements to their quality;
iii. Provide adequate open  space  (as outlined in  Table  13.1);
iv. Contribute to the provision  of outdoor sports facilities in  line with Policy SC 2;
v. Create or  add to the networks of multi-functional Green Infrastructure;
vi. Secure new  provision  to help  address  identified shortages in  existing open  space
provision, both in  quantity, quality and  accessibility;
vii. Locate open  space  facilities in  appropriate locations, preferably within developments;
and
viii. Promote linkages  between new  development and  surrounding  recreational networks,
communities and  facilities.
 
65 Strategic green  infrastructure assets are  those assets that either provide  or could  provide  wider  green  infrastructure
benefits.
66 To be Identified on  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Adopted Policies Map, plus  incidental open  space
and amenity areas  too small  to be  shown. Until this time the existing open  spaces  and sport and  recreation facilities
identified in  the Borough of Crewe  and Nantwich Local  Plan, Congleton Borough Local  Plan First Review  and the
Macclesfield Borough Local  Plan will  remain  in force.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 136
 Sustainable EnvironmentJustification
13.46 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'local planning  authorities should  set
out a  strategic approach  in their Local  Plans, planning  positively for the creation, protection,
enhancement and  management of networks of biodiversity and  green  infrastructure' .
13.47 The wide  variety of natural landscapes, biodiversity habitats, green  spaces, rural  areas  and
the network of footpaths and  bridleways  is seen  as one of the reasons  why Cheshire  East is  such  an
attractive place  to live  by local  people. There are  concerns  amongst local  people  about potential loss
of green spaces and other places  important for outdoor recreation and natural beauty and biodiversity.
The policy  links  with Policies SE 3  'Biodiversity and  Geodiversity', SE 4  'The Landscape', SE 5  'Trees
Hedgerows  and Woodlands'  and  SE 7   'The Historic Environment' linking  all the various  green  assets
of Cheshire  East from parks  and gardens  to woodland  copses, hedges  and ponds.
13.48 It is important to co-ordinate green  infrastructure provision  so that resources  are used
effectively.  The council’s  Green Space Strategy sets out the green  infrastructure assets and  the
various  partners involved  in green  space  provision. It contains a  vision, background  evidence,
recommendations and  an action plan.  The council’s  Open Space Assessment adds  further detail at
town and  village  level.
13.49 Provision of multi-functional green  infrastructure should  create: places  for outdoor relaxation
and play; space  and habitat for wildlife; opportunities to access  nature; climate change  adaptation;
opportunities for environmental education; space  for local  food production; improved  health and
wellbeing; reduced  air, water and  noise  pollution; green  transport routes to promote walking  and
cycling; and  improved  quality of place.  It can  also  play  a major  role in attracting economic  growth
and investment, increasing  land  and property benefits, promoting tourism, and  increasing  business
productivity.
13.50 Appropriate restoration following mineral  working  can provide  additional green  infrastructure
assets (See Policy SE 10  'Sustainable Provision of Minerals').
13.51 In the council’s  Green Space Strategy, the Open Space vision  is to provide  'a network of
clean, green, sustainable, attractive, well  maintained, safe areas  for all  ages, for formal and  informal
recreational activities, more formal outdoor sports or for sitting and relaxing, which are  easily accessible
and are well designed  to avoid  conflict and  build  community cohesion, whilst enhancing  our day to
day environment' .
13.52 Chapter 9  of the Green Space Strategy outlines Open Space Standards for the various  types
of open  space.
13.53 The combined  open  space  standards would  give a total figure of 2.6 hectares of open  space
per 1,000 population plus  developer  contributions for outdoor sports provision  – either enhancement
of existing sites or  towards the provision  of new  facilities.  In some  cases, commuted sums  generally
may be more appropriate for improvement of other open spaces and green infrastructure connectivity.
The requirement per  family dwelling  would  therefore range  from 40m2 per home  comprising  children’s
play and amenity green  space  – to 65m2 per home  comprising  children’s  play, amenity, allotments
and green connectivity plus a developer contribution for outdoor sports - in areas with severe  shortages
in open  space.  It is  likely  that the total amount of 65m2 per home  (plus  developer  contributions for
outdoor sports) would  be required  on major  greenfield and  brownfield development sites, though the
amount required  would  be influenced by  other available  evidence  at that time. The Open Space
Standards Table  below  shows  the open  space  requirement per  home  and also  shows  the equivalent
figure in hectares (per 1,000 population) that is  used to assess the amount of open space in a particular
neighbourhood  / community.
13.54 In some  cases, commuted sums  may  be required  for biodiversity offsetting/compensatory
habitat expansion. Developments should  incorporate biodiversity considerations in  their design  but
there is  still likely  to be  some  biodiversity loss. One way  to compensate for this loss  is by offsetting:
this includes  the provision  of compensatory habitat expansion  or restoration on  an alternative site.

13.56 Viability considerations will  be taken into account with any  development proposal  especially

13.57 Paragraphs 76  and 77 of the National Planning Policy Framework consider  Local  Green
Space designations: “Local  communities through local  and neighbourhood  plans  should  be able  to
identify for special  protection green  areas  of particular importance to them. By designating land  as
Local  Green Space local  communities will  be able  to rule  out new  development other than in  very
special  circumstances. Identifying land  as Local  Green Space should  therefore be  consistent with
the local  planning  of sustainable development and  complement investment in  sufficient homes, jobs
and other essential services. Local  Green Spaces should  only be designated when  a plan  is prepared
or reviewed, and  be capable  of enduring  beyond  the end  of the plan  period” . Paragraph 77  sets out
when  they might not be  appropriate : “The Local  Green Space designation will  not be  appropriate for
most green  areas  or open  space. The designation should  only  be used:
 where  the green  space  is in reasonably  close  proximity to the community it serves;
where  the green  area  is demonstrably special  to a local  community and  holds  a particular local
significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, recreational value (including
as a playing  field), tranquillity or  richness  of its wildlife; and
where  the green  area  concerned  is local  in character and  is not an  extensive tract of land."

Historic Environment
13.58 Our historic environment is  a finite resource  and an integral part of the unique  character and
distinctiveness of Cheshire  East. In essence, it helps  shape  our distinctive identity and  contributes
significantly to both the landscape  and townscape qualities of the borough.
13.59 Cheshire  East's historic environment includes  both visible  and below  ground  archaeological
heritage assets. Built heritage is  not solely  about physical  or architectural character, but just as
importantly, the technological, social  and cultural significance of a  building, feature or  place, both to
our community, but also  to the nation as  a whole. It is  also  important to maintain the integrity and
setting of designated and  un-designated heritage assets and  the features they contain. Many  of these
heritage assets are  vulnerable  to change  and are under  pressure.  Once damaged  or removed, they
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 138
 Sustainable Environmentare irreplaceable, to the detriment of both current and future generations.  Consequently, it is important
to the long  term well-being  of the borough  that there is  positive stewardship of its built heritage and
that its conservation and  management are  key priorities in  the future place-shaping  of Cheshire  East.
13.60 The council  is committed to conserving  the historic significance of the borough’s  heritage
assets, their setting and  the wider  historic environment. Cheshire  East’s  heritage is  an essential
component of its present and  its future. A critical component to achieving  a high-quality built
environment is  to ensure  that the borough’s  historic environment is  sustainably managed, enhanced
and protected, whilst supporting appropriate, sustainable development.
13.61 Once lost or  altered, features of the historic environment cannot be  replaced. It is  important
therefore that decision  making  is based  on a full understanding of the significance of heritage assets
affected by development, the impacts arising from those proposals  and the wider public benefit arising
from the proposed  development.
Policy SE 7
The Historic Environment
1. Cheshire East has an extensive and varied built heritage and historic environment, described
in the justification text to this policy. The character, quality and  diversity of the historic
environment will  be conserved  and enhanced. All new  development should  seek  to avoid
harm to heritage assets and make a positive contribution to the character of Cheshire East's
historic and  built environment, including  the setting of assets and  where  appropriate, the
wider  historic environment.
2. Proposals for development shall  be assessed  and the historic built environment actively
managed in order to contribute to the significance of heritage assets and local  distinctiveness.
Where a  development proposal  is likely  to affect a  designated heritage asset (including  its
setting) the significance of the heritage asset, including any contribution made by its setting,
must be  described  and reported as  part of the application.
3. The council  will support development proposals  that do  not cause  harm  to, or  which  better
reveal  the significance of heritage assets and will seek to avoid or minimise conflict between
the conservation of a  heritage asset and  any aspect of a  development proposal  by:
a. Designated Heritage Assets:
i. Requiring  development proposals  that cause  harm  to, or  loss of, a  designated
heritage asset and  its significance, including  its setting, to provide  a clear  and
convincing  justification as  to why  that harm  is considered  acceptable. Where that
case  cannot be  demonstrated, proposals  will not be  supported.
ii. Considering  the level  of harm  in relation to the public  benefits that may  be gained
by the proposal.
iii. The use  of appropriate legal  agreements or  planning  obligations to secure  the
benefits arising  from a  development proposal  where  the loss, in  whole  or in part,
of a heritage asset is  accepted.
139 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable Environmentb. Non-Designated Assets:
i. Requiring  that the impact of a  proposal  on the significance of a  non-designated
heritage asset should  be properly  considered, as  these are  often equally  valued
by local  communities. There should  be a balanced  consideration, weighing  the
direct and  indirect impacts upon  the asset and  its setting, having  regard  to the
scale  of any  harm  or loss. The presumption should  be that heritage assets should
be retained and  re-used  wherever  practicable and  proposals  that cannot
demonstrate that the harm  will be outweighed by  the benefits of the development
shall not be  supported. Where loss  or harm  is outweighed by  the benefits of
development, appropriate mitigation and compensation measures will be required
to ensure  that there is  no net loss  of heritage value
4. For all  heritage assets, high  quality design  should  be achieved. It should  aim to avoid  poorly
executed pastiche design  solutions and  should  foster innovation and  creativity that is
sensitive and  enhances  the significance of heritage assets in  terms of architectural design,
detailing, scale, massing  and use of materials.
5. Cheshire  East Council  will seek  to positively manage  the historic built environment through
engagement with landowners/asset owners  and other organisations and  by working  with
communities to ensure  that heritage assets are  protected, have  appropriate viable  uses,
are maintained to a  high  standard and  are secured  and have  a sustainable future for the
benefit of future generations. Proposals that conserve  and enhance  assets on  the Heritage
at Risk  register will  be encouraged.
 
Justification
13.62 The National Planning Policy Framework states that "local planning  authorities should  set
out in  their Local  Plan a  positive strategy for the conservation and  enjoyment of the historic
environment, including  heritage assets most at risk  through neglect, decay  or other threats. In doing
so, they should  recognise  that heritage assets are  an irreplaceable  resource  and conserve  them in
a manner  appropriate to their significance".
13.63 Cheshire  East contains a  much  valued, varied  and  unique  built heritage. This is  a key
contributor to the quality of life and  economic  attractiveness of the borough  and has a positive and
important role  to play  in achieving  a sustainable community in  Cheshire  East. The council  will expect
new developments to respect and  promote the distinctive local  heritage of the area, including  the
historic silk  industry in  Macclesfield, the importance of the rail  industry in  Crewe  and the distinctive
qualities of towns and  villages  across  the borough.
13.64 Key assets include  Macclesfield's silk  and industrial heritage, Little Moreton Hall, Crewe's
railway  heritage, Tatton Park, Lyme  Park, Quarry Bank Mill, Tegg's Nose  Country Park, the canal
network, historic towns and  parts of the Peak District National Park, amongst others. Specific unique
attractions include  a wealth of historic parks  and gardens  and the Lovell  Telescope  at Jodrell  Bank.
The area's stately homes  and historic parks  and gardens  are a particular feature of Cheshire  East
and pose  particular challenges  as well as opportunities. There are  76 conservation areas  and 2,638
listed buildings  including  47 grade  1 and 179 grade  2* listed buildings.
13.65 There is  also  a wealth of locally  important heritage assets that are  not formally designated,
but which  are equally  valued  and cherished  by local  communities, ranging  from smaller  assets such
as boundary  markers  and railings, to larger  buildings  and structures, and  historic landscapes, veteran
trees and  ancient woodlands. Much  of this local  heritage remains  unrecorded  and therefore it is
essential that the impact of proposals  upon  these non-designated assets is  also properly  considered
in assessing  development proposals. The council  is, therefore, committed to protecting buildings,
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 140
 Sustainable Environmentstructures, townscape features of particular local  interest and  value, and  cherished  landmarks, which
are not statutorily designated, including  historic parklands.
13.66 The borough  also  has a rich archaeological  resource  ranging  from the prehistoric period  to
the Second World War, including sites such as the Bridestones Neolithic chambered tomb, the Roman
and medieval  saltworking remains  of Middlewich, the Roman  and waterlogged deposits of Nantwich
the Saxon Sandbach Crosses, the site of the Civil  War  Battle of Nantwich and  the defences of the
former airfield at Cranage. It also  has a diverse  historic landscape  character, ranging  from medieval
field systems to 20th Century fieldscapes.
13.67 In order  to properly  understand the nature, significance and  physical  extent of assets of
archaeological  interest, programmes  of mitigation in  the form of desk-based  assessment, field
evaluation, recording of the asset, minimising the impact through design modification, may be required.
Retaining as  much  as possible  of the character of surviving  historic landscapes  can enhance  the
local distinctiveness and  attractiveness of new  development.
13.68 Designated heritage assets are  those that are  recognised  as having  national heritage
significance and/or benefiting from statutory protection and  comprise:
Conservation areas
Listed buildings
Scheduled monuments
Registered parks  and gardens
Registered battlefields
World  Heritage Sites
13.69  Non-designated heritage assets are  locally  important heritage assets which  often have  a
strong local  affinity or  association and  comprise:  
Areas of archaeological  interest (including  areas  of archaeological  potential and  sites of
archaeological  importance)
Buildings of local  architectural or  historic interest (local  list)
Locally  important assets not on  the local  list
Locally  significant historic parks  and gardens
Other locally  important heritage landscapes
13.70 Securing high  quality design  is very  important to conserving, enhancing  and enriching  the
unique  heritage and  local  identity of the borough.  With respect to setting, and  wider  context, new
developments should  respect the local  character, massing, and  scale  of the area. 
13.71 Design  innovation will  be positively encouraged  to create architecture that is  clearly  of today
and the heritage of tomorrow, but which  also marries  with and  responds  to the wider  historic context.
Whilst poor  quality, ill  considered  pastiche design  will be discouraged, architecture that focuses on
local traditions, character and  craftsmanship will  also  be supported and  encouraged. For both
contemporary and  traditional design  solutions, a  focus on  achieving  quality, sense  of place  and local
distinctiveness will  be essential in  order  to be  supported in  heritage sensitive contexts.
13.72 Cheshire  East Council  has a range  of responsibilities and  statutory powers  to positively
manage  the historic environment.  In order  to safeguard and  maximise  the gain  from the borough’s
heritage assets, the council  will seek  to use  these measures  appropriately and  responsibly  for the
public  benefit in  order  to conserve  and enhance  the borough’s  historic environment. An increasingly
important issue  for the historic environment is  the harm  arising  from heritage crime.  As part of the
management of the historic environment, the council  will seek  to work  with local  communities and
other partners to deliver  the heritage crime  programme  in Cheshire  East.
13.73 Monitoring and  reviewing  the status and  condition of important heritage assets will  be an
important activity, particularly where  there are  known  development pressures  and/or they are  assets
being  at risk, in  particular on  the Heritage at Risk  Register.

Renewable and Low Carbon Energy
13.75 The world's climate is  in a period  of warming. Scientists suggest "there is  an overwhelming
scientific consensus  that climate change  is happening, and  that it is  primarily  the result of human
activity, '(67)mainly through the combustion of fossil fuels that result in the release  of greenhouse gases
such  as carbon  dioxide.
13.76 Continued global  warming  will result in  many  changes  to the environment, both locally  and
internationally. Anticipated changes  include  'average global  temperatures [rising] by  up to 6°C by  the
end of this century. This is  enough  to make  extreme weather events like  floods and  drought more
frequent and  increase  global  instability, conflict, public  health-related deaths and  migration of people
to levels  beyond  any of our  recent experience. Heat waves, droughts, and  floods would  affect the UK
too'.(68)
13.77 The social, environmental and  economic  costs of climate change  could  be huge  if no  global
action is  taken to reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions. Therefore, international, European and  national
legislation has  been  introduced to achieve  a reduction of global  carbon  emissions  in order  to reduce
the cause  and effect of climate change.
13.78 The UK legislation on  carbon  dioxide  emissions  is contained in  the UK Climate Change  Act
2008. This commits the UK to:
A 34%  (potentially increasing  to 42%)  reduction of 1990  Carbon  Dioxide  levels  by 2020
An 80%  reduction of 1990  Carbon  Dioxide  levels  by 2050
13.79 The UK government has  also  committed to increasing  the percentage of energy  generated
from renewable  resources. The Renewable  Energy Directive 2009, states that ' by 2020, 15  per cent
of energy  should  be generated from renewable  resources' .
13.80 In order  for Cheshire  East to contribute to the achievement of these objectives, there is  a
need  to introduce policies  that encourage  the reduction of carbon  dioxide  emissions  and encourage
the implementation of renewable  and low carbon  energy.

Renewable and Low Carbon Energy
1. The development of renewable  and low carbon  energy  schemes  (including  community-led
initiatives), together with any  ancillary  building(s)  and infrastructure, will  be positively
supported and  considered  in the context of sustainable development and  any impact on
the landscape.
2. Weight will  be given  to the wider  environmental, economic  and social  benefits arising  from
renewable  and low carbon  energy  schemes, whilst considering  the anticipated adverse
impacts, individually  and cumulatively upon:
i. The surrounding  landscape  including  natural, built, historic and  cultural assets and
townscape; including  buildings, features, habitats and  species  of national and  local
importance and  adjoining  land  uses; and  / or
ii. Residential amenity including visual intrusion, air, dust, noise, odour, traffic generation,
recreation and  access; and  / or
iii. The operation of air  traffic, radar  systems, electromagnetic transmissions, and  the
Jodrell  Bank Radio  Telescope.
3. Appropriate mitigation measures  to address  any effects identified and  considered  (for all
low carbon  and renewable  schemes)  will be required  prior  to any  development proceeding.
4. Given the nature of some  forms of renewable  and low carbon  energy  schemes  and their
supporting infrastructure and  ancillary  building(s), it will  be necessary  and appropriate in
certain instances, to secure  removal  of the scheme  and its supporting infrastructure and
ancillary  building(s)  and restore the land  to an  appropriate use  once  a scheme  is ready  for
decommissioning, through the imposition of planning  conditions.
5. Planning permission  for wind  energy  development involving  one or more  wind  turbines will
only be granted if:
i. the development site is  in an area  identified as  suitable for wind  energy  development
in the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document or  Neighbourhood  Plan;
and
ii. following consultation, it can  be demonstrated that the planning  impacts identified by
affected local  communities have  been  fully addressed  and therefore the proposal  has
their backing.
 
Justification
13.81 The National Planning Policy Framework states that the planning  system should  'support
the transition to a  low carbon  future in  a changing  climate, taking full account of flood risk  and coastal
change, and  encourage  the re-use  of existing resources, including  conversion  of existing buildings,
and encourage  the use  of renewable  resources  (for example, by  the development of renewable
energy)' . It also  states that 'planning plays  a key role  in helping  shape  places  to secure  radical
reductions in  greenhouse  gas emissions, minimising  vulnerability and  providing  resilience  to the
impacts of climate change, and  supporting the delivery  of renewable  and low carbon  energy  and
associated infrastructure. This is  central to the economic, social  and environmental dimensions  of
sustainable development' .
13.82 There are  various  sources  of renewable  and  low carbon  energy  that can  be applied  in
Cheshire  East. It is  anticipated that the following technologies will  be the most viable  and feasible:
143 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable EnvironmentSolar thermal and  photovoltaics on  south facing buildings  throughout the Borough. Ground
mounted schemes  may  be appropriate where  they do  not conflict with other policies  of the plan
Combined  heat and  power  and district heating will  play an important role, particularly in  strategic
and major  employment, retail, residential, community and  other developments where  there are

environment and  surrounding  ecology
are mitigated

A potential supply  of deep  geothermal
heat has  been  identified in  the borough,
particularly at Crewe, that offers potential
to generate renewable  energy
Advanced thermal treatments
Wind turbines of small, medium and  large
scale
13.83 Renewable  and low carbon  energy  has the potential to contribute to the borough’s  electricity
supply. Assessments of technical and  environmental constraints, as  well as the potential landscape
and visual  impact studies of renewable  and low carbon  energy  development across  the borough,
should  be used  to help  identify suitable locations appropriate for renewable  and low carbon  energy
development.
13.84 Whilst the council’s  evidence base studies makes reference to, and identify potential locations
suitable for renewable  and  low carbon  technologies, this does  not mean  that technologies will
automatically be granted consent within the identified areas. Equally, it should not restrict development
for technologies (other than wind  turbine development) outside of the identified areas, or  mean  that
technologies will  automatically be  refused consent if outside the identified areas.
13.85 Following the Written Ministerial Statement on  18th June  2015  and associated update to
Planning Practice Guidance, areas  suitable for wind  energy  development will  be formally identified
in the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.

Energy Efficient Development
1. The council  will look favourably upon  development that follows the principles  of the Energy
Hierarchy, and   seeks  to achieve  a high  rating under  schemes  such  as BREEAM (for
non-residential development), CEEQUAL (for public-realm  development) and  Building for
Life. For non-residential development, this will  be especially  so where  the standard attained
exceeds  that required  by the current Building Regulations (or  as updated).
2. Non-residential development over  1,000 square  metres will  be expected to secure  at least
10 per cent of its predicted energy  requirements from decentralised and  renewable  or low
carbon  sources, unless  the applicant can  clearly  demonstrate that having  regard  to the type
of development and  its design, this is  not feasible or  viable.
3. In those areas  identified as  'District Heating Network Priority Areas'(69) or within large  scale
development elsewhere, new  development should  contribute to the development of a
strategic district heating network, where  feasible and  viable, by  seeking  to make  use of
available  heat (including  geothermal) and  waste heat as  follows:
i. Large  and mixed  use developments of over  100 dwellings  or non residential
development of 10,000 square  metres gross  floor space  should  install a  site-wide
district heating network.
ii. Smaller developments of 10 or more dwellings  or non residential development of 1,000
square  metres gross  floor space  should  connect to any  available  district heating
network.
4. Where a  district heating network does  not yet exist, applicants should  demonstrate that the
heating and  cooling  equipment installed is  capable  of connection to a  network at a  later
date.
5. New development should  be designed  to maximise  the ability to accommodate a  district
heating solution in  terms of overall  layout, phasing, mix  of uses  and density.
6. Development with high  energy  demands  should  give  consideration to its potential role  in
providing  an anchor  load  for a  district heating network.
7. In those areas  that are  not connected to the gas  network, new  development will  be
encouraged  to deliver  its residual  energy  from low  and zero  carbon  sources.
Justification
13.86 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'to support the move  to a low carbon
future, local planning authorities should: plan  for new development in  locations and ways which  reduce
greenhouse  gas emissions; actively support energy  efficiency improvements to existing buildings;
and when  setting any  local  requirement for a  building’s  sustainability, do  so in a way consistent with
the government’s zero carbon buildings policy and adopt nationally described standards' . It also states
that development should  'comply with adopted Local  Plan policies  on local  requirements for
decentralised energy  supply  unless  it can  be demonstrated by  the applicant, having  regard  to the
type of development involved  and its design, that this is  not feasible or  viable; and  take account of
landform, layout, building  orientation, massing  and landscaping  to minimise  energy  consumption' .

Sustainable EnvironmentFigure 13.3 Energy Hierarchy
13.87 Cheshire  East is  relatively constrained in  terms of its capacity to generate renewable  energy,
particularly from large  scale  technologies. Consequently, achieving  national and  local  targets to
reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and  increase  renewable  energy  generation will  be extremely
challenging. Without a  requirement for efficiency standards that exceed  the requirements of Building
Regulations on  large  sites, it would  be unlikely  to occur.
13.88 Cheshire East Council and Housing Associations will lead by example by seeking to maximise
energy  efficiency and  by incorporating renewable  energy  generation through the refurbishment and
redevelopment of land  and buildings  in their ownership.
13.89 This justification for the on-site low  carbon  energy  target is  drawn  from the Cheshire  East
‘Climate Change  and  Sustainable Energy Planning Research’  February 2011’, which  considers
technical feasibility and  financial viability. This approach  is justified by  the particular challenges  and
characteristics of the borough. The target seeks  to achieve  a balance  between the social, economic
and environmental imperative of higher standards and the commercial realities of property developers.
The council  recognises  that this will  in some  cases  remain  a challenging  target, particularly for certain
building  types, and  so it will  be acceptable to achieve  average  compliance  across  all buildings  in a
development.
13.90 Compliance with this requirement should be demonstrated through completion of the Standard
Assessment Procedure (SAP) which  assesses  the energy  rating of development. This process  is
already  required  to demonstrate compliance  with Part L  of the Building Regulations. If viability is
uncertain, applicants should  use open  book  accounting to allow  the determination of viability.
13.91 The purpose  of the ‘district heating network priority areas’  is to prioritise district heating in
areas  where  the potential is  greatest and  to take advantage of available  heat sources  such  as
geothermal or  waste heat. The development of District Heating Networks to serve  strategic
developments and  areas  where  there are  major  energy  users  are being  explored. However, it is
recognised  that delivering  District Heating Networks cannot be  achieved  though planning  alone. The
aim of this policy  is to ensure  that new  development makes  an appropriate contribution.
13.92 The design  and layout of site-wide networks should  be such  as to enable  future expansion
into surrounding communities. Where appropriate, applicants may be required  to provide land, buildings
and/or equipment for an  energy  centre to serve  existing or  new development, irrespective of whether
the scheme  is currently in  operation.
13.93 The viability of district heating schemes  is heavily  influenced by  a development’s  density,
mix of use, layout and  phasing. Residential development should  normally  be at least 55  dwellings
per hectare and  a minimum  size  of 100  homes. Mixed  use development can  allow  densities to be
lower  and can provide  a good  ‘anchor’  development (i.e. provides  a high  and stable heat load  over
the day  and year). The cost of district heating pipes  is high  and so the layout of a  development should
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 146
 Sustainable Environmentseek  to minimise  the length of pipe  needed. The on-site network should  consider  how  it can  be
connected to a  strategic network in  future.
13.94 The council  is committed to encouraging  households  and businesses  located in  areas  off
the gas  network to move  away  from heating systems powered  by liquid  gas, oil  or electricity towards
low and zero  carbon  technologies. Applications for new  development in  areas  off the gas  network
will be expected to comply  with this requirement. This will  have  economic  benefits for the occupants
as well as contributing to the achievement of national and  local  carbon  dioxide  and renewable  energy
targets.
13.95 Government targets in relation to greenhouse gas reduction are recognised to be challenging.
Government and  industry experts recognise  that construction practice may  be unable  to keep  pace
with the ambitious targets imposed  and from this the notion of 'Allowable Solutions' was  created.
These 'Allowable Solutions' are  a way  of providing  flexibility for low  and zero  carbon  development
and are likely  to be  an identified set of on, off and  near-site options or  projects that will  be used  to
offset the remaining  greenhouse  gas emissions  of a proposal.  
13.96 The proposed  framework for zero  carbon  buildings  policy  including  allowable  solutions has
yet to be fully confirmed by government and is currently being developed at the national level. Cheshire
East Council  will align  with the national prescribed  scheme, once  in place, or  look  to establish local
mechanisms if the national scheme is not introduced as planned, to improve  the viability of development
under the zero carbon requirements. Money raised through allowable solutions, or  its locally established
alternative, will  contribute towards the delivery  of energy  efficiency and  greenhouse  gas reduction
priorities identified by  Cheshire  East Council. Further guidance  on this will  be given  at site allocations
stage following further national guidance  on this matter expected from the government.

13.97 Minerals  make  an essential contribution to the nation's economy  and quality of life providing
the materials for infrastructure, buildings, energy  and goods.  Cheshire  East contains a  range  of
mineral  resources  of local  and  national economic  importance.  Minerals  currently worked  in the

Sustainable Provision of Minerals
Cheshire  East will  make  provision  for an  adequate and  steady supply  of minerals  in support of
sustainable economic  growth without unacceptable adverse  impacts on  the environment having
considered  the need  to conserve  finite natural resources  as far as  possible  and safeguard them
for future generations.
To achieve  this, the council  will:
1. Make  appropriate provision  for the supply  of aggregates having  regard  to Cheshire  East’s
apportionment of sub-national supply  guidelines  and Local  Aggregate Assessments.
2. Seek to maintain aggregate landbanks  of at least 7  years  sand  and gravel  and at least 10
years  crushed  rock  supply  over  the plan  period.
3. Make  appropriate provision  for the supply  of permitted silica  sand  reserves  at each  site
equivalent to at least 10  years  production throughout the plan  period, or  at least 15  years
at sites where  significant new  investment is  required.
4. Identify suitable locations for potential sand  and gravel, silica  sand  and salt extraction in
the Site Allocations and Development Policies Document. These will  take the form of specific
sites, preferred areas  and/or areas  of search  where  appropriate.
5. Encourage and  support the provision  and use of suitable alternative materials to land-won
minerals in order to minimise the need for new primary extraction and  conserve finite natural
resources.
6. Safeguard Cheshire  East’s  important mineral  resources  of silica  sand, sand  and gravel,
sandstone (including  building  stone), salt and  surface coal  through the definition of Mineral
Safeguarding Areas, which  will be defined in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies
Document and  will include  environmental designations, urban  areas  and buffer zones, plus
development management criteria. Within these areas, mineral  resources  will be protected
from unnecessary  sterilisation by  other development.
7. Safeguard existing and  potential minerals  associated infrastructure against other
development in  close  proximity which  may  potentially constrain its current or  future use.
8. Support the extraction of natural building  and roofing stone needed  for architectural and
heritage purposes  where  environmentally acceptable.
9. Not support proposals  for peat extraction from new  or extended sites.
10. Encourage and  support the transportation of minerals  by alternative methods to road  where
practicable.
11. Secure at the earliest opportunity the high standard restoration and aftercare of sites following
mineral  working, recognising  the diversity of appropriate restoration schemes  to deliver  the
potential for beneficial afteruses.
12. Recognise  the need  for the afteruse of underground  salt cavities for gas  storage purposes
in response  to national energy  policy.
13. Set out environmental criteria in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document
against which  all minerals  proposals  will be assessed  to ensure  operations do  not have
unacceptable adverse  impacts on  the natural and  historic environment or  on human  health.
 
Justification
13.98 Aggregates are  the essential raw  material needed  in almost any  construction activity such
as new  housing  and infrastructure.  Cheshire  East is  a producer  of sand  and gravel  and, to a  small
scale, crushed  rock  (sandstone) used  for aggregate purposes.  To  meet the future demand  for
aggregates, supply  levels  set out in  National and  Sub-National Aggregate Guidelines have  been
apportioned between the Mineral  Planning Authorities of the North West through agreement between
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 148
 Sustainable Environmentthe North West Aggregates Working  Party.  Table  13.2 sets out Cheshire  East’s  contribution to
sub-national supply and overall provision based on rolling forward annualised average apportionments

13.99 Levels  of aggregate supply  to meet demand  will be reviewed  when  necessary  following the
publication of updated National and Sub-National Aggregate Guidelines.  Local Aggregate Assessments
(LAAs) will  also  be prepared  annually  to assess  the supply  and demand  of aggregates in  Cheshire
East based  on 10-year  sales  averages  and other relevant information, identifying if any  shortfall or
surplus  exists.
13.100 In order  to provide  security of aggregate supply, provision  should  be made  to maintain
minimum  aggregate landbanks  of at least 7  years  sand  and gravel  and at least 10  years  crushed
rock supply  throughout the plan  period.  Landbanks  will be used  to monitor the security of aggregate
supply  from Cheshire  East, indicating if a  review  of provision  is needed, and  as a consideration when
assessing  the need  for new  planning  permissions.
13.101 Our evidence base tells us that there is  a sufficient crushed rock aggregate landbank across
permitted sites, but that additional sand  and gravel  reserves  will be required  within the period  up to
2030  in order  to maintain a  landbank  consistent with national policy.  Provision for sand  and gravel
supply  in Cheshire  East will  be made  through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document.
13.102 Silica sand  resources  in Cheshire  East are  recognised  as being  of national economic
importance.  In response  to national planning  policy, the Authority is, therefore, required  to ensure
that a  steady and  adequate supply  of this raw  material is  provided. Due  to the national need  for silica
sand, it is  important that each  production site is  adequately provided  for, unless  exceptional
circumstances prevail.  Therefore a  minimum  stock of permitted reserves  for at least 10  years
production should  be maintained at individual  sites throughout the plan  period, or  for at least 15  years
at new  or existing sites where  significant new  capital investment is  required(74). Silica sand  quarries
in Cheshire East also produce quantities of sand for sold aggregate purposes and, therefore, contribute
to the overall  supply  and landbank  of aggregate sand  and gravel.
13.103 To enable  the provision  of a steady and  adequate supply  of both aggregate and  industrial
minerals, allocations in the form of specific sites, preferred areas and/or an area of search for potential
future minerals  development will  be identified through the Site Allocations and  Development Policies
Document.  This approach to allocations is considered to offer a level of certainty as to where potential
mineral  extraction may  take place, whilst providing  a degree  of flexibility to meet needs  over  the plan
period.  This will  involve  reviewing  existing allocations in  the Cheshire  Replacement Minerals  Local
Plan 1999.  New allocations will be subject to necessary environmental assessment and sustainability

Sustainable Environmentappraisal.  New  sites, or  extensions to existing sites for future peat extraction, will  not be  included
consistent with national planning  policy.
13.104 The consumption of primary  (land-won)  mineral  resources  can be offset by  alternative
materials such  as secondary  or recycled  aggregates produced  as industrial by-products or  from
construction, demolition and  excavation (CD&E) waste.  Whilst it is  acknowledged  not all  primary
minerals  can feasibly be  replaced, proposals  offering to provide  suitable alternative materials in
appropriate locations should  be supported in  order  to limit the need  for land-won  extraction and  help
to secure  the long  term conservation of finite natural resources.  The Minerals  and Waste DPD will
identify appropriate sites needed  for the management of CD&E waste, including  for aggregate
recycling.
13.105 As mineral  resources  are finite and  can only  be worked  where  they naturally occur, in
accordance  with the principles  of sustainable development, they should  be safeguarded in  order  to
meet the needs  of future generations.  Mineral  resources  considered  for safeguarding in  Cheshire
East for their economic  importance include:
Silica (industrial) sand,
Sand and  gravel
Sandstone (including  for building  stone purposes)
Salt
Surface coal
13.106 The broad  extent of these resources  is shown  on the Mineral  Resources  in Cheshire  East
map (Figure 13.4).  This is  based  on mineral  resource  data provided  by the BGS and  The Coal
Authority.  This data will  provide  the basis  for the definition of Mineral  Safeguarding Areas (MSAs)
in the Minerals ands Waste DPD, subject to refinement through consultation with the minerals industry
and others.
Figure 13.4 Mineral Resources in Cheshire East (based on BGS/Coal Authority data)
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 150
 Sustainable Environment13.107 The purpose of MSAs is to prevent the needless sterilisation of mineral resources by alerting
to their presence.  This factor can  then be  given  appropriate consideration in  the planning  process.
MSAs do  not preclude  other (non-mineral)  forms of development being  permitted within them, nor
do they carry any presumption that the mineral resource will be worked.  Where it can be demonstrated
that it is  environmentally feasible and  practicable, the prior  extraction of the mineral  resource  will be
encouraged  ahead  of necessary  development.
13.108 Prior extraction is  the process  by which  a mineral  is won  from a  site prior  to non-mineral
development taking place. This can  take place  at a number  of different scales, which  would  depend
on the size  of the site, the depth of mineral, the type and  quality of the mineral, and  the nature of the
proposed  development. In line  with the requirements of the NPPF, the Minerals  and Waste DPD will
set out policies  to encourage  the prior  extraction of minerals, where  practicable and  environmentally
feasible, if it is  necessary  for non-mineral  development to take place.
13.109 In safeguarding sites for existing, planned  and potential minerals  associated infrastructure
(as set out in  the NPPF), including  for secondary  and recycled  materials, appropriate consideration
will also  be given  to the potential constraints that proximal  (non-mineral)  development may  place  on
the operation of this infrastructure.
13.110  Cheshire  East will  work  with the minerals  industry and  others to ensure  that MSAs are
based  upon  the best available  information and  that all  relevant mineral  associated infrastructure has
been  considered.  Accompanying policy  will be set out in  the Minerals  and Waste DPD to support
the practical implementation of determining proposals  in these areas  in line with best practice
guidance(75).
13.111 Cheshire East has a valued, varied and unique built heritage.  The provision of locally-sourced
building and roofing stone is therefore important to enable the repair and maintenance of built heritage
assets in  support of their long  term conservation as  well as ensuring  sensitivity of design  in proximity
to designated and  local  heritage assets and  their settings This complements the aims  of Policy SE
1 ‘Design’  and Policy SE 7  ‘The Historic Environment'.
13.112  Proposals for the extraction of peat at new  or extended sites in  Cheshire  East, will  not be
supported, reflecting the national planning  policy  position on  peat extraction.
13.113  Substantial environmental benefits can  be achieved  by replacing  the road  borne
transportation of minerals  with alternative methods such  as rail, waterway, pipeline  or conveyor. 
Whilst it is recognised that given  the nature of mineral extraction in Cheshire East, road often presents
the only  feasible option, alternative methods will  be  encouraged  and supported wherever  this is
practicable.
13.114  Mineral  working  is a temporary use  of land, although it often takes place  over  long  periods
of time.  The restoration and subsequent aftercare of mineral sites following the completion of extraction
can provide  opportunities to deliver  a range  of sustainable, positive and  beneficial after-uses.  This
includes agriculture, forestry/native woodland, nature conservation, amenity and  recreation.  Restored
land can also help  adapt to or  mitigate the effects of climate change  and contribute to Cheshire  East’s
network of green  infrastructure, consistent with Policy SE 6  ‘Green Infrastructure’.  The most
appropriate restoration schemes  to deliver  the potential for beneficial afteruses will  be determined
on a site-by-site basis.
13.115  Local  geological  circumstances in  Cheshire  East have  demonstrated their feasibility for
natural gas storage purposes in underground cavities, created following the extraction of salt (in brine)
with the suggested potential for carbon  storage.  In response  to national planning  policy,
encouragement should  be given  to such  afteruse, subject to ensuring  that the appropriate integrity
and safety measures  are satisfactorily secured.  Government has  identified the need  for gas  storage
capacity to contribute to national energy  security.

unacceptable adverse impacts on the natural and historic environment or on human  health.  In addition
to the relevant polices  in this plan, detailed policies  will be brought forward through the Minerals  and
Waste DPD setting out criteria against which  all mineral  related planning  proposals, including  for
hydrocarbon  resource  development, will  be assessed, consistent with national planning  policy  and
guidance.

Waste
13.117  The major  streams of waste arising  in the borough  include  municipal  or local  authority
collected (including  household); commercial  and industrial; construction, excavation and  demolition;
and hazardous.  Waste management has  changed  significantly over  the last twenty years  in the UK
with a  major  decrease  in waste being  disposed  of to landfill and  an increase  in recycling  - a trend
experienced  in Cheshire  and Cheshire  East.  New  technologies are  also  emerging  to manage  waste
as a resource  offering benefits such  as energy  generation.
13.118 A key aim of the government is to move towards a 'zero waste economy'(76) in which material
resources  are re-used, recycled  or recovered  wherever  possible, and  only  disposed  of as  the last
option.  To  achieve  this, waste must be  managed  according  to the principles  of the 'Waste Hierarchy'.

Sustainable Management of Waste
To achieve  the sustainable management of waste in  Cheshire  East, the council  will:
1. Expect all  proposals  for waste management development to maximise  opportunities for
waste to be  managed  in accordance  with the principles  of the Waste Hierarchy  whereby
priority will  be given, in  order, to its (i)  prevention; (ii)  preparation for re-use; (iii)  recycling;
(iv) other recovery; and  (v) disposal.
2. Meet the predicted needs  of Cheshire  East through provision  of sufficient opportunities for
waste management facilities in  appropriate locations, including  for waste disposal.  This
will be achieved  through the preparation of a  Waste Development Plan Document (DPD).
This plan  will:
i. Identify sites and  areas  suitable for new  or enhanced  waste management facilities for
the identified waste management needs  of Cheshire  East(77) over  the plan  period.
ii. Integrate with Cheshire  East’s  municipal  waste management strategy.
iii. Set out policies to ensure that proposals for the management of waste do not endanger
human  health or  cause  environmental harm.
 
Justification
13.119  A key  objective of sustainable development is  to produce  less waste and  wherever  possible
use it as  a resource.  To  deliver  this, the management of waste must be  driven  up the ‘Waste
Hierarchy’(78) whereby options for management are  prioritised in order according to their environmental
impact.  The most sustainable and  environmentally friendly option is  to reduce  the amount of waste
that is  produced  in the first place.  When waste is  created, priority is  then given  to preparing  it for
re-use, then to recycling  (including  composting), then to recovery  (including  energy  generation), and
last of all  disposal  (for example  landfill).
13.120 Specific policies  and the allocation of sites for waste development in  Cheshire  East will  be
set out in  the Minerals  and Waste DPD.  This will  be prepared  with regard  to the Waste Management
Plan for England and  in consistency with national waste planning  policy(79). Production of the Waste
DPD will  follow the timetable outlined in  the Local  Development Scheme (LDS) to ensure  the timely
provision  of new  facilities.
13.121 The Minerals  and Waste DPD will  identify and  address  the waste management needs  of
Cheshire  East and  plan  for appropriate provision  based  on analysis  of the best available  waste data
and appraisal  of options.  This will  be based  upon  updated evidence  on the authority's waste arisings
(for all  waste streams), its management capacity and  on cross  boundary  waste flows both into and
out of the authority area.
13.122 Sites and  areas  in the borough  suitable for new  or enhanced  waste management facilities
will be identified consistent with criteria set out in  national waste planning  policy  and, if necessary,
safeguarded for this use.  Recognition will  be given  to the benefits of co-locating waste management
facilities and  the potential for new  technologies that use  waste as  a resource  to help  drive  its
management up  the Waste Hierarchy.

79 The National Planning Policy Framework does  not contain specific waste policies. Updated national waste planning
policy  has been  published  as part of the Waste Management Plan for England replacing  the existing national waste
planning  policy  contained in  Planning Policy Statement 10  (PPS10): Planning for Sustainable Waste Management.
153 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable Environment13.123 The Minerals  and Waste DPD will  also integrate with the council’s  municipal  waste strategy
to ensure Cheshire  East's waste is managed in the most sustainable way, reducing reliance on landfill.
13.124 Policy will  be set to ensure  that the environment and  human  health is  protected through
the prevention or  mitigation of the adverse  impacts of the generation and  management of waste,
complementing other relevant policies  in the Local  Plan.
13.125 It is recognised  that waste management is  strategic in  nature and  that movements of
materials cross  administrative boundaries. Preparation of the Minerals  and Waste DPD will  involve
engaging  with other relevant Waste Planning Authorities to address  any issues  of cross  boundary
waste movements based  on the evidence  available.

Pollution
13.126 The Local  Plan plays  a key role in determining the location of development that may  give
rise to pollution, either directly or  indirectly, and  in ensuring  that other uses  and development are  not,
as far as  possible, affected by  major  existing or  potential sources  of pollution. Development should
avoid  and, if necessary, mitigate against environmental impacts.
Policy SE 12
Pollution, Land Contamination and Land Instability
1. The council  will seek  to ensure  all development is  located and  designed  so as not to result
in a harmful or  cumulative impact upon  air quality, surface water and  groundwater, noise,
smell, dust, vibration, soil  contamination, light pollution or  any other pollution which  would
unacceptably affect the natural and  built environment, or  detrimentally affect amenity or
cause  harm. Developers  will be expected to minimise, and  mitigate the effects of possible
pollution arising  from the development itself, or  as a result of the development (including
additional traffic) during  both the construction and  the life of the development.  Where
adequate mitigation cannot be  provided, development will  not normally  be permitted.
2. Development for new  housing  or other environmentally sensitive development will  not
normally  be permitted where  existing air  pollution, soil  contamination, noise, smell, dust,
vibration, light or  other pollution levels are unacceptable and there is no reasonable prospect
that these can  be mitigated against.
3. Development should  support improvements to air  quality, not contradict the Air Quality
Strategy or  Air Quality Action Plan and  seek  to promote sustainable transport policies.
4. Where a  proposal  may  affect or  be affected by  contamination or  land  instability (including
natural dissolution and/or brine  pumping  related subsidence), at the planning  application
stage, developers  will be required  to provide  a report which  investigates the extent of the
contamination or  stability issues  and the possible  affect it may  have  on the development
and its future users, the natural and  built environment. This report should  be written in  line
with best practice guidance.
5. In most cases, development will  only be deemed  acceptable where  it can  be demonstrated
that any  contamination or  land  instability issues  can be appropriately mitigated against and
remediated, if necessary.
 
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 154
 Sustainable EnvironmentJustification
13.127 The National Planning Policy Framework states that the planning  system should  'prevent
both new  and existing development from contributing to or  being  put at unacceptable risk  from, or
being  adversely  affected by  unacceptable levels  of soil, air, water or  noise  pollution or  land  instability' ;
as well as ‘remediating and  mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land,
where  appropriate’
13.128 The council  strongly supports the need  to protect the environment and  residents from the
effects of pollution. Some types of development may  cause  or contribute to air  quality, water or  land
pollution. The council  will therefore seek  to make  sure  that levels  are kept to a  minimum  through the
construction phase  and  life of the development, and  are not detrimental to human  health, the
environment or  the amenity of neighbouring  or nearby  users, or  the users  of the development itself.
13.129 Paragraph 124  of the NPPF requires  that planning  policies  should  sustain compliance  with,
and contribute towards, EU Limit values  or national objectives for pollutants, taking account of the
presence  of Air Quality Management Areas and  the cumulative impacts on  air quality for individual
sites in  local  areas. Planning decisions  should  ensure  new  development in  (or which  may  affect) an
Air Quality Management Area is  consistent with the current Cheshire  East Air Quality Action Plan.
13.130 One approach  to dealing  with the cumulative impact of developments is  through the
preparation of a  low emissions  strategy designed  to accelerate the uptake of low  emissions  fuels and
technologies in  and around  development sites. Cheshire  East Council  is currently in  the process  of
producing  a low emission  strategy for the borough.
13.131 Noise  and vibration can  lead  to harm  or be detrimental to amenity. Whilst planning  cannot
control the noise  or vibration from existing established development, it can  try to ensure  that new
noise  sensitive development is  not close  to existing sources  which  generate noise, such  as industrial
uses, noise  created by  vehicles  and other forms of transport or  even  evening  uses  such  as hot food
takeaways. This policy will seek to ensure development is planned appropriately, so new developments
which  have  the potential to create noise  are not located in  places  where  they would  unacceptably
affect the natural and  built environment, or  detrimentally affect amenity or  cause  harm.
13.132 Noise  and  vibration during  the construction process  can often cause  disturbance and
detrimentally affect amenity to occupants of neighbouring  properties. The council  will, where  necessary,
seek  to attach planning  conditions assessing  each  case  on its individual  merits.
13.133 Lighting is  an important part of ‘everyday  life’ as  it can  be used  to improve  the appearance
and character of an  area/building, as  a security feature and  a way in which  uses  can be extended for
longer  periods  of time (into the evening  hours)  thereby causing  potential noise  issues. The council
is aware of the increasing issues arising from artificial lighting, which can often impact upon residential
amenity, the character and  appearance  of an  area  (particularly rural  locations) and  the environment.
Aspects such  as poor  design, location, the expel  of unnecessarily  high  levels  of light can  have  a
harmful impact.  In addition, lighting left on  unnecessarily  is a waste of energy.
13.134 Whilst not all forms of lighting require planning permission, the council will, where appropriate,
seek  to influence light pollution that would  have  a harmful impact upon  the natural/built environment
and amenity.
13.135 Contamination is  not always  restricted to previously  developed  land, it can  be located on
greenfield land  and can arise  from natural sources  as well as from human  activities. Development
on land  which  is known  or suspected to be  contaminated, or  for uses  which  would  be particularly
vulnerable  in terms of exposure  to contamination (such  as housing  or schools), must be  supported
by sufficient information to enable  the possible  contamination risks  to be  fully assessed. It is  essential
that measures  are then put in  place  which  allows  the development to go  ahead  safely.
155 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable Environment13.136 Natural conditions such  as landslides  (due  to geology, angle  of land), soluble  rocks  or
mining  activities such  as coal  mining  or subsidence  caused  by brine  pumping(80) can cause  land
instability. Guidance on  areas  affected by  brine  pumping  is available  as part of the pre-application
advice  process  (generally, this issue  affects Middlewich, Sandbach and  North Cheshire). Specific
conditions may  need  to be  applied  to address  the impact of ground  instability in  these areas.
Development on  land  which  would  be affected by, or  would  affect land  stability must therefore be
accompanied  by a report which  identifies the risk. Development on  land  where  instability cannot be
mitigated and  remediated will  not normally  be allowed.
13.137 The council will seek the advice of the appropriate regulatory/statutory organisations including
the Environment Agency, Health and  Safety Executive, Manchester Airport, The Coal  Authority and
The Cheshire Brine Subsidence Compensation Board on proposals falling within defined consultation
zones. There are a number of installations and pipelines in the borough handling  notifiable substances
and the Proposals Map  will indicate consultation zones  appropriate to their uses.
13.138 Further guidance  on the above  will be provided  in subsequent planning  policy  or
Supplementary Planning Documents.

Flood Risk and Water  Management
13.139 In  recent years, floods have  shown  how  vulnerable  the UK is  to extreme weather events,
resulting in  significant economic, social  and environmental cost.  Whilst Cheshire  East may  not have
experienced  devastating fluvial or  surface water flood events as  seen  in 2007, 2009, 2012  and 2014,
the number  and severity of recent floods seems  to be  on the increase  and climate change  means
that the frequency, pattern and  severity of flooding are  expected to increase.
13.140  Effective land  use management has  become  one of the most important ways  to manage
flood risks  and improve  community resilience.  Sustainable development in  the right locations can
help reduce  the quantity of water entering our  river  and drainage  networks, improve  water quality
within the borough  and provide  opportunities to enhance  biodiversity, health and  recreation.
13.141 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and  its supporting Technical  Guidance
sets out the approach  that Local  Planning Authorities and  developers  should  follow in  considering
flood risk, including  a hierarchy  of flood risk  assessment documents.
13.142 Cheshire  East Council  as a local  planning  authority is  required  to undertake a  Strategic
Flood Risk  Assessment (SFRA) to identify areas  at risk  of flooding from all  sources. For Cheshire
East, this is  flooding from rivers  (fluvial), canals  and  reservoirs, groundwater, surface water and
sewers, and  the implications of climate change. The SFRA will  then in  turn inform the Local  Plan
Strategy.  
80 There is  a statutory duty under  the Cheshire  Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act, 1952  to consult
with the Cheshire  Brine Subsidence Compensation Board for all  development within certain prescribed  consultation
areas.

Flood Risk and Water  Management
Developments must integrate measures  for sustainable water management to reduce  flood risk,
avoid an adverse impact on water quality and quantity within the borough  and provide opportunities
to enhance  biodiversity, health and  recreation, in  line with national guidance, by  ensuring  that:
1. All development follows the sequential approach  to determining the suitability of land  for
development, direct new development to areas at lowest risk  of flooding and where necessary
apply  the exception test; this should  take into account all  sources  of flooding identified in
the Cheshire  East SFRA.
2. All planning  applications for development at risk  of flooding are  supported by  an appropriate
Flood Risk  Assessment (FRA) to demonstrate that development proposals  will not increase
flood risk  on site or  elsewhere  and opportunities to reduce  the risk  of flooding are  sought,
taking into account the impacts of Climate Change  in line with the Cheshire  East SFRA.
New development will  be required  to include  or contribute to flood mitigation, compensation
and / or protection measures, where  necessary, to manage  flood risk  associated with or
caused  by the development.
3. New development is  designed to be safe, taking into account the lifetime of the development,
and the need  to adapt to climate change.
4. All developments, including changes to existing buildings, seeks improvements to the current
surface water drainage  network and  be designed  to manage  surface water. This should  
include  appropriate sustainable drainage  systems (SuDS) and  green  infrastructure to store,
convey  and treat surface water prior  to discharge  with the aim  of achieving  a reduction in
the existing runoff rate, but must not result in  an increase  in runoff. It is  not sustainable to
dispose  of surface water via  the public  sewer  systems; applicants seeking  to drain  to the
public  sewers  must demonstrate there are  no other more  sustainable viable  options. Where
appropriate, opportunities to open  existing culverts should  be identified.
5. Where water infrastructure capacity is  an issue, all  major  development must demonstrate
that there is  adequate infrastructure in  place  to serve  the development.
6. New development enhances  and protects surface and  ground  water quality and  complies
with the Water Framework Directive in  ensuring  that development does  not cause  a
deterioration in the status of inland waters, unless suitable mitigation measures are in place;
and
7. New development incorporates water efficiency measures.
 
Justification
13.143 The Cheshire  East area  predominantly covers  the Cheshire  Plain, a  flat, lowland  area,
which  is characterised by  watercourses running  in well-defined floodplains and  localised  areas  of
hilly terrain.  To  the northeast, this includes  part of the western Peak District, an  upland  area  forming
the southern end  of the Pennines.  This area  has steep topography, and  is characterised by  steep
sided  valleys  and large  numbers  of minor  watercourses.
13.144 The main  source  of flood risk  in Cheshire  East is  from main  rivers  and  Ordinary
Watercourses.  Whilst the overall  level  of risk  from these sources  is low, there are  principal  town
centres such  as Crewe, Macclesfield and  in Key Service Centres such  as Congleton, where  risk is
greater due  to the presence  of a densely  urban  population.  In these urban  areas, watercourses can
often be  modified with straightened and  culverted sections, especially  where  rivers  flow underneath
major  railway  and road  infrastructure.
13.145 Cheshire  East Council  (CEC) published  the Cheshire  East Level  1 Surface Water
Management Plan (SWMP) in  July  2012.  The SWMP project brought together existing flood risk
157 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable Environmentinformation from CEC, the Environment Agency and  United Utilities  to assess  the surface water flood
risk across  the study area, first through a  strategic review  of flood risk  and then an  assessment of
particular sites potentially at high  risk from flooding. The strategic review  of flood risk  across  the study
area has indicated that the overall  level  of surface water flood risk  is moderate.  In particular:
Due to the flat nature of the topography, there is  likely  to be  extensive surface water flooding
resulting from an  extreme rainfall event.  This flooding is  unlikely  to be  deep  or fast flowing,
except in  localised  areas, and  only  small  numbers  of properties are  likely  to be  affected.
Deep  flooding is  only  likely  to be  experienced  where  there are  localised  low-points, such  as
natural closed  depressions, or  man-made  features, for example  underground  car parks  or
subways.
In a small  number  of locations, steep topography is  likely  to result in  surface water flooding along
well defined flow-paths.  Flooding in  these areas  has the potential to represent a  significant
hazard  to people  due to its velocity and  depth.
There are  likely  to be  a number  of locations throughout the study area  where  surface water and
fluvial flooding mechanisms  are likely  to interact.  In these areas, it may  be difficult to identify
the exact source of any flooding, and CEC and the Environment Agency will have to work together
to manage  these issues.
There are  a large  number  of Ordinary Watercourses within the study area, some  of which  run
through urban  areas.  In many  cases, these watercourses have  been  culverted over  and are
likely  to be  in poor  condition.  A blockage  or collapse  of one  of these culverts could  represent a
significant flood risk  to adjacent properties.
13.146 As a  local  planning  authority, Cheshire  East Council  should  use the flood risk  evidence
collected through the SFRA and SWMP to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding
by directing development away  from areas  at highest risk, but where  development is  necessary,
making it safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere.  This should be carried out through the planning
process, specifically during  the development of the Local  Plan.
13.147 The NPPF also  states that Local  Plans should  'take account of climate change  over  the
longer  term, including  factors such  as flood risk, coastal change, water supply  and  changes  to
biodiversity and  landscape'.
13.148 As a Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) the council has a number of roles and responsibilities
within local  flood risk  management as  required  under  the Flood Risk  Regulations 2009  and the Flood
and Water Management Act 2010.
13.149 The Flood Risk  Regulations require  the Council  to develop  a Preliminary Flood Risk
Assessment (PFRA). The Cheshire East PFRA was published in June 2011. The PFRA did not identify
a Flood Risk  Area using  the national significant thresholds set by  Defra.  As a  result, the next stages
of the PFRA process, the requirement to develop  flood risk  hazard  mapping  and  Flood Risk
Management Plans, do  not apply  to Cheshire  East Council. However, the Environment Agency is
currently in  the process  of updating their national Flood Map  for Surface Water (uFMfSW), which  is
expected to meet the requirements for flood risk  hazard  mapping  and will be available  to Cheshire
East Council  later in  2013.
13.150 Under the Flood and Water Management Act, Cheshire East, as the LLFA, has  responsibility
for developing a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS) for their area covering local sources
of flooding.  The local  strategy produced  must be  consistent with the national strategy.  It will  set out
the local organisations with responsibility for flood risk in the area, partnership arrangements to ensure
co-ordination between these, an  assessment of the flood risk  and plans  and actions for managing
the risk.  The strategy will  outline how  the council  intends to deliver  its remaining  duties under  the
Act. The council  now has additional permissive  powers  of control over  ordinary  watercourses to help
manage  flood risk  across  the borough  (notably new  regulatory duties under  Land  Drainage  Act 1991
and any associated Byelaws currently being  considered).
13.151 The Cheshire  East LFRMS is  currently being  prepared  and the findings of the Cheshire
East SFRA and  the Cheshire  East SWMP should  help  inform its development.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 158
 Sustainable Environment13.152 Wider national policy  contained within Catchment Flood Management Plans (CFMPs) and
River  Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) should  also  influence how  flood risk  is managed  at a local
level.
13.153 A CFMP provides  a detailed overview  of flood risk  from multiple sources  and policies  for
long-term management of flood risk  within the catchment that take into account the likely  impacts of
climate change, the effects of land use and  land management, deliver multiple benefits and contribute
towards sustainable development.  This is  critical when  areas  under  development pressure  coincide
with high  flood risk. 
13.154 Chosen  policies  and  actions can  be used  to influence the location of development.
Development should be focused towards the more 'sustainable' areas in terms of lower risk of flooding
or where  flood risk  management is  considered  viable  within the short and  long-term plans. 
Development should  be avoided  in those areas  where  it is deemed  inappropriate, to reduce  flood
risk now  and in the future.  Therefore, development should  not rely  on the future policy  direction, as
Environment Agency led  Flood Risk  Management infrastructure investment is  not there to support
future development, but rather to protect current properties and  people  at risk.  Where development
is planned  in high  risk areas, private (developer)  funding will  be required  to reduce  risk.  In this
instance, development may  not be  viable.  Cheshire  East is  located in  two CFMP catchments; the
Upper  Mersey  and the Weaver  Gowy.
13.155 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is  to deliver  improvements across  Europe in  the
management of water quality and  water resources  as well as improving  the physical  state of water
courses  and improving  in-channel  habitat.  The WFD requires  all inland  and coastal waters to reach
“good  ecological  status” by  2015  through a  catchment-based system of River  Basin Management
Plans (RBMPs). The Water Environment Regulations (2003)  transposed the WFD into law  in England
and Wales  and the Environment Agency is  leading  on its delivery.
13.156 Cheshire  East is  within the North West River  Basin District and  the Environment Agency
published  the final North West River  Basin Management Plan in  December  2009.  The main
responsibility for the council  is to work  with the Environment Agency to develop  links  between river
basin management planning and the development of Local Authority plans, policies and assessments. 
In particular, the programme of actions (measures) within the River Basin Management Plan highlights
the need  for:
Water Cycle  Strategies,
Considering the WFD objectives (achieving good status or potential as appropriate) in the spatial
planning  process, including  LDDs  and Sustainable Community Strategies, and
Promoting the use  of Sustainable Drainage  Systems (SuDS) in  new  development.
13.157 Cheshire  East Council  has set up  strategic partnerships with Cheshire  West and  Chester
Council, Warrington BC, Halton BC and  St Helens  BC.  The Cheshire  and Mid Mersey  Partnership
Group also serves to ensure consistency amongst the councils in their approach to water management
issues.
13.158 New development should  incorporate water efficiency measures  as much  as is practicable.
Standards of water efficiency for residential and  commercial  development will  be further defined at
Site Allocations and  Development Policies stage.

and is home  to the iconic  Lovell  Telescope  (grade  I listed building)  which  is a prominent feature within
the Cheshire  East landscape.
13.160 The council  recognises  that Jodrell  Bank is  a unique  site which  is of significant scientific
and historical value. Accessible to the general  public, this site is  an important contribution to the
borough’s  tourism economy  and has the potential to attract many  more  national and  international
visitors to the region.

Peak District National Park Fringe
1. Within the Peak District National Park Fringe(81) development that would  affect the setting
of the Peak District National Park will  be resisted where  it compromises  the statutory
designation and  purposes  of the National Park.
2. Development will  be considered  on its individual  merits having  particular regard  to the type,
scale  and location taking account of the Peak District National Park Landscape  guidelines
and characteristics of the South West Peak and  the adjoining  areas  of the Cheshire  Plain.
 
Justification
The Peak District National Park is  an asset of national, regional, and  local  importance. It was  the first
of 15  national parks  in the United Kingdom to be  designated for their spectacular landscapes, cultural
heritage and  wildlife, and  for people  to enjoy.
13.164 The Environment Act (1995) establishes the statutory purposes of national park designation,
as:
to conserve  and enhance  the natural beauty, wildlife and  cultural heritage of the national parks;
and
to promote opportunities for the understanding and  enjoyment of the special  qualities [of the
parks] by  the public.
13.165 Section 62  of the Act places  a general  duty on  all relevant authorities, statutory undertakers
and other public  bodies, to have  regard  to these purposes.
13.166 Special Qualities define what is  distinctive and  significant about the Peak District compared
with other parts of the country. Understanding these qualities helps  us to plan  effectively and  manage
the national park  in order  to protect them.
13.167 In the Peak District National Park Core Strategy, they are described  as valued characteristics
and include:
Natural beauty, natural heritage, landscape  character and  landscapes.
Sense of wildness  and remoteness.
Clean  air, earth and  water.
Importance of wildlife and  the area’s  unique  biodiversity.
Thousands of years  of human  influence which  can be traced through the landscape.
Distinctive character of hamlets, villages  and towns.
Trees, woodlands, hedgerows, stone walls, field barns  and other landscape  features.
Significant geological  features.
Wealth of historic buildings, parks  and gardens.
Opportunities to experience  tranquillity and  quiet enjoyment.
Easy access  for visitors and  surrounding  urban  areas. 
Opportunities to experience  dark  night skies.
Vibrancy  and a sense  of community.

Figure 13.5.
161 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Sustainable EnvironmentCultural heritage of history, archaeology, customs, traditions, legends, arts, and  literary
associations.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation and  adventure. 
Environmentally friendly methods of farming and  working  the land.
Craft and  cottage industries.
Opportunities to improve  physical  and emotional well-being.
Special values  attached to the national park  by surrounding  urban  communities.
The flow of landscape  character across  and beyond  the national park  boundary.
13.168 The Peak District National Park is  a complex  tapestry of different landscapes  in which  there
are three distinct areas. The South West Peak sits along  the boundary  of the Peak Park Fringe but
also includes  parts of this area  in order  to reflect the flow of landscape  character (a  feature which  is
reflected in  the list of special  qualities above). It is  particularly characterised by  its sloping  valleys
with woodlands  which  are described  within the Peak District National Park Landscape  strategy as:
'a pastoral landscape  with a  varied  undulating topography of steep slopes, low  ridges  and incised
valleys. Blocks of woodland  are a characteristic feature of this landscape, together with patches of
acid grassland  and  bracken  on steeper slopes  and  higher  ground. This is  an area  of traditional
dispersed  settlement with probable  ancient origins. Views  to lower  ground  are framed by  woodlands
and valley  sides. This landscape  covers  extensive tracts of the western slopes  of the South West
Peak, in  the landscapes  rising  above  Macclesfield and  Leek. '
13.169 In places, the boundaries  of the Peak District National Park follow administrative rather
than landscape  boundaries. Through consultation, the council  will seek  to work  with the Peak District
National Park to ensure  that all  new  developments within the Peak District National Park Fringe will
not have  an adverse  impact upon  the purposes  of the Peak District National Park and  its valued
characteristics, having particular regard  to the type and scale of the development and the Peak District
National Park Landscape  Assessment and  Strategy.

Connectivity14 Connectivity
14.1 National planning  policy  seeks  to reduce  car use and to encourage  people  to adopt more
sustainable travel habits. The NPPF requires  local  authorities to support a  pattern of development
that facilitates the use of sustainable modes of transport, locate significant trip generating development
where  the need  to travel is  minimised  and promote a  mix of uses  within walking  distance of homes.
14.2 The targets for housing  and employment growth in  the borough  further strengthen the need
for adequate supporting infrastructure including the provision of new transport infrastructure, measures
to restrain car  use  and  increase  use  of public  transport, cycling  and  walking  as well  as other
improvements. 
14.3 The relationship between Local  Transport Plans and  the Local  Plan Strategy is  crucial  to
implementing the objective of managing transport demand and promoting accessibility and integration,
both across  Cheshire  East and  with neighbouring  areas. The Local  Plan Strategy aims  to capitalise
on the strengths of the existing transport system in  Cheshire  East, including  good  transport links  to
major  centres by  way  of the rail  and motorway network. It sets out how  we will seek  to improve
connectivity in  the future.
14.4 The scale of development proposed  will require significant investment in transport infrastructure
and a step change  in the provision  of public  transport and  other sustainable modes. The economic
strength of Cheshire  East, and  the quality of life on  offer, very  much  depend  on the accessibility,
speed, quality and  cost of transport facilities. Therefore, increasing  accessibility and  promoting
sustainable travel is  a key theme within the Local  Plan Strategy.
14.5 We must also  be realistic about the challenges  we face. The way  we travel is  changing  to
adapt to climate change  and new  technologies, the age  profile of the population and  shifts in  the
global  economy.
14.6 Good transport links  are crucial  for a  successful economy, thriving towns and  rural  areas  and
a good  quality of life for all  our residents. We  want to make  sure  that our  transport system enables
people  to safely get to the places  they want to, when  they want to, that people  can walk  and cycle
as a real alternative to the car and that our transport system is integrated across all modes of transport.
Sustainable Travel and Transport
14.7 The challenge  for the Local  Plan Strategy is  twofold; to redress  shortfalls in  infrastructure and
improve  connectivity to support economic  growth, whilst changing  the need  for travel and  the way
we travel, by  promoting new  and sustainable options.
Policy CO 1
Sustainable Travel and Transport
To deliver the council objectives of delivering a safe, sustainable, high quality, integrated transport
system that encourages a modal shift away from car travel to public transport, cycling and walking;
supportive of the needs  of residents and  businesses  and preparing  for carbon  free modes  of
transport, the council  will expect development to:
1. Reduce  the need  to travel by:
i. Guiding development to sustainable and  accessible  locations or  locations that can  be
made  sustainable and  accessible;
ii. Ensuring development gives  priority to walking, cycling  and public  transport within its
design;
iii. Encouraging more  flexible working  patterns and  home  working;
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 166
 Connectivityiv. Supporting improvements to communication technology for business, education,
shopping  and leisure  purposes  and;
v. Supporting measures that reduce the level of trips made by  single occupancy vehicles.
2. Improve pedestrian facilities so  that walking  is attractive for shorter journeys(82) including:
i. Supporting the priority of pedestrians at the top of the road  user  hierarchy  and making
sure that in  settlements, town centres and  residential areas, the public  realm
environment reflects this priority;
ii. Supporting safe and  secure access for mobility and visually impaired persons including
mobility scooter users  and parents with pushchairs;
iii. Creating safe and  secure  footways and  paths linking  with public  transport and  other

iv. Ensuring new  developments are  convenient, safe and  pleasant to access  on foot;
v. Supporting work  to improve  canal  towpaths and  public  rights of way  where  they can
provide  key linkages  from developments to local  facilities;
vi. Supporting measures  that introduce safe routes to schools; and
vii. Ensuring a  selective and  ongoing  review  of speed  limits, as  appropriate.
3. Improve cyclist facilities so  that cycling  is attractive for shorter journeys(83) including:
i. Creating safe and  pleasant links  for cyclists travelling around  the borough;
ii. Providing secure  cycle parking facilities at new  developments, at public transport hubs,
town centres and  at community facilities;
iii. Improving route signing;
iv. Working  with community groups  to develop  local  cycling  initiatives and  seek  external
funding to assist with the development of the local  network; and
v. Supporting the priority for cyclists over  single  occupancy  vehicles  by making  sure  that
in settlements, town centres and residential areas, the public realm environment reflects
this priority.
4. Improve public  transport integration, facilities, capacity, service  levels, access  for all  users
and reliability(84) including:
i. Rail infrastructure -  current schemes  comprise:
a. Improvements to Crewe  Railway  Station, promoting its role  as a national rail  hub
and providing  associated connectivity for buses;
b. Supporting the aspiration for re-opening  the Sandbach to Northwich railway  line
to passengers  including  the opening  of a station at Middlewich;
c. Supporting proposals  for rail  infrastructure and  the provision  of rail  facilities as
appropriate; and
d. Engaging in  proposals  for improving  rail connectivity through High  Speed Rail.
ii. Bus Infrastructure -  current schemes  comprise:
a. Improvements to Crewe  Bus Station.
iii. Improving public  transport service  levels, which  may  involve  developers  temporarily
subsidising new bus services or the extension of an existing service to provide additional
journeys, or  supporting community transport initiatives to enable  sustainable access
to new  development;

5. Improve and develop  appropriate road, rail and water freight transport routes and associated
intermodal freight transport facilities in  order  to assist in  the sustainable and  efficient
movement of goods.
Justification
14.8 The National Planning Policy Framework states that "transport policies  have  an important role
to play in facilitating sustainable development but also in contributing to wider sustainability and health
objectives. Smarter use  of technologies can  reduce  the need  to travel. The transport system needs
to be  balanced  in favour of sustainable transport modes, giving  people  a real choice  about how  they
travel'. Therefore 'encouragement should be given to solutions which support reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions  and reduce  congestion ".
14.9 To effectively influence the individual’s  choice  about their mode  of travel, a  range  of options
must be  available  that provide  accessible, attractive, safe and  reliable  alternative options in  respect
of cost, time and  convenience. Public transport has  an important role  to play  in planning  for
sustainability and  future needs  by facilitating sustainable developments, as  well as by encouraging
a shift towards low  carbon  transport. An increase  in the number  of shorter journeys  made  on foot will
contribute towards sustainability by  reducing  carbon  emissions, as  well as being  beneficial for health
and tackling congestion.
14.10 Investment in  a high  quality public  realm  linking  housing, employment and  town and  village
centres encourages  people  to walk  and cycle  and positively manages  vehicular  access  that enables
more  sustainable patterns of travel. Well  designed  places  with excellent public  realm  can quickly
establish the key  function of a  place  therefore promoting the legibility of towns and  villages, and
encouraging  more  sustainable lifestyles.
14.11  Cheshire  East has  strong links  with neighbouring  areas  with an  extensive road  and rail
network including the M6 and West Coast Main Line giving access to Greater Manchester and London
Euston.
14.12 An effective freight network is essential for delivering sustainable economic growth. However,
the transportation of freight on  roads  through existing residential areas  would  not be  considered
appropriate.
14.13 Policy Y1 (Travel  to Education) of the Local  Transport Plan 2011-2026  states that the council
will work  with schools  and colleges  to enable  sustainable travel to education, including  appropriate
provision  for those eligible  for free or  assisted transport.
14.14 Policy H8  (Road  Safety) of the Local  Transport Plan 2011-2026  states that the council  will
improve  road  safety and  take account of vulnerable  road  users. This includes  the consideration of
where  reduced  speed  limits would  be appropriate (e.g. 20's Plenty Campaign  for residential areas).
14.15 As currently proposed, the line  of High  Speed 2  (HS2) passes  through the borough. HS2 will
have  significant benefits for the borough  and the sub-region  and is anticipated to connect to the West
Coast Main  Line  just south of Crewe  and  will travel through parts of the borough. In addition,
Manchester Airport lies  immediately to the north of the borough  offering world  wide  services.
14.16 Improved cross  boundary  and public  transport connections are  sought with all  surrounding
Local  Authority areas  and will be progressed  through ongoing  Duty to Co-operate arrangements.

Policy CO 2
Enabling Business Growth Through Transport Infrastructure
The council  will support new  developments that are  (or can be made)  well  connected and
accessible  by:
1. Minimising  the future need  to travel by  locating new  development in  locations where  there
is a good  range  of housing, jobs, shops  and services  already  accessible  by public  transport,
cycling  and walking(85).
2. Enabling development by supporting transport infrastructure, regeneration and / or behaviour
change  initiatives that will  mitigate the potential impact of development proposals(86)
including:
i. Supporting schemes  outlined within the current Infrastructure Delivery  Plan / Local
Transport Plan;
ii. Where new  or improved  infrastructure is  provided, supporting measures  to improve
the walking, cycling  and sustainable travel environment on  routes relieved  of traffic;
iii. Supporting improvements to communication technology for business, education,
shopping  and leisure  purposes;
iv. Supporting the improvement of rail infrastructure - especially facilities at railway stations;
v. Supporting the improvement of national motorway network facilities, where appropriate;
vi. Providing recharging  points for hybrid  or electric vehicles  in major  developments in
order  to reduce  carbon  emissions; and
vii. For residential and  non-residential development, where  there is  clear  and compelling
justification that is  it necessary  to manage  the road  network, proposals  should  adhere
to the current adopted Cheshire  East Council  Parking Standards for Cars  and Bicycles
set out in  Appendix C  (Parking Standards).
3. The council  will support the economic  benefits of High  Speed 2  whilst ensuring  that
environmental and  community impacts are  minimised. Safeguarding Directions for Phases
2a and 2b of High  Speed 2  (January  and November  2016)  are in place  and are shown  on
the Policies Map  and the relevant Figures within the Crewe  section of Chapter 15  of this
document, along  with further detail within the Policy for site LPS 3  'Basford West'.
4. The council  will work  with neighbouring  transport authorities and  support proposals  which
mitigate the wider  impacts of development and  improve  connectivity, particularly by  public
transport, so  that the opportunities provided  by economic  growth can  be accessible  to a
wider  population. Where appropriate, developers  will be required  to provide  information on
cross  boundary  impacts and  how  these will  be addressed  through improvements to
sustainable travel options, which  may  include  contributions to cross  boundary  transport
strategies where  they exist.
85 In line  with Policy S1: Spatial Planning of the Local  Transport Plan 2011-2026.
86 In line  with Policy B2: Enabling Development of the Local  Transport Plan 2011-2026.
169 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Connectivity5. Proposals for the safeguarding of disused transport corridors will be supported. Recreational
and appropriate uses  for disused  transport corridors  may  be allowed  provided  they do  not
preclude  eventual re-use  for transport purposes  or impact on  public  safety(87).
 
Justification
14.17 Paragraph 17 of the NPPF states that 'significant development should be  focused in locations
which  are or can be made  sustainable'  . Good transport connections are  integral to our  ambitious
plans  for economic  growth and  to the protection of our  environment to ensure  a sustainable future
for all  our residents and  businesses.
14.18 A selection of the major  highway  schemes  listed in  the Infrastructure Delivery  Plan include:
A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road
Improvements to the Crewe  Green Roundabout junction and  completion of Crewe  Green Link
Road  South
Macclesfield Town  Centre Movement Strategy
Congleton Link  Road
Poynton Relief Road
Middlewich  Eastern Bypass
Junction improvements on  the A51 corridor  north of Nantwich
Improvements to the A534 corridor  in Sandbach, including  the M6  and A533 junctions
Improvements to the A34 and  A555 corridors  in Handforth
Improvements to the A537/A50 corridor  through Knutsford
Improvements to the junction of B5077 Crewe  Road/B5078 Sandbach Road  in Alsager.
14.19 The council  is committed to working  with adjacent local  authorities to mitigate the impact of
cross  boundary  travel. A refresh of the SEMMMS study is  underway  between Cheshire  East and
Greater Manchester Authorities and a cross boundary strategy will also be prepared with Staffordshire
County Council  and related Authorities. Developments may  be required  to contribute to any  identified
measures  where  appropriate. Public funding for transport interventions will  also  be sought where
appropriate.
14.20 Climate change  is nationally recognised  as one of the most important challenges  facing our
society. Transport accounts for 25%  of the carbon  dioxide  (CO2) emissions  in the UK and  personal
car travel is  the single  biggest contributor to individual  CO2 emissions.
14.21 Statistics indicate that, in  2011, Cheshire  East’s  residents, commerce  and industry and  other
non-residential energy  uses  resulted in  carbon  dioxide  emissions  of 3.159m tonnes. This equates to
8.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions  per person, which  is more  than the regional  average  of 7.0 tonnes per
person. However, CO2 emissions  per person  have  fallen in  recent years: from 10.6 tonnes in  2005
and 9.2 tonnes in  2010(88). This has  implications for local, regional  and national air  quality.
14.22 One of the most important ways  of reducing  carbon  emissions  is to reduce  the need  to travel,
particularly by  private car, and  to encourage  more  sustainable modes  of transport such  as cycling,
walking, buses  and trains. Development should  be located in  areas  close  to existing facilities and
shops, and  to transport hubs  and bus routes. Maintaining or  increasing  the mix  of uses  in an area
reduces  the need  to travel, as  well as adding  vitality and  diversity.
87 This applies  to sites of former railway  stations, sidings  etc, as  well as to the alignment of the line. Such areas  can
provide  essential space  for interchanges, car  parking, or  other facilities associated with the new  transport route.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 170
 Connectivity14.23 The improvement of key  transport links  on the highway  network will  allow  a better use  of the
network for bus  users  and cyclists. There is  also  the potential for high  occupancy  vehicle  lanes  to be
provided  in the future.
14.24 Another key  element is  to facilitate, where  possible, ICT, broadband  and other technologies
that remove the need to travel and to facilitate local access to these technologies.  A flexible approach
to the emergence  and uptake of new  technologies will  also  be required  where  these offer attractive
and affordable communication or  transport solutions.
14.25 The council  will seek  to ensure  that development includes  adequate parking  provision  for
bicycles. It will  also  seek  to ensure  that development includes  adequate car  parking  provision  where
there is  clear  and compelling  justification that is  it necessary  to manage  the road  network. Provision
should  be based  on the car  parking  standards set out in  Appendix C.
14.26 There is  a case  for Britain to develop  a high-speed  rail network, primarily  because  there is
a need  for additional rail  capacity in  the future if we  are to keep  our economy  moving. Building a
high-speed  railway  (rather than a  conventional speed  one)  is the best way  to do  this, as  the faster
journey  times encourage  people  to switch from other, more  carbon-hungry, modes  of transport such
as aviation or  car. Building new  fast lines  also  frees up  space  on the current railway  system to allow
more  commuter or  freight services, delivering  further economic  and environmental benefits.
14.27 High Speed 2  (HS2) is  the most significant transport infrastructure project in  the UK since
the motorways were built in the 1950s and 1960s. It will provide a high speed rail line between London
and Birmingham and  on to Manchester and  Leeds. Further details regarding  HS2 will  be included  in
the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Development Plan Document.

Digital Connections
14.28 Digital technologies have  been  a major  driving  force in  influencing and  shaping  industry and
society in  the 21st Century. Changes  that are  currently transforming our  working, learning, leisure
and community environments should  be given  due consideration and  accommodated in  the future
spatial design  of Cheshire  East.
Policy CO 3
Digital Connections
1. High capacity, leading  edge  digital communication networks will  be supported in  Cheshire
East to meet the needs  of businesses  and communities, subject to the number(s)  of radio
and telecommunications masts (and  sites for such  installations) being  appropriately located
and kept to a  minimum  and consistent with the efficient operation of the network.
2. Developers  will be required  to work  with appropriate providers  to deliver  the necessary
physical  infrastructure to accommodate information and  digital communications (ICT)
networks as  an integral part of all  appropriate new  developments.
171 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
ConnectivityJustification
14.29 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'advanced, high  quality communications
infrastructure are  essential for sustainable economic  growth. The development of high  speed
broadband  technology and  other communications networks also  plays  a vital role  in enhancing  the
provision of local community facilities and services. In preparing Local Plans, local planning authorities
should  support the expansion  of electronic communications networks, including  telecommunications
and high  speed  broadband'.
14.30 New developments must be  'future-proof' with appropriate digital infrastructure that will  meet
existing and  future communication needs. It is  essential that the Council  works  with developers  to
make  sure  that the appropriate digital infrastructure is  incorporated, including  4G and  5G networks.

Travel Plans and Travel Assessments
Policy CO 4
Travel Plans and Transport Assessments
All major  development proposals  that are  likely  to generate significant additional journeys  will
be accompanied  by a Transport Assessment and, where  appropriate, a  Travel  Plan which  will
address  the following requirements:
1. The Transport Assessment will  need  to demonstrate that the capacity and  efficiency of the
highway  network will  not be  severely  affected as  a result of the development. This should
be undertaken in  accordance  with the latest Cheshire  East Council  guidance;
2. The Transport Assessment and  associated Travel  Plan should  demonstrate how  the
proposed development will link into and enhance existing walking, cycling or public transport
infrastructure;
3. The Travel  Plan will  need  to propose  measures  that will  mitigate the impact of increased
trips generated on  the highway  network;
4. The Travel Plan should propose measures to facilitate and  encourage the use of sustainable
travel alternatives (such  as walking, cycling  or public  transport use), whilst discouraging
single  occupancy  vehicle  travel and  parking; and
5. Major  developments will  be required  to monitor the effectiveness of the travel plan  and the
traffic generated by  that development and  share  data with the Local  Authority.
 
Justification
14.31 The  National Planning Policy Framework states that 'all developments that generate significant
amounts of movement should  be supported by  a Transport Statement or  Transport Assessment' .
14.32 Proposals for developments that are  likely  to have  a significant transport impact will  be
required  to include  a Transport Assessment and  / or associated Travel  Plan. This provides  the
opportunity to assess  traffic generation, identify measures  to reduce  traffic congestion and  improve
accessibility by  facilitating and  encouraging  sustainable modes  of transport (walking, cycling, public
transport use  and car sharing).
14.33 A Travel  Plan is  essentially an action plan designed to help organisations implement measures
to reduce  the need  for travel and  to facilitate and  encourage  the remainder  to travel more  sustainably.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 172
 ConnectivityIt should  help  to reduce  local  traffic congestion, car  parking  problems  and help  to promote healthy
lifestyles, economic  growth and  environmental improvements.
14.34 For any  new  development, it is  important to encourage  sustainable travel options from day
one of occupation before car-based  travel habits become established. Travel Plans can be origin-based
(Residential Travel  Plans) or  destination-based (Workplace  / Business Travel  Plans).
14.35 Travel  Plans can  help  overcome  concerns  about new  development by  finding new  ways  of
addressing travel needs and demonstrating how to influence travel choices. They also offer numerous
benefits to developers, businesses, employers, employees, residents and the local community. Further
information on  the purpose  and benefits of Travel  Plans and  advice  on how  to prepare  a Travel  Plan
is provided  in the Cheshire  East Travel  Planning Guidance Note.
14.36 Where there are  major  development proposals  close  to the council’s  boundary, the council
will ensure  that the cross  border  impacts are  considered  as part of the Transport Assessment and
liaise  with the neighbouring  transport authority.

175 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations
15.1 Paragraph 157  of the National Planning Policy Framework states that the Local  Plan Strategy
should  ‘allocate sites to promote development and  flexible use  of land, bringing  forward new  land
where  necessary, and  provide  detail on  form, scale, access  and quantum of development where
appropriate.’
15.2  The Cheshire  East Local  Plan Strategy identifies both 'Sites' and  'Strategic Locations'. These
are proposed  in locations that will  contribute to providing  balanced  sustainable communities, where
there are  housing  and job opportunities, supported by  key infrastructure and  a range  of services.
They consist of:
Local  Plan Strategy Sites –  Where the intended uses  and location of development is  precisely
defined and  allocated on  the Policies Map  and is deliverable  in the short to medium  term.
Local  Plan Strategy Strategic Locations –  These are  broadly-defined areas  of land  with the
capacity to deliver  proposals  of strategic importance, where  definitive site boundaries  and
intended uses  will be included  and allocated in  the medium  to long  term in  the Site Allocations
and Development Policies Document.
15.3 The Local Plan Strategy focuses on identifying development proposals in  and around Principal
Towns  and Key Service Centres informed by  the settlement hierarchy. The council  will be preparing
a Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document that will  identify the remaining  sites for
development, in  particular around  Local  Service Centres.
15.4 It should  be noted that an  allocated site will  still have  to go  through the planning  application
process  and the fact that it is  allocated does  not guarantee that planning  permission  will be granted,
although it does  establish the principle  of a particular land  use. Planning applications on  allocated
sites will  be assessed  against the policies  in this document, the saved  development plan  policies  and
other material planning  considerations. It also  needs  to be  recognised  that planning  applications can
be made  for sites not identified in  this document and  these will  be assessed  against the relevant
policies  of this document, the saved  development plan  policies  and  other material planning
considerations. Any subsequent planning  permissions  granted on  previously  unidentified land  are
referred to as  'windfall' permissions.
15.5 All sites proposed  in this section are  expected to be  developed  in line with the policies  of the
Local  Plan Strategy unless  it is otherwise specified in  the relevant allocation policy.
The Assessment of Strategic Sites and Locations
15.6 The first step in  seeking  sites to allocate was  to consider  information available  to the council
through contact and  discussion  with developers, landowners, agents and  promoters, from responses
to earlier  consultation stages in  the preparation of the Local  Plan Strategy, alongside  sites currently
identified in  evidence  documents such  as:
Strategic Housing  Land  Availability Assessment (SHLAA);
Employment Land  Review;
Housing  and Employment Land  Databases;
Town  Strategies; and
Neighbourhood  Plans.
15.7 The initial list of sites were then consulted on  early in 2013 as part of the Development Strategy,
with the preferred sites and  locations being  selected as  those that were  felt more  appropriate to meet
the strategic vision, priorities and  objectives of the Local  Plan. These sites were  all assessed  as part
of the Sustainability Appraisal that accompanied  the Development Strategy. A further selection of
sites were  then consulted on  as part of the Possible Additional Sites Consultation, to ensure  that all
potential sites had been properly considered by the council, key stakeholders and  the public. Following
on from this consultation, the council  produced  a Pre-Submission Core  Strategy for consultation at
the end  of 2013. The Pre-submission Core  Strategy was  a draft version  of the Local  Plan Strategy
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 176
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsand allowed  a last opportunity for comments on  the proposed  plan  prior  to the publication of the
submission  document.
15.8 The Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic Locations contained within this document have
been  selected using  the council's Site Selection Methodology, which  incorporates a  thorough
assessment of all  the evidence  available  to the council  including:
consideration of the responses  from the previous  consultations;
the Sustainability Appraisal;
the Habitats Regulations Assessment;
the Flood Risk  Assessment;
the Viability Assessment;
the Green Belt Assessment;
known  physical  constraints;
potential mitigation measures;
availability of the site;
conformity with the emerging  Local  Plan policies;
ability to contribute to the strategic vision, priorities and  objectives of the Local  Plan;
need  for and  contribution to infrastructure provision;
the Equality Impact Assessment;
the Rural  Impact Assessment; and
the Health Impact Assessment.
15.9 The decision  taken to allocate a  site in  this document is  part of a  balanced  assessment of all
the information available.
Development Proposals
15.10 It is important to remember  that:
the Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic Locations are  not listed in  priority order;
where  the Strategic Sites and  Locations policies  contain a  list of criteria or  proposals  that these
are not in  any order  of importance or  priority, unless  the policy  specifically states that they are;
proposals  for new  development will  be assessed  against all  relevant policies  in the Local  Plan
and will be expected to be in conformity with those relevant policies unless other material planning
considerations dictate otherwise; and
national policy  may  not be  repeated in  these policies  but will  be applicable  as appropriate.
Monitoring of Strategic Sites and Locations
15.11  This document has  been  produced  at a time of national and  local  economic  recovery  and
for that reason  has been  designed  to be  flexible and  to build  in contingency. Whilst the council  is
committed to the delivery  of the Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic Locations, it accepts that
there could  be circumstances where  development will  not come  forward entirely as  anticipated.
Therefore, the Local  Plan Strategy has  an in-built mechanism  to monitor performance through an
Authority Monitoring Report produced  annually  using  performance indicators listed in  Chapter 16  of
this document. Generally, the outcome of the monitoring process  will inform whether specific
intervention actions should  be pursued  in the Local  Plan Strategy. If these actions fail to address
under  performance then other complementary plans  and strategies should  be reviewed.
15.12 The full range  of intervention actions that the council  and its partners could  take is  set out
in the monitoring chapter. These actions include  the preparation of development briefs, completing
or contributing to surveys, and  potentially undertaking Compulsory  Purchase Orders to assist land
assembly  and the overall  delivery  of the site.
15.13 The council  will also  look  at the potential to bring  forward sites from later phases  of the plan
period to ensure that appropriate housing  and employment provision is made. A review of employment
land and employment land  allocations may  also  be undertaken to maximise  efficient use  of sites.
177 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSafeguarded Land
15.14 In order  to avoid  the need  for future reviews  of the Green Belt and  in accordance  with the
National Planning Policy Framework, it is  necessary  to identify areas  of safeguarded land  between
urban areas and  Green Belt boundaries that may  be required to meet longer-term development needs
stretching well  beyond  the period  of the Local  Plan, as  set out in  Policy PG 4  ‘Safeguarded Land’.
15.15 Safeguarded land  is not allocated for development at the present time and  policies  relating
to development in the open countryside will apply. Planning permission for the permanent development
of safeguarded land  should  only  be granted following a  Local  Plan review  that proposes  the
development. Any such  review  will need  to take account of the development needs  arising  at that
time and  the availability of other sources  of land  available  at that point.
15.16 Safeguarded land  is required  around  the larger  settlements that are  inset into the Green
Belt; Macclesfield, Handforth, Knutsford, Poynton and  Wilmslow. Other settlements (such  as Alsager
and Congleton) are  adjacent to the Green Belt boundary  but are  not completely surrounded  by it and
therefore retain the capacity to expand  in the future without incursions  into the Green Belt.
Maps
15.17 Ordnance Survey based  maps  are provided  for each  town showing  the development related
proposals, as  well as commitments (strategic developments that already  have  permission)  and larger
scale  maps  of each  site and  strategic location. These maps  are presented for illustrative purposes.
15.18 The definitive spatial application of the proposals that will be land allocations and consequential
policy  boundary  changes  are to be  shown  on the new  Policies Map. This will  be an update of the
combined Proposals Maps produced as part of the previous  Local Plans adopted by the former district
and county councils.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 178
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsCrewe
15.19 When considering  options for development, there is  a need  to consider  Crewe  in its wider
context. From its inception, Cheshire  East has  identified Crewe  as its biggest spatial priority and  has
developed  the All Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City strategy in  response  to this. The All Change
for Crewe: High  Growth City strategy proposes  that by  2030  Crewe  will be:
A nationally significant economic  centre;
A key  driver  and hub for investment, connectivity, enterprise and  business  across  the South
Cheshire  sub-region;
Widely recognised  as an important anchor  to the North West region;
One of the leading  advanced  engineering  and manufacturing centres in  England, building  on its
rich industrial heritage and  successful outward-facing firms, with a  major  focus on  automotive,
advanced  engineering  and advanced  manufacturing sectors;
Recognised  as a sought-after place  in South Cheshire; where  talented and  able  people  want to
live, work  and play, and  where  once  previously  deprived  areas  of the town have  been  completely
revitalised and  re-energised;
An improved  strategic transport network and  a state-of-the-art broadband  internet network;
Home  to premier  educational facilities;
A diversified 'knowledge economy' that attracts and  keeps  hi-tech firms and  skilled  workers; and
A green  and improved  town environment and  health and  well-being  of its residents, through the
requirement for development schemes  to improve  existing and  to provide  new green  infrastructure.
15.20 In addition to the Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic Locations identified, there is  an
allowance  within the Crewe  urban  area  for the development and  delivery  of brownfield and  windfall
sites. It is  expected that these will  deliver  in the order  of 400  homes.
15.21 Further information about each  of the identified Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic
Locations can  be found on  the following pages.
High Speed Rail 2
15.22 Proposals for High  Speed Rail  (HS2) will  consolidate the position of Crewe  as one of the
most connected areas  in the UK and  will support existing businesses, inward  investment and  job
creation. The council supports the economic benefits of High Speed Rail (HS2) but will look to minimise
its environmental impacts.
15.23 The government has  announced  its proposals  for a  High  Speed Rail  Line  which  links  the
West Midlands with Manchester. Called HS2 (phase two), it will pass through various parts of Cheshire
East. The current proposals  will have  a potential transformative impact on  Crewe  and  the local
economy  in line with aspirations established in  High  Growth City.
15.24 Any future proposal  for High  Speed Rail  2 might necessitate significant change  in Crewe. In
this event, the council  could  prepare  an Area Action Plan or  similar  document that would  most likely
focus around  the area  referenced in  the HS2 Command  Paper 9355, published  on 15th November
2016, as  a hub station for Crewe  or alternatively trigger a  review  of the Local  Plan Policies.
15.25 Safeguarding Directions for Phases 2a  and 2b of High  Speed 2  (January  and November
2016)  are in place  and are shown  on the Policies Map  and the relevant Figures within this Chapter,
along  with further detail within the policy  for site LPS 3  'Basford West'.

Strategic Location LPS 1:  Central Crewe
15.26 Central Crewe  comprising  the town centre, Mill  Street, Crewe  Railway  Station and  Crewe
Alexandra Football Ground presents a range of development and regeneration opportunities in Central
Crewe  which  will deliver  a high  quality and  accessible  environment and  present the opportunity for
improvement and  regeneration.
15.27 Central Crewe is characterised by three main  development areas: the traditional town centre;
Grand Junction Retail Park and  the railway  station (with adjoining  areas  of Nantwich Road.) Despite
its origins  as a railway  town, Crewe  town centre has  historically developed  some  distance from the
railway  station. This disconnection has  been  exacerbated by  the development of the Grand Junction
Retail Park from the late 1990's onwards  which  is separate from the town centre. To  ensure  that
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 180
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsCrewe  thrives in  the future, connectivity needs  to be  improved; the design  of new  buildings  needs  to
be of a  high  standard and  green  infrastructure needs  to be  incorporated in  new  developments, to
enhance  the town's environment and  improve  the health and  wellbeing  of residents.
Strategic Location LPS 1
Central Crewe
Within the Strategic Location identified as  Central Crewe, the council  will look  to maximise
opportunities for improvement and  regeneration incorporating the introduction of new  and the
improvement of existing green  infrastructure. The regeneration and  development of Central
Crewe  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of new  homes  (at approximately 40  dwellings  per hectare, including  both
apartments and  family homes);
2. The provision  of comparison  retail and  leisure, including  at least 1  anchor  store and  a large
scale  leisure  use within the town centre boundary  (as defined in  the Crewe  and Nantwich
Local  Plan and  its eventual replacement in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies
Development Plan Document);
3. Support for the delivery  of student accommodation, as  appropriate;
4. Provision of other commercial  uses  including  office;
5. Support for an  enhanced  cultural offer, in  particular around  the Lyceum  Theatre;
6. Support for 24  hour  town centre uses, including  restaurants and  cafés/bars;
7. Support of multi-use facilities that drive  footfall generation and  introduce a  diversity of uses
within the town centre;
8. The incorporation of new, and  improvements to existing, green  infrastructure within new
developments to include  increased  tree planting; the creation of tree lined  boulevards; the
creation of green  spaces; the provision  of children's play  areas  and the provision  of
pedestrian and  cycle  links  between new  and existing developments;
9. Appropriately sited, rationalised and  improved  car parking  to support town centre uses  and
the local  economy;
10. A bus  interchange with covered  areas  and public  conveniences;
11. Promotion of the market with a  unique  theme;
12. A focus for Civic  functions;
13. Provision of new car parking, signage, concourse, public transport interchange and improved
station facilities (including ancillary development relating to its use) at Crewe Railway Station;
14. Up to 5,000 square  metres of retail on  Mill Street and  the creation of pedestrian and  cycle
links to the railway  station and  the town centre;
15. Potential leisure development and expansion of the existing sports and leisure hub at Crewe
Alexandra Football Club  on Gresty Road;
16. Provision of Flag Lane  link to improve  access  and permeability of the town;
17. Corridor  improvements on  Earle Street from Grand Junction Way  to Vernon  Way;
18. Improvements to the wider  highway  network, including  the A534 Nantwich Road  Corridor
and specifically in  relation to the access  to Crewe  Railway  Station;
19. Improvements to Crewe  Railway  Station, including  the development of adjacent land  for
complementary uses, to improve  connectivity at this major  communications hub; and
20. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The creation of stronger physical  connections between the town centre, the railway  station
and Grand Junction including  the provision  of better transport information between the town
centre and  railway  station.
181 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsb. The promotion of development which  capitalises on  and enhances  Crewe  Railway  Station's
position as  a major  communications hub.
c. The encouragement of landmark  developments of an  appropriate design  in particular at
Macon Way to reflect this prominent location. This should include  offices or other commercial
uses  (not retail).
d. New buildings  should  be of a high  design  quality and  respond  to Crewe's railway  heritage
and contemporary living. The new  development should  sensitively retain and  incorporate
any heritage buildings  and/or structures within them.
e. Provision of green  infrastructure to reflect 'The Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe'
(TEP, 2012)  including  tree planting; the creation of tree lined  boulevards  with the provision
of greenspaces  within new  developments. The creation of green  spaces  including  those
linking  green  infrastructure and  safe and  secure  pedestrian and  cycle  routes should  be
integrated into any  development proposals.
f. Investigate potential of land  contamination.
g. Provision of new, and  improvements to existing pedestrian, cycle  and public  transport links
between existing and  proposed  residential areas, employment, commercial  and leisure
areas, schools  and health facilities and  within the town centre itself.
h. Depending  on the location within the town, a  cultural heritage desk  based  assessment of
the surviving  fabric of the 19th Century railway  town and  its industrial heritage may  be
required; proposals  should  also  demonstrate that redevelopment proposals  will conserve
elements that contribute to listed buildings  status and  their setting.
i. Financial contributions towards education provision, highway  improvements and  health
infrastructure as  required.
j. There are  three Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) within the site at Earle Street,
Nantwich Road and Wistaston Road. Development proposals will need to include appropriate
mitigation measures  if they are  located within these AQMAs or  could  have  an adverse
impact upon  them.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 182
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsJustification
15.28 Central Crewe  presents a  unique  opportunity to regenerate under-exploited assets and
provide  a strong mix  of uses.
15.29 The area  includes  a significant number  of listed and  locally-listed buildings. Crewe's railway
heritage is  of regional, if not national significance. It is  of paramount important that such  buildings
are retained and  sensitively incorporated within any  new  developments.
15.30 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  well-being  of residents and
those working  within the town, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the town and  reflects the
findings of the Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe  (TEP, 2012)  and will also  help  deliver  the
'All Change  for Crewe' vision.
15.31 The focus on  Central Crewe  in the Local  Plan Strategy will  be on re-establishing the town
centre, improving  its vitality and  viability and  improving  connectivity between the railway  station and
town centre. The changes  set out above  will provide  a catalyst for future investment, promoting a
series  of infill developments whilst addressing  the potential to rationalise car  parking  provision  in the
town centre.
15.32 This development area  supports the 'All Change  for Crewe' initiative to enhance  the
attractiveness of Crewe  as a place  to live  and work, develop  underutilised sites and  improve  the
town's public  image.
15.33 Ongoing improvements to Crewe  Railway  Station with complementary retail, commercial
and leisure  uses  will support the role  of the railway  station as  a key transport interchange.
15.34 Highway  improvements along  the A534 Nantwich Road  corridor  and specifically in  relation
to the access  to Crewe  Railway  Station are  fundamental, to ensure  that the highway  network can
cope  with future developments.
15.35 The introduction of residential accommodation will  support and  enhance  the town centre,
improving  natural surveillance  and the vitality of the night time economy. It will  also support the wider
aspirations of creating better, safer and  improved  links  between the railway  station and  the town
centre.
15.36 New residential development can  assist in  promoting the connections between the town
centre and  the railway  station, as  well as improving  the approach  to the town from the south-east
and the north-west. The introduction of further residential development in  this area  will also  deliver
a balance  of uses  which  are essential to successful urban  environments, as  well as a catalyst for
transforming the quality of streets and  public  spaces.
15.37 The town centre boundary  along  with the identification of primary  and secondary  frontages
will be further defined in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document. Until this time the
town centre boundary  will remain  as identified in  the Crewe  and Nantwich Local  Plan.
15.38 There is  a current planning  permission  on Mill Street (P07/0639) for mixed  use development
comprising  residential, employment and  retail, new  pedestrian / cycle  link and associated car  parking,
landscaping, servicing  and access.
15.39 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.40 Three AQMAs lie  within the site and  therefore any  development proposals  need  to ensure
that air  quality does  not deteriorate, as  a result of development taking place. Appropriate mitigation
measures  will therefore be  required  where  sites are  located within them/would have  an adverse
impact upon  them.
183 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.41 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

Table 15.1 Policy Context: Central Crewe Strategic Location
 
Site LPS 2:  Basford East, Crewe
15.42 Basford East presents the opportunity to create a  high  quality employment led, vibrant and
sustainable, mixed use development with excellent links to Crewe and the M6 Motorway. This gateway
site into Crewe  will provide  employment opportunities and  homes  of high  quality to facilitate the
delivery  of employment on  the site.  Key to the site's comprehensive  delivery  will be the Crewe  Green
Link Road  South.
15.43 The site is  a large  greenfield site covering  approximately 92  hectares. The site is  bordered
by the West Coast Mainline  (to the west) and  Stoke-on-Trent / Nottingham rail  line (to the north), and
the A500 to the south.
Site LPS 2
Basford East, Crewe
The development of Basford East over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of up  to 19  hectares of B1 Office Space, up  to 5 hectares of B2 floor space;
to include  the creation of a  fourth generation business  park, with generous  green
infrastructure provision. The site is not considered to be suitable for B8 uses, due to highway
constraints;
2. The delivery  of up  to 850  new  homes, ancillary  to the delivery  of employment uses  on the
site. The delivery  of more  than 850  new  homes  on the site will  only  be permitted if this can
be justified by  the submission  of a viability study. Such a  study will  be independently
evaluated, on  behalf of Cheshire  East Council, such  costs to be  borne  by the developer(s);
3. The creation of a  new  local  centre including:
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 184
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsOne new  primary  school  located to the eastern edge  of the site; i.
ii. Retail provision  appropriate to local  needs;
iii. Public house  / restaurant; and
iv. A community facility that will  be capable  of accommodating a  variety of uses;
4. The retention and  incorporation of the existing farm buildings  (Crotia Mill)  on the site,
potentially as  part of the Local  Centre;
5. The incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. A significant depth of native woodland  and other semi-natural habitat screening  along
all boundaries  to provide  a buffer between the development and  the railway  line (at
least 20metres) and  the A500 (at least 40metres), to offset detrimental visual  impact
to the open  countryside and  the setting of the grade  1 listed Crewe  Hall and its
registered park  and garden, along  with the creation of wildlife habitats, including  those
for protected species;
ii. The retention, where  possible, of important hedgerows that have a cumulative screening
impact on  development and  contribute to the habitat value  of the site;
iii. The protection and  enhancement of Basford Brook;
iv. The creation of drainage  ponds  that have  visual  and habitat potential;
v. Allotments; and
vi. Open space  including  sports pitches; multi use  games  area; outdoor gym; equipped
children's play  space  and facilities for teenagers;
6. The provision  of a pedestrian link  (also  allowing  for cycle  access)  over  the Crewe  Green
Link Road  South;
7. The provision  of contributions to local  health infrastructure.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The site must be  developed  on a comprehensive  basis. To  ensure  that the impact upon
protected species  is minimised, the development of the site shall  take place  starting in  the
south and  finishing in  the north, on  a phased  basis. The council  will not permit the
development of small  portions of the site, unless  it can  be demonstrated that they contribute
to and  complement the development as  a whole.
b. As part of a comprehensive masterplan for the site, provision must be  made for a community
facility that contains space  that can  be used  for a  number  of uses, on  a flexible basis.
c. The development would be expected to contribute towards road infrastructure improvements
in the area, including  the Crewe  Green Link  Road, A500 link  capacity improvements, A5020
Weston Road  junction and  junction 16  of the M6.
d. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
e. Environmental mitigation required  as part of the Crewe  Green Link  Road  South scheme
will be safeguarded from development. The development should  provide  compensatory
habitat for great crested newts and  other protected and  priority species  on the site. The
great crested newt mitigation areas  shall  be contiguous with that provided  for the Crewe
Green Link  Road  South, within a  zone  adjacent to the northern boundary  of the site, parallel
to the railway  corridor.
f. The development would  be expected to provide  contributions towards improvements to
existing, and  the provision  of new, public  transport links  to Crewe  Railway  Station, Crewe
town centre and  local  villages.
g. The development would  be expected to allow  continued access  to and  servicing  of the
adjacent railways including improved access to the Rail  Depot from Crewe Green Link Road
South.
h. The development would  be expected to provide  improvements to existing, and  include  the
provision  of new  pedestrian, cycle  and public  transport links  to existing and  proposed
residential and  employment areas, shops, schools  and health facilities.
185 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsi. The development will  provide  connections to the South Cheshire  Growth Village, South
East Crewe, in  the form of green  infrastructure, pedestrian and  cycle  links  with further
consideration of comprehensively  masterplanning both schemes.
j. The provision  of green  infrastructure, to reflect 'The Green Infrastructure Action Plan for
Crewe' (TEP, 2012)  including  tree planting; the creation of tree lined  boulevards  with the
provision  of greenspaces  within new  developments. This should  include  the creation of
green  spaces, including  those linking  green  infrastructure, with safe and  secure  pedestrian
and cycle  routes that should  be integrated into any  development proposals.
k. High quality employment provision  on the site is  key to its delivery, with housing  considered
ancillary  and required  in order  to ensure  the deliverability of this site.
l. The development should  provide  a quality of place  with pedestrian and  cycle  links  through
to Crewe  Railway  Station and  beyond  to Crewe  town centre.
m. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment shall  be carried  out; if it requires  further work  and
mitigation, this will  be completed, as  required.
n. The area  has a 'typical' Cheshire  Landscape, characterised by  a flat topography broken  up
with a  dense  network of field hedges  interspersed with mature hedgerow  trees. The
development of Basford East must respond  to this sensitive landscape  setting and  create
a new  high  quality environment.
o. Existing farm buildings  offer the potential for conversion  to alternative uses.
p. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
q. There are  several  ponds  located on  the site and  a range  of mature trees and  hedgerows
which  are of ecological  value.
r. The site is  located in  close  proximity to the grade  1 listed Crewe  Hall and its grade  II listed
registered park  and garden; any  development on  the site will  need  to ensure  that it does
not have  an adverse  impact upon  its setting.
s. Existing buildings  of Crotia Mill  Farm, on  the site, are  thought to lie  on the site of a  14th
Century water mill. Archaeological investigations will  be an important consideration across
the site but particularly in  relation to this farm complex.
t. Records  show  that there is  potential for some  areas  of infill associated with former ponds
and a mill lake, and  there may  be areas  of localised  contamination associated with Crotia
Mill Farm (formerly a  mill)  on site.
u. The Crewe  Green Link  Road  South  runs through the site. The site will  deliver  a pedestrian
and cycle  link over  the Crewe  Green Link  Road  South.
v. Future masterplanning and  development of the site should  take into account potential
impacts from High  Speed Rail  Two.
w. Appropriate noise mitigation measures must be  included with future development proposals
for the site.
Justification
15.44 At present, Basford East is a  mix of arable, improved grassland and semi-improved grassland
which also contains a river  habitat. Basford Brook flows through the heart of the site alongside several
groupings  of ponds, which  support interesting flora and  fauna. Surrounding uses  include  the railway, 
the A500, Crewe  Hall registered park  and garden  and open  countryside. There are  also  a range  of
mature trees and  hedgerows  which  are of ecological  value.
15.45 The principle  of developing  this area  has been  accepted in  previous  Development Plans.
Basford East is  allocated for strategic and  major  industrial and  business  related development within
the Crewe  and Nantwich Local  Plan. Use  Classes  B1, B2 and  B8 were  considered  to be  appropriate
on this site. However, B8 uses are  no longer considered to be appropriate, due to highway constraints.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 186
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.46 The provision  of employment development is  the principal  and overriding  objective of the
Basford East site. The housing  development will  act as  an 'enabler' to ensure  that the employment
development takes place. If any  more  than 850  new  homes  are proposed  to be  delivered  on this site
a viability study will  be required  to be  submitted. This will  be independently evaluated, on  behalf of
Cheshire  East Council  and the cost for this will  be borne  by the developer(s). This is  to ensure  that
the objective of delivering  an employment site, to support the aims  of 'All Change  for Crewe: High
Growth City', will  be met.

15.47 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents and
employees, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the town and  reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe  (TEP, 2012)  and will also  help  deliver  the aspirations of 'All
Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City' .
15.48 The Crewe  Green Link  Road  (South) scheme  (CGLRS) is  a 1.1 km  dual-carriageway  link
running  north-south between the Weston Gate roundabout on  the A5020 Weston Road  and the A500
Hough-Shavington Bypass. The scheme was granted planning permission in October 2011. A revised
planning  application was  progressed  through 2012, and  this was  granted in  January  2013. A
Compulsory  Purchase Order (CPO) for the land  required  to construct, operate and  maintain the
scheme  was made  and confirmed during  November  2013. The scheme  was completed in  2015.  
15.49 Future masterplanning and development of the site should take into account potential impacts
from High  Speed Rail  Two  (HS2).
15.50 The provision  of a local  centre, including  appropriate medical  facilities; a  new primary  school;
local retail; pub/restaurant and  a community facility, with space  that can  be used  for a  number  of
uses, on  a flexible basis  is essential, to ensure  that the site is  sustainable. The community facility
must be  formed of flexible space  to accommodate uses  including  toilets; kitchen and  storage and  be
187 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationscapable  of a variety of uses  such  as clubs  (for people  of all  ages), community meetings and  as a
place  of worship.
15.51 Basford Brook has  been  selected as  a local  wildlife site and  flows through the heart of the
site providing  the greatest source  of flood risk. A site specific Flood Risk  Assessment will  be required
on the site that should  consider  future transport infrastructure including  impacts of High  Speed Rail
Two (HS2). Any infrastructure planned  over  the brook  or in the floodplain should  be designed  to not
impact on  flood flow. Culverting part or  the entire brook  is not recommended. Masterplanning of the
site should  avoid  areas  at greatest source  of flood risk.
15.52 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.53 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.54 As the site is  located adjacent to a  railway  line, roads  and industrial noise  sources, it is
important that appropriate noise  mitigation measures  are incorporated within the development.
15.55 Planning approvals  on the site are  as follows: 14/4025N: outline approval  for up  to 490
dwellings, primary  school, recreational open  space, ecological  mitigation areas. Resolution to grant
planning  approval  (15/04/15) subject to signing  of S106 Legal  Agreement, signed  on 15 January
2016. 15/1537N: outline application for mixed  use development comprising  up to 325  dwellings, B1,
D1, A1 and  A3/4, creation of footpaths and  public  open  space.  Resolution to grant planning  approval
(Strategic Planning Board 16  December  2015)  subject to the signing  of a S106 Agreement yet to be
signed.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment land  will be delivered  during  the middle  part of the Plan period
(2020-2025).

on West Midland Mosses SAC and Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 1 Ramsar (Wybunbury
Moss  SSSI) particularly in  relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational
pressures. This should  include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and indirect
impacts of the development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be
avoided, appropriate mitigation measures  will be required  to ensure  no adverse  effects on
the integrity of the site.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development would be expected to contribute towards road infrastructure improvements
in the area, including  the Crewe  Green Link  Road  South, A500 link  capacity
189 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsimprovements,the provision  of a spine  road; improvements to junction 16  of the M6  and
other traffic management and  regulations.
b. Improvements to existing, and  the provision  of new, pedestrian and  cycle  links  to connect
the site to existing and  proposed  residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools  and
health facilities.
c. The development would  be expected to allow  continued access  to and  servicing  of the
adjacent railways.
d. Development should  incorporate green  infrastructure and  reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012), including  tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green  spaces, including  those linking  green  infrastructure with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
e. Future masterplanning and  development of the site should  take into account potential
impacts from High  Speed Rail  Two.
f. Development must not have an adverse impact on the established great crested newt habitat
areas.
g. A financial contribution will  be sought from developers  to fund tree planting at appropriate
locations.
h. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards transport and
highways, education, health, open  space  and community facilities.
i. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
j. The development would  be expected to contribute to improvements to existing and  the
provision  of new  public  transport links  to Crewe  Railway  Station, Crewe  town centre and
local villages.
k. The site has  potential for the provision  of rail  sidings  with good  rail access  for the
trans-shipment of freight between railway  and road  and/or rail  connected warehousing  and
distribution. If this is  not provided  within the site, a  larger  contribution to road  infrastructure
improvements will  be required.
l. Habitat and  appropriate mitigation measures  to be  provided  within the site for protected
species.
m. The masterplanning of the site will  need  to ensure  that the development is  located within
the site in  such  a way that it will  not have  any adverse  impact on  existing and  proposed
protected species  habitat.
n. The Basford area  has a 'typical' Cheshire  landscape, characterised by  a flat topography
broken  up with a  dense  network of field hedges  interspersed with mature hedgerow  trees.
The development of Basford West will  need  to respond  to this sensitive landscape  setting.
o. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
 
Justification
15.58 At present the site comprises  open  farmland, with mature trees and  hedgerows. It is  known
to support some  interesting flora and  fauna, including  great crested newts. Surrounding uses  include
the railway  to the east; the A500 to the south; Crewe  Road  to the north and  west, with mainly  ribbon
residential development to the west, on  Crewe  Road.
15.59 The principle  of developing  this area  has been  accepted in  previous  Development Plans.
The strategic site is  a development plan  allocation for regional  and strategic employment identified
in the Crewe  and Nantwich Local  Plan and  known  as Basford West. An outline planning  application
(ref P03/1071) for employment uses  and associated works  was granted permission  on 13 May  2008
on the majority of the land  within the employment allocation.

15.60 Outline planning  approval  (14/0378N) was  granted on  the eastern portion of the site for
96,851 square  metres of B2 and  B8 uses  on 18 July 2014.
15.61 An outline planning  application, on  part of the site, for residential development (up  to 370
units), offices, local centre, restaurant, hotel, car showroom and  new spine road was approved, subject
to S.106, by  Strategic Planning Board in  August 2013  (ref 13/0336N). Reserved  matters planning
approval  for up  to 370  dwellings, local  centre (A1), public  house  (A3/4), hotel (C1)  and car showroom
was approved  on 24 September 2015.
15.62 The provision  of employment development is  the principal  and overriding  objective of the
Basford West site. A viability assessment has  been  submitted, to justify the provision  of 370  new
homes  on the site. The housing  development will  act as  an 'enabler' to ensure  that the employment
development takes place. If any  more  than 370  new  homes  are proposed  to be  delivered  on this site
a viability study will  be required  to be  submitted. This will  be independently evaluated, on  behalf of
Cheshire  East Council  and the cost for this will  be borne  by the developer(s). This is  to ensure  that
the objective of delivering  an employment site, to support the aims  of 'All Change  for Crewe; High
Growth City' are  met.
15.63 The delivery  of the employment elements of the site, as  well as the contributions that it will
make  towards infrastructure improvements, including  the A500, Crewe  Green Link  Road, junction 16
of the M6  and the spine  road, are  considered  to be  of vital importance to the delivery  of “All Change
for Crewe”.
15.64 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents and
employees, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the town and  reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe  (TEP, 2012)  and will also  help  deliver  the aspirations of 'All
Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City' .
191 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.65 Habitat for protected species  and appropriate mitigation will  be provided  within the site; the
development will  have  to be  appropriately sited, to ensure  that there is  not any  adverse  impact on
such  habitat areas.
15.66 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.67 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.68 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site(s):
impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
impact on  water resources
impact on  water chemistry
impacts on  nutrient status
risks from pollution during  construction (e.g. spillages  or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
impact of increased  foot traffic on  sensitive habitats and  species
15.69 At the date of the adoption of this Local  Plan Strategy, part of Site LPS 3  Basford West,
Crewe  is subject to the 'Safeguarding Directions Fradley to Crewe' given  by the Secretary of State
for Transport which  came  into force on  12 January  2016, which  include  proposals  for an  Infrastructure
Maintenance Depot (IMD) at Crewe  ("the Safeguarding Directions"). However, in  September 2016,
the Secretary of State published  the 'High Speed Two  Phase 2a: West Midlands  to Crewe  Design
Refinement Consultation', which  includes  the potential relocation of the proposed  IMD to a  site near
Stone in  Staffordshire. The consultation took place  between 13  September and  7 November  2016.
In the event that the 'HS2 Phase 2  West Midlands  to Crewe  Hybrid  Bill' includes  an IMD located at
Stone, the council  anticipates that the Secretary of State will  withdraw the Safeguarding Directions
affecting Site LPS 3.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment land  will be delivered  during  the middle  part of the plan  period
(2020-2025).

Site LPS 4:  Leighton West, Crewe
15.70 The area  defined as  Leighton West presents the opportunity to deliver  a new  sustainable
urban  extension that will  support and  complement the adjacent Leighton Hospital and  other major
employers  including  Bentley.
15.71 Leighton West lies  to the north west of Crewe  and borders  existing residential development
to the east and  Leighton Hospital to the north. Surrounding land  uses  include  residential, Leighton
Hospital, open  countryside, waste disposal  site and  council  depot.
15.72 Two areas  are included  in the Local  Plan Strategy for the Leighton West area; this site and
the adjacent Strategic Site LPS 5  'Leighton, Crewe'.
193 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 4
Leighton West, Crewe
Development at Leighton West will  result in  the creation of a  new  sustainable neighbourhood  to
support Leighton Hospital and  provide  a key site for the development of an  automotive research,
development and  supply  hub, in  partnership with Bentley Motors which  is located in  very  close
proximity to the site. The development of Leighton West over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will
be achieved  through:
1. Contributions to health infrastructure and the provision of land  adjacent to Leighton Hospital,
for its future expansion, to ensure  that the future health care  needs  of the area  can be met;
2. The delivery  of around  850 new  homes  (at a  variety of densities). The design, density and
scale  of the development should  reflect the fact that the site lies  in a transitional location
between the higher  density urban  area  and the rural  area. The surrounding  development
is predominantly suburban  and the development of the site should  reflect this.  The
development of the site will  be masterplan-led, including  a design  code, which  will consider
its location, constraints and  opportunities;
3. The inclusion  of key  worker  housing, for the employees  of Leighton Hospital;
4. The delivery  of a new  mixed-use  local  centre that will  serve  Leighton Hospital and  nearby
residents including:
i. Provision of retail appropriate to meet local  needs;
ii. Community facilities;
iii. Public House;
iv. Children's day  nursery;
v. A new  primary  school; and
vi. Leisure  facilities;
5. Around 5  ha of additional employment land  located at the southern end  of the site including
a science/energy park  which  could  include  advanced/automotive engineering  and
manufacturing;
6. The incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. Green corridor;
ii. Allotments;
iii. Open space  including  formal sports pitches, multi use  games  area, outdoor gym,
equipped  children's play  space  and facilities for teenagers;
7. A new  bus interchange for the hospital and  nearby  residential areas;
8. On land  to the north of Pyms Lane, there is  potential for a  science/energy park  and delivery
of a key site for the development of an  automotive research, development and  supply  hub,
working  in partnership with Bentley Motors. This area  also  has the potential to include  a
geothermal plant and  district heating hub;
9. The widening and/or realignment of Smithy Lane, to provide access  to the site and  improved
access  to Leighton Hospital for emergency  vehicles  and suitable footpath and  cycle  lanes;
10. A package  of network improvements to provide  improved  access  to Leighton Hospital and
surrounding  residential development including  emergency  vehicles  and suitable footpath
and cycle  lanes; and
11. An improved  'emergency portal' for blue  light vehicles  being  able  to access  the hospital's
Accident and  Emergency Department from Smithy Lane.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Leighton West is  situated in  close  proximity to both Leighton Hospital and  Bentley Motors,
both of which  offer key  opportunities to implement the aspirations contained in  ‘All Change
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 194
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsfor Crewe: High  Growth City’. The site will  help  to deliver  the future expansion  of Leighton
Hospital, to ensure  that it can  provide  the healthcare needs  for the area, as  it grows, along
with key  improvements to highways; the ‘blue  light’ portal and  public  transport serving  the
hospital. The close  proximity of the site to Bentley provides  an opportunity for the creation
of an  automotive hub  which  will provide  new  employment opportunities and  expand  the
automotive related investment in  Crewe  and the wider  area.
b. Development should  incorporate green  infrastructure and  reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012)  including  tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green  spaces, including  those linking  green  infrastructure, with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
c. Leighton West includes a potential site for the location of a deep geothermal plant. Following
work  by leading  academics  at Keele University, Cheshire  East Council  is investigating the
feasibility of using deep geothermal energy to supply  a district heating network in the vicinity,
to potentially supply  new  residential developments, major  industrial units, and  nearby
Leighton Hospital.
d. Improved highway  and public  transport links  to Leighton Hospital, Crewe  town centre and
major  employment areas.
e. Contributions to key  enabling  infrastructure, including  improvements to the A530 corridor
from the Flowers Lane  and Smithy Lane  junctions with the A530 and  the Bradfield Road  /
North Street corridor.
f. Improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to connect
the site to existing and  proposed  residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools,
health facilities, Crewe  town centre and  the Connect2 link  to Nantwich.
g. A green  buffer should  be provided  between Leighton Hospital and  the village  of Bradfield
Green.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. Provision of habitat for great crested newts and  other protected and  priority species  and
habitats as  required.
j. Investigate the potential for contamination issues, especially  in relation to land  to the south
of the site. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land
should  be carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use
should  it be  found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be
required  at a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
k. Following the findings of a  desk  based  archaeological  assessment, targeted mitigation is
likely  to be  required  in areas  not subject to a  geophysical  survey.
l. Development should  be masterplanned to facilitate highway  improvements required  to
mitigate against the impact of the new  development and  address  existing pinch  points,
including  the Flowers Lane  and Smithy Lane  junctions with the A530.
m. Any development of the Leighton West site will  require  highway  improvements. These
improvements will  be phased  with the development of the site and  also  delivered  through
masterplanning of the area  covered  by both the Leighton West and  the Leighton Strategic
Sites.
Justification
15.73 Traffic studies have  been  undertaken to look  at the effect of the traffic generated by  the
Leighton West site on  the highway  network. This has  highlighted issues  at the junctions of the A530
with Flowers Lane  and also  with Smithy Lane, both of which  are in close  proximity of the site and
would  require  improvements to be  made, to enable  them to handle  the additional demand  at these
locations, as  a result of the Leighton West development.
15.74 The work  undertaken also  shows  that improvements will  be required  at other junctions to
facilitate the growth in  traffic expected as  a result of the Leighton West development and  other
195 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsdevelopment in  the area. In particular the A530 corridor  from the north, past the site and  to Alvaston
Roundabout north of Nantwich, and  also  the corridor  from the junction of Flowers Lane  and Smithy
Lane  with the A530 along  Bradfield Road  and North Street towards Crewe  Green Roundabout around
the north of Crewe  through Maw  Green.
Figure 15.5 Leighton West  Site
15.75 The provision  of employment land  on the site offers the opportunity to establish a
science/energy park  and a key site for the development of an  automotive research, development and
supply  hub, in  close  proximity to Bentley Motors. This site offers a  single  location with good  access
to infrastructure and  linkages  to the wider  area. In 2013, Bentley Motors announced  a £1billion
investment in  Crewe  from 2015. Working  in partnership with Bentley Motors and  key businesses
across  the United Kingdom this site provides the opportunity to expand Crewe’s significant automotive
heritage and  skills  base; to provide  new  employment opportunities and  to kickstart wider  automotive
related investment in  Crewe, in  line with the aspirations contained in  ‘All Change  for Crewe: High
Growth City’.
15.76 The provision  of land  adjacent to Leighton Hospital for its future expansion  will ensure  that
the future health care  needs  of the town are  met and  will help  to deliver  the aspirations of ‘All Change
for Crewe: High  Growth City’.
15.77 Masterplanning of the site should  consider  further constraints on  the site including  high
voltage power  lines  which  cross  the site from the south west to the north which  require  an easement
of 30m  to the nearest building.
15.78 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents and
employees, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the town and  reflects the findings of the Green
Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe  (TEP, 2012)  and will also  help  deliver  the aspirations of ‘All
Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City’.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 196
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.79 It is important that cycle  and pedestrian links  between the site and  surrounding  residential
and employment areas  and to Crewe  town centre are  provided  to improve  connectivity with the town
centre. Links  should  also  be provided  to the Connect 2  scheme.
15.80 Great crested newts are  known  to be  present on  site. There will  therefore be  a requirement
to deliver  a significant area  of habitat creation to compensate for the impacts of any  development on
this site.
15.81 Access to Leighton Hospital will  be a key consideration in  the development of this site and
its improvement is  part of the rationale for it. Provision of land  adjacent to Leighton Hospital, for future
expansion  is of importance, to ensure  that the future health care  needs  of the area  can be met.
15.82 A desk-based  assessment of archaeology  on site has  been  completed and  a geophysical
survey  for the eastern area.  Given the size  of the area, targeted mitigation is  likely  to be  required  in
areas  not subject to geophysical  survey.
15.83 Land  adjacent to this site (known  as land  north of Parkers Road)  has planning  permission
for up  to 400  homes.
15.84 This site includes  a potential location for a  geothermal plant, as  it is situated within an  area
that has  been  identified as  a geothermal 'hotspot'. This provides  the opportunity for the development
of a district heating scheme; energy supply to nearby employers and to Leighton Hospital. The potential
development of a  geothermal plant is  a stand alone  proposal  and  would  not require  housing
development to cross-subsidise  it.
15.85 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.86 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.87 The design  and density of the development should  reflect the location and  character of the
area and respond  to the contents of the council’s  most up  to date Design  Guidance.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment land  will be delivered  in the early  to middle  part of the plan
period  (2015-2025).

15.89 Leighton West lies  to the north west of Crewe  and borders  existing residential development
to the east and  Leighton Hospital to the north. Surrounding land  uses  include  residential, Leighton
Hospital, open  countryside, waste disposal  site and  council  depot.
15.90 Two sites are  included  in the Local  Plan Strategy for the Leighton West area. This Strategic
Site of Leighton, lies immediately to the north east of Leighton Hospital and adjacent to to the Leighton
West allocation.
Site LPS 5
Leighton, Crewe
This site lies  adjacent to the Strategic Site of Leighton West. The site lies  in close  proximity to
both Leighton Hospital and  Bentley Motors; its development will  result in  the expansion  of the
new sustainable neighbourhood  at Leighton West. This will  provide  opportunities for people  to
live near  to the key  automotive hub, to be  located at the southern end  of the Leighton West site
and in close  proximity to Bentley Motors. The development of the Leighton West Strategic Site
over the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  500 homes  (at a  variety of densities). The design, density and  scale

f. The retention, where  possible, of hedgerows  and trees and  the inclusion  of appropriate
planting and  buffering along  the northern, eastern and  western boundaries  of the site and
in particular between the site and  Leighton Hospital and  between the site and  the village
of Bradfield Green, to provide a clear edge  to the site, a buffer between the site and  Leighton
Hospital and  to reduce  the visual  impact of the development of this site on  the adjacent
open  countryside.
g. Improved public  transport links  to Leighton Hospital, Crewe  town centre and  major
employment areas.
h. A minimum  of an  extended phase  one habitat survey  and protected species  surveys  will
be required.  Further surveys  may  be required  depending  upon  the results of these initial
surveys.  Development proposals  to include  retention of any  priority or  Local  Wildlife Site
Quality habitat and  provision  of habitat for great crested newts and  other protected species  
as required.
i. A desk based archaeological assessment is  required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being  carried  out, if required.
j. There will  be a requirement for financial contributions to be  made  to the provision  of a new

Justification
15.91 Land  adjacent to part of this site (known  as land  north of Parkers Road)  has planning
permission  for up  to 400  homes, is  listed in  the commitments list and  is under  construction. The site
is in a number  of ownerships.
15.92 The opportunity is  presented by  this strategic site for new  homes  to be  delivered  at a
sustainable location, in  close  proximity to Bentley Motors and  the new  automotive hub  that will  be
created at the southern end  of the Leighton West site. In turn this will  assist in  delivering  the growth
aspirations for Crewe  of 'Northern Gateway' (formerly known  as ‘All Change  for Crewe: High  Growth
City’).
15.93 This strategic site is  intended to deliver  key highways  improvements in  and around  the area
known  as Leighton West, which  will facilitate the development and  address  current and  future
congestion issues  in the area.
15.94 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents, as
well as enhancing  the environment of the town and  reflects the findings of 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012)  and will also  help  deliver  the growth aspirations for Crewe  of
'Northern Gateway' (formerly known  as ‘All Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City’).
15.95 It is important that cycle  and pedestrian links  between the site and  surrounding  residential
and employment areas, Leighton Hospital and  to Crewe  town centre are  provided  to improve
connectivity with the town centre. Links  should  also  be provided  to the Leighton Hospital Cycle  Link
Scheme and  Connect 2  link to Nantwich.
15.96 Great crested newts are  present on  adjacent land  and along  with other protected and  priority
species  and  habitats could  be present on  site. Appropriate habitat creation, retention and  other
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 200
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsmitigation measures  will be required. The ecological  mitigation strategy should  be formulated to
ensure  it is complimentary to ecological  mitigation associated with adjacent developments.
15.97 Necessary  highway  network improvements must be  completed to an  agreed  timetable to
ensure  highway  capacity and  access  to the Hospital are  maintained.
15.98 Any new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up  to date and  robust
Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor and  Outdoor Sports
Facilities’.
15.99 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

15.103 Crewe  Green presents the opportunity to provide  a high  quality residential development at
a key gateway into Crewe  whilst delivering  improvements to the transport network in  particular the
Crewe  Green roundabout. Located to the east of Crewe  town centre, the triangular parcel  of land  is
bordered to the north by open countryside, the east by the A534, the south by Crewe Green roundabout
with the Crewe  Green Conservation Area adjoining  the roundabout and  to the west by  Sydney Road.
Site LPS 6
Crewe Green
The development of Crewe  Green over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  150 homes;
2. The provision  of land  to Cheshire  East Council  that is  necessary  to facilitate the delivery  of
highway  improvements at Crewe  Green Roundabout. Such improvement to be  completed
before development of the new  homes  starts on  site; and
3. The incorporation of green infrastructure, to include open space provision, including children's
equipped  play  space/multi use  games  area.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The provision  of a high  quality design  on this gateway site to Crewe, which  lies in close
proximity to the Crewe Green Conservation Area and numerous listed buildings. Development
should  have  regard  to the need  to conserve  and enhance  the character and  appearance
of the conservation area, including  its setting and  that of the various  heritage assets within
it. Development will  be required  to include  appropriate landscaping  to minimise  its impact
on the Green Gap and  the historic environment.
b. The development of this site will  assist in  the facilitation and  delivery  of highway
improvements at Crewe  Green roundabout.
c. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
d. Development should  incorporate green  infrastructure and  reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012)  including  tree planting; the creation of tree lined
boulevards with the provision of greenspaces within new developments. This should include
the creation of green  spaces, including  those linking  green  infrastructure, with safe and
secure pedestrian and cycle routes that should be integrated into any development proposals.
e. The improvement of existing and  provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to link  new
and existing residential areas, employment areas, shops, schools  and health facilities.
f. The inclusion  of appropriate planting and  buffering along  the northern boundary  of the site.
g. Provision of habitat for protected species, if required.
h. The development will be expected to provide contributions to education provision and health
infrastructure.
i. A desk based archaeological assessment is  required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being  carried  out, if required.
j. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.104 This site is  a gateway site into Crewe. The development of this site will  assist in  the delivery
of improvements to the Crewe  Green roundabout which  is a key piece  of highway  infrastructure and
is identified in  the Infrastructure Delivery  Plan which  states that the roundabout suffers from peak
period  delays  and includes  it within the ‘Physical Infrastructure Delivery  Schedule'.
15.105 The key  gateway location of the site, along  with its close  proximity to Crewe  Green
Conservation Area, necessitates the delivery  of a very  high  quality designed  development, including
appropriate landscaping  to reduce  the visual  impact of the development. The provision  of new  green
infrastructure and  the improvement of existing green  infrastructure are  of paramount importance.
This will assist in improving the health and wellbeing of residents, as  well as enhancing the environment
of the town and  reflects the findings of the Green Infrastructure Action Plan for Crewe  (TEP, 2012)
and will also  help  deliver  the aspirations of ‘All Change  for Crewe: High  Growth City’.
15.106 Funding sources  for improvements to the Crewe  Green roundabout are  a Local  Growth
Fund Grant and  third-party developer  contributions secured  by the council.
15.107 Habitat for protected species  must be  provided  if required.
15.108 The development will  be expected to provide  contributions to education provision.
15.109 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.110 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

15.114  Mechanisms  must be  put in  place, to ensure  that water from the development, flowing into
Fowle Brook, does  not have  an adverse  impact on  the Sandbach Flashes SSSI.
15.115 Adjacent land lies within the Green Gap. It is important that any visual impact of development
on the Green Gap is  minimised  by appropriate landscaping  and the retention of existing trees and
hedgerows.
15.116  It is important that the site contributes to highway  improvements along  the North Crewe
corridor, including  at Sydney Road  Bridge and  Crewe  Green Roundabout, to ensure  highway  safety.
15.117  It is important that ecological  appraisals  of the site are  carried  out and  that habitat and
appropriate mitigation measures for protected species, if required, will be  provided. Mitigation proposals
for great crested newts in  particular are  likely  to be  necessary.
15.118  It is important that buffering planting, along  the western boundary  of the site, with the West

Site LPS 8
South Cheshire Growth Village, South East Crewe
A new  sustainable settlement will  be delivered  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period. This will  be
achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  650 new  homes. The density and  scale  of the development should
reflect the sensitivities and  relationships of different parts of the site and  should  be directly
informed by a detailed heritage impact assessment that will inform and shape a development
brief, masterplan and  design  code  for the site. This should  have  special  regard  to the
relationship to heritage assets and  their settings and  their collective character and
significance and  what this rich  heritage context contributes to the character of the site and
to its wider  setting;
2. The provision  of a new  mixed-use  local  (village)  centre, with a  range  of uses, including:
i. Appropriate retail provision  to meet local  needs;
ii. Community meeting facility and  a new  village  square  and enhanced  public  realm
elsewhere;
iii. Sports and  leisure  facilities;
3. The provision  of open  space  including  sports pitches, multi use  games  area, outdoor gym,
equipped  children's play  space  and facilities for teenagers;
4. The provision  of pedestrian and  cycle  links  to the new  primary  school  and wider  adjacent
Basford East site;
5. The creation of wildlife habitats, including  those for protected species  in accordance  with
detailed ecological  assessments and  management proposals; and
6. The incorporation of the following green  infrastructure:
i. In the area  to the south of Old Park Road  (outside the historic parkland  of Crewe  Hall),
retention and/or creation of hedgerow  boundaries  with native woodland  tree species
and associated landscaping  along  all site boundaries  on routes into the site and
alongside the railway corridor and for all boundaries adjacent or in proximity to heritage
assets (where  those are  appropriate to the setting of the heritage assets) to offset
detrimental visual impact to the open countryside and  the setting of designated heritage
assets;
ii. Parkland restoration to the north of Old Park Road  in the historic parkland  of Crewe
Hall (including  the registered park  and garden)  would  include  the retention and
restoration of the shelterbelt, clumps  of trees and  other parkland  features;
iii. Additionally, the retention, where  possible, of hedgerows  and trees within the site that
have  a cumulative screening  impact on  development and  contribute to the habitat
value  of the site;
iv. Other targeted landscape  mitigation as  set out in  the Heritage Impact Assessment
(CEC 2016)  and summarised  under   part b  of ‘Site Specific Principles of Development’
below;
v. The creation of drainage  ponds  that have  visual  and habitat potential, allotments and
a community orchard.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 208
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite Specific Principles of Development
a. Development should  incorporate green  infrastructure and  reflect 'The Green Infrastructure
Action Plan for Crewe' (TEP, 2012)  including  tree planting and  hedgerows  in historically
appropriate locations and  the creation of green  spaces, including  those linking  green
infrastructure and  providing  for safe and  secure  pedestrian and  cycle  routes that should  be
integrated into the development proposals.
b. Within this green  infrastructure framework, specific landscape  mitigation shall  be provided
in accordance  with the recommendations of the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC 2016)
the details of which  are to be  further developed  through the preparation and  adoption of a
Design  Brief and  via the Masterplan and  Design  Code  for the site.  These key  elements of
mitigation as  set out in  the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC 2016)  entail the following:
i. Provision of sufficient areas  of open  space  to the south and  east of Hollyhedge
Farmhouse to maintain its open  rural  setting;
ii. Provision of a  substantial landscaped  edge  to the south/south east of the development
parcel  immediately to the south of the railway  line (on the opposite side  of Main  Road
to Hollyhedge  Farm).  This should  combine  a mix of copse  and individual  tree planting
contained by  a new  native hedgerow.  At the point nearest Hollyhedge  Farm in  the
south eastern corner, a  copse  should  be created.  It should  include  woodland  planting
on the western edge  of the parcel, tying in  with the woodland  buffer of the Basford
East site; 
iii. Provision of open  space  and appropriate parkland  landscaping  alongside  the
access/drive and  to the south of Crewe  Hall Farmhouse and  associated barns;
iv. Provision of an area of greenspace to the east of Stowford hamlet, retaining the existing
pond, trees and  other positive planting as  a key space  within the development;
v. Reinstatement of historic shelter belt planting to define the edges  of the former historic
parkland  to the east of the access  to the Crewe  Hall Enterprise Centre, immediately
to the north of Old Park Road, and  to the east of the entrance/access to Crewe  Hall
Farm. The detail of the shelterbelt planting is  to be  based  on compelling  historical
evidence  of the original  planting scheme  for the parkland; and
vi. Parkland restoration of the parcel  of agricultural land  immediately to the north of
Stowford hamlet between the drive  to Crewe  Hall and the access  to Crewe  Hall
Enterprise Centre (immediately to the west of the South Cheshire  Growth Village  site). 
The detail of this should  be based  on compelling  historical evidence  of the parkland
planting scheme.
c. The development will  be expected to provide  contributions towards education provision  and
provide  key linkages  through to a  school  to be  provided  at Basford East, along  with the
wider  Basford East area. This should  include  both pedestrian and  cycle  links.
d. The development should  be comprehensively  masterplanned with a  detailed design  code
to ensure  the following:
i. The creation of appropriate linkages  and connectivity between this site and  Basford
East, Crewe  town centre and  railway  station and  the M6;
ii. A high  quality of development is  secured  by ensuring  that new  development is
appropriately located, and  is of an  appropriate density and  scale  in its relationship to
heritage assets, including  their setting, principally  the grade  I listed Crewe  Hall, the
registered park  and garden  at Crewe  Hall, Hollyhedge  Farmhouse and  other groups
of listed buildings  to minimise  the impact upon  the heritage assets; 
iii. To ensure  the development relates appropriately to its wider  context and  the wider
setting of the heritage assets, including  consideration of key  views  into and  out of the
site, landform, key  approaches  into the site and  the wider  landscape  character of the
countryside; and
209 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsiv. The character of the two distinct areas should be maintained, i.e. the parkland character
should  be enhanced  within the historic parkland  of Crewe  Hall to the north of Old Park
Road   (including  the registered park)  and the agricultural landscape  to the south of the
parkland should be reinforced.  This should be based on compelling historical evidence.
e. As an  integral part of formulating the development brief, Masterplan and  Design  Code, a
full assessment of the significance of the heritage assets and  their setting that are  affected
by the South Cheshire  Growth Village  development will  need  to be  undertaken, and  the
findings of the assessment should  be reflected in  the development brief, masterplan and
design  requirements set out in  the Design  Code.
f. Improvements to existing and provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to new and existing
residential and  employment areas, shops, schools  and health facilities.
g. Contributions to improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  public  transport links  to
Crewe  Railway  Station, Crewe  town centre and  local  villages.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy Site will  provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. The land  within the registered park  and garden  of Crewe  Hall and the Green Belt will  be
excluded  from the site boundary  but appropriate specific  landscape  mitigation measures,
as set out in  the Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC, 2016)  will be required  outside of the
site boundary.
j. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards education, health,
green  infrastructure, open  space  and community facilities.
k. The development would  be expected to contribute towards and  / or facilitate road
infrastructure improvements in the area, including, A500 link capacity improvements, A5020
Weston Road  junction and  junction 16  of the M6.
l. Potential for self build and adaptable units to be incorporated into the masterplan and  design
code  for the site.
m. An appropriately designed  green  buffer will  be provided  between the site and  the village  of
Weston.
n. The area  has a 'typical' Cheshire  Landscape, characterised by  a flat topography broken  up
by a dense  network of field hedges  interspersed with mature hedgerow  trees. The
development must respond  to this sensitive landscape  setting.
o. Pre-determination cultural heritage desk  based  assessment is  required, to determine the
need  for further evaluation and  any mitigation that will  be required.
p. Future masterplanning must ensure  that connectivity for pedestrians and  cyclists is
maximised  and that high  quality cycle  and pedestrian links  are provided  to the adjacent
mixed  use site of Basford East, including  the new  primary  school.
q. Financial contributions will  be required  towards the provision  of a new  primary  school  on
the nearby  Basford East site LPS 2.
r. Provision of habitat for protected species, if required.
s. Noise and air quality assessments, if required, relating to the railway  and main roads passing
through or  adjoining  the site.
 
Justification
15.127 The allocation proposes  a new  sustainable village  which  provides  distinctive new  housing
in a high  quality landscape  setting. Existing woodland  and vernacular  estate architecture set the tone
for the creation of new  residential community which  compliments the current housing  offer in  Crewe.
The site will  help  meet the needs  of Crewe's growing  population and  labour  force demand, to support
the retention and  growth of a  highly  skilled  workforce.
15.128 The provision  of this site will  support growth in  Crewe  and the aspirations of the Northern
Gateway in  improving  local  infrastructure, reducing  the loss  of skilled  people  to other areas  and
increasing  local  expenditure on  goods  and services  leading  to further jobs  being  created. The South

northern route proves  unfeasible, will  an access  south of the railway  be permitted. This could  take
the form of an  all-weather lit route. No  vehicular  link to Basford East will  be permitted.
15.133 The future development brief, masterplanning and  design  coding  must be  informed by  a
full 'assessment of significance' as  required  by the NPPF as  well as by the recommendations in  the
Heritage Impact Assessment (CEC, 2016).  This must assess  the significance of the heritage assets
and their settings and  seek  to minimise  the impact of the development upon  the historic environment
by delivering  high  quality design  and mitigation as  set out in  this policy.  It is  extremely important that
211 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationshigh quality development, with a  strong sense  of place  is secured, hence  the requirement for a
development brief, masterplan and  comprehensive  design  code.
15.134 Adjacent land  lies within the Green Gap and  Green Belt, along  with the grade  I listed Crewe
Hall and registered park  and garden  (grade  II and  on the Heritage at Risk  Register). It is  important
that the visual  impact of development on  these areas  is minimised  by appropriate landscaping,
parkland  restoration and  the retention of existing trees and  hedgerows. The area  south of the village,
either side  of Main  Road, Weston, is  particularly sensitive, including  its relationship to Hollyhedge
Farmhouse a grade II* listed building, and its setting. The land retained around Hollyhedge Farmhouse
(as defined in  the Heritage Impact Assessment CEC 2016)  shall  remain  undeveloped. A high  quality
landscape  scheme, with appropriate, strong planting on  the boundaries  of the development and
substantial areas of open space should be provided in the vicinity of Hollyhedge Farmhouse, to reduce
the impact of the development upon  its setting.
15.135 It is important that this site contributes to highway network improvements, to ensure  highway
network improvements, to ensure highway safety and  deliver the aspirations of the Northern Gateway.
15.136 The area  of protected open  space  is located within the Green Belt. As well  as providing  for
open  space  and recreation to meet the needs  of the village, it will  be accompanied  by supporting
facilities compatible with Green Belt Status. The detailed boundaries  of the Green Gap will be reviewed
and could  further assist in  separating the Village  from Weston.
15.137 An archaeological  assessment will  be required, to understand the impact on  undesignated
heritage assets and  to minimise  or mitigate harm.  This should  be informed by  consultation with the
Local  Authority's archaeological  advisers.
15.138 Habitat for protected species  must be  provided  if required.
15.139 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor and  Outdoor Sports Facilities’.

15.144 The Wybunbury  Moss  Special Area of Conservation and  Ramsar  site lie  within close
proximity of this site. It is  important that this site contributes towards habitat improvements at
Wybunbury  Moss. The provision  of green  infrastructure, open  space  and SuDS should  reduce  any
potential impacts on  European designated sites
15.145 The existing landscape  includes  some  hedgerows  and hedgerow  trees of landscape  value.
Two ponds  and a watercourse are  also  present on  the site. All these features should  be conserved,
utilised and  extended as  part of the landscape  framework and  green  infrastructure proposals  within
the development.
15.146 Contributions are  required  to be  made  for improvements to public  transport, highways  and
education.
15.147 It is important that cycle  and pedestrian links  between the site and  nearby  residential and
employment areas  are provided, to integrate the site within the area  and ensure  sustainability.
15.148 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals  and their proximity to European

15.150 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site (consisting of either a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and  / or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Risks  from misconnections, misuse  of garden  chemicals
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
Impact of increased  foot traffic on  the sensitive fen meadow  vegetation
15.151 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least  a Phase 1 Preliminary

15.167 It is important that the site contributes to appropriate highway  improvements along  the
Sydney Road  corridor  to ensure  highway  safety. 
15.168 Mud snail  (a Local  Biodiversity Action Plan priority species), lesser  silver  diving  beetle (a
protected species)  and great crested newts (a  protected species)  have  been  recorded  from a  number
of ponds  and ditches on  this site. Lesser  silver  diving  beetles are  dependent upon  livestock poaching
of the pond  edges  to maintain the habitat in  a suitable condition therefore areas  of retained habitat
around  the ponds  must be  of sufficient size  to allow  light grazing  to be  undertaken. The provision  of
additional ponds  either on-site or  off-site within an  area  of suitable grazed  agricultural land  is required
to provide  additional mitigation for the potential cumulative impacts on  this species. Grass snakes  (a
protected species)  are also  known  to be  present in  the broad  locality.  Other protected species  are
also thought to be  present on  the site. It is  important therefore that appropriate habitat for protected
species, if required, is  retained/provided within the site.
15.169 It is important that appropriate buffering planting, along the northern and eastern boundaries
of the site, is  provided  in such  a way that a  clear  edge  to the development is  provided  and that visual
impacts are  mitigated.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.178 In addition to the Strategic Sites and  Locations identified on  this plan  and in the text below,
there is  an allowance  within Macclesfield for the development and  delivery  of brownfield and  windfall
sites. It is  expected that these will  deliver  in the order  of 500  homes.
15.179 As a result of the decline  in traditional manufacturing, there is  capacity for the partial re-
development of the Hurdsfield employment site to help  meet future employment need.
15.180 Further information about each  of the identified Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic
Locations can  be found below.
Strategic Location LPS 12:  Central Macclesfield
15.181 This site covers  the central areas  of Macclesfield. It includes  the existing main  shopping
area and its surrounds, as  well as the existing Tesco  Hibel  Road  site, the Barracks Mill  (Black Lane)
site and  The King's School's Cumberland  Street Site. Surrounding uses  include  residential, retail,
sports facilities and  commercial  uses.
Strategic Location LPS 12
Central Macclesfield
Within the area  identified as  Central Macclesfield, the council  will look to maximise  opportunities
for improvement and  regeneration, incorporating the introduction of new  and the improvement
of existing green  infrastructure. The regeneration and  development of Central Macclesfield over
the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of new  dwellings;
2. Support for new and improved retail and leisure  developments that are in-centre and improve
the quality of the shopping  experience;
3. Provision of other commercial  uses  including  B1 office use;
4. Support for enhanced  cultural offer;
5. Support for new  restaurants and  cafés, to increase  footfall throughout the evening;
6. Delivery  of landmark, well  designed  buildings;
7. Appropriate car  parking;
8. Promotion of the local  markets;
9. Improvements to the public  realm;
10. Incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. Improvements to existing green  infrastructure;
ii. Increased tree planting and  the creation of tree lined  boulevards; and
iii. The creation of greenspaces  within new  developments;
11. Improved pedestrian and  cycle  links  to the railway  station and  bus station;
12. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities;
13. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space  and community facilities;
14. Highway  improvements to Cumberland  Street corridor  and Hibel  Road, Flower Pot junction
and Broken Cross  junction or  as determined through any  future transport study;
15. Improved strategic highways  links  towards the north and  Manchester on  the A523 corridor,
including  Poynton Relief Road;
16. Maximising  opportunities to bring  disused  and underused  buildings  back  into use; and
17. The provision  of high  quality design  is of paramount importance, as  this site includes
numerous  listed buildings, four conservation areas  and locally  important buildings  and
spaces. Development should have regard to the need to conserve  and enhance the character
and appearance  of the listed buildings  and conservation areas, including  their settings.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 224
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite Specific Principles of Development
a. The overriding objective is to create a quality of life and urban environment which is  attractive
for all  those who  want to live, work  and shop  in Macclesfield. To  do this the focus must be
on offering increased  high  quality retail provision, a  varied  and interesting entertainment
centre, a  mix of residential accommodation and  high  quality commercial  space.
b. Retail and  leisure  sectors must be  strengthened.
c. Macclesfield Railway  Station is  very  well connected with frequent trains to London  and
Manchester. In light of this connectivity there is  a significant opportunity to create a  ‘hub’
of activity built around  the station with commercial, residential and  leisure  development.
d. Land  immediately to the south of Hibel  Road  (A537) is  ‘wedged’  between the retail core
and northern inner  ring road. The area  is small-scale  and intimate with some  attractive
buildings  but could  benefit from enlivening  via small  scale  development and  reintegration
with the town centre.
e. Sensitive infill residential development will  be appropriate around  Macclesfield’s  historic
centre. Furthermore there are numerous opportunities to rationalise and consolidate existing
car parks  – in so doing  ‘unlocking’  important regeneration opportunities.
f. There are opportunities to deliver high quality public open space  throughout the town centre,
most notably on  Park Lane  / Park Green. Allied with this, pedestrian activity and  linkages
must take preference over  vehicular activity. These pedestrian routes should  be safe, secure,
accessible  and well lit.
g. The encouragement of landmark developments of a high  quality design that should respond
to local  heritage and  contemporary buildings.
h. The Macclesfield Area of Archaeological Potential lies  within the Central Macclesfield area.
Archaeological assessments of development areas  will be required, to include  provision  for
mitigation if required.
i. Depending  on the location within the town, a  cultural heritage desk  based  assessment of
the development proposals  will be required; proposals  should  demonstrate that they will
conserve and enhance the character and appearance of the listed buildings and conservation
areas, including  their settings and  also  show  how  regard  has been  paid  to the impact of
development proposals  on the heritage of the town.
j. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Justification
15.182 Central Macclesfield presents a  valuable  opportunity to maximise  the assets and  enhance
the character of Macclesfield town centre and  central area.
15.183 This area  contains a  number  of heritage assets and  locally  important buildings  and spaces.
It is particularly important these buildings, places  and spaces  are retained and  the local  heritage is
considered  in any new  developments.
15.184 The delivery  of new  residential development within this central area  will help  to support and
enhance  the town centre, improving  natural surveillance  in the area  and supporting the night time
economy. It will  also  help  to maintain a  balance  of uses  within the area, that will  help  to create and
support sustainable communities.
15.185 High quality public  spaces  will support the vitality of this area  and help  to create successful
urban  environments. Whilst the improved  pedestrian and  cycle  links  will increase  footfall through this
central area  and will help  to bring  life to the area  throughout the day. Safeguarding and  enhancement
of the River  Bollin corridor  will be important considerations.

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 13:  South Macclesfield Development Area
15.187 The South Macclesfield Development Area is a  large, predominantly greenfield site adjacent
to the southern urban  edge  of Macclesfield, bounded  by Congleton Road  (A536) and  the railway  line.
Much  of this site consists of open  fields and  scrub  land  with hedgerow  boundaries  but there are  some
existing uses  on site such  as small  business  uses  off Turf Lane, a  depot and  playing  fields with
changing  rooms.
15.188 Adjacent neighbouring  uses  include  one and two storey residential properties on  Congleton
Road  (A536) and  recent new  residential development off Moss  Lane. The eastern boundary  runs
along  the rail  line and opposite Lyme  Green Business Park. The southern boundary  is onto farm land
and the council’s  waste recycling  centre and  Danes  Moss  Landfill Site.
15.189 The site offers the opportunity to create a  sustainable urban  extension to facilitate some
growth in Macclesfield; providing  new housing alongside employment, convenience retail, community,
recreation and  sporting facilities as  well as green  infrastructure and  an important contribution to the
new link road.
Site LPS 13
South Macclesfield Development Area
The development of the South Macclesfield Development Area over  the Local  Plan Strategy
period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  1,050 dwellings;
2. Provision of:
i. Replacement playing  fields, green  infrastructure and  open  space  to offer multi sports
and recreational opportunities including  a new  pavilion  / changing  rooms;
ii. Class  A3 / A4 public  house  and restaurant;
iii. Class  A3 / A5 drive-through restaurant or  hot food takeaway; and
iv. Class  D2 health club  / gym  facility;
3. Provision of a  new Class  A1 superstore with a  net sales  area  of up  to 5,000 square  metres. 
The majority of the net sales  floorspace should  be dedicated for convenience  goods(89);
4. Provision of around  5 hectares of employment land  and employment related uses;
5. Provision of a  new  primary  school  or contributions towards educational facilities;
6. Potential relocation of Macclesfield Town  Football Club;
7. Incorporation of green  infrastructure;
8. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities; and
9. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space, community and  sports facilities.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Delivery  of Link  Road  between Congleton Road  and London  Road.
b. Existing trees, water courses  and natural habitats are  to be  retained and  enhanced  as
appropriate.
c. Necessary  infrastructure, open  space  and structural planting to include  additional tree
planting must be  provided.
89 Convenience  goods  defined to comprise  the following Classification of Individual Consumption by  Purpose (COICOP)
categories: Food and non-alcoholic beverages, Tobacco, Alcoholic beverages (off-trade), Newspapers and periodicals,
and Non-durable  household  goods.
227 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsd. The north / north-east portion of the site is  most suitable for residential development.
Proposals should  take account of the scale, massing  and density of the existing adjacent
properties and  access  should  be taken from the new  link road. Site layouts should  preserve
the amenity of existing properties.
e. The site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy  requirements set
out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes';
f. Commercial, convenience  retail and  leisure  development will  be appropriate on  the western
end of the site.
g. The south-east part of the site provides  an excellent opportunity for the provision  of a new
stadium facility for Macclesfield Town  Football Club. There would  also  be an opportunity,
to the west of the Stadium, to provide  training facilities along  with car  parking  which  could
serve  the whole  site.
h. The form of development should  endeavour  to retain, where  appropriate, much  of the
existing tree cover  which  is present on  site –  in particular on  the southern boundary.
Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to existing routes and  the proposed  parcels  of development
should  be provided, set within greenways  which  are safe, attractive and  comfortable for
users.
i. A desk based archaeological assessment is  required for the site, with appropriate mitigation
being  carried  out, if required.
j. A detailed site-specific flood risk  assessment should  be prepared.
k. The retention and/or replacement of the indoor  and outdoor sports facilities should  be in
accordance  with the findings of an  adopted, up  to date and  robust needs  assessment.
l. The site will  be developed  only  where  it can  be demonstrated that there is  no significant
harm on the Danes Moss SSSI, particularly in relation to changes in water levels and quality,
species  populations and  recreational pressures. This should  include  a full assessment of
the direct and  indirect impacts of the development on  the features of special  interest. Where
impacts after mitigation cannot be  avoided, development proposals  will not be  permitted.
m. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Justification
15.190 This site has  been  allocated for a  mix of uses  including  employment and  shopping  purposes
since 1997, but has not come forward for development due to a combination of site conditions, market
demand  and competition pressures  from other employment locations within the borough.
15.191 A mixed  use allocation including  a number  of higher-value  land  uses  including  residential
and Class  A1 convenience  retail is  therefore considered  to be  crucial  in enabling  this site to come
forward for development within the plan  period.
15.192 Residential development will  play  a key role in achieving  development on  this site but the
density of the proposals  will need  to be  carefully balanced  so as to achieve  viability whilst ensuring
the development is  of a sustainable and  high  quality design  that will  be in keeping  with the semi  rural
character of this particular area.
15.193 Due to the scale  of the development and  its location on  the urban  fringe the retention of
large areas of open space and play facilities across the site will  be considered important for recreation
purposes.

Ordnance Survey 100049045¯0 0.5 0.25
kmFigure 15.15 South Macclesfield Development Area  Site
15.194 The site has  been  subject to a  long-standing allocation for Class  A1 retailing since  1997
(subsequently carried forward in the 2004 Local Plan Update) with the South Macclesfield Development
Area Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG –  adopted November  1998)  identifying that a  Class
A1 food superstore with a net sales area of 2,787 square metres (30,000 sq. ft.) would be  appropriate.
15.195 The 2011  Town  Centres Study identifies that there is  a significant under-supply  of
convenience  goods  floorspace in  Macclesfield with existing large  out-of-centre superstores identified
to be significantly overtrading.  Even taking account of planned commitments, a significant quantitative
and qualitative based  need  is identified by  the study for a  new  Class  A1 superstore in  the town to
re-distribute trade whilst enhancing  genuine  competition and  choice  for local  residents.
15.196 A new  Class  A1 superstore on  the site would  therefore realise  the long-standing Local  Plan
allocation and  address  the current spatial deficiency in  main  food shopping  provision  in the south of
Macclesfield.  The store would  meet a  ‘location-specific’ need  and serve  the planned  new residential
development as  well as encouraging  sustainable convenience  shopping  patterns.
15.197 Given the planned regeneration of Macclesfield town centre, it is important that the proposed
Class  A1 superstore predominantly meets convenience  shopping  needs  and the council  will seek  to
control the quantum of non-food retail floorspace via  appropriate planning  conditions.
15.198 The socio-economic  profile of south Macclesfield suggests that there are  pockets within
this part of the town which  are most likely  to suffer from deprivation.  The allocation of employment
land within this site will  help  to improve  access  to employment opportunities for local  residents and
also contribute to the town's overall  employment needs.
15.199 The site is  in close  proximity to the Danes  Moss  SSSI and  any new  development will  need
to be  respectful of this fact. The council  will expect all  existing landscape  features to be  retained,
where  possible, as  well as the retention of any  trees subject of a  Tree  Preservation Order unless
there are  exceptional circumstances for their removal. An extensive network of green  infrastructure
will be required  on site, particularly to the south in  order  to integrate the site successfully into the area
229 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsand to help  mitigate any  impacts on  the SSSI.  A comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  will be required
to soften the urban  edge  and ensure  the site responds  positively to the character and  appearance  of
this area  as well as providing  an appropriate buffer between the built form and  the SSSI. Dependant
on the layout of the site a structural landscape buffer with appropriate planting may also be considered
necessary  adjacent to the railway  line in order  to assist mitigation of noise.
15.200 The site has  also  been  identified as  a site having  ecological  potential. A more  detailed
consideration should be given to this through the submission of an ecological survey and incorporation
of mitigation measures.
15.201 The site will  be served  by a new  link road  between Congleton Road  (A536) and  London
Road  (A523). The road  will be constructed in  a phased  manner, proportionate to the development of
adjacent housing, retailing and  business. The development of the eastern portion of the site will
require  completion of the link  road  to London  Road. No  development is  expected to be  served  from
the existing road  network to the north.
15.202 Appropriate off and  on site highway  works  will be necessary  to enable  sustainable linkages
between the site and  the town centre without exacerbating current traffic congestion pressures. The
council  will expect cycle  and  pedestrian routes to ensure  sustainable modes  of transport are
encouraged.
15.203 Due to the scale  of this development and  sensitive constraints, a  master plan  should  be
submitted so  the site may  be planned  in a co-ordinated and  comprehensive  manner.
15.204 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.205 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to the Danes  Moss  SSSI:
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
Impact of increased  foot traffic on  the sensitive fen meadow  vegetation
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land  will be delivered  during  the middle  part of the plan  period

Site LPS 14:  Land East of Fence Avenue, Macclesfield
15.206 This site is  located to the east of Macclesfield, between the current urban  area  and the
Macclesfield Canal. Part of the site is currently occupied  by the King's School and the site also includes
areas  of agricultural land. Overall, it covers  an area  of approximately 13  hectares.  Adjacent land
uses  include  the Fence Avenue  Industrial Estate and  residential areas.  The Macclesfield Canal
bounds  the south-eastern end  of the site.
15.207 This site presents a  suitable opportunity for the delivery  of a sustainable and  high  quality
residential development in  a central and  accessible  location.
15.208 Part of the site is  within the Buxton Road  Conservation Area and  the Macclesfield Canal
Conservation Area. Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 14
Land East of Fence Avenue, Macclesfield
The development of Land  East of Fence Avenue  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be
achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  250 new  homes, including  the sensitive conversion  of the main
school building to apartments; development will focus on the school curtilage (which includes
the sports fields);
2. Incorporation of green  infrastructure throughout the site, to include  an appropriate level  of
open  space  provision; an  area  adjacent to the canal  shall  be retained as  open  space
encompassing  land  either side  of the Smyth’s  Bridge; this will  retain some  of the naturalised
setting, including  the belt of tree planting to the west of the bridge  (in order  to minimise
impact on  the conservation area  and landscape  designation area);
3. Improvement of existing and  provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to existing residential
areas, shops, schools and health facilities; in particular, improvements to the canal towpath;
231 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations4. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space  and community facilities; and
5. Attention to the quality of landscaping and the design of the new built development, including
a sensitive approach  to density, massing  and height.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Public realm  provision  must play  a critical part of any  proposals, reflecting the green
credentials of the site. These spaces  will need  to be  safe and  secure  and appropriately
managed.
b. Proposals should  retain the main  school  building  which  faces onto Fence Avenue.
c. Green infrastructure provision  should  be prioritised throughout the site. It must connect with
the town centre by  providing  links  to the bottom of Hurdsfield Road  and Fence Avenue  to
link to Victoria Park and  also  to the eastern edge  of the site which  provides  connectivity
with the wider  Green Belt and  open  countryside. Existing trees and  hedgerows  should  be
retained where  possible  as these make  a valuable  contribution to the character of the area,
and its relationship with surrounding  land  uses. The scale  and design  of new  development
therefore needs  to reflect the urban  fringe character at the edges  of the site and  green
infrastructure also  needs  to permeate from the edges  into the main  body  of the site.
d. The Macclesfield Canal, which frames the southern portion of the site, provides an excellent
opportunity for improved  permeability and  connectivity with any  proposed  development and
also for enhancement of the public  right of way. The development provides  the opportunity
to enhance  the usability of the canal  and connectivity of the site to it through connection to
the towpath via  Smyth’s  Bridge, bringing  it back  into positive use.
e. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes;.
f. Transport improvements as  determined through any  future transport study.
g. Retention (or  replacement) and  enhancement of playing  fields and  sporting facilities are
required  as part of the development. The retention and/or replacement of the indoor  and
outdoor sports facilities should  be in accordance  with the findings of an  adopted, up  to date
and robust needs  assessment.
h. The setting of the Church  of the Holy  Trinity should  be protected by  excluding  the elevated
land directly opposite the church  from development (i.e. retaining it as  open  green
space/pasture) and  maintaining the quality and  density of landscaping  on the eastern edge
of the site, including  retention of existing tree belts and  hedges. The identifiable tree line
along  the eastern edge  of the site should  be strengthened by  additional planting to form a
strong Green Belt boundary.
i. Any application would need to be supported by a full ecological  appraisal, including a detailed
botanical survey  of the grassland  habitats on  site. Mitigation would  be required  to address
any impacts on protected species. Any woodland, priority habitats or  habitats of local wildlife
site quality on  the site should  be retained.
j. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.209 Located to the north of Buxton Road  and within 500m  of Macclesfield town centre, this site
presents itself as  a very  sustainable location as  it is within easy  walking  distance of local  amenities
(shops  / library)  and public  transport provision  (bus  stops, train station).
15.210 The site is  one of two sites currently occupied  by The King's School who  are seeking  to
consolidate existing operations into one  site. The council  intends to identify a  new  site for The King's
School through its Site Allocations Development Plan Document.  This has  the benefits of releasing
central, sustainably-located sites for development and  will enable  improved  school  and  sporting
facilities to be  developed.
15.211  The Fence Avenue  site includes  a main  school  building  and a series  of ancillary  buildings
to the east. The main  school  building  dates back  to 1909  and although not listed it is  considered  to
be of architectural merit and  offers an  important contribution to the character of the Buxton Road
Conservation Area, within which  it is located. A sympathetic conversion  of the existing building  is
therefore required.
15.212 The remainder  of the site consists of playing  fields, farmland and  a wooded  valley  and is
framed by  the Macclesfield Canal. The main  school  building  and western boundary  of the site is
located within the Buxton Road  Conservation Area and  the eastern boundary  runs  parallel  to the
Macclesfield Canal  Conservation area.
15.213 The site sits adjacent to the Cheshire  Green Belt to the east and  it lies  within an  area
identified as  the “Peak Park Fringe” within the Cheshire  East: Local  Landscape  Designation Study
(2013). Any new  development on  this site must respect the landscape  character of this particular
area, the openness  of the adjacent Green Belt and  have  regard  to Policy SE 15  'Green Infrastructure',
and landscape  will therefore be  important to ensuring  the proposed  development integrates well  into
the character of this particular area.

Land at  Congleton Road, Macclesfield
The development of land  at Congleton Road  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved
through:
1. The delivery  of around  300 new  dwellings;
2. Provision of around  10 hectares of employment land  and employment related uses;
3. Incorporation of green infrastructure, including a neighbourhood park  and public open space;
4. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities; this could link to Site LPS 13 and provide a strategic south west green route around
the town;
5. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space  and community facilities; and
6. A master plan  should  be submitted so  the site may  be planned  in a co-ordinated and
comprehensive  manner. Development must be  in accordance  with an  agreed  masterplan
which  must detail how  a readily  recognisable  Green Belt boundary  would  be reinforced that
will endure  in the long  term.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development would  be expected to contribute towards off-site road  infrastructure
improvements in  the central and  southern Macclesfield area.
b. Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive  development of the adjacent
safeguarded land  will not be  permitted (Site reference LPS 19).
c. The access road must be designed to serve any potential future development on the adjacent
safeguarded land  and it must be  of a standard to form part of any  future South West
Macclesfield Link  Road.
d. The development would  be expected to provide  improvements to existing and  include  the
provision  of new  pedestrian, cycle  and public  transport links  to existing and  proposed
residential and  employment areas, shops, schools  & health facilities. The provision  of a
south west green  route would  link with existing north to south routes in  the form of the
Macclesfield Canal  and Middlewood  Way.
e. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
f. The development should  deliver  compensatory habitats on  the site as  required.
g. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment is  required  for the site, with targeted evaluation
and appropriate mitigation being  carried  out, if required.
h. A landscaped buffer should be incorporated between development and the rear of properties
on Hillcrest Road.
i. Any application would  need  to be  supported by  a full ecological  appraisal. Mitigation would
be required  to address  any impacts on  protected species. Any woodland, orchards  or other
priority habitats or  habitats of local  wildlife site quality on  the site should  be retained and
buffered by  areas  of open  space/habitat creation.
j. Any development proposals  must avoid  any impacts on  Local  Wildlife Sites. This should
include  indirect impacts resulting from changes  in hydrology, hydrochemistry, air  pollution
and recreational impacts.
k. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.

incorporating land  to the north and  south of Gaw End Lane. The site is  mainly  agricultural land,
adjacent to the Council  Depot at the northern-eastern corner.  Surrounding uses  include  Lyme  Green
Business Park, residential uses  and agricultural land.
15.231 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary. The new  Green
Belt boundary  uses  physical  features that are  readily  recognisable. These are  London  Road  (A523),
the Macclesfield Canal  and the wooded  boundary  to Rayswood  Nature Reserve.

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 17
Gaw End Lane, Macclesfield
The development of Gaw End Lane over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved through:
1. The delivery  of around  300 homes;
2. Incorporation of green  infrastructure which  should  include  the following:
i. Green linkages  to the wider  footpath network, habitats and  site LPS 13  including  links
to the north/south strategic link  of the Macclesfield Canal. Land  to the southwest of
the site adjacent to the canal  should  remain  undeveloped  and is allocated for open
space  within site LPS 17  as shown  on Figure 15.19;
ii. New public  open  space;
iii. Green buffers to London  Road/Leek Road  and Macclesfield Canal; and
iv. An area  of protected open  space  adjacent Rayswood  Nature Reserve  as shown  on
the proposals  map;
3. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities; and
4. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space  and community facilities.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Buffer zone  of semi-natural habitats to be  provided  adjacent to the Macclesfield Canal  SBI.
b. Development must be  sensitive to the conservation area  and listed structures / buildings.
The retention of open  space  on the western edge  of the site would  help  safeguard the
immediate context from urbanising  development up  to the canal  edge, where  it would  most
dramatically affect views and the sense of openness within the bend in the canal. Regarding
the setting of Toll  Bar cottage the impact could  be lessened  in the approach  taken to the
site’s  planning, by  retaining the mature boundary  landscaping  opposite the property and
also by using  this south easterly part of the site as  a pedestrian gateway into the scheme,
with associated open  space.
c. This Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
d. The site will  be developed  only  where  it can  be demonstrated that there is  no significant
harm  on the Danes  Moss  SSSI, particularly in  relation to changes  in water levels  and quality
and recreational pressures. This should  include  a full assessment of the direct and  indirect
impacts of the development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be
avoided, appropriate mitigation measures  will be required  to ensure  protection of the SSSI
e. Any application would  need  to be  supported by  a full ecological  appraisal. Ecological
mitigation would  be required  to address  any adverse  impacts.
f. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at

Justification
15.232 The site is  located to the south of Macclesfield, is  well  related to the existing highways
network and  Lyme  Green business  park  and  its allocation required  a revision  to the Green Belt
boundary. The site has  been  identified to deliver  some  300 dwellings.
15.233 The site is  detached from the main  urban  area  of Macclesfield; however  it does  have  a
strong relationship to the business  park  at Lyme  Green and  good  access  to key  services, facilities
and employment opportunities by  a range  of modes  of transport. Due  to a  lack  of constraints and
major  infrastructure requirements the site is  available  for future development in  the short term.
15.234 There are  some  natural features within the site which  is adjacent to a  Site of Biological
Importance and  includes  heritage assets within the Macclesfield Canal  Conservation Area, notably
a listed canal  bridge.  Development must be  sensitive to the conservation area  and listed structures
/ buildings  and any noise  impact from adjacent land  uses  should  be mitigated against.
15.235 It is essential that investment is delivered to improve public transport infrastructure, pedestrian
and cycle  links  and other appropriate improvements to enhance  the sustainability of this location.
15.236 Any proposals  should  include  a buffer zone  of semi-natural habitats adjacent to the
Macclesfield Canal  and SBI. The area  of protected open  space  (as shown  on the Figure 15.19) will
also act as  a buffer to the woodland  area  of Rayswood  Nature Reserve.
15.237 Through the protection of existing features and  the provision  of appropriate infrastructure
and services, development here  can form a  sustainable extension to Macclesfield supporting the
prosperity and  vitality of the town through the plan  period.
15.238 Development here  relates well  to Lyme  Green Business Park and  the highway  network
within the southern area  of Macclesfield town.

15.240 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to the Danes  Moss  SSSI:
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work

1. The delivery  of around  150 new  dwellings;
2. Provision of public  open  space  and green  linkages  to existing footpaths and  rights of way;
3. The incorporation of natural features such  as trees, the existing pond  and landform features
into any  development proposal;
4. Creating a readily  recognisable Green Belt boundary, that will endure in  the long term, along
the western edge  by tree planting and  landscaping  along  the existing hedge  line extending
north-eastwards to the existing pond;
5. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities; and
6. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, open  space  and community facilities.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development would  be expected to contribute towards off-site road  infrastructure
improvements in  the central, western and  southern/south western Macclesfield area.
b. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
c. The line  of the existing sewer  should  be protected.
d. The site should  be developed  so as to facilitate any  junction improvements that may  be
necessary  for a  future road  link between Chelford Road  and Congleton Road.

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 20:  White Moss Quarry, Alsager
15.255 The White Moss  Quarry site is  located to the west of Alsager and  covers  areas  of the peat
and sand  workings  and associated aggregate recycling  operations at White Moss.  Although classed
as greenfield (as  subject to restoration conditions), areas  of land  have  been  extensively disturbed by
mineral  extraction.  The remainder  of the location is  in agricultural use  and contains a  variety of
wooded areas, existing hedgerows and field systems, to be retained or incorporated into the proposed
scheme.  It is  proposed  that development will  be focused on  the south eastern part of this location
allowing  for the wider  existing worked  areas  to be  effectively restored.
Site LPS 20
White Moss Quarry, Alsager
The development of White Moss  Quarry over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved
through:
1. The provision  of around  350 new  homes  in the plan  period  (at a  density of between 25  and
35 dwellings  per hectare);
2. The creation of a  new  local  centre including:
i. Appropriate retail provision  to meet local  needs; and
ii. A small  scale  community facility that will  be capable  of accommodating a  variety of
uses.
3. The incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. A significant depth of native woodland  and other semi-natural habitat screening  along
all relevant boundaries  to provide  a buffer between the development and  the M6  (at
least 40  metres) and  to offset detrimental visual  impact to the open  countryside, along
with the creation of wildlife habitats, including  those for protected species;
ii. The retention, where  possible, of important hedgerows that have a cumulative screening
impact on  development and  contribute to the habitat value  of the site;
iii. The creation of drainage  ponds  that have  visual  and habitat potential;
iv. Open space  including  multi use  games  area, equipped  children's play  space  and
facilities for teenagers; and
v. Open space  provision  to accommodate the need  for enhanced  or new  indoor  and
outdoor sports facilities to accommodate the additional demand  from the housing. 
Provision should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up  to date and  robust Playing Pitch
Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Ensure the delivery  of a high  quality and  sustainable development which  respects the
character of local  landscape  and delivers  excellent urban  and architectural design.
b. Provision of new  access  and highways  improvements to the surrounding  area.
c. Improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to connect
the site to Alsager town centre, existing and  proposed  residential areas, employment areas,
shops, schools  and health facilities.
d. The development would  be expected to contribute to improvements to existing and  the
provision  of new  public  transport links  to Alsager town centre and  local  villages.
e. Development proposals would be expected to fully assess  and mitigate any potential adverse
impacts in  line with the policy  requirements of Policy SE 12  'Pollution, Land  Contamination
and Land  Instability'.
f. Development would  be expected to allow  for full remediation and  restoration of the worked
areas  contributing to provision  of green  infrastructure.
249 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsg. Full integration of existing trees and  hedgerows  within a  network of green  spaces, which
connect within and  beyond  the site to existing services  in Alsager.
h. Protection of, and  enhancements to, the existing Local  Wildlife Site covering  parts of the
location.
i. Provision of affordable housing  in line with the policy  requirements set out in  Policy SC 5
'Affordable Homes'.
j. Contributions to highways  improvements on  Butterton Lane  B5077 and  B5078 Radway
Green Road, and  contributions towards or  delivery  of improvements to junctions within the
town.
k. Contributions to education and  health infrastructure.
l. Proposals would  need  to demonstrate that any  surviving  peat and  associated deposits do
not require  further analysis  or is not worthy of preservation on  palaeoecological  grounds.
If this could  not be  done, further archaeological  and palaeoenvironmental work  may  be
required  involving  specialist palaeoenvironmental input.
m. The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is  no adverse impact
on the Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 2 Ramsar and Oakhanger Moss SSSI, particularly
in relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational pressures. This should
include  a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and  indirect impacts of the
development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be  avoided,
appropriate avoidance  mitigation measures  will be required  to ensure  no adverse  effects
on the integrity of sites.
n. A site specific Flood Risk  Assessment should  be prepared.
o. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.

15.256 The location consists of areas  that have  been  subjected to mineral  related development in
the form of peat and  sand  extraction for agricultural and  horticultural purposes  with associated
aggregate recycling  operations.  Remaining  areas  are in agricultural use  and contain a  variety of
wooded  areas, existing hedgerows and field systems, to be retained and incorporated into the proposed
scheme.
15.257 The site offers the opportunity to deliver  homes  within close  proximity to Alsager with
excellent access  to the M6  corridor, employment opportunities at Radway  Green Business Park,
incorporation of green  infrastructure and  extended access  to existing services  within Alsager.  The
site would  provide  an extension to Alsager when  joined  with approved  residential development on
adjacent land  to the east, off Crewe  Road.
15.258 A need  for the provision  of affordable housing, additional school  places  and a small  local
centre and  community facility has  been  identified and  the integration of new  pedestrian, cycle  and
transport links.  Development at White Moss  Quarry will also support the vitality and viability of Alsager
town centre.
15.259 The site would  make  a valuable  contribution to the overall  housing  need  for the borough,
whilst contributing to the Local  Plan Strategy Vision  and Strategic Objectives to promote economic
prosperity, create sustainable communities and  protect and  enhance  environmental quality, providing
the opportunity to bring  forward the benefits of restoring land  currently in  use as a quarry.
15.260 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals  and their proximity to a  European
site (consisting of either Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and/or Ramsar
sites).
15.261 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.262 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site (consisting of either a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and/or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Risks  from misconnections, misuse  of garden  chemicals
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
Impact of increased  foot traffic on  the sensitive fen meadow  vegetation
15.263 The site has planning  permission, with a signed s106 Legal Agreement (planning application
ref 13/4132N), for a  mix of uses  including  the provision  of up  to 350  residential dwellings.
15.264 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

Justification
15.267 This site is  comprised  of the former Twyfords Bathrooms headquarters and  the premises
of Cardway  Cartons; the sites are  separated by  a railway  line in active use. It lies  within the south
eastern part of Alsager with extensive road  frontages onto both Crewe  Road  and Linley  Lane. The
253 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationssite is  brownfield land  within the built-up area  of the town, and  includes  part of a  dismantled railway.
There is a small portion of greenspace in the south of the site that forms part of an amenity greenspace
identified as  A30 by  the Open Spaces Assessment.
15.268 The site covers  an area  of approximately 31  hectares. There is  good  access  to the site by
road from the town and  the A50 and  by public  transport services  along  Crewe  Road. The majority of
the site is  currently developed  with the predominant uses  including  warehousing, factory space
delivery  areas  and car parking  for staff.
15.269 The Twyfords site has  outline planning  permission  for 335  dwellings  (planning  application
ref 11/4109C).  The Cardway  site has  outline permission  for 110  dwellings  (planning  application ref
15/2101C), subject to the signing  of a S106 Agreement.
15.270 Retention of existing modern  office space  is considered  appropriate in  order  to maximise
the sustainable reuse  of the site. However, paragraph  22 of the NPPF notes that planning  policies
should  avoid  the long  term protection of employment use  where  there is  no reasonable  prospect of
the site being  used  for that purpose. The Employment Land  Review  (2012)  assessed  the Twyfords
portion of the site. It recommended  consideration of partial change  of use, with the possible  exception
of modern  office development, whilst noting that the site is  not in  a modern  industrial location.
15.271 The council  would  support retention of the valued  trees in  the north eastern corner  of the
site. Full consideration of mitigation and  management should  be given  to the impact on  the footpaths
that border  the site, and  the amenity greenspace  that falls within it.
15.272 Archaeological investigations will  be required  on the site due  to the presence  of Bronze
Age Barrow archaeological  deposits to the north east of the site. Any necessary  mitigation should  be
put in  place, and  development should  respect the presence  of the barrow.
15.273 The possibility of contamination resulting from the previous  industrial use  of the site must
be fully appraised  and mitigation undertaken as  necessary.
15.274 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.275 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site (consisting of either a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas, and/or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry

15.276 It has  been  identified through the Alsager Town  Centre Supplementary Planning Document
that accessibility to and  within the town centre for cyclists and  pedestrians needs  to be  improved.

15.279 The site is  located to the north west of Alsager and  within the established urban  area. It
covers  an area  of approximately 22  hectares. The site's oldest buildings  date to the 1940s  and were
built to accommodate munitions workers. The majority of buildings  on the site date to the 1960s. The
site was  occupied  by the University since  1992, although the majority of their operations have  now
relocated to Crewe. The site currently comprises various unused  buildings. The sports hall, gymnasium,
changing  rooms  and playing  fields remain  in use, but will  be provided  in Crewe  in coming  years.
15.280 The site is  bounded  to the north and  west by  countryside; to the east by  Hassall  Road; and
to the south by  Dunnocksfold Road.
15.281 The site was  allocated for up  to 150  dwellings  in the Congleton Local  Plan, as  part of a
mixed-use allocation under Policy DP3A. It is the subject of a Development Brief SPD, which identifies
the potential for 300  homes. The site is  subject to a  planning  application for 408  homes  and sports
pitches (15/5222C).
15.282 The council will support the retention of existing hedges and trees, particularly those shielding
the sports pitches at the junction of Hassall  Road  and Dunnocksfold Road.
15.283 Focus should be  given to the sustainable management of surface water on the site including
use of SuDS.
15.284 Situated adjacent to the corner  of the existing settlement, the site presents an  excellent
opportunity to contribute to housing stock in the area, whilst retaining and enhancing important leisure
facilities, forming a  wider  leisure  hub linked  to the adjacent school  and Cheshire  East Council  Leisure
Centre.
15.285 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure

22,000 square  metre facility at Radway  Green Brownfield allows  for the redevelopment of part of the
site for high  quality employment use.
Site LPS 23
Radway Green Brownfield, Alsager
The regeneration and  redevelopment of Radway  Green Brownfield over  the Local  Plan Strategy
period  will be achieved  through:
1. 10 hectares of employment land;
2. Incorporation of green  infrastructure;
3. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas  and shops; and
4. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards transport and
highways.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation and  remediation as
necessary, may  be required  at a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
b. Contributions to M6  junction 16  improvements and  the railway  level  crossing  on Radway
Green Road.
c. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment shall  be carried  out to determine if any  future
evaluation/mitigation will  be needed  and a programme  of archaeological  building  recording
(at level  2 as defined in  English Heritage 2006, Understanding Historic Buildings p.14)
undertaken for those buildings  and structures associated with the ordnance  factory during
the Second and  Cold  Wars.
d. The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is  no adverse impact
on the Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 2 Ramsar and Oakhanger Moss SSSI, particularly
in relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational pressures. This should
include  a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and  indirect impacts of the
development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be  avoided, with
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.

Justification
15.291 Radway Green Brownfield is a well-established mixed-use employment area, offering office,
industrial and  research, and  development workspace. It is  located to the south west of Alsager and
to the north east of junction 16  of the M6  motorway. Surrounding uses  include  employment and  open
countryside.
15.292 The Employment Land  Review  identified the area  adjacent to this site as  well-established,
attractive to the logistics sector, and  in a good  commercial  location. It recommended  that the site
continue in  employment use.
15.293 The council will support the incorporation of green infrastructure for the purposes of screening
and environmental improvement.
15.294 The possibility of contamination resulting from the industrial use  of the site must be  fully
appraised.
15.295 An archaeological  assessment will  be required, to ensure  that there will  not be  an impact
on undesignated heritage assets. The Royal  Ordnance Factory (ROF no. 13)  is a non-designated
heritage asset recorded  on the Cheshire  Historic Environment Record  (CHER 4122)  and  was
established in  1940  to produce  .303 ammunition. Many  of the extant buildings  are visible  on 1940s
RAF aerial  photographs of the site held  in the HER and  therefore date to the Second World  War.
Furthermore, these buildings  continued in  use into the equally  significant Cold  War period  and some
of the later supporting buildings  will date from this period.
15.296 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals  and their proximity to a  European
site (consisting of either Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and  / or Ramsar
sites).
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 260
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.297 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site (consisting of either a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and/or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Risks  from misconnections, misuse  of garden  chemicals
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
Impact of increased  foot traffic on  the sensitive fen meadow  vegetation
15.298 Any development proposal  should  take into consideration the policy  requirements set out
in Policy CO 2  'Enabling Business Growth Through Transport Infrastructure', and  the need  to improve
sustainable travel options particularly in  the wider  cross  border  context.

Radway Green Extension, Alsager
The development of Radway Green Extension over  the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved
through:
1. The provision  of 25  hectares of employment land.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The provision  of green  infrastructure, including:
i. The creation of wildlife habitats, including  those for protected species;
ii. The retention, where possible, of important hedgerows and trees that have a cumulative
screening  impact on  development and  contribute to the ecological  value  of the site;
and
iii. A substantial landscape  buffer along  the site boundaries  but particularly along  the
boundaries  of the site with the Green Belt.
b. Improvements to site access, potentially to allow  for better access  to the Radway  Green
site as  a whole, as  well as improvements to existing access  and provision  of new  pedestrian
and cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas  and shops.
c. Contributions to improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  public  transport links  to
Crewe  Railway  Station, Crewe  town centre, Alsager town centre and  local  villages.
d. Contributions to M6  junction 16  improvements and  the railway  level  crossing  on Radway
Green Road.
e. The delivery  of a high  quality designed  development at this key  site in  the Green Belt.
f. The development should  provide  compensatory habitat for protected and  priority species,
as required, on  the site.
g. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment shall  be carried  out to determine if any  further
evaluation / mitigation will  be needed.
h. The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is  no adverse impact
on the Midland Meres and  Mosses Phase 2 Ramsar and  Oakhanger Moss SSSI  particularly
in relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational pressures.  This should
include  a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and  indirect impacts of the
development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be  avoided,
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.
i.  A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
j. Appropriate boundary treatments should be implemented to provide a  clearly defined Green
Belt boundary  that is  likely  to endure.
Justification
15.300 The site is  located on  the B5078 about 2  kilometres to the south west of Alsager and  adjoins
the Radway  Green Industrial Estate, a  mature employment area  developed  in open  countryside
around  a munitions factory during  the post war  period.
15.301 The future development of the site is conditional upon  contributions to highway infrastructure
improvements, notably an  upgrading  of junction 16  on the M6.

15.302 The incorporation of green  infrastructure, notably trees and  hedgerows, together with
sensitive design  in terms of the scale  and massing  of any  new structures, has  the potential to mitigate
any potential adverse  impacts on  visual  amenity from main  public  vantage points.
15.303 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  enhancing  the environment of the local  area  and
improving  the health and  wellbeing  of employees.
15.304 The principal  access  to the site will  be via the existing Radway  Green Road  (B5078) where
there is  the potential to provide  a safe access  with adequate highway  capacity to serve  a strategic
employment allocation of this scale. The access  should  also be constructed so  as to facilitate access
to the wider  Radway  Green Site.  A new  access  at this point will  avoid  conflict with the constrained
railway  crossing  and  enhance  the attractiveness and  efficiency of the site as  a whole. Further
improvements to the public  transport network, together with new  pedestrian/cycle links, will  enhance
the site’s  accessibility to Key/Local Service Centres and  the principal  rail hub at Crewe.
15.305 A total of 380  hectares of employment land  is to be  provided  during  the plan  period  up to
2030  and this has  been  informed by  the Employment Land  Review  (2012). This site will  make  a
positive contribution to the employment land  supply  equation.
15.306 An archaeological  assessment will  be required, to ensure  that there will  not be  an impact
on undesignated heritage assets.
15.307 Habitats for protected species, if required, will  be provided.
15.308 The strategic importance of Radway  Green and  its location within the M6  Growth Corridor
from Birmingham to Manchester allows  it to act as  the key  linkage  between these major  hubs  and
the wider  Cheshire  economy, and  provides  the opportunity to retain key  existing jobs  and promote
economic  growth and  further diversification at the site. This is  also  supportive of the 'All Change  for
Crewe; High  Growth City'  initiative for the delivery  of economic  growth along  the M6  growth corridor.

that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.312 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the site due  to its proximity to a  European site (consisting of either a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas, and/or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
Impact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  site
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status

a. The provision  of green  infrastructure, including:
i. The retention of the watercourse and  an undeveloped  8 metres wide  buffer zone  of
open  space/seminatural habitats should  be provided  alongside  it.
ii. The creation of wildlife habitats
iii. Sustainable drainage

d. Contributions to M6  junction 16  improvements and  the railway  level  crossing  on Radway
Green Road.
e. A site specific Flood Risk  Assessment should  be prepared.
f. New development will  be expected to respect any  flooding constraints on  the site and,
where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation.
g. Provision of new pedestrian and cycle links to new and existing residential areas, and shops.
h. The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is  no adverse impact
on the Midland Meres and Mosses Phase 2 Ramsar and Oakhanger Moss SSSI, particularly
in relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational pressures. This should
include  a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and  indirect impacts of the
development on  the features of special  interest.  Where impacts cannot be  avoided,
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.
i. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Justification
15.315 The site is  located on  the B5077 to the south west of Alsager close  to the Radway  Green

15.320 Habitats for protected species, if required, will  be provided.
15.321 Part of the site is  affected by  flood risk  (Valley  Brook), and  a Sequential Test has  been
applied in line with national planning policy. Policy PG 6 'Spatial Distribution of Development' identifies
that an  additional 40  hectares of employment land  should  be provided  at Alsager. In the absence  of
alternative, reasonably  available  sites within or  immediately adjacent to Alsager for employment
development with a  lower  probability of flooding, the allocation of Radway  Green North satisfies the
Sequential Test. Through a  site specific Flood Risk  Assessment, carried  out to inform any  planning
application proposal, it should  be demonstrated that the proposed  development would  be safe from
fluvial flooding, and  would  not increase  the risk  of flooding elsewhere. As with any  development
adjacent to a  main  river  an undeveloped  buffer zone, at least 8  metres wide  (measured  from the bank
top), alongside  the whole  extent of the watercourse, should  be provided. Bank top is  defined as  the
point at which  the bank  meets normal  land  levels.
15.322 The buffer zone  scheme  shall  be free from built development including  lighting, domestic
gardens, formal landscaping, footpaths etc; and could form a vital part of green infrastructure provision.
The buffer zone  would  also  serve  the purpose  of protecting the Brook from the adverse  impacts of

15.329 The focus for Congleton over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be that of high  quality
employment led  growth to accommodate the expansion  of existing businesses  and  attract new
investment into the town. New  housing  is seen  as important as  part of a  balanced  and integrated
portfolio of development to support the town centre and ensure  balanced and sustainable communities.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 268
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.330 At the heart of the development strategy for Congleton is  the construction of the Congleton
Link Road. It will  assist in  meeting the objective of employment led  growth as  it will  support:
The economic, physical  and social  regeneration of the town;
The opening up of new development sites in particular to improve access to Radnor Park Industrial
Estate and  Congleton Business Park;
The reduction in  existing town centre traffic and  to facilitate town centre regeneration;
The improvement of strategic transport links  across  the borough;
The reduction in  community severance  along  key town centre corridors;
The reduction in  traffic related pollutants within the town especially  on those areas  declared  Air
Quality Management Areas.
15.331 The Congleton Link  Road  runs  to the north of the town connecting the A534 Sandbach
Road  to the A536 Macclesfield Road. As well  as providing  other benefits, it directly unlocks
considerable  opportunities to create new  homes, jobs, green  infrastructure and  other community
facilities to the north of the town. The link  road  is therefore necessary  for land  allocations to take
place.
15.332 The Congleton Link  Road  received  planning  approval  in June  2016  (15/4480C). To  facilitate
this key  public  infrastructure, no  development will  be permitted on  the land  required  for the delivery
of the link  road. The council  has also  agreed  a funding strategy at its Cabinet meeting of 14  June
2016. The link  road  will be funded from a  number  of sources  and to facilitate the early  delivery  of the
link road  and unlock  the full extent of the adjacent allocations, the council  intends to provide  forward
funding to enable its construction. The approach is to secure financial contributions from development
unlocked  by the link  road  including  retrospective contributions should  the road  have  already  been
committed (as  evidenced  through a  construction contract being  let by  the council)  and / or completed
by the time that development is  granted planning  permission. The council  will seek  appropriate
contributions to the infrastructure requirements of individual  sites as  set out in  policy  requirements
and in line with Policy IN 1  'Infrastructure' and  IN 2 'Developer Contributions'. This approach  may  be
superseded  in the future through the adoption and  implementation of a  Community Infrastructure
Levy  Charging  Schedule.
15.333 The layout and  extent of the sites to the north of Congleton have  been  informed by  the
proposed  route of the Congleton Link  Road. The North Congleton Masterplan has  been  prepared  to
inform the allocation of land  and provide  further guidance  on the following sites:
Back Lane  and Radnor  Park (LPS 26);
Congleton Business Park (LPS 27);
Giantswood Lane  South (LPS 28);
Giantswood Lane  to Manchester Road  (LPS 29);
Manchester Road  to Macclesfield Road  (LPS 30).

15.336 The Back Lane  and Radnor  Park site to the northwest of the town is  significant in  scale
extending from Black Firs Lane  and Chelford Road  to the River  Dane. It presents an  opportunity to
establish a  high  quality extension to Radnor  Park Trading  Estate alongside  prominent leisure  and
recreational uses. Residential development will  support the creation of this sustainable community
set in  ample  green  space  which  supports existing wildlife areas  and the River  Dane  which  is a key
asset to the town. Key to this development will  be the provision  of the Congleton Link  Road. The
Village  Green at Back Lane  will be retained and  enhanced.
15.337 Surrounding uses  include  the Radnor  Park Trading  Estate, residential uses, playing  fields,
open  countryside, agricultural land, woodland  and the River  Dane.
Site LPS 26
Back  Lane / Radnor Park, Congleton
The development of Back Lane / Radnor Park over the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved
through:
1. The delivery  of, or  a contribution towards, the Congleton Link  Road;
2. The delivery  of around  750 new  homes  (at approximately 30  dwellings  per hectare) as  set
out in  Figure 15.31 of the LPS;
3. The delivery  of around  7 hectares of employment land  adjacent to Radnor  Park Trading

271 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsshould integrate with the adjacent uses, particularly through sustainable transport, pedestrian
and cycle  links.
f. The delivery  of appropriate public  transport links  to connect with employment, housing  and
retail / leisure  uses  in the town.
g. The provision  of pedestrian and  cycle  routes to provide  clear  and safe links  to surrounding
communities.
h. A desk-based  archaeological  assessment will  be required  for any  future application on  this
site.
i. The site will  provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy  requirements set out in  Policy
SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
j. Future development should have reference to the River  Dane Local Wildlife Site and Ancient
Woodland.
k. Future development should  also  have  consideration to Policy SE 14  'Jodrell Bank'.
l. In order  to ensure  a sustainable, mixed  use scheme  is delivered  on the site, the council  will
require  all housing  proposals  to demonstrate, through the execution of a  s106  Agreement
or appropriate alternative, how  the delivery  of employment land  as an extension to the
Radnor  Park Trading  Estate will  be positively supported.
m. The visual, noise  and pollution assessment of development should  be undertaken with the
assumption that the link  road  is in situ and  suitable screening  / mitigation provided
accordingly. Noise  and visual  mitigation measures  should  be provided  between future and
existing employment / residential areas. This could  include  separation distances, acoustic
fencing, earth mounding, tree planting and  building  orientation.
n. Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up

‘Indoor and  Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
o. Future development should  provide  an appropriate buffer with the Ancient Woodland  along
the River  Dane  corridor.
p. Future development should  provide  an east to west greenway  with pedestrian and  cycle
links across  the site linking  together proposed  and existing leisure  uses, local  retail and
other community facilities at this site with other sites to the north of Congleton. This should
include  a footbridge over  the River  Dane  for pedestrian / cycle  use.
q. The Congleton Link  Road  will form the boundary  for development; except for a  single  area
shown  in Figure 15.31.
r. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
s. The proposed  route of the Congleton Link  Road  is as shown  in Figure 15.31. Development
should  be undertaken with the assumption that the link  road  is in situ. The land  required  for
the construction and  delivery  of the Congleton Link  Road  will be safeguarded from
development.
 
Justification
15.338 The Congleton Link  Road  is the single  largest infrastructure project the council  has
undertaken to date. It is vital to the successful delivery of sites to the north of Congleton and to resolve
long-standing economic  and environmental impacts arising  from congestion in  the town. The link
road will also  improve  connectivity across  the borough  and  access  to the M6. The council  has
recognised  that it may  have  to provide  gap funding upfront in  order  to deliver  the Congleton Link
Road. As the link  road  is an essential component in  the delivery  of sites to the north of Congleton,
the council  will seek  appropriate contributions towards the link  road  from development unlocked  by
the link  road. In the event that the road  is committed (as  evidenced  through a  construction contract
let by  the council)  and / or completed at the time or  planning  permission(s)  being  granted, the council
will seek  appropriate contributions to the Congleton Link  Road  on a retrospective basis.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 272
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.339 The council’s  stated aims  for the delivery  of the sites to the north of Congleton are  that they
should  be delivered  on a comprehensive  basis  in line with the North Congleton Masterplan. The site
cannot be  comprehensively  delivered  without additional highways  capacity provided  by the proposed
Congleton Link  Road  and, as  such, the council  will seek  to ensure  appropriate contributions to the
Congleton Link  Road. The council  will be mindful of the costs of bringing  the site forward in  such
circumstances and  will consider  affordable housing  provision, on  a case  by case  basis, where  it is
demonstrated through robust viability evidence  that 30%  affordable housing  would  render  the
development of a  site unviable  (in line with paragraph  7 of LPS Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'). 
The council’s  expectation is  the site is  delivered  on a comprehensive  basis  in the form of outline
planning application(s), in line with the North Congleton Masterplan, to secure appropriate contributions
towards the delivery  of the Congleton Link  Road  and appropriate contributions to the infrastructure
requirements of individual  sites as  set out in  policy  requirements and  in line with Policy IN 1
'Infrastructure' and  IN 2  'Developer Contributions'. In the event that changing  circumstances impact
on the sites / infrastructure delivery  in line with the stated programme  then the council  will consider
measures  as set out in  Chapter 16  (Monitoring and  Implementation) of the LPS, including  the use  of
its Compulsory  Purchase Powers, in  order  for the stated objectives of the site to be  met.
 
Figure 15.31 Back  Lane and Radnor Park Site
15.340 Future development should  prioritise pedestrian and  cyclist permeability and  achieve  a
green  infrastructure network across  the site to improve  / integrate networks, and  improve  connectivity
and provide  safe direct access  to the town centre and  surrounding  areas.
15.341 Development should  provide  green  links  to the River  Dane  Local  Wildlife Site. It should
promote the inclusion  of areas  of good  quality open  space, including  natural and  semi-natural habitat
and wildlife corridors, within the strategic master planning  of this area, to promote and  enhance  its
biodiversity and  nature conservation potential.
15.342 The Village  Green at Back Lane  will be retained and  enhanced  as part of a  comprehensive
master plan  for this area. Adjoining developments should  include  proposals  for either complementary
recreational facilities or  improvement measures  at the playing  fields or  proposed  country park. A new
273 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsprimary  school  is proposed  off Back Lane. This will  form a  key focus for future community life. The
school  should  be designed  either to allow  convenient dual  use for community events or  with a  stand
alone  community facility.
15.343 Future development should avoid the functional floodplain and include  SuDS, where possible,
to manage  surface runoff and  reduce  the amount of surface water entering the combined  network.
This should  include  a surface water drainage  strategy to consider  measures  such  as attenuation
ponds  / detention basins  and other measures. The provision  of green  and blue  infrastructure will  be
key to the future master planning  of this site.
15.344 Average  residential density should  be 30 dwellings  per hectare across  the site. A varied
density profile across  the site may  be necessary  in response  to site characteristics including  visual
sensitivity, topography, landform and  the existing character of the site. 
15.345 Planning application 13/2746C relating to land  between Black Firs Lane, Chelford Road
and Holmes  Chapel  Road, for the erection of up  to 170  dwellings, public  open  space, green
infrastructure and  associated works  now  has planning  approval.
15.346 The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore initially a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  is required.
15.347 Any development proposal  should  take into consideration  the policy  requirements set out
in Policy CO 2  'Enabling Business Growth Through Transport Infrastructure', and  the need  to improve
sustainable travel options particularly in  the wider  cross  border  context.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land  allocations in  mixed  use schemes  will be phased  in tandem
with the housing  allocations. Where appropriate, the phased  release  of employment land  will be
secured  through S106 agreements/obligations.

15.366 The Congleton Link  Road  is the single  largest infrastructure project the council  has
undertaken to date. It is vital to the successful delivery of sites to the north of Congleton and to resolve
long-standing economic  and environmental impacts arising  from congestion in  the town. The link
road will also  improve  connectivity across  the borough  and  access  to the M6. The council  has
recognised  that it may  have  to provide  gap funding upfront in  order  to deliver  the Congleton Link
Road. As the link  road  is an essential component in  the delivery  of sites to the north of Congleton,
the council  will seek  appropriate contributions towards the link  road  from development unlocked  by
the link  road. In the event that the road  is committed (as  evidenced  through a  construction contract
let by  the council)  and / or completed at the time or  planning  permission(s)  being  granted, the council
will seek  appropriate contributions to the Congleton Link  Road  on a retrospective basis.
15.367 The council’s  stated aims  for the delivery  of the sites to the north of Congleton are  that they
should  be delivered  on a comprehensive  basis  in line with the North Congleton Masterplan. The site
cannot be  comprehensively  delivered  without additional highways  capacity provided  by the proposed
Congleton Link  Road  and as such  the council  will seek  to ensure  appropriate contributions to the
Congleton Link  Road. The council  will be mindful of the costs of bringing  the site forward in  such
circumstances and  will consider  affordable housing  provision, on  a case  by case  basis, where  it is
demonstrated through robust viability evidence  that 30%  affordable housing  would  render  the
development of a  site unviable  in line with paragraph  7 of LPS Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'). The
council’s  expectation is  the site is  delivered  on a comprehensive  basis  in the form of outline planning
application(s), in line with the North Congleton Masterplan, to secure appropriate contributions towards
the delivery of the Congleton Link Road and appropriate contributions to the infrastructure requirements
of individual  sites as  set out in  policy  requirements and  in line with Policy IN 1  'Infrastructure' and  IN
2 'Developer Contributions'. In the event that changing circumstances impact on the sites / infrastructure
delivery  in line with the stated programme  then the council  will consider  measures  as set out in
Chapter 16 (Monitoring and Implementation) of the LPS, including the use of its Compulsory Purchase
Powers, in  order  for the stated objectives of the site to be  met.
15.368 Development should  provide  green  links  to the River  Dane  Local  Wildlife Site. It should
promote the inclusion  of areas  of good  quality open  space, including  natural and  semi-natural habitat
and wildlife corridors, within the strategic master planning  of this area, to promote and  enhance  its
biodiversity and  nature conservation potential. Development of the site should  include  appropriate
landscaping  to minimise  visual  intrusion in  to the Dane  Valley.
15.369 Future development should  include  SuDS,where possible, to manage  surface runoff and
reduce  the amount of surface water entering the combined  network. This should  include  a surface
water drainage  strategy to consider  measures  such  as attenuation ponds  / detention basins  and other
measures. The provision  of green  and blue  infrastructure is  key to the future master planning  of this
site.
15.370 A new  primary  school  is proposed  within the site. This is  likely  to serve  a broad  area  across
the north of Congleton and  will form a  key focus for future community life. The school  should  be
designed  either to allow  convenient dual  use for community events or  with a  stand alone  community
facility. There is  the opportunity to link  the school  with localised  retailing.
15.371 Future development should  consider  a movement strategy and  the importance of a  green
infrastructure network across  the site to improve  and integrate networks and  improve  connectivity
and safe direct access  to the town centre and  surrounding  areas.
15.372 Average  residential density should  be 30 dwellings  per hectare across  the site. A varied
density profile across  the site may  be necessary  in response  to site characteristics including  visual
sensitivity, topography, landform and  the existing character of the site. 
15.373 The site has potential for contamination to be  present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

located off the A34 (Wilmslow-Handforth Bypass), is  bordered  to the north by  the A555 (Manchester
Airport Eastern Link  Road), shares  a boundary  (consisting of open  countryside and  a rugby  and
cricket club)  to the north and  the east with Stockport Metropolitan Borough, and  is bordered  to the
south by  open  countryside, as  well as being  bordered  to the west by  residential, retail and  industrial
development.
15.397 The site is  generally  level  in parts and  gently undulating elsewhere. It comprises  of
predominantly low  grade  agricultural land  with some  ground  cover  from willow  and hawthorn, with
some  mature groups  of hedgerow  and tree cover  to the south east of the site, as  well  as having
various  ponds  across  the site, some  of which  support a  community of great crested newts.
15.398 Areas of the site are  in current use  (MoD  offices and  Total Fitness) and  there are  pockets
of other built development across  the site. A grade  II listed building, Dairy  House  Farm, is  located
within the site; footpaths and  public  rights of way  traverse the site.
15.399 In order to deliver an exemplar sustainable new settlement which  delivers all the infrastructure
and facilities required, a comprehensive  masterplan for the entire site will be  developed and supported
by a North Cheshire Growth Village Design Guide. These documents will be produced in collaboration
with stakeholders and, following full consultation, will  be approved  and adopted by  the council  to
guide  development of the site.
15.400 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 33
North Cheshire Growth Village, Handforth East

demonstrated that the local  centre will  still provide  a vital and  vibrant centre for the new
community;
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 294
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations4. New two form entry primary  school  and provision  of, or  contributions to, secondary  school
provision  to meet projected needs. Proposals should  consider  the potential to include  a
secondary  school  on site;
5. The incorporation of green  infrastructure including:
i. Green corridors;
ii. Country-park style open  spaces;
iii. Public open  space  including  formal sports pitches; and
iv. Allotments and  / or community orchard
6. The provision of, or appropriate contributions towards, the infrastructure and facilities required
to support the development, including  highways  and transport, education, health, open
space  and community facilities.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. High quality design  must reflect and  respect the character of the local  built form (especially
in relation to the setting of listed buildings)  and natural environment creating an  attractive
place  to live  and work, appropriate to its location, through having  a thorough understanding
of the site’s  features and  contributions they make  to the local  area.  Development must be
in accordance with an approved and agreed  comprehensive masterplan and North Cheshire
Growth Village  Design  Guide.
b. A delivery  plan  will be required  showing  the phasing  of development and  timing of provision
of the local  centre and  other community facilities and  infrastructure. Supporting facilities
and infrastructure must be delivered as early as is feasible to emphasise the new settlement’s
sustainable credentials in  its early  years.
c. All new  dwellings  should  aim to achieve  a ‘Built for Life’ accreditation (or  equivalent under
a comparable  successor  scheme)  and where  possible, dwellings  should  aim to achieve  a
‘Built for Life Outstanding’ accreditation (or  equivalent under  a comparable  successor
scheme).
d. The provision  of apartments above  the retail and  other facilities in  the local  centre(s) should
be included  in development proposals  where  feasible and  viable.
e. Features of amenity value  including  mature trees, hedgerows  and ponds  must be  retained
where  possible.
f. Development proposals  should  take advantage of the existing topography and  vegetation
on site where  possible  in order  to minimise  visual  impacts on  the surrounding  landscape.
Significant planting and  landscaping  buffers must be  provided  at the eastern boundary  to
define a  readily  recognisable, defensible and  permanent new  boundary  to the Green Belt.
g. Existing public  rights of way  should  be retained and  appropriate pedestrian and  cycle
linkages  must be  provided  to improve  connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the site
to the wider  local  area, including  improvements to the accessibility of Handforth Railway
Station and  district centre.
h. Improvements must be  made  to other public  transport provision, including  where  possible
direct access  to bus  services  to Handforth district centre and  beyond.
i. Allow for appropriate highway  impact mitigation measures  to the A34 and  A555 corridors.
j. Site access is  primarily to be taken from A34/ Coppice Way  roundabout  and A34 / Handforth
Dean  Retail Park ‘dumbell’  junction. Both of these junctions are  to be  upgraded  as part of
the development. Consideration should  be given  to provision  of an  additional access  point
from the A555.
k. The development should  retain important habitats and  provide  compensatory habitats for
great crested newts and  other protected and  priority species  and habitats on  the site. The
green  corridors  should  be designed  to support the preservation and  enhancement of
biodiversity on  the site.
l. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment will  be required  to determine if any  future
evaluation or  mitigation will  be needed.
m. Development must facilitate the preservation and  refurbishment of the Grade II listed Dairy
House  Farm.
295 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsn. Residential and  other sensitive land  uses  should  be located away  from main  noise  and
pollution sources  and mitigation measures  should  be incorporated where  appropriate.
o. Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive  development of the adjacent
safeguarded land  will not be  permitted (Site reference LPS 35).
p. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
q. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated.  Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
r. Provision of a management plan to govern  the long term use, maintenance and management
of community facilities, public  open  space  and public  realm.

Justification
15.401 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) advises  that sustainable development
may be achieved  through the allocation of new  settlements with self contained facilities and  providing
an opportunity to properly  plan  infrastructure to support new  construction. This is  best achieved
through the local  planning  process  where  a plan-led, co-ordinated approach  can be achieved  with
the early  involvement of key  stakeholders.
15.402 The case  for an  alternative future development option through the allocation of a  major
mixed-use  development at Handforth East was  originally  canvassed  as part of the public  consultation
on the Handforth Town  Strategy.
15.403 The approach  to delivering  a new sustainable community adopted by  the council, has  been
favoured over  the allocation of development sites in  restricted, unsustainable locations having
constrained infrastructure and/or a  lack of local  services  and facilities.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 296
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.404 A concept statement prepared  for the site in  July 2013  advised  that the majority of the site
should  be allocated for residential development and  that densities should  vary  accordingly  to reflect
the neighbouring  environment and  local  character. Medium  density would  be appropriate on  the
northern edge  of the site whilst low  density could  be suitable on  the eastern and  southern edges,
reflecting the relationship with the open  countryside.
15.405 The proposed  commercial  centre is  intended to be  in the north-west portion of the site to
take advantage of the existing primary  vehicular  access  points which  provide  connectivity with
Handforth Dean  and the A34. Similarly, a  local  centre, with a  mixture of uses  including  small  scale
retail, is  intended to be  provided  close  to the roundabout that provides  a direct link  to Handforth Dean
Retail Park whilst schools  would  be best located in  the heart of the residential area. The precise
locations of uses  will be determined through the comprehensive  masterplan. The two form entry
primary  school  provision  will be located on  site. The secondary  school  provision  to meet projected
needs  from the site is  predicted to be  equivalent to 11.5 classrooms  and proposals  should  consider
whether a  new  secondary  school  can also  be accommodated on  site.
15.406 The site access  strategy has  been  informed by  use of the highway  model  developed  for
the A6MARR scheme  and  the primary  site access  will be from an  upgraded  A34/Coppice Way
roundabout and  an upgraded  A34/Handforth Dean  Retail Park ‘dumbbell’  junction. Proposals should
investigate the possibility of including  a complementary access  point from the A555, which  would
provide increased permeability through the site and deliver wider network benefits in terms of providing
an additional connection between the A555 and  A34.
15.407 Given the site’s  proximity to Handforth, Cheadle  Hulme, Bramhall and  surrounding
settlements, the townscape and  vernacular  should  be considered  to inform the character of the
development. High  quality design  should  also be a priority and  proposals  must demonstrate that local
character has  been  respected whilst not compromising  the quality of the environment.
15.408 Landscape  corridors  should  be provided  throughout the site, not only  for convenient
pedestrian and  cycle  leisure  routes but also  to link  recreational spaces. Existing newt mitigation
features present on  site should  remain  and be extended to allow  wildlife to access  foraging areas
through the use  of ‘green  fingers’ extending into, and  beyond, the development. Regard  should  also
be had to the land  safeguarded for potential future development adjacent to the site (site reference
LPS 35).
15.409 The proposed  new  sustainable community is  considered  to be  in line with the social,
economic  and environmental principles  of sustainable development, allowing  it to contribute to the
required  housing, employment and  infrastructure needs  of the borough, whilst addressing  policy
requirements taken as  a whole  within the Local  Plan Strategy and  meeting the requirements of the
NPPF.
15.410 To make  sure  that the North Cheshire  Growth Village  continues as  an exemplar  sustainable
community in  the long  term, future management, maintenance and  ownership  will be addressed  from
the outset to include  a local  management organisation comprising  representatives of the new
community and local authority to allow locally-based long term ownership and management of facilities
in perpetuity.
15.411  Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘ Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities.
15.412 The site has potential for contamination to be  present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

Site LPS 34:  Land Between Clay Lane and Sagars Road, Handforth
15.413 The land  between Clay  Lane  and Sagars Road  presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high
quality, sustainable residential development to contribute to the identified housing  requirement for
Handforth.
15.414 The site is  located to the west of Handforth, bound  by Clay  Lane  (track) to the west, and
Sagars Road  (track) to the south. Whilst there is  open  countryside to the west and  south, the site
adjoins  residential development to the north and  east. The site is  generally  flat.
15.415 There are  a number  of mature trees within and  around  the site, and  the site is  separated
from the adjoining  housing  areas  by Dobbin  Brook. At present, the site is  not publicly-accessible  and
has no footpaths running  through it, although there are  tracks to the west and  south accessible  to
the public.
15.416 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 298
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 34
Land Between Clay Lane and Sagars Road, Handforth
The development of the land  between Clay  Lane  and Sagars Road  over  the Local  Plan Strategy
period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  250 dwellings;
2. Provision of a  direct cycle  and pedestrian link  from the site to the west to improve
connectivity. A link  to the open  space  to the east should  also  be provided  as part of any
development; and
3. Retention of trees and  woodlands  on the edges  of the site, with new  planting to re-enforce
important landscape  features and  to properly  define a  new  Green Belt boundary.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development must be  a high  quality design  which  reflects and  respects the character
of the area  and the amenities of neighbouring  properties.
b. Provide a  comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  which  retains existing mature trees and
hedgerows  particularly on  the perimeter of the site.
c. Creation of a  new  vehicular  access  to the site of sufficient capacity to accommodate the
proposed  development.
d. Improve the connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the site to Handforth town centre
and the wider  local  area  with the provision  of cycle  paths and  pedestrian linkages.
e. Provision should  be made  for public  open  space, possibly  utilising Dobbin  Brook as  a focus
for green  infrastructure. Any new  development will  be expected to make  contributions to
playing  fields and  children’s  play  facilities where  these cannot be  provided  on site.
f. New development will  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on  site
and where  necessary  provide  appropriate mitigation.
g. Provide contributions to health and  education infrastructure.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made  suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated.  Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Justification
15.417 The site offers excellent opportunities for a  sustainable residential development which  will
contribute to meeting Handforth’s  housing  requirements.
15.418 The site is reasonably well  located to Handforth, with bus routes nearby and is within walking
distance to Handforth Railway  Station and  shopping  centre. There is  the opportunity for linkage  to,
and improvement of, adjoining  rights of way  for pedestrians and  cyclists.
15.419 With a  quality design, the development of the site could  respect the character and
distinctiveness of the locality with quality design. Green links  could  be created, improving  local
connectivity and  benefiting new  residents as  well as the wider  area.
15.420  The site has potential for contamination to be present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 36:  North West  Knutsford
15.429 North West Knutsford consists of 3 sites which, together, comprise areas of open countryside
adjacent to, playing  fields, public  rights of way, allotments and  fishing ponds, limited areas  of
employment and a number of listed buildings. The sites are adjacent to existing residential development
on the North West edge  of Knutsford. They present an  opportunity for high  quality, sympathetic low
density residential development with community facilities and the creation of open space. Development
will integrate with existing facilities and  communities and  provide  links  to the settlements to the south
and east of the sites.
15.430 Surrounding land  uses  also  include  the Land  Rover  Car Sales Showroom, the Brookdale
Centre and  Tatton Park.
15.431 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 36
North West  Knutsford
The development of North West Knutsford over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved
through:
1. Phased provision  of around  500 new  homes  and 7.5 hectares of high  quality Class  B1
business  park  development within the following sites:
LPS 36(A) Land  North of Northwich Road  (175  dwellings);
LPS 36(B) Land  West of Manchester Road  (75 dwellings  and the development of a
new 7.5 hectare high  quality Class  B1 business  park; and
LPS 36(C)  Land  East of Manchester Road  250 dwellings;
It is anticipated that separate planning  applications will  deliver  each  of the above  sites,
and with each  site having  independent access, this is  acceptable. Collectively the sites
will deliver, as  appropriate, the following provisions  (2-6)  and each  planning  application
will be assessed  against the relevant site specific criteria (a-u)  as they may  apply  to that
application site.
2. Appropriate retail provision  to meet local  needs;
3. Appropriate:
i. contributions towards educational facilities; and
ii. Provision of open  space, and  provision  of / contributions toward sports and  leisure
facilities;
4. Incorporation of green  infrastructure where  required, including:
i. Allotments; and
ii. Community orchard  or community gardens; and
5. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities;
6. The existing sports grounds  situated between Mereheath Lane  and Manchester Road  to
the south of LPS 36(C)  are removed  from the Green Belt. These are  identified as  protected
open  space  within LPS 36  as shown  on Figure 15.43 and  will be retained in  their entirely
as such, and  enhanced  if possible. The existing allotment gardens  to the east of Mereheath
Lane  remain  in the Green Belt as  protected open  space.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 304
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite Specific Principles of Development
a. Protection and  enhancement of the setting of Tatton Park.
b. The sites will  deliver housing which will  contribute to the local character of Knutsford through
the use  of appropriate density, architecture, style, form and  materials and  reference to CEC
most up  to date Design  Guidance.
c. A mix  of housing  types, sizes  and tenures to comply  with Policy SC 4.
d. Proposals will  be expected to be  of a high  quality design  that respects the setting of nearby
designated heritage assets, parkland and the character of the surrounding area. Development
adjacent to the Toll  House  on Northwich Road  must be  set back  from the road  by a buffer
zone  of mature planting to mitigate the visual  impact of development on  the Toll  House.
e. Proposals will  be expected to include  a Landscape  Character Assessment to guide  the
scale  and massing  of new  development.
f. Provide a  comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  which  retains existing mature trees and
hedgerows  where  possible, or  provide  appropriate mitigation.
g. Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2
‘Indoor and  Outdoor Sports Facilities'.
h. Provision of additional community facilities.
i. Contributions to health infrastructure.
j. Improve the connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the sites to the town centre and
wider local area with the provision of, or contribution to, cycle paths and pedestrian linkages.
k. Creation of a  network of green  infrastructure and  accommodation of SuDS requirements.
l. Provision of high  quality landscaping  to enhance  ecological  features.
m. Provision of new  woodland  belts within the sites and  to create site boundaries.
n. Contribute to road  infrastructure in  the area  including  roundabout improvements at the
junction of A50/Northwich Road  and Canute Place and  Improvement to the A50 Corridor.
Provision within LPS 36(A) and  LPS 36(B) for a  principal  access  road  which, in  the longer
term, would  connect Northwich Road  to Manchester Road  and ensure  connectivity within
the North West Knutsford sites.
o. An archaeological  pre-determination evaluation will  be required  for these sites in  addition
to a desk  based  archaeological  assessment.
p. Any development that would prejudice the future comprehensive  development of the adjacent
safeguarded land  will not be  permitted (site references LPS 39  / LPS 40).
q. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
r. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the sites are, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  they
be found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required
at a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the sites.
s. The sites will  be developed  only  where  it can  be demonstrated that there is  no adverse
impact on  the Midland  Meres  and Mosses  Phase 1  Ramsar, Rostherne Mere  Ramsar  and
Tatton Mere  SSSI particularly in  relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and
recreational pressures. This should include a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct
and indirect impacts of the development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts
cannot be  avoided, appropriate mitigation measures  will be required  to ensure  no adverse
effects on  the integrity of the sites.
t. The development of the new  business  park  within Site LPS 36(B) should:
Be planned  in a comprehensive  way, with the adjacent housing  development site;
Incorporate a high quality of architecture and materials reflective of the site's importance,
being  a gateway location to the town;
Include a high quality landscaped belt to the northern, western and eastern boundaries
of the site to soften the transition between the buildings  on the site and  adjacent open

high quality landscaping  throughout the site;
Provide for pedestrian and  cyclist links  with the adjacent housing  development site;
and
Be limited to buildings  that are  no more  than two storeys in  height.
u. The development of site LPS 36(C)  should:
be planned  in a comprehensive  way;
provide  for open  space  and landscaping  (and  no built development) within the area
removed  from the Green Belt and  identified as  ‘protected informal open  space’  - this
area to comprise  informal open  space  incorporating landscaped  belts along  both
Mereheath Lane and the eastern edge of built development on the site, each landscaped
belt to be a minimum of 15  metres wide and complementary to the landscape character
of the surrounding  area; and
provide  a suitable landscape  screen  within the area  allocated for housing  adjacent to
its eastern boundary  with the ‘protected open  space’. The details of this landscape
screen  should  be informed by  the required  Landscape  Character Assessment and
provide  appropriate mitigation as  part of a  comprehensive  landscape  scheme; and
include  the provision  of a wide  landscaped  belt on  the Green Belt land  to its northern
side, with an  average  width of around  100m  to soften the transition between built
development and  the adjacent open  countryside and  to respect the setting of Tatton
Park, its Registered Historic Park and  Garden, and  the visitor approach  to Tatton; and
provide  for the long-term future management of the informal open space and landscaped
belts.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 306
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsJustification
15.432 North West Knutsford is largely made up of agricultural land, which directly adjoins residential
areas. Surrounding uses  are both residential and  commercial  and therefore this area  presents its self
as an ideal  opportunity for a  high  quality, residential-led sustainable development, which  will offer a
contribution to housing, employment and  community requirements for a  Key Service Centre.
15.433 The topography of this area  is relatively flat and  sits adjacent to Rostherne and  Tatton
landscape  designation. There are  a number  of designated heritage assets and  Historic Parklands,
which  are located within close  proximity of the strategic sites and  therefore new  development will
need to be sensitively designed so as to be sympathetic to both the historic built form and surrounding
landscape.
15.434 A landscape  and visual  assessment will  be fundamental in  justifying the siting and  massing
of development. The sites should also be masterplanned in  order that there is  a cohesive link between
these strategic sites and  safeguarded land.
15.435 Green infrastructure, along  with a  comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  will be essential to
these developments. Open space  provision  and additional woodland  planting particularly along  the
boundaries  of the sites will ensure the development is in keeping with the character of the surrounding
landscape  and will provide  a defensible boundary  to prevent encroachment into the Green Belt.
15.436 As with all new development, any ecological constraints should be considered and respected,
and where  necessary  the proposal  should  provide  appropriate mitigation.
15.437 Vehicular  and pedestrian permeability as  well as cycle  linkages  between the sites, town
centre and wider  community facilities should be enhanced or created in order to ensure the integration
of the development and  its sustainability into the existing community.
15.438 This particular area of Knutsford currently accommodates a number of sports and  community
facilities, which  provide  a valuable  contribution to the health and  well being  of the local  community.
Contributions to the enhancement of existing facilities either on  or off site will  be expected.
15.439 New development will  put increased pressure on existing community facilities and therefore,
on or off site contributions to local  community facilities should  also  be secured  in order  to ensure  the
sites are  sustainable.
15.440 The council  will require  improvement works  to existing highways  infrastructure associated
with the development of these sites to accommodate the capacity and  assist with the free flow of
traffic in  and out of Knutsford town centre.
15.441 The council  will require  development of an  appropriate scale  and design; and  will require
boundary  treatments including  retention of valued  trees and  hedgerows  where  possible, in  order  to
contain the development, provide  habitat for local  wildlife and  respect the setting of Tatton Park
Estate.
15.442 The protection enhancement and some new provision of PROW, sports and leisure facilities
will be required  in accordance  with Policy SC 2  'Indoor and  Outdoor Sports Facilities' in  line with an
appropriate action plan.
15.443 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on the sites as  part of sustainable development proposals  and their proximity to European
site (consisting of Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and  / or Ramsar  sites).
15.444 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value
of the sites due  to their proximity to a  European site (consisting of a  Special Area of Conservation,
Special Protection Areas and  / or Ramsar  site):
Impact on  natural hydrological  function, pathways, groundwater and  surface water
307 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsImpact on  recharge  to groundwater and  consequent impact on  sites
Impact on  water resources
Impact on  water chemistry
Impacts on  nutrient status
Risks from pollution during construction (e.g. spillages or minor pollution incidents and the storage
of oils  and fuels)
Risks  from misconnections, misuse  of garden  chemicals
Impacts from changes  to air  quality from construction and  ‘end  use’  traffic emissions  resulting
in potential for increased  nitrogen deposition
Impacts from dust generated during  the construction work
Impact of increased  foot traffic on  the sensitive fen meadow  vegetation
15.445 The sites have  potential for contamination to be  present therefore at least a  Phase 1
Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any
contamination that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.446 Site LPS 36(B) provides  an opportunity to create a  new  high  quality (Class  B1) business
park development in  this important gateway location to the town. To  reflect this, and  to ensure  that
its development respects the wider  open  countryside setting of the town in  this area, a  high  quality
of design  is critical, including  appropriate landscaping  to the boundaries  of the site. To  achieve  this
objective, the site will  also  be limited to Class  B1 uses.
15.447 Site LPS 36(C)  provides  an opportunity to create a  high  quality, distinctive and
comprehensively  planned  new  residential neighbourhood  with associated community facilities. The
eastern-most part of the site is  identified as  protected informal open  space. This enables  new  built
development to be  set back  from Mereheath Lane  and allows  for appropriate landscaping, in  the
interests of protecting the setting of, and  approach  to, Tatton Park. The informal open  space  and
landscaped  belts could  accommodate sustainable drainage  features and  they provide  an opportunity
to create new  ecological  habitats to provide  net gains  in biodiversity for the allocated site as  a whole.
The opportunity should  also  be taken to provide  managed, public  access  within the landscaped  belt
to the north of the site. This landscaped  belt can  be created in  the Green Belt along  the northern
boundary  of the site and  will serve  to strengthen the new  Green Belt boundary.

CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 308
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 37:  Parkgate Extension, Knutsford
15.448 Parkgate Extension is a site of approximately 17 hectares. The site forms a natural extension
to the existing residential and  employment uses  on the edge  of Knutsford, forming an  appropriate
location in  which  to meet the identified needs  of the town.
15.449 The surrounding  land  uses  include  ecologically  important Green Belt woodland  of Tatton
Park to the north and  west. To  the south is  Parkgate Trading  Estate bounded  by a railway  line on the
southern side. There is  a waste water treatment plant on  the eastern boundary  of the proposed
employment site with the Birkin Brook.
Site LPS 37
Parkgate Extension, Knutsford
The development of Parkgate Extension over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved
through:
1. Phased provision  of around  200 new  homes  (at approximately 25  dwellings  per hectare);
2. 6 hectares of employment land  with the provision  of suitable vehicular  access;
3. Incorporation of green  infrastructure;
4. Implementation of a  landscaping  scheme, including  SuDS and  boundary  treatments,
ecological  mitigation and  pond  treatment required  to detract large  water birds;
5. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, shops, schools  and health
facilities including  a permanent diversion  route of public  footpath (Knutsford FP11)  and at
least three 20  metre wide  links  between the housing  area  and the woodland  buffer;
6. An approximate 50  metre acoustic buffer/bund/fence for noise  mitigation between the
proposed  housing  and the industrial estate and  employment allocation;
7. Dwellings  within mapped  areas  of noise  mitigation will  require  mitigation to outdoor amenity
space; and
8. Appropriate contributions towards education facilities.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Undertake a  Landscape  Character Assessment to guide  the scale  and massing  of new
development and  to ensure  it is acceptable with the surrounding  landscape. Also ensure  a
high quality design, which  reflects and  respects the character of the area, built form and
surrounding landscape. Provision of a landscape buffer to enhance  and secure the boundary
of the Tatton Park Estate to the north and  west of the site and  between the employment
site to the south.
b. Provide a comprehensive landscaping scheme which retains and enhances  existing mature
trees and  hedging  where  possible, or  provide  appropriate mitigation.
c. Improve the connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the site to the town centre and
wider local area with the provision of, or contribution to, cycle paths and pedestrian linkages.
d. New development will  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on  site
and where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation and  enhancements.
e. Avoid  development on  the eastern boundary  of the site which  falls within Flood Zones 2
and 3.
f. Provision of a  satisfactory road  access  to the site.
g. Contributions towards highway infrastructure such as  the Brook Street/Hollow Lane, Adams
Hill/A50 junction improvements and  Mobberley  Road  and Parkgate Lane  junction.
h. Contributions to education and  health infrastructure.
i. Provision of green  infrastructure to include  open  space  and woodland  buffers.
j. Archaeological mitigation will  be required  in accordance  with the completed desk-based
assessment.
309 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsk. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
l. Housing  which  incorporates noise  mitigations measures  such  as acoustic glazing  and
mechanical  ventilation and  heat recovery  systems.
m. The site will be developed only where it can be demonstrated that there is  no adverse impact
on the Midland  Meres  and Mosses  Phase 1  Ramsar  and Tatton Mere  SSSI particularly in
relation to changes  in water levels  and quality and  recreational pressures. This should
include  a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the direct and  indirect impacts of the
development on  the features of special  interest. Where impacts cannot be  avoided,
appropriate mitigation measures will be required to ensure no adverse effects on the integrity
of sites.
n. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made; suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.

Justification
15.450 The land  at Parkgate forms a  logical  extension to an  existing residential and  employment
area located adjacent to the settlement boundary  north of Knutsford.
15.451 This whole  site is  outside the Green Belt having  been  allocated within the Macclesfield
Borough Local  Plan 2004  as employment land. In order  to facilitate the sustainable expansion  of the
trading estate and  contribute to economic  growth, a  mixed  employment and  housing  scheme  is
proposed. By virtue of its location and  non Green Belt designation, it is  considered  that this site
presents a  rare opportunity, within this part of the borough, for a  sustainable development within the
existing settlement boundary  of a Key Service Centre.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 310
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.452 This site is  well  contained by  existing landscape  features (woodland  to the north and  a
brook  to the south) and  borders  the Tatton Mere  SSSI and  the Rostherne, Tatton Park Landscape
Designation. A landscape  and visual  assessment will  therefore be  essential to ensuring  that new
development is  designed  sensitively having  regard  to the surrounding  landscape, character of the
area and existing built form.
15.453 Green infrastructure provision  will be essential to ensure  the new  development is  well
integrated. New  residential development should  be situated to the north of the site to protect the
amenities of residential properties with the existing and  proposed  employment uses. Comprehensive
woodland  buffers should  also be secured  to the boundary  of Tatton Park Estate to the north and  west
of the site and  to the south adjacent to the existing and  proposed  employment land.
15.454 Existing mature trees and  hedging  will be expected to be  maintained, where  possible, or
replaced  with mitigation. The floodplain of the Birkin Brook must be  safeguarded.
15.455 A cohesive approach must be taken when considering the layout of the site, good connectivity
between existing and  new  developments and  open  space  provision  will be essential in  ensuring  a
well designed  sustainable site. Noise  mitigation must be  incorporated between the industrial site and
the residential area  in the form of a  50 metre standoff or  acoustic bund  / fence.
15.456 New development will  also  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on
site and  where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation.
15.457 Improved access and infrastructure is considered to be key to ensuring the site's sustainability
and integration within the wider  community. New  access  to the site off Parkgate Lane  will be required
together with a  new access to Mobberley Road, over or under the railway line. Section 106 contributions
will be sought to improve additional pressure  to road networks within Knutsford and social  infrastructure
to secure  a sustainable form of development.
15.458 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals  and their proximity to European
site (consisting of either Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and  / or Ramsar
sites).
15.459 The council  expects that the following are  considered  in the context of the ecological  value

15.490 Middlewich  has been  identified as  one of the Key Service Centres for Cheshire  East, and
as such  the vitality and  growth of this town contributes to the prosperity of the borough  as a whole.
15.491 The timely delivery  of the Middlewich  Eastern Bypass is  key to ensuring  that Middlewich
realises  its full sustainable growth potential as  a Key Service Centre and  also  contributes to the
prosperity of the borough  as a whole. The completion of the bypass  should  be delivered  alongside
new developments.  Figure 15.49 identifies a  number  of Local  Plan Strategy Sites and  Strategic
Locations in  and around  Middlewich  for growth in  the future.

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 42:  Glebe Farm, Middlewich
15.493 Glebe Farm is  a large  greenfield site to the south of Middlewich  covering  approximately 17
hectares. Surrounding uses  include  residential, employment and  open  countryside.
Site LPS 42
Glebe Farm, Middlewich
The development at Glebe Farm over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  525 new  homes; and
2. Provision of pedestrian and  cycle  connections which  enhance  green  infrastructure.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Financial contributions to the delivery  of a Middlewich  Eastern Bypass.
b. Relevant contributions towards highways  and transport, education, health, open  space  and
community facilities.
c. The achievement of high  quality urban  and architectural design  and the delivery  of a high
quality public  realm.
d. The provision  of a network of open  spaces  for nature conservation and  recreation which
reinforce connections to adjacent green  infrastructure.
e. Contributions to education and  health infrastructure.
f. The site will  deliver  excellent connections to existing residential areas  and facilities within
Middlewich and within the site,  including pedestrian, cycle  and vehicular connection between
Booths Lane  and Warmingham  Lane.
g. A pre-determination desk  based  archaeological  assessment will  be required  for the site.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy Site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. The development proposals  must be  of a high  standard and  have  a positive impact on  the
various  listed buildings, their character and  appearance, including  the setting of the Trent
and Mersey  Canal  Conservation Area.
j. Retention (or  replacement) of the existing sport ground  should  be in accordance  with the
findings of an  adopted, up  to date and  robust needs  assessment.
 
Justification
15.494 Glebe Farm presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality, sustainable residential
development whilst supporting the delivery  of key  infrastructure through financial contributions to the
Middlewich  Eastern Link  Road. The existing permission  for 149  dwellings  adjacent to the site at
Warmingham  Lane  enhance  the ability of the site to achieve  this.
15.495 The site is  located toward the existing urban  edge  of Middlewich  with a  strong relationship
to the residential area  to the north and  contains a  pond, trees and  hedgerows  within the site.  To  the
east of the site on  the other side  of Booth Lane  lies the Trent and  Mersey  Canal  conservation area,
which  also  includes  the listed Rumps  locks.
15.496 Existing green  space  adjacent to the north of the site offers an  opportunity to fully integrate
and maximise  green  infrastructure within the new  residential area  whilst enhancing  the urban
environment of the existing residential development to the north. Given the site's location at the south
western edge  of the existing settlement, the provision  of new  infrastructure and  facilities will  ensure
future development is  sustainable whilst the provision  of strong pedestrian and  cycle  links  to existing
residential and  employment areas  will support facilities elsewhere  in the town.

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsStrategic Location LPS 43:  Brooks Lane, Middlewich
15.499 The Brooks Lane  Strategic Location is  an area  of around  23 hectares of land  that is  largely
used  for employment purposes  and includes  unused  and under  used  land. The site is  around  0.5km
to the south of Middlewich  town centre and  as such  is considered  a sustainable location with
regeneration potential for an  enhanced  use that will  benefit the town.
15.500 The site is  well related to the existing urban  area  of Middlewich  with excellent access  to
services  and facilities in  the town centre and  includes  the Trent and  Mersey  canal  and associated
conservation area  within its boundary. The site's central position would  make  it an  ideal  location for
a new  station in  the town and  it is important that this possibility is  given  serious  consideration as  part
of any  future masterplanning for the redevelopment of the site.
Strategic Location LPS 43
Brooks Lane, Middlewich
The development at Brooks Lane  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through
a masterplan led  approach  that will  determine the precise  nature and  quantum of development
that is  appropriate for the strategic location. The strategic location is  likely  to include:
1. The delivery  of around  200 homes;
2. The delivery  of leisure  and community facilities to the north of the site;
3. The provision  of appropriate retail facilities to meet local  needs;
4. The incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. Green corridor; and
ii. Open space  including  an equipped  children's play  space.
5. The improvement of existing and  provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to connect
development to existing employment, residential areas, shops, schools, health facilities,
recreation and  leisure  opportunities and  the town centre; and
6. The potential provision  of a Marina  at the Trent and  Mersey  Canal.
7. The provision  of land  for a  new  railway  station including  lineside  infrastructure, access  and
forecourt parking.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The masterplan will  need  to consider  the constraints, such  as the scheduled  monument,
listed buildings  and the Trent and  Mersey  Canal  Conservation Area and  their respective
settings, as  well as the opportunities that the site provides  including  a new  railway  station
and marina.
b. Development should  incorporate pedestrian and  cycle  links  set within green  infrastructure,
which  connects and  enhances  links  to existing employment, residential areas, shops,
schools, health facilities, recreation and  leisure  opportunities and  the town centre.
c. The site will deliver enhancements to the Trent and Mersey canal corridor. The development
proposals  adjoining  the Trent and  Mersey  Canal  Conservation Area and  associated listed
buildings  must reflect the location and  be of a high  standard.
d. On site provision  of a network of open  spaces  for nature conservation and  recreation.
e. Contributions towards public transport and highways improvements, including improvements
to the A54 through Middlewich.
f. Contributions towards education and  health infrastructure.
g. Consideration of the impact on  Cledford Lane  Lime  Beds Grade B Site of Biological
Importance that is  located to the south of the site.
h. The site includes  part of an  area  of archaeological  potential and  a scheduled  monument.
To determine the contribution which  this area  makes  to the significance of the scheduled
monument and  other heritage assets future development proposals  will be accompanied
323 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsby a pre-determination desk  based  archaeological  assessment and  Heritage Impact
Assessment.
i. The strategic location will  provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy  requirements
set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
j. Development should  contribute to the long  term conservation and  enhancement of the
scheduled  monument including  opportunities for interpretation’.
k. Future policy  development and  the masterplanning of the site shall  be informed by  the
suggested mitigation set out in  the HIA prepared  by the council’s  Heritage and  Design  Team
dated 19  September 2014.
Figure 15.51 Brooks Lane Strategic Location
Justification
15.501 The site is  bounded  by the Trent and  Mersey  Canal  to the west, a  residential area  to the
north, the Sandbach to Northwich railway line to the east and British Salt settling lagoons to the south. 
There is  potential to expand  the site into the salt lagoons  in the future.
15.502 The development of this site will  be expected to enhance  the conservation area  and its
setting, regenerate the part of the site close  to the canal  and bring  significant benefits to the visitor
economy. Delivery  of a mixed  residential-led development in  this location will  ensure  the provision
of new  and enhanced  green  infrastructure, open  spaces  and pedestrian and  cycle  links  through the
site, opening  access  to important heritage assets within the site for existing residents of the town and
new residents of the site.
15.503 The provision  of land  for a  station and  other on  site infrastructure with good  links  to existing
services  and facilities in  the town will  ensure  that the site is  sustainable in  the long  term as  well as
help support the future vitality of such  services  within Middlewich. This should  include  the on-site
identification of a  new  railway  station for the town. If an  alternative location for the railway  station
beyond  the site is  subsequently preferred, following detailed masterplanning work, then the
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 324
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsdevelopment should  contribute to its provision. The British Salt Lagoons  located to directly to the
south of the site offer an  opportunity to explore  the potential of enlarging  the site in  future and  making
best use  of brownfield land  here. The design  of the development should  respect and  capitalise on  its
canal-side  setting.
15.504 The site relates well  to the achievement of the Local  Plan Strategy Vision  and Objectives
by enhancing  environmental quality, promoting conditions for business  growth through regeneration
and creating sustainable communities, whilst delivering  significant regeneration benefits.
15.505 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.

15.506 This site is  located to the east of Middlewich  and two miles  west of junction 18  of the M6,
at the edge  of Middlewich.
Site LPS 44
Midpoint 18, Middlewich
The development at Midpoint 18  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through a
masterplan led  approach  with:
1. Phased delivery  of up  to 70  hectares of employment land, including  the development of the
existing undeveloped sites: Midpoint 18 (Phases 1 to 3), with provision expected to continue
for the remaining  site beyond  the plan  period; and
2. Provision of and  where  appropriate, contributions to the completion of the Middlewich
Eastern Bypass.
3. Provision of land  set aside  to enable  the future construction of a  new  station –  in terms of
lineside  infrastructure, parking  and access.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Maximising  connectivity to new  and existing areas  of Middlewich.
b. Contributions towards public  transport and  highways  improvements.
c. Contributions to education and  heath infrastructure.
d. Provision of floorspace to accommodate B1, B2 and  B8 uses.
e. Future development should  safeguard the River  Croco  and other watercourses and  deliver
significant ecological  mitigation areas  for protected and  priority species  and habitats on
site.
f. A pre-determination desk  based  archaeological  assessment will  be required, with targeted
evaluation as  appropriate.
 
Justification
15.507 The future prosperity of Middlewich  largely  relies  on its proximity to the M6  corridor  and the
ability to maximise  the opportunities for new  and more  skilled  jobs  across  a range  of employment
types. Strong access  to the motorway network gives  this site the potential to serve  Cheshire,
Merseyside, Greater Manchester and  the Potteries within a  one hour  drive  time.
15.508 Midpoint 18  is a large  strategic employment site with a  total area  of some  221.7 hectares.
It comprises  an area  of existing employment development of 100.7 hectares and  an undeveloped
area of 121  hectares. It is  expected that up  to 70  hectares of the undeveloped  area  will come  forward
within the plan  period  with the remainder  in reserve  to be  released  for employment purposes  when
required.  A masterplan led  approach  will be required  for the development of this site. Provision of
well planned cycle, pedestrian and road  links within and through the site will  enhance the sustainability
of the site and  its connections to the main  urban  area  and population within Middlewich. Provision of
new public  transport services  to this location will  further enhance  the sustainability of the site.
15.509 The site delivers  a significant contribution to the Local  Plan Strategy Objectives and  Vision
by promoting economic prosperity, contributing toward the creation of sustainable communities through
the provision  of a better employment / housing  balance. The provision  of land  for a  station and  other
on site infrastructure with good  links  to existing services  and facilities in  the town will  ensure  that the
site is  sustainable in  the long  term as  well as help  support the future vitality of such  services  within
Middlewich. This should  include  the on-site identification of a  new  railway  station for the town. If an
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 326
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsalternative location for the railway station beyond the site is subsequently preferred, following detailed
masterplanning work, then the development should  contribute to its provision.

and where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation measures;
g. Provide contributions to education and  health infrastructure;
h. A pre-determined desk  based  archaeological  assessment will  be required  for the site at
planning  application stage;
i. Future Masterplanning should  consider  the use  of SuDS to manage  surface water run  off
from the site; and
j. Improve the connectivity of the site to the wider  surrounding  existing residential areas.
 
Justification
15.512 The site is  adjacent to the Glebe Farm LPS 42  site and  forms a  natural extension to the
residential area  to the west of Warmingham  Land  and  the south of Middlewich, where  two new
residential developments extending the established residential form are  currently under  construction.
15.513 Development should  pay particular attention to the boundary treatments and design adjoining
the River  Wheelock valley  to the west of the site.

4. The delivery  of a new  highway  link to Waterlode and  the re-alignment of the A51 through
the site;
5. The delivery  of up  to 2 hectares of B1 uses  (business);
6. Incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. An extension of the riverside  park  between Reaseheath College  and the town centre,
including  both the floodplain and  the valley  shoulder, with substantial native woodland
tree planting on  the higher  land, above  the floodplain; the area  adjacent to the river
should  be treated as  a wetland landscape  buffer zone, with public  access, including
formal footpaths and  cycle  ways;
ii. Allotments;
iii. Open space  provision, including  sports pitches; multi-use games  area; children's
equipped  play  space; outdoor gym  and facilities for teenagers;
iv. Land  to remain  undeveloped  to the west of the River  Weaver, as  shown  on Figures
15.54 and  15.55, to include  public  access  to the immediate riverside.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Incorporation of existing mature trees and  hedgerows  in potential development.
b. Improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and
existing residential areas, employment areas, shops, education and  health facilities. This
may involve  the need  to provide  new  crossing  points over  the River  Weaver. Cycle  routes
should  ensure  that the site and  Reaseheath College  are connected to the Connect 2
Greenway route (this may  be partly achieved  by contributions).
331 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsc. The provision  of contributions towards the highway  improvements, including  at Burford
Cross  Roads, the realignment of the A51 and  link between A51 and  Waterlode and
contribution to improvements to Alvaston Roundabout.
d. The provision  of contributions towards public  transport improvements.
e. The provision  of contributions to health infrastructure.
f. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment, with further work  and mitigation being  carried
out as  required  as the overall  archaeological  potential of the site is  considered  to be  high.
g. Every opportunity should  be made  to increase  the understanding and  appreciation of the
significance of the scheduled  battlefield and  its setting (90) and the site's archaeological
potential.  This should  be reflected in  the masterplanning and  design  of the site, including
in terms of roads, views, landscaping  and open  spaces. The design  must also  seek  to
minimise  and mitigate any  adverse  impact on  the Reaseheath Conservation Area.
h. The creation of green  spaces  linking  green  infrastructure and  safe and  secure  pedestrian
and cycle  routes should  be integrated into any  development proposals.
i. Retention of the floodplain of the River  Weaver; a  large  area  of the site lies  within the
floodplain of the River  Weaver  which  needs  to be  protected from development.
j. The extension of the Nantwich Riverside  Park and  the creation of a  Riverside  Walk, from
the southern edge  of the site, to Beam Bridge, to link  with the countryside beyond.
k. The preservation of views  towards local  landmarks  e.g. St Mary's Church  Tower  and Acton
Church  Tower.
l. The development should  provide  compensatory habitat for great crested newts and  other
protected and  priority species  and habitats on  the site.
m. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
n. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated.  Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
o. A site specific Flood Risk  Assessment  would  be required  to demonstrate that the proposed
development would  be safe from fluvial flooding and  would  not increase  the risk  of flooding
elsewhere.
p. Ensure that the masterplanning and  design  of the site incorporates the retention and
integration of the most important buildings  within the non-designated heritage asset of
Henhull  Hall Farm.
90 The setting of the scheduled  battlefield being  the surroundings  within which  the asset is  experienced. This isn’t
constrained to the visual  relationship with the asset but could  also  be how  a piece  of land  or area  contributes toward
historical understanding of the events that influenced the battle and  its location.

this will  be integrated with development proposals  throughout the site.
15.520 The site will  provide  an extension to the Nantwich Riverside  Park which  is an important
recreational asset to the town. The site includes an area of floodplain which will be incorporated within
the Nantwich Riverside  Park. The Cheshire  East Greenspace Strategy includes  further reference to
the Nantwich Riverside  Park.
15.521 The Connect 2  Greenway route will  also  be linked  to this site, providing  a sustainable link
to other parts of Nantwich and  to Crewe.
15.522 Immediately to the west of the site lies  the site of the Nantwich Civil  War battlefield, included
on English Heritage's Register of Battlefields. The northern part of the allocated site includes  part of
Reaseheath Conservation Area. These heritage assets will  be protected and  enhanced  through an
appropriate landscaping, design  and  heritage assessment.  The part of the allocated site within
Reaseheath Conservation Area is not significantly affected by the current application.  Any development
proposals  within the conservation area  must be  of a very  high  standard, reflecting their location.
15.523 The site has high archaeological potential which will be explored further, through assessment
and mitigation work, as  required.
15.524 The site will  enhance  accessibility to key  facilities; the town centre and  the Connect 2
Greenway for pedestrians and  cyclists.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.525 The delivery  of a new  highway  link to Waterlode and  the re-alignment of the A51 will  seek
to improve  the surrounding  highway  network and  lessen  the amount of traffic within the Reaseheath
Conservation Area.
15.526 This site has planning approval for 1,100 dwellings, up to 1.82 hectares of class B1 business
use, potential primary  school, community facilities, local  centre, allotments and  open  space  (ref
13/2471N), 20/01/16.
15.527 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.528 The site has  potential for contamination to be  present and  therefore at least a  Phase 1
Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any
contamination that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.529 Compensatory habitat for any  protected and  priority species  and habitats on  the site should
be included  within any  development proposals  for the site.
15.530 Flood Maps  show  Flood Zones 2  and 3 affecting the eastern boundary  of this site. It is
important that a  Flood Risk  Assessment is  carried  out.
15.531 To reflect the conclusions of the Heritage Impact Assessment of this site, the masterplanning
and design of the site needs to incorporate the retention and integration of the most important buildings
within the non-designated heritage asset of Henhull  Hall Farm.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that the employment development will  be delivered  in the middle  part of the plan
period  (2020-2025).

 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 47:  Snow Hill, Nantwich
15.532 Snow Hill  comprising  of municipal  car parks, town centre retail, public  leisure  facilities and
open  space  presents the opportunity for a  high  quality development in  a sustainable location. The
site is  suitable for a  range  of uses  including  retail and  leisure  development. Snow Hill  will create a
mixed  use quarter which  complements the vibrancy  and character of Nantwich town centre by  linking
the River  Weaver  into the heart of the historic market town. Snow Hill  will be a distinctive and
sustainable place  that contributes to the rich  tapestry of buildings, streets and  spaces  in Nantwich
and provides  an attractive destination to raise  the profile of the historic town of Nantwich within the
region.
15.533 Snow Hill  occupies  8.5 hectares, located to the western edge  of Nantwich town centre and
acts as  a key gateway into the town. The site is  adjacent to town centre facilities and  has good
pedestrian linkages.
15.534 A main  arterial route for the town (Waterlode B5341) cuts north-south through the site with
the River  Weaver  bisecting the site in  the same  direction also  linking  into the Nantwich Riverside
Loop  and the Weaver  Valley.
Site LPS 47
Snow Hill, Nantwich
The development of Snow Hill  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved  through:
1. The comprehensive mixed use regeneration of this important site to strengthen and enhance
the existing town centre and  take advantage of its location next to the River  Weaver. The
site is  suitable for a  number  of uses  including:
i. Retail, including  opportunities for small, independent retailers;
ii. Leisure  and sports facilities;
iii. Offices;
iv. Hotel including  a conference venue;
v. Parking;
vi. Housing; and
vii. Bars and  cafés.
2. The provision  of high  quality design  is of paramount importance, as  this site includes
numerous listed buildings, a listed structure and lies partly within the Nantwich Conservation
Area. Development should  have  regard  to the need  to conserve  and enhance  and have  a
positive impact upon  the character and  appearance  of the listed buildings  and conservation
area, including  their settings. Development should  also have  regard  to the proposals  of the
Nantwich Conservation Area Appraisal and  Management Strategy (17/12/12), including  the
impact of proposals  on Local  List candidates that lie  within or  adjacent to this site.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. A design  framework including  a masterplan which  ensures  that the site is  seen  as being
part of the town centre, by  the creation of strong links  between Snow Hill  and the existing
town centre; the establishment of active new  frontages; high  quality urban  design; clear
and easy  to use  pedestrian and  cycle  routes, both throughout the site and  between the site
and the town centre and  to facilitate a  radical  improvement to the environmental quality of
Swinemarket.
b. Retail provision  to include  small  units, to ensure  opportunities are  given  to independent
retailers as  well as adding  to and  complementing the existing retailing and  leisure  offer of
the town.
335 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsc. Improvements to existing and  the provision  of new  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to the town
centre and  new  and existing residential areas, employment areas, shops, education and
health facilities.
d. Maintain, as  far as  possible, car  parking  levels  in the town centre.
e. Sensitively expand  the area  to the west of the river  to support the mix  of uses  along  Welsh
Row.
f. Incorporation and  retention of the swimming  baths within the overall  design  for the site.
g. Incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. An extension of the riverside  park  between Reaseheath College  and the town centre
(on both sides  of the river), including  both the floodplain and  the valley  shoulder, with
substantial native woodland  tree planting and  a wetland landscape  buffer zone, with
public  access, including  formal footpaths and  cycleways  to improve  levels  of access
to the River  Weaver  and its banks;
ii. Open space  provision.
h. Create a  series  of interconnected, attractive streets and  spaces.
i. The design of new buildings to be of a very  high standard, reflecting the site's location within
and adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation Area.
j. This area  is within an  area  of archaeological  potential and  an area  of special  archaeological
potential which  included  nationally-important waterlogged archaeological  deposits. A desk
based  archaeological  assessment and  a pre-determination evaluation will  be required, with
further work  and mitigation being  carried  out as  appropriate to preserve  the archaeological
value  of Snow Hill.
k. On site provision, or  where  appropriate, relevant contributions towards highways  and
transport, education, health, green  infrastructure, open  space  and community facilities.
l. Improvement to Waterlode / Welsh  Row  junction.
m. Deliver  a distinctive destination for local  people  to be  proud  of and  visitors to enjoy.
n. Proposals should  consider  impacts of development on  the listed 'Nantwich Bridge' and  its
setting.
o. Proposals should  include  an assessment of the contribution the area  makes  to the
conservation area, including  views  of the conservation area.
p. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated.  Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the part of the site concerned.
q. New development will be expected to respect any flooding constraints on  the site and where
necessary  provide  appropriate mitigation.
r. Retention of the floodplain of the River  Weaver; a  large  area  of the site lies  within the
floodplain of the River  Weaver  which  needs  to be  protected from development.
s. Development proposals will be required  to demonstrate that they will conserve  and enhance
the character and appearance of the listed buildings, listed structure and conservation area,
including their settings and also show how regard has been paid to the impact of development
proposals  on the heritage of the town.
t. Development on  the site should  provide  compensatory habitat for any  protected and  priority
species  and habitats on  the site.

Justification
15.535 The River  Weaver  is a key site in  Cheshire  for both water vole  and otter. It is  important
therefore that the river  corridor  is enhanced  and safeguarded as  part of any  development.
15.536 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents and
those working  within the town, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the town. Nantwich Riverside
runs through the site and  is a key green  / blue  infrastructure asset to the town. An extension to the
Nantwich Riverside  Walk, on  both sides  of the River  Weaver, will  be provided  as part of this
development.
15.537 The site includes  an area  of archaeological  potential; an  area  of special  archaeological
potential which  includes  nationally important waterlogged archaeological  deposits, listed buildings
and lies within and  adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation Area. The best practice contained in  the
‘Nantwich Waterlogged Deposits Report No  3 Management Strategy: Supplementary Planning
Document for the Historic Environment and  Archaeological Deposits: Area of Special Archaeological
Potential (Revised  June  2016)’  will need  to be  applied  with regard  to development proposals  on the
site. These heritage assets will  be protected and  enhanced  through appropriate design, heritage
assessment and  landscaping. The southern extent of the site lies  within the Nantwich Conservation
Area, an area of archaeological potential as well as  having several listed buildings (including Nantwich
Bridge that crosses  over  the river)  within and  around  the periphery  of the site. Development within
the site will  need  to have  regard  to the proposals  of the Nantwich Conservation Area Appraisal and
Management Strategy (17/12/12). This may  include  the opportunity to enhance  the open  grassed
areas  and car parks  alongside  the River  Weaver, within and  adjacent to the Nantwich Conservation
Area. A number  of local  list candidates (Manor  House, No. 7, 7a  and 7b Beam Street, The Old Biot
(brine  spring  site), Snow Hill  The Watermill site, Waterlode) are  located within or  adjacent to the site
and are important features of the character and  appearance  of the conservation area; the impact of
development proposals  on these local  list candidates must therefore be  taken into consideration with
regard  to development proposals  for the site.
337 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.538 The Nantwich swimming  baths is  an important asset to the town and  includes  an outdoor
brine  swimming  pool. It is  important therefore that this is  retained and  incorporated within the
development scheme  for the site.
15.539 Part of the site is  located within an  area  of flood risk  / flood plain  of the River  Weaver  and
as such  will need  to be  protected from development and  included  as part of the extended Riverside
Park.
15.540 Part of this site is  in an area  of former gasworks  and therefore has  potential contamination
issues  which  should  be considered  in any future application. The remaining  area  of the site is  also
potentially contaminated and  should therefore also be subject to appropriate studies and remediation.
15.541 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.542 Protected and  priority species  and their habitats are  present on  the site. It is  therefore
important that development on  the site provides  appropriate mitigation.
Indicative Site Delivery
The St Annes Lane  area  of the site is  expected to be  delivered  during  the early  part of the plan
period  (2016-2020), with the remaining  area  of the site being  delivered  during  the middle  and
latter parts of the plan  period  (2020-2030)

Site LPS 48
Land adjacent to Hazelbadge Road, Poynton
The development of Land  adjacent to Hazelbadge  Road  over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will
be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  150 new  homes;
2. Incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. an appropriate level  of amenity open  space  and children's play  space;
ii. the creation of links  with footpaths to the north and  east; and
iii. pedestrian and  cycle  links  to new  and existing residential areas, employment areas,
shops, schools  and health facilities, including  improved  pedestrian links  to the town
centre, and  the railway  station.
3. Open space  provision  to accommodate the need  for enhanced  or new  indoor  and outdoor
sports facilities to accommodate the additional demand  from the housing. Provision should
be in accordance  with an  adopted up  to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor
Sports Strategy.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Contributions to existing, and  the provision  of new, public  transport links  to the town centre
or contributions towards or  the provision  of land  for additional car  parking  for Poynton
Railway  Station.
b. Improvements to Hazelbadge  Road  and its junction with Chester Road, including  provision
of improved turning/parking facilities linked to Lower Park School and  access improvements
to Lower  Park School.
c. Contributions to health infrastructure and  education provision.
d. The provision  of affordable housing  in line with the policy  requirements set out in  Policy SC
5 'Affordable Homes'.
e. Appropriate boundary treatments should be implemented to provide a  clearly defined Green
Belt boundary  that is  likely  to endure.
f. The inclusion  of appropriate noise  mitigation along  the south western boundary  of the site
to make  sure  that noise  and disturbance from the West Coast Mainline, which  runs  along
the south western boundary  of the site, is  reduced  to a level  to be  agreed  at a future date.
g. Any application would  need  to be  supported by  a full ecological  appraisal. Mitigation would
be required  to address  any impacts on  protected species.
h. Any woodland, priority habitats or  habitats of Local  Wildlife Site quality on  the site should
be retained and  buffered by  areas  of open  space/habitat creation.
i. The protected trees shall  be retained and  incorporated into any  development.
j. A site specific Flood Risk  Assessment should  be prepared. New  development will  be
expected to respect any  flooding constraints on  the site and, where  necessary, provide
appropriate mitigation.

Justification
15.548 The site is  located on  the edge  of Poynton, to the north west of the town. The site has  been
identified to deliver  some  150  dwellings  and  presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality,
sustainable residential development. The eastern boundary  of the site is  formed by  Poynton Brook,
with part of the western boundary  formed by  the railway  line.
15.549 The site is  greenfield and  covers  an area  of about 6  hectares. There is  good  access  to the
site by  road  from the town and  it is close  to Poynton Railway  Station.
15.550 Boundary treatments should  be reinforced so  as to ensure  a strong long  term perimeter to
the Green Belt.
341 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.551 Hazelbadge  Road  is a non through road  that currently serves  Lower  Park Primary School
and adjoining  residential properties. Development provides  the opportunity to improve  the access
and turning arrangements locally.
15.552 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links  between the site and the surrounding residential
areas  and countryside are  provided  to improve  connectivity within and  around  the town.
15.553 Impacts on education and health infrastructure will require appropriate mitigation.  Provision
of access  improvements for Lower  Park School can  be considered  as part of the overall  mitigation
measures.
15.554 The development of this site would assist in  the delivery of additional car parking for Poynton
Railway  Station.
15.555 The provision  of green  infrastructure and  the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  well-being  of residents and
employees, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the local  area.
15.556 It is important that appropriate noise  mitigation, along  the south western boundary  of the
site, with the West Coast Mainline  is provided  in such  a way that noise  and disturbance are  mitigated
to an  acceptable level.
15.557 The council  would  require  the retention of the site’s  valued  trees.
15.558 Full consideration of mitigation and  management should  be given  to the impact on  the
footpaths that cross  the site.
15.559 Habitats for protected species  and appropriate mitigation, if required, will  be provided  within
the site; the development will have to be appropriately sited to make sure that there is not any adverse
impact on  such  habitat areas.
15.560 Part of the site is  affected by  flood risk  (Poynton Brook), and  a sequential test has  been
applied in line with national planning policy. Policy PG 6 'Spatial Distribution of Development' identifies
that an  additional 650  dwellings  should  be provided  at Poynton. In the absence  of alternative,
reasonably  available  sites within or  immediately adjacent to Poynton for housing  development with
a lower  probability of flooding, the allocation of Land  Adjacent to Hazelbadge  Road  satisfies the
Sequential Test. Through a  site specific Flood Risk  Assessment, carried  out to inform any  planning
application proposal, it should  be demonstrated that the proposed  development would  be safe from
fluvial flooding, and  would  not increase  the risk  of flooding elsewhere. As with any  development
adjacent to a  main  river  an undeveloped  buffer zone  should  be provided. The buffer zone  needs  to
be 8 metres wide measured from bank top for the whole extent of the watercourse. Bank top is defined
as the point at which  the bank  meets normal  land  levels.
15.561 An archaeological  assessment will  be required, to ensure  that there will  not be  an impact
on heritage assets.
15.562 Any new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up  to date and  robust
Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor and  Outdoor Sports
Facilities’.
15.563 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.564 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals.

15.567 The site is  located on  the edge  of Poynton, to the south east of the town. The site has  been
identified to deliver  around  150  dwellings  and  presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality,
sustainable residential development. The southern boundary  of the site is  formed by  Poynton Brook,
which  provides  opportunities for links  to existing footpaths.
15.568 The majority of the site is  greenfield with some  buildings  present and  covers  an area  of
about 5  hectares. There is  good  access  to the site by  road  from the town and  by public  transport
services  along  Dickens  Lane.
15.569 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links  between the site and the surrounding residential
and employment areas  are provided  to improve  connectivity within and  around  the town.
15.570 The provision  of green  infrastructure and  the improvement of existing green  infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  well-being  of residents and
employees, as  well as enhancing  the environment of the local  area.
15.571 The council  would  require  the retention of the site’s  valued  trees along  the brook  to the
south and  west boundary.
15.572 Full consideration of mitigation and  management should  be given  to the impact on  the
footpath that crosses  the site.
15.573 It is important that buffering planting along  the southern boundary  of the site is  provided  to
protect the stream and  woodland.
15.574 Habitats for protected species  and appropriate mitigation, if required, will  be provided  within
the site; the development will have to be appropriately sited to make sure that there is not any adverse
impact on  such  habitat areas.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.575 Part of the site is  located in  an area  of flood risk  of Poynton Brook, and  as such  it should
be demonstrated that the proposed  development would  be safe from fluvial flooding, and  would  not
increase  the risk  of flooding elsewhere. As with any  development adjacent to a  main  river  an
undeveloped  buffer zone  should  be provided. The buffer zone  needs  to be  8 metres wide  measured
from bank  top for the whole  extent of the watercourse. Bank top is  defined as  the point at which  the
bank  meets normal  land  levels.
15.576 Any new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up  to date and  robust

Justification
15.593 This plan  provides  for 380  hectares of employment during  the plan  period  up to 2030. This
site will  make  a positive contribution to help  meet this overall  employment land  requirement and
provide  opportunities for employment growth in  the town. The site will  also  help  to address  the ratio
of workplace-based  employment to residence-based  employment for Poynton identified in  the Spatial
Distribution Update Report(91).
15.594 The site is  located on  the edge  of the built form of Poynton to the south west of the
settlement.  The site has  been  identified to deliver  around  10ha  of employment land  and presents an
opportunity to deliver  a high  quality, sustainable employment development, whilst supporting the
delivery of key  infrastructure through financial contributions towards the delivery of the Poynton Relief
Road. The site is  adjacent to Adlington Business Park; an  existing employment site.
15.595 The preferred route of the Poynton Relief Road  will form the western boundary  of the site. 
If the planned  Poynton Relief Road  is not built, or  the current identified route is  altered significantly,
then a  further Green Belt assessment of this site would  be required.
15.596 The new  Green Belt boundary  should  be defined using  physical  features that are  readily
recognisable  and are likely  to be  permanent, for example  (but not restricted to) continuous physical
features such  as significant hedges, stone walls, and  line of trees.
15.597 A full planning  application (15/4865M) has  been  submitted on  the eastern parcel  of the site
for the erection of a  logistics warehouse  (6,728sqm) and  ancillary  trade sales. A decision  is awaited.
15.598 It is important that the proximity of the residential dwellings  is taken into consideration in
any development proposals, with the provision  of appropriate mitigation where  necessary.

351 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.599 The incorporation of green infrastructure, notably trees, hedgerows, and greenways, together
with sensitive design  in terms of the scale  and massing  of any  new  structures, has  the potential to
mitigate any  adverse  impacts on  visual  amenity from main  public  vantage points. This will  also assist
in enhancing  the environment of the local  area, and  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of employees.
15.600 It is important that cycle and pedestrian links  between the site and the surrounding residential
areas  are provided  to improve  connectivity within and  around  the town. The council  would  seek
opportunities to provide  for future pedestrian and  cycle  links  up to the adjacent safeguarded land
(LPS 52) and to enable a comprehensive route to be eventually established for cyclists and pedestrians
linking  the allocated site to the railway  station.
15.601 The provision  of a pedestrian crossing  across  the A523 London  Road, linking  to footpath
Adlington FP53, along  with the improvement of this footpath, would  provide  enhanced  pedestrian
access  to the site. Improving pedestrian access  to the railway  station can  also  be achieved  through
the reinstatement of footpaths, linking  to existing footpaths, through the former Woodford Aerodrome
site.
15.602 The council  would  require  the retention of existing trees and  hedges  on the site.
15.603 Full consideration should  be given  to the impact of development on  the footpath crossing
the site, with appropriate mitigation and  management measures  introduced as  required.
15.604 Habitat for protected species  and appropriate mitigation, if required, will  be provided  within
the site; the development will have to be appropriately sited to make sure that there is not any adverse
impact on  such  habitat areas.
15.605 The eastern parcel  of the site lies  to the north of a  group  of cottages and  listed buildings  in
an historic area know as Hopegreen. An archaeological assessment and a Heritage Impact Assessment
will be required  to make  sure  that there will  not be  an impact on  heritage assets.
15.606 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’. This is  likely  to be  addressed  as part of the Poynton Relief Road
construction.
15.607 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.608 Details of Construction Environment Management Plans, landscaping, green  infrastructure
and open  space  proposals  should  be submitted to the council  during  any future planning  application
process  on this site as  part of sustainable development proposals.
15.609 The Poynton Relief Road is a proposed  1.9 mile highway running between the A6 Manchester
Airport Relief Road  (A6MARR) and  A523 London  Road, which  will relieve  congestion in  and around

15.618 The main  intention behind  allocating this site is  to provide  employment land  within the town
and to create a  more  sustainable community by  better balancing  the proportion of housing  and jobs
in the town. This is considered necessary as  Sandbach has seen a significant reduction in  employment

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsland but relatively high  levels  of housing  development in  recent years.  This allocation presents the
opportunity to deliver  a mixed  used  development site with the primary  use of the site being  for
employment purposes, whilst acknowledging  that supporting residential development will  be needed
to help  enable  the access  and infrastructure improvements required  to deliver  the whole  site. It is
intended that the development of the site will  include  the provision  of supporting facilities,
complimentary to the principal employment use whilst also protecting important existing environmental
features.
15.619  The site is  greenfield and  is currently in  agricultural use  with a  watercourse bisecting the
site north to south. Surrounding uses  include  agricultural land, residential development and  the M6
motorway.
Site LPS 53
Land adjacent to J17  of M6, south east  of Congleton Road, Sandbach
The development of land  adjacent to Junction 17  of the M6, south east of Congleton Road  over
the Local Plan Strategy period will be achieved  through a mixed use employment led development
consisting of:
1. The delivery  of 20  hectares of employment land  (Class  B1 & B2) as  set out in  Figure 15.64;
2. The delivery  of up  to 450  new  homes  to support the delivery  of the 20  hectares of
employment land, as  set out in  Figure 15.64;
3. The provision  of appropriate retail for local  needs;
4. The provision  of appropriate leisure  uses, potentially including  a hotel, public  house  or
restaurant;
5. The incorporation of green  infrastructure, including:
i. The retention, where  possible, of important hedgerows that have a cumulative screening
impact on  development and  contribute to the habitat value  of the site;
ii. The protection and  enhancement of the wildlife corridor  and Local  Wildlife sites; and
iii. Open space  including  a multi use  games  area  and an equipped  children's play  space.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The site will  avoid  development within the functional floodplain, wildlife corridor  and Site of
Biological Importance / Local  Wildlife Site and  these features will  be retained within
appropriate undeveloped  buffer zones  and a management plan  will be required  for them.
b. Appropriate contributions will  be made  to improvements to junction 17  of the M6  motorway
and the junctions on  the A534 Old Mill  Road  corridor.
c. Provision for improved  access  off Old Mill  Road  and a new  bridge  across  the Brook to
access  the employment land  beyond.
d. Contributions to education and  health infrastructure
e. Development should  consider  the 'Cheshire East Green Space Strategy 2011' and  include
the creation of improved  access  to green  corridors  whilst protecting and  enhancing  the Site
of Biological Importance, watercourse and  wildlife corridor  already  on site.
f. Provision for future widening of the A534 Old Mill Road  Corridor adjacent to the development
site.
g. A desk  based  archaeological  assessment will  be required  for this site.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. Provision of a  landscaped  buffer between the employment land  and housing  areas.

kmFigure 15.64 Land adjacent to Junction 17  of M6, south east  of Congleton Road Site
Justification
15.620 The strategic site is  well connected to the existing settlement of Sandbach and  contained
by existing residential development to the north, west and  south. To  the east, the site boundary  is
formed by  the M6  motorway. Capricorn  lies at the gateway to Sandbach offering an  excellent
opportunity to capitalise on  strong links  to the M6, attract investment and  skills  to locate in  the town
and deliver  a high  quality sustainable urban  extension.
15.621 The intention of this allocation is  to ensure  that the primary  use of the site is  for employment
purposes with around 20 hectares being required for this purpose. Sandbach is experiencing substantial
housing  growth and  this employment opportunity is  key to ensuring  that a  balance  of housing  and
employment development can  come  forward over  the plan  period. The employment component of
the allocation is  therefore seen  as central to the achievement of sustainable development for the
town. The site is allocated for class B1 business  and B2 industrial, taking account of the characteristics
of the site and  the need  for greater employment in  Sandbach. However  residential development up
to 450  dwellings  may  be required  as a sub-ordinate use  to cover  the infrastructure costs needed  to
enable  delivery  of the whole  site. This will  improve  accessibility and  provide  contributions to
improvements to the surrounding  highway  network including  future improvements to junction 17  of
the M6  motorway and  the junctions on  the A534 Old Mill  Road  corridor.
15.622 A key  infrastructure consideration is  the provision  of a new  access  road  and bridge  across
the wildlife corridor. This will  provide  a link between the principal  site access  by junction 17  and the
main  area  of employment land  in the centre of the site. The employment area  should  be separated
from adjoining  areas  of housing  by a landscaped  tree buffer. Development of areas  adjoining  the
Wildlife corridor should  be accompanied by proposals for its retention and  enhancement. This includes
the provision  of a  management plan  to govern  long  term management arrangements. In order  to

compulsory  purchase  powers  to enable  the delivery  of this key  element of infrastructure.
357 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.623 The site should  be developed  in accordance  with the allocations set out in  Figure 15.64;
this provides  the appropriate balance  of uses  to meet the housing  and employment needs  of the
town.
15.624 The provision of new green infrastructure and the improvement of existing green infrastructure
are of paramount importance. This will  assist in  improving  the health and  wellbeing  of residents and
those working  within the town, as  well  as enhancing  the environment of the town. Appropriate
landscaping  and open  space  will be provided  and integrated with adjacent development.
15.625 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land  allocations in  mixed  use schemes  will be phased  in tandem
with the housing  allocations. Where appropriate, the phased  release  of employment land  will be
secured  through S106 agreements/obligations.

Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 54:  Royal London including land to the west of Alderley Road, Wilmslow
15.629 The Royal  London  site presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality, sustainable, mixed
use development to contribute to the identified housing  needs  of the town of Wilmslow, as  well as
contributing to the provision  of the borough’s  knowledge-based  industry and  open  space  provision.
15.630 This site is  located to the south west of Wilmslow town centre and  is split into two parts
across  Alderley Road. The east section of the site is  bordered  by the West Coast Main  Line  and A34
Wilmslow Bypass to the east and  south of the site, with residential development and  playing  fields
to the north. The section west of Alderley Road  is currently agricultural land  bounded  by housing  to
the north, west, and  south; and  by the existing Royal  London  Campus  (across  Alderley Road)  to the
east.
15.631 The site includes  the existing Royal  London  campus, which  is to be  retained. With the
exception of one or two hedgerows, the non-developed area of the site is open in nature, with numerous
trees dotted along  the site boundary, and  a small  area  of wooded  cover  to the south west of the site.
There are  also  ponds  and a brook  within the site that has  resulted in  a small  area  of the far southern
end of the site being  in flood zone  3.
15.632 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 54
Royal London including land west of Alderley Road, Wilmslow
The development of the Royal  London  site over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be achieved
through:
1. The retention of the existing Royal  London  Campus  unless  buildings  become  surplus  to
the requirements of existing occupiers, in which case the council  will consider their suitability
for reuse  or redevelopment for a  range  of alternative uses;
2. The delivery  of around  175 dwellings  (around  80 on land  to the east of the existing campus,
around  20 to the north of the existing campus(92) and around  75 on land  west of Alderley
Road);
3. The provision  of 5 ha of employment land  for up  to around  24,000 square  metres of B1
employment space  and a hotel;
4. Incorporation of green  infrastructure and  the provision  of public  open  space  at the southern
end of the land  west of Alderley Road;
5. Retention and  extension of the existing Wilmslow High  School playing  fields for educational
use in the area  marked  as protected open  space  on the map. This may  include  additional
buildings for education use provided they do  not harm the integrity of the open space overall;
6. Provision of at least 1  ha of land  set aside  for use  as school  playing  fields within the land
to the east of the existing campus, in  addition to the areas  marked  as protected open  space
on the map, and  an appropriate level  of amenity open  space  and children's play  space; and
7. Pedestrian and  cycle  links  and associated infrastructure.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. Phased delivery  on land  to the east of the existing campus  so that a  serviced  site for B1
employment uses  is delivered  in conjunction with the residential development.
b. High quality design  and appropriate landscaping  / green  infrastructure should  be provided
within the site in  order  to preserve  the character of the area  and ensure  an acceptable
relationship between residential and  employment uses. The design  must respect the site's
location as  a key entrance into Wilmslow.
c. Provision of areas  of open  space  within the scheme, including:
92 Land  within the site boundary  but outside of the existing Royal  London  campus  at The Coach  House  and Harefield
Farm.

'Affordable Homes'.
h. Respect for the setting of listed buildings  on site including  Fulshaw Hall.
i. A detailed site-specific flood risk  assessment should  be prepared.
j. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
k. Retention of the existing Royal  London  Campus  landscape  setting.

361 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsJustification
15.633 This site presents an  ideal  opportunity for an  infill development which, with a  mixed  use
scheme, will  facilitate the growth and  expansion  of a major  employment site, provide  jobs  and meet
Wilmslow's much  needed  requirements for open  space  provision, whilst retaining the character of
the area.
15.634 The Royal  London  site currently performs an  essential role  in providing  employment in  a
key growth sector and  this site is  vital in  providing  future employment opportunities in  Wilmslow. The
council  has received  a planning  application submitted by  Royal  London  (reference 16/2314M) for a
major  new  office building  on the land  to the east of the current campus. This could  result in  existing
buildings within the existing campus becoming available for reoccupation or redevelopment, providing
scope  for extension of the mixed  use approach  across  this part of the allocation. Development of the
land east of the existing campus  site should  be phased  so that employment uses  can be brought
forward alongside  the residential development. Housing  will therefore act as  an ‘enabler’  to ensure
that employment development takes place.
15.635 A cohesive approach must be taken when considering the layout of the site, good connectivity
between existing and  new  developments and  open  space  provision  will be essential in  ensuring  a
well designed  and sustainable site. A new  public  realm  between existing and  proposed  employment
uses  will be required.
15.636 High quality design  will also  be very  important. New  development will  be expected to
preserve  or enhance  the setting of designated heritage assets located within the site, as  well as the
character of the surrounding  area  including  the visual  character of the entrance into Wilmslow from
the south along  Alderley Road. Proposals on  the land  west of Alderley Road  should  also have  regard
to the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Note (2004) 'Development in Established Residential
Areas: Fulshaw Park’.
15.637 New residential development should  be situated to the north of the site to protect the
amenities of residential properties with the existing and  proposed  employment uses.
15.638 By virtue of its location and  leafy character it is  considered  that this site offers an  ideal
setting for a hotel along Alderley Road frontage. The hotel will not only generate additional employment
opportunities but will  offer a  supporting facility for businesses.
15.639 A full comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  will be fundamental in  ensuring  the proposed
development is  in keeping  with the character of the area  and should  secure  a sensitive green  buffer
between proposed  residential and  employment zones.
15.640 There is  significant tree coverage, particularly to the west of this site, therefore existing
mature trees and hedging will  be expected to be maintained where possible, or replaced with mitigation.
15.641 New development will  also  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on
site and, where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation.
15.642 The eastern section of this site is  already  served  by two existing access  points off Alderley
Road. In order to accommodate the new development existing access points will need to be  enhanced,
where  appropriate, and/or seek  to introduce a  new  access  point. A new  access  point off Alderley
Road  will be required  for the western section. Individual dwellings  should  not have  their own  direct
accesses  to Alderley Road.
15.643 Integration within the surrounding  community, town centre and  railway  station will  be
important in  ensuring  the sustainability of this development, therefore contributions to enhancements
or the provision  of new  linkages  will be encouraged.
15.644  The council's Green Space Strategy has  identified that there is  a specific need  for open
space  within South West Wilmslow. The inclusion  of a new  area  of public  open  space  as part of the
residential development of land  west of Alderley Road  will provide  a facility for existing and  future
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 362
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsresidents, which  will protect an  area  of the land  from development and  retain a  feature that offers a
high contribution to the character of this particular area.
15.645 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.646 The site has potential for contamination to be  present therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
Indicative Site Delivery
It is expected that employment land  allocations in  mixed  use schemes  will be phased  in tandem
with the housing  allocations. Where appropriate, the phased  release  of employment land  will be
secured  through S106 agreements/obligations.

15.650 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 55
Wilmslow Business Park
The development of the Wilmslow Business Park site over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will
be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of up  to 6.3 ha  of employment land  for an  exemplar  B1 Business use
development in line with the principles of sustainable development, providing around 25,000
square  metres of employment space.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. New development will  be expected to be  of a high  quality and  innovative design, which  will
consider  site constraints whilst providing  an attractive place  to work.
b. A comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  will be required.
c. New development will  be expected to make  enhancements to the existing access  point or
provide  a new  access  to the A34. It must also  improve  connectivity and  accessibility within
the site and  to the wider  local  area  including  pedestrian and  cycle  links  to Wilmslow Railway
Station.
d. The existing playing  fields on  site must be  retained within the site or  contributions made  for
off site provision. The retention and  / or replacement of the outdoor sports facilities should
be in accordance  with the findings of an  adopted, up  to date and  robust needs  assessment.
e. New development will  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on  site
and where  necessary, provide  appropriate mitigation.
f. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be

Green BeltFigure 15.67 Wilmslow Business Park Site
Justification
15.651 Located within close  proximity of Wilmslow town centre and  transportation links  this former
Green Belt site offers an  ideal  opportunity for development. Bounded by  the A34 and  West Coast
Mainline  this site is  surrounded  by defensible boundaries  and is therefore an  opportune environment
for a sustainable employment site.
15.652 Development of the site would  contribute to Wilmslow’s  expanding  knowledge  based
industry, facilitate jobs and contribute to both the town and wider  borough objectives towards economic
growth. It provides  excellent linkages  and visibility from the main  A34 road. The mainline  railway
station lies  less than half a  mile  to the north.
15.653 The isolated nature of this site restricted by its boundaries, narrow shape  and limited access
point will, as  with all  developments, require  a high  level  of design  but will  also  allow  scope  for an
innovative design solution, which will overcome constraints. A future master plan for this development
would  therefore be  desired.
15.654 To ensure  the principles  of sustainable development are  achieved, enhancements to the
existing access  will be essential to provide  linkage  of this development with the town centre and  wider
community.
15.655 A comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  will be fundamental to providing  an attractive setting
for the business  park  as well as providing  a landscape  buffer between the railway  line, A34 Bypass
and the education use  to the north.
15.656 Open space  provision  offers an  important contribution to the health and  wellbeing  of the
local community. The playing  fields north of the site will  therefore need  to be  either retained within
the site or  provision  made  off site.
365 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locations15.657 Development will be required to take existing ecological constraints on site into consideration,
such  as a brook  which  runs  through the site. Existing mature trees and  hedging  will be expected to
be maintained, where  possible, or  replaced  with mitigation.
15.658 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up

15.660 The Little Stanneylands site presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality, sustainable
residential development to contribute to the identified housing  requirement for Wilmslow.
15.661 The site is  located to the north of Wilmslow to the north west of Stanneylands Road. It is
adjacent to residential development, the Stanneylands Hotel and  Wilmslow Garden Centre. Beyond
the northern site boundary, the land  drops  down  into the Dean  River  valley.
15.662 There are  a number  areas  of mature trees within and  around  the site, including  a number
protected by TPOs. At present, the site is not publicly-accessible and has no footpaths running through
the area.
15.663 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 366
 Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic LocationsSite LPS 56
Land at  Little Stanneylands, Wilmslow
The development of the Little Stanneylands site over  the Local  Plan Strategy period  will be
achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  200 dwellings;
2. Provision of a  direct cycle  and pedestrian link  from the site to Manchester Road, linking  the
site to Handforth Railway  Station and  centre;
3. Provision of a  new  pedestrian and  cycle  bridge  across  the River  Dean  and improvement of
public  access  along  the river  valley  to include  a footpath link  from Linneys  Bridge to
Manchester Road; and
4. Retention of trees and  woodlands  at the edges  of the site, with new  planting to re-enforce
landscape  features -  to properly  define a  new  Green Belt boundary  and to maintain the
setting of existing properties and  protect the amenities of those occupiers.
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development must be  a high  quality design  which  reflects and  respects the character
of the area  and the amenities of neighbouring  properties.
b. Provide a  comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  which  retains existing mature trees and
hedgerows  where  possible.
c. Creation of a new vehicular access to Stanneylands Road, or as  an alternative to Manchester
Road.
d. Improve the connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the site to Handforth centre and
the wider  local  area  with the provision  of cycle  paths and  pedestrian linkages.
e. Provision must be  made  for public  open  space  to the north and  west of the site utilising the
river valley. Any new  development will  be expected to make  contributions to playing  fields
and children’s  play  facilities where  these cannot be  provided  on site.
f. New development will  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on  site
and where  necessary  provide  appropriate mitigation.
g. Provide contributions to health and  education infrastructure.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. Provide for a  long-term management strategy for land  along  the Dean  Valley  shown  as
Protected Open Space in  Figure 15.68.
j. Respect for the setting of listed buildings  adjacent to the site.
k. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated. Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
Justification
15.664 The site offers an  excellent opportunity for a  sustainable residential development which  will
contribute to meeting Wilmslow’s  housing  requirements.
15.665 The site is  reasonably  well located to Wilmslow with bus  routes nearby  and within easy
walking  distance to Handforth Railway  Station and  district centre, provided  an appropriate pedestrian
linkage  to Manchester Road  is provided. This needs  to be  a direct safe and  level  access  in order  that
the full sustainable potential of the site can  be realised.
15.666 With a  quality design, the development of the site could  respect the character and
distinctiveness of the locality with quality design. Green links  along  the River  Dean  could  be created,
367 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsimproving  local  connectivity and  benefitting new  residents as  well as the wider  area. It is  proposed
that land  to the north and  west lying  between the development and  the River  Dean  will be dedicated
as a new  area  of land  with public  access. In addition to measures  to improve  use and accessibility,
the land will require an  appropriate management plan and arrangements for its long term management
that retain its special  character.

15.667 The Heathfield Farm site presents an  opportunity to deliver  a high  quality, sustainable
residential development to contribute to the identified housing  requirement for Wilmslow.
15.668 The site is  located to the eastern side  of Wilmslow, south of Dean  Row  Road. It is  directly
adjacent to existing residential areas  to the north and  west.
15.669 The site is  gently undulating with several  trees and  groupings  that are  covered  by Tree
Preservation Orders. A public  footpath runs  north-south at the eastern end  of the site.
15.670 In addition to this area  of the site allocated for housing, the area  beyond  forms a  logical
extension which  is safeguarded for potential future development needs  beyond  the plan  period.
15.671 Allocation of this site involved  an adjustment to the Green Belt boundary.
Site LPS 57
Heathfield Farm (allocation), Wilmslow
The development of the Heathfield Farm site over  the plan  period  will be achieved  through:
1. The delivery  of around  150 dwellings;
2. Provision of direct cycle  and pedestrian links  from the site to the west, to improve  links  to
the Summerfields local  centre and  Wilmslow town centre / railway  station; and
3. The retention of the public  footpath crossing  the site;
Site Specific Principles of Development
a. The development must be  a high  quality design  which  reflects and  respects the character
of the area  and the amenities of neighbouring  properties.
b. Provide a  comprehensive  landscaping  scheme  which  retains existing mature trees,
hedgerows  and ponds  with new  planting to re-enforce these areas, help  break  up the site
and create green  infrastructure.
c. Utilise the existing access  off the Dean  Row  Road  / Handforth Road  roundabout as  the
main  point of access. Proposals should  consider  the option of a  future link  to Pinewood
Road  in any future phases  of development on  the safeguarded land.
d. Improve the connectivity and  accessibility into and  out of the site to the wider  area  with the
provision  of or  contribution to pedestrian linkages  and cycle  paths, including  a pedestrian
and cycle  link to Browns Lane  / Pinewood Road.
e. Provision should  be made  for public  open  space  within the site, supplementing existing
green  infrastructure as  well as improving  linkages  with the existing area  of public  open
space to the south of Browns Lane. New development will be expected to make contributions
to playing  fields and  children’s  play  facilities where  these cannot be  provided  on site.
f. New development will  be expected to respect any  existing ecological  constraints on  site
and where  necessary  provide  appropriate mitigation.
g. Provide contributions to education and  health infrastructure.
h. The Local  Plan Strategy site is  expected to provide  affordable housing  in line with the policy
requirements set out in  Policy SC 5  'Affordable Homes'.
i. A minimum  of a Phase 1  Preliminary Risk  Assessment for contaminated land  should  be
carried  out to demonstrate that the site is, or  could  be made, suitable for use  should  it be
found to be  contaminated.  Further work, including  a site investigation, may  be required  at
a pre-planning  stage, depending  on the nature of the site.
j. Any development that would  prejudice  the potential for future development of the adjacent
safeguarded land  (Site ref LPS 58)  will not be  permitted.

Justification
15.672 The site offers an  excellent opportunity for a  sustainable residential development which  will
contribute to meeting Wilmslow’s  housing  requirements.
15.673 The site is  reasonably  well located to both Wilmslow and  Handforth, with bus  routes nearby
and is within walking  distance to shops  and the train stations, provided  appropriate pedestrian/cycle
links are provided.
15.674 With a  quality design, the development of the site could  respect the character and
distinctiveness of the locality with quality design.
15.675 The site forms part of a  larger  area  of land  removed  from the Green Belt, the remainder  of
which  is safeguarded. This safeguarded land  should  remain  undeveloped  for the duration of the plan
period. However  the construction of the Heathfield Farm allocation should  anticipate the potential
development of the adjoining land at some point and not prejudice this possibility. Linkage to Pinewood
Road  should  be considered  as part of this process.

15.676 The Heathfield Farm (safeguarded) site presents an  opportunity to safeguard land  which
may be required  in future plans  to meet identified development needs  in the future.
15.677 The site is  located to the eastern side  of Wilmslow, south of Dean  Row  Road. It is  adjacent
to the LPS Site LPS 57  (Heathfield Farm) and  offers the potential for a  future phase  of development
if required  through a  review  of the Local  Plan.
15.678 The site is  gently undulating in  character with several  trees and  groupings  that are  covered
by Tree  Preservation Orders. There is  a pond  at the eastern end  of the site and  a public  footpath
runs north-south through the site.

Figure 15.72 Wardle Employment Improvement Area  Site
Justification
15.691 A former Royal  Air Force airfield, industrial and  commercial  development has  grown  on the
site over  the past few decades  since  the closure  of the airfield. At present the site is  a mix of existing
businesses  and open  countryside. Existing employment development is  focused around  the Wardle
Industrial Estate (along  Green Lane)  and the North West Farmers complex  (Boughey’s  distribution)
accessed  directly from the A51. The built form of the area  comprises  a variety of large  units in  use
for industrial and  storage/distribution purposes.
15.692 The suitability of Wardle  as a focus for employment uses  is well established. The history
of the site and  surrounding  area  has long  been  one of employment and  industrial related activities
including  agricultural related uses. Over time the majority of the former airfield buildings  have  been
reutilised or  redeveloped, which  has  led to several  highly  successful businesses  expanding
incrementally over  time such  as North West Farmers and  those located at Wardle  Industrial Estate.
15.693 A comprehensive  approach  to the future development of this site is  required, which  focuses
on retaining existing natural features where possible, for example by designing the Masterplan around
the existing hedgerow  pattern and  by retaining higher  quality trees. The Masterplan will  ensure  that
an appropriate landscape-driven  employment park  is achieved, in  keeping  with the character of the
surrounding  area.

15.695 Alderley Park is  an existing employment site located to the south east of Nether Alderley,
occupied  by the worldwide  pharmaceutical company  AstraZeneca, and  incorporates the BioHub
Incubator. Whilst the site provided  approximately 2,900 jobs(94), the majority of which  were  highly
skilled  research  and development posts, AstraZeneca announced  plans  to scale  down  its facility at
Alderley Park. There is  therefore a  need  to reconsider  the future of this strategic employment site.
15.696 As a previously-developed  site within the Green Belt, it is  not proposed  to alter the existing
Green Belt boundary  at Alderley Park.
Site LPS 61
Alderley Park Opportunity Site
The council  will support development on  this site to create a  life science(95) park  with a  focus on
human  health science  research  and development, technologies, and  processes, where  criteria
1-5 below  are met:
1. Development shall  be:
i. For human  health science  research  and development, technologies and  processes; or
ii. For residential (around  200 to 300  new homes)  or other high  value  land  uses  demonstrated
to be  necessary  for the delivery  of the life science  park(96) and not prejudicial  to its longer
term growth; or
iii. For uses  complimentary to the life science  park  and not prejudicial  to its establishment or
growth for this purpose.
2. Development shall  be in accordance  with the Alderley Park Development Framework(97).
3. Construction of new  buildings  for uses  in criterion 1  above  shall  be restricted to the Previously
Developed  Land  (PDL)(98) on the site unless:
i. very special  circumstances are  demonstrated to justify use  of other land  on this site outside
the PDL; and
ii. an equivalent amount of PDL on  the site is  restored to greenfield status, the restored land
should  be of an  equivalent or  better quality than the greenfield land  that is  used, so  there
is no overall  increase  in the developed  footprint.
4. Development would  not have  a greater impact on  the openness  and visual  amenity of the
Green Belt and  the purposes  of including  land  within it than existing development.
5. Development shall  preserve  or enhance  the significance of listed buildings, the conservation
area and  other heritage and  landscape  assets on  and  around  this site.  A Heritage Impact
Assessment must be  undertaken to determine the level  of development that can  be achieved.

Figure 15.73 Alderley Park Opportunity Site
Justification
15.697 Although this site is designated as an existing employment site, the National Planning Policy
Framework states that ‘policies should avoid the long term protection of sites allocated for employment
uses  where  there is  no reasonable  prospect of a  site being  used  for that purpose’.  Following the
announcement by  AstraZeneca of their plans  to reduce  the scale  of their facility on  this site to around
700 jobs  by 2016, Cheshire  East Council  has sought to work  alongside  the company  to maximise
the potential of this site as  a specialist employment facility. The council  and AstraZeneca have  a
shared  aspiration that the site should  evolve  from a  single  occupier  site to a  'cluster' of life science
businesses  with a  particular focus on  human  health science  research  and development, technologies
and processes.
15.698 However, it is  recognised  that, in  order  to enable  the delivery  of this vision, it may  be
necessary to allow a wider range of uses  on some areas  of the site, without satisfying the requirements
of Policy EG 3. In order  to maximise  the sites employment capability, alternative uses  must be
379 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Local Plan Strategy Sites and Strategic Locationsrestricted to those that have  been  demonstrated as  either necessary  for the delivery  of the desired
life science  park  and not prejudicial  to its longer  term growth, or  complimentary to the life science
park and not prejudicial  to its establishment or  growth.
15.699 The Alderley Park Development Framework has  been  developed  to proactively guide  any
future development on  the site. The site is  subject to a  planning  application (15/5401M, registered
on 30/11/15) for the demolition of a  number  of specified buildings, and  a mixed  use development.
15.700 For the avoidance  of doubt this site remains  within the Green Belt.
15.701 Any replacement and/or new  sports provision  should  be in accordance  with an  adopted up
to date and  robust Playing Pitch Strategy and  Indoor Sports Strategy and  with Policy SC 2  ‘Indoor
and Outdoor Sports Facilities’.
15.702 The site has potential for contamination to be present, therefore at least a Phase 1 Preliminary
Risk Assessment for contaminated land  needs  to be  carried  out to ensure  that any  contamination
that is  present is  subject to appropriate remediation.
15.703 A proposal  needs  to be  put forward and  agreed  with Sport England that replaces  the playing
fields to an  equivalent or  better quantity and  quality in  a suitable location.
15.704 In line  with the development framework, a high quality of design, together with a commitment
to quality of materials, finishes, detailing and  landscaping  will be required, reflecting the unique
characteristics of the site.

Monitoring and  Implementation
381 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Monitoring and Implementation16 Monitoring and Implementation
16.1 This Local  Plan Strategy will  influence positive changes  for the people  who live, work  and visit
the borough, by  addressing  the key  challenges  that face it. It is  therefore essential that changes  are
measured  through a  monitoring framework. Monitoring will  assess  the delivery  and effectiveness of
achieving  the vision, objectives, spatial strategy, the strategic priorities and  the policies. In addition,
one of the key  tests of soundness  for the Local  Plan Strategy is  to ensure  the plan  is “effective” and
that the plan  is deliverable  in the plan  period.
16.2 The Local Authority will produce an Authority Monitoring Report (AMR), which will be published
annually  on the council's website for public  view. The AMR will  demonstrate how  the policies  within
the Local  Plan Strategy are  achieving  their objectives by:
Assessing the performance of the Local  Plan Strategy and  other Local  Plan documents by
considering  progress  against the indicators proposed;
Setting out Cheshire  East's updated housing  trajectory;
Identifying the need  to reassess  or review  any policies  or approaches;
Making  sure  the context and  assumptions behind  our strategy and  policies  are still relevant;
Identifying trends in  the wider  social, economic  and environmental issues  facing Cheshire  East
affecting the Local  Plan policies.
16.3 The council  has ensured  the monitoring framework is  Specific, Measurable, Achievable and
Realistic and, where  appropriate, Time  bound  (SMART) in  order  that the Local  Plan Strategy will
meet the National Planning Policy Framework's tests of soundness. Some of the policies  will relate
to more  than just one  indicator, thereby a  more  comprehensive  snapshot may  be achieved. One
indicator may  have  a multiple of uses  and therefore refer to more  than just one  policy.
16.4 Monitoring data will  be drawn  from a  whole  range  of sources. These sources  will include
national, regional  and locally  published  sources, surveys  carried  out by  the council, for example
annual  employment, retail and  housing  completion surveys, and  town centre surveys. It will  also
include  the Strategic Housing  Land  Availability Assessment (SHLAA) and  other surveys  carried  out
in conjunction with stakeholders and  partners as  applicable.
16.5 The AMR will  provide  the council  with an  indication through measured  indicators as  to whether
the plan  is meeting key  Strategic Priorities. Where the evidence  or trends show  there is  under
performance or  policies  are out of date or  clearly  not providing  their aim  this would  trigger the council
to take action. This trigger will  vary  depending  on the indicator in  question. The council  will consider
what action is needed, for example whether the policy needs to be strengthened, maintained or revise
that part of the Local  Plan Strategy, whichever  was the more  appropriate.
16.6 The Local  Plan Strategy is  intended to be  a robust document, suitable for setting the direction
of development locally  for the next 20  years. Nevertheless, changing  conditions may  be so significant
as to require  a review  or partial review  of the Local  Plan Strategy, for example; where  development
fails to come  forward due  to infrastructure or  land  assembly  difficulties, significant changes  to national
planning  policy  or because  of influences beyond  its control. Where appropriate, the council  will work
collaboratively with developers  and stakeholders to find solutions or  it may  be able  to use  its influence
and powers  to assist in  the delivery.
16.7 There are  a number  of contingency measures  the council  could  apply  if issues  materialise. In
the event of difficulties arising, the steps the council  will apply  will be dependent on  the situation,
each  being  assessed  on its individual  merits. Should an  issue  arise, examples  of remedial  actions
that the council  could  consider  applying  are as follows:
Review  and re prioritise head  of terms for securing  developer  contributions to enable  priority
schemes  to be  developed;
Review  its SHLAA and  Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document to bring  forward
new sites;
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 382
 Monitoring and ImplementationCarry  out an  employment land  review  and Market Appraisal of Employment land  to maximise
their efficient use;
Consider  the release  of sites to achieve  a five year  housing  supply; and
Use its compulsory  purchase  powers.
16.8 The direct investment in  land  and buildings  and developer  contributions towards infrastructure
will be fundamental to ensuring  the implementation of the Local  Plan Strategy.
16.9 The Local  Plan policies  will be implemented through a  number  of mechanisms, including  but
not exclusive  to:
Development management, through appropriate consideration of planning  applications;
Development and  preparation of more  detailed policies  through the Site Allocations and
Development Policies Document, Minerals  and Waste Development Plan Document and  future
Supplementary Planning Documents;
Working  with partner bodies, organisations, funding bodies, businesses  and developers  through
private and  public  sector partnership arrangements and  investment;
Partnership working  with public  sector partners such  as health and  social  care  providers;
Funding mechanisms  including  developer  contributions and  the Community Infrastructure Levy;
Private sector, including  registered landlords;
Local  Design  Review, design  and quality audits and  awards;
Preparation of town / village  design  statements and  Neighbourhood  Plans by  town / parish
councils  and local  communities;
Regular  updating of the evidence  base  to support the Local  Plan, as  required.

Proposed Growth DistributionProposed Employment Land Distribution
A.3 The Tables  below  illustrate the proposed  distribution of employment land  across  Cheshire  East
as distributed across  Principal Towns, Key Service Centres, Local  Service Centres and  Other
Settlements and  Rural  Areas.
A.4 The figures for take-up between 2010  and 2013  are the gross  take-up of new  employment land
for employment (B1, B2 and  B8) uses. The take-up figures do  not include  redevelopment of existing
employment sites for employment use  or the losses  of employment land  to other uses.
A.5 The employment land supply is the amount of land available for new  employment development.
It includes  sites with permission  for employment development, sites under  construction, existing
employment allocations and  new allocations in this Local Plan Strategy. It does not include permissions
for redevelopment for employment uses  where  the site is  already  being  used  for employment. It does
include  permissions  for changes  of use  from non-employment uses  to employment uses, but does
not include  changes  from one  type of employment use  to another. It also  does  not include  sites that
are classed  as owner-expansion  land  as these are  not generally  available  for development.

B.1 Consideration has  been  given  to the ‘saved’  policies  in the Local  Plans adopted by  the former
Boroughs / County Council  (Congleton Borough Local  Plan First Review, Borough of Crewe  and
Nantwich Replacement Local  Plan 2011, Macclesfield Borough Local  Plan, Cheshire  Replacement
Minerals  Local  Plan and  the Cheshire  Replacement Waste Local  Plan). Where appropriate, ‘saved’
policies  have  been  deleted to ensure  no overlap  with the policies  contained in  the Cheshire  East
Local  Plan Strategy –  Submission Version.
B.2 A list of previously  adopted policies  which  the council  is seeking  to retain / replace  is set out
below. Policies that are  retained will  continue to be  used  in the determination of planning  applications
in the borough  until superseded  by the Site Allocations and  Development Policies Document and  the
Minerals  and Waste DPD.

Saved PoliciesAppendix C:  Parking Standards
C.1 The following sets out the parking  standards that the council  applies  to new  developments.
Table  C.1 ‘Car  Parking Standards’ will  only  apply  where  there is  clear  and compelling  justification
that it is  necessary  to manage  the road  network. Reference should  be made  to the Cheshire  East
Parking Standards -  Guidance Note (October 2012)  or, if superseded, to the latest parking  standards
guidance.
C.2 Cheshire  East Council  will accept representations to vary  from car  parking  standards on  a
site-by-site basis  with reference to evidence  obtained locally  or from a  suitable data source  (e.g.
TRICS) outlining predicted parking  profiles that would  allow  departures from the Standards set out
below.
C.3 Guidance provided  from the National Planning Policy Framework has  been  used  to develop
these parking  standards.
C.4 The parking  standards that apply  for residential dwelling  houses  are minimum  standards and
for all  other uses  the standards should  be regarded  as recommended  levels. The parking  provision
will also  take account of:
Availability and  cost of parking  spaces  on site and  close  by;
How regular  and frequent public  transport is;
How easy  it is to access  a site by  safe walking  and cycling  routes;
Operational needs  of proposed  developments; and
Relationship between different land  uses, such  as how  close  housing  is to employment, shops
and leisure  uses.

to cater for the increasing size of cars on the market).Size and Layout of
Standard Parking
Bays (including
Good circulation around car parks is an important factor in ensuring the safety of pedestrians
moving to and from their vehicles.  As such aisle widths should be set at a minimum ofresidential
developments)
6.9m for two-way routes to allow for ease of movement to/from spaces without unnecessarily
impeding pedestrians and other vehicles.  For one-way routes the aisle width can be
reduced to a minimum 6.0m.
The recommended minimum clear internal dimensions for a domestic single garage are
2.7 metres x 5.5 metres.Domestic Garage
Dimensions
Developers should note that dimensions less than this will not necessarily be considered
to qualify against the parking ratios for residential development.
Provision should be made for the specific use of the motorcycle otherwise known as
Powered Two Wheeler vehicle or PTWs, on all developments where there are 20 or more
communal parking spaces.
Minimum requirements are for the provision of one secure motorcycle space for car parks
with up to 50 communal car spaces and 2% provision against car space numbers thereafter.
The location of such facilities is an important factor, therefore the chosen area should be
safe and secure, well lit and somewhere where there is good general surveillance.
The space required for parking of a motorcycle is 3.0m x 1.5m, and multiples thereof,
although it is not necessary or desirable to mark bays out individually.Powered Two
Wheeler
Bays for drivers with disabilities should be 3.7m wide or alternatively should consist of two
standard 2.5m bays with shared spaces of 1.2m in between bays.  A 1.2m safety zoneDisabled Parking
should be provided for boot access and cars with rear hoists.  The 1.2m safety/unloading
zone at the rear should not project into the 6.0m/6.9m aisle width for circulating traffic as
this would expose disabled drivers to being reversed into in the safe zone.  Parent/infant
parking bays to be provided at the same dimensions without the safety zone at the boot
access.

 Evidence and LinksAppendix E: Housing Trajectory
Figure E.1 Housing Trajectory with a  Base  Date  of 31  March 2016
E.1 The housing  trajectory for Cheshire  East illustrates the expected delivery  rate of new  dwellings.
It demonstrates how  the proposed  housing  requirement of 36,000 new  dwellings  will be achieved,
over the whole  plan  period.
E.2 The ‘Local  Plan’ line  in the trajectory represents the annualised  average  housing  requirement 
of 1,800 dwellings  for Cheshire  East from 2010  to 2030, as  set out in  this document. The vertical bars
show  the number  of dwellings  that have  been  completed, the anticipated supply  and the number  of
dwellings  that are  predicted to be  built over  the plan  period.
E.3 From 01  April, 2010  to 31  March  2016, a  total of 5,473 dwellings  (net) have  been  constructed,
including  C2 uses, leaving  30,527 dwellings  to be  delivered  over  the remainder  of the plan  period.
E.4 The predicted delivery  from specific sites comprises:
Commitments (10,822); and
Proposed Strategic Sites and  Strategic Locations (18,555).
E.5 The contribution from these sources  of supply  total 34,850 dwellings, which  reduces  the
remainder  to be  identified to 1,150 dwellings.
E.6 The ‘Allowance for Site Allocations’ bar  represents the projected delivery  from sites which  are
not formally identified at present but will  be identified in  the Site Allocations and  Development Policies
Document.  This will  allocate a  further 3,335 over  the plan  period. For the purposes  of this trajectory
this contribution is  spread  equally  over  the plan  period  post 2020  (to allow  for the timescales required
for the preparation and  adoption of this document).
E.7 The council  has also  sought to identify a  ‘small  sites windfall allowance’, which  acknowledges
that as  well as those already  identified sources  of supply, there are  likely  to be  sites (comprising  9
units or  less)  which  have  not previously  been  identified which  may be brought forward for development. 
445 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Housing TrajectoryThe council  has set this allowance  at 125  dwellings  per annum  (excluding  Crewe  and Macclesfield
given  the provisions  of LPS 1  and LPS 12)  and commencing  from 2019/20.  This is  based  upon
evidence  of consistent housing  delivery  from this scale  of sites since  2009/10 as  detailed within the
Housing  Supply and  Delivery  Topic  Paper (as  at 31  March  2016).  It has  been  set to take effect from
2019/20 as  the council  acknowledges  that there are  already  a number  of committed sites of 9  or less
units, and  this approach  removes  any potential for double  counting than if we  were  to commence
from the current year  (2016/17).  This equates to an  additional 1,375 units added  to the supply  over
the remainder  of the plan  period.
Average (7
years)2015/16 2014/15 2013/14 2012/13 2011/12 2010/11 2009/10

(excluding Crewe and
Macclesfield)
Table E.1  Completions across Cheshire East on sites of 9  or fewer units, excluding residential gardens only
E.8 Altogether, this brings  the predicted supply  of housing  to 39,560 dwellings, taking in  to
consideration those completions (as  at 31  March  2016), commitments (as  at 31  March  2016),
allocations for Strategic Sites and  Strategic Locations, site allocations in  the SADPD and  a small
sites windfall allowance.  This equates to almost 10%  plan  flexibility, which  is comfortably above  the
36,000 dwellings required. The contribution from each component of the housing supply is summarised
in Table  E.2 below.

Table E.2  Housing supply at  31 March 2016
Five Year  Housing Land Supply
E.9 The NPPF requires  that councils  identify a  five-year supply  of ‘deliverable’  housing  land  in their
development plans, plus  a 5% buffer to allow  for choice  and competition.  Where there has  been  a
record of persistent under delivery, local planning authorities should increase the buffer to 20% (moved
forward from later in the plan period) to provide a reasonable prospect of achieving the planned supply
and to ensure  choice  and competition in  the market for land.  In the context of Cheshire  East, set
against an  annual  target of 1,800 new  dwellings  per annum  and  applying  a 20%  buffer to the
requirement only, would  lead  to a  requirement of 10,800 new  homes  over  the next 5  year  period
(2016/17 until 2020/21).  However, there is  also  a shortfall which  the council  is seeking  to address
through the ‘Cheshire East’ methodology (Sedgepool 8), which apportions the previous under delivery
over the first 8  years  of the remainder  of the plan  period.  This results in  a delivery  requirement of
2,466 dwellings  per annum  as shown  on the ‘Cheshire  East’ methodology (Sedgepool 8)  delivery
requirement line  of figure E.1.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 446
 Housing TrajectoryE.10 The sites identified in  the Local  Plan Strategy have  been  selected on  the basis  that they will
make  a significant contribution to meeting the housing  needs  of the area  over  the whole  plan  period
and are economically  viable  in terms of deliverability.  Moreover, they will  significantly improve  the
supply  of affordable, intermediate and  market housing  once  the Local  Plan Strategy is  formally
adopted.  There will  also be a greater range  of sites identified in  the Site Allocations and  Development
Policies DPD in  due course.
E.11 The Local  Plan Strategy and  its associated trajectory sets out a  comprehensive  range  of sites
(committed or  to be  allocated) which  all have  a role in ensuring  the council  can demonstrate and
maintain a  5 year  supply.  Each of the sites have  been  appraised  in terms of their delivery  potential
over the first five years  and remainder  of the plan  period  and in the case  of each  of the Strategic
Sites, there has  been  detailed discussions  with the relevant landowners  / site promoters to ensure
that the timing and  yield  of development utilised is  both robust and  justifiable.
E.12 The range of sites outlined in  the housing trajectory is considered capable of delivering  15,588
dwellings  (including  a small  sites windfall allowance  for years  4 and 5) over  the next 5  years.  Hence,
using  the ‘Cheshire  East’ method (Sedgepool 8)  and applying  a 20%  buffer, a  5.3 year  supply  of
‘deliverable’  housing  land  is currently available  in Cheshire  East.

Housing TrajectoryAppendix F: The Local Plan for Cheshire East
What is the Local Plan?
F.1 The Local  Plan, when  it is fully adopted, will  be the complete Development Plan for Cheshire
East (replacing  earlier  Plans prepared  by the former Districts and  the County Council)  and its policies
will form the basis  for planning  decisions  in the borough.  The Local  Plan will  cover  a range  of matters
including:
How much  employment land  is needed  and where  it should  be provided;
Protecting and  improving  important open  areas  and providing  new  ones;
How many  new  homes  will be required  and where  they should  be located;
Providing new  transport infrastructure including  roads, cycle  routes and  footpaths; and
How town centres and  community facilities in  the borough  could  be improved.

Figure F.1 Content of the Local PlanF.2 The Local Plan for Cheshire East will consist of three
key documents. These are:
The Local  Plan Strategy, which  sets out the vision,
spatial strategy and  strategic priorities for the
development of Cheshire  East for the period  up to
2030.  It will  be used  by everyone  who  wants to see
how the borough  will change  and establish what new
development is  expected over  the period  to 2030. 
The document also  identifies Local  Plan Strategy
Sites and  Strategic Locations that will  accommodate
most of the development intended.
The Local  Plan Site Allocations and  Development
Policies document, which  will allocate the remaining
sites proposed  for future development and  provide
detailed policies  to be  used  when  considering
planning  applications for new  development across
the borough.
The Minerals  and Waste Development Plan
Document, which  will set out policies  for dealing  with
minerals  and waste and  identify specific sites for these purposes.
F.3 The Local  Plan will  be supported by  an Adopted Policies Map  which  will:
Define development sites and  Green Belt boundaries;
Identify settlement boundaries;
Show where  different types of development will  be permitted;
Display  environmental and  heritage designations; and
Show where  policies  will apply  across  the area.
F.4 The Local  Plan will  also  be accompanied  by an Infrastructure Delivery  Plan which  will identify:
Future infrastructure needs  and costs across  the borough;
The phasing  and timing of infrastructure provision;
Available  funding sources; and
The Infrastructure Providers.
F.5 Other documents that support the Local  Plan are:
A Local  Development Scheme (LDS), which  sets out the programme  of the preparation of the
Local  Plan documents and  Supplementary Planning Documents.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 448
 The Local Plan for Cheshire EastA Statement of Community Involvement, which sets out how the council will involve the community
and stakeholders in  the preparation and  review  of the Local  Plan, Supplementary Planning
Documents and  Development Management Decisions.
A Monitoring Report, which assesses progress on the delivery of the Local Plan and  its supporting
documents and  reviews  the effectiveness of the Local  Plan.
F.6 Further information on  the Local  Plan is  available  at: www .cheshireeast.gov .uk/localplan
Neighbourhood Planning and its relationship to the Local Plan
F.7 Cheshire  East Council  is committed to engaging  local  communities in  the planning  and
development of their areas. Neighbourhood  Planning is  a way  for local  communities to shape  the
development of the area  in which  they live.  The Localism  Act 2011  promoted the concept of
Neighbourhood  Planning with the National Planning Policy Framework and  Neighbourhood  Planning
(General) Regulations 2012 setting out the process, responsibilities and framework for those involved
in the preparation of a  Neighbourhood  Plan and  accompanying  processes.
F.8 Crucially, a  Neighbourhood  Plan must generally  conform with the strategic policies  contained
in the emerging  Cheshire  East Local  Plan and  contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development. Neighbourhood  Plans should  not repeat the emerging  Cheshire  East Local  Plan or  the
National Planning Policy Framework.  A Neighbourhood  Plan should  be complementary and  work
alongside  the Local  Plan and  will be expected to follow the overall  scale, distribution and  location of
development outlined in  it.

What is the Local Plan Strategy?
F.10 The Local  Plan Strategy is  the centrepiece of the Cheshire  East Local  Plan. It sets out the
strategic priorities for the future development of the area  together with a  suite of planning  policies
and proposals  designed  to deliver  sustainable development.
F.11 The Local  Plan Strategy has  been  informed by:

451 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
The Local Plan for Cheshire EastAppendix G: Evolution of the Local Plan Strategy
G.1 There have  been  a number  of stages in  the development of the Local  Plan Strategy. The
consultation stages and  associated evidence  base  collected to support the Local  Plan Strategy has
allowed  the council  to develop  a greater understanding of the issues  and opportunities that exist
within Cheshire  East. Responses  received  during  each  previous  consultation stage have  been
considered  and changes  made  to the overall  approach  to the  Local  Plan Strategy as  and when
considered  appropriate. The key  stages in  the development of the  Local  Plan Strategy are  set out
in Figure G.1 below:
Figure G.1 Key  Stages in the Development of the Local Plan Strategy
Core Strategy Issues and Options Paper (November / December 2010)
G.2 The Issues and  Options Paper set out options for the overall  strategy for the future of the
borough  and asked  some  fundamental questions about what Cheshire  East should  look like in 2030,
how much  growth should  be included  in the  Local  Plan Strategy and  where, in  a broad  sense, the
development should  be located. The document set out a  vision  for the future of the borough  and
included  a number  of strategic priorities for consultation.
G.3 The Core  Strategy Issues and  Options Paper also  identified a  number  of strategic level  issues
and options for the future development of the borough. The consultation on  the Issues and  Options
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 452
 Evolution of the Local Plan Strategypaper  highlighted the need  to provide  a 'bottom up' understanding for the Principal Towns  and Key
Service Centres identified in  the Determining the Settlement Hierarchy  paper.
Place Shaping Consultation (Summer / Autumn 2011)
G.4 To better understand the issues  in each  of the settlements identified in  the Determining the
Settlement Hierarchy  paper, a  Snapshot Report was  prepared  for each  Principal Town  and  Key
Service Centre. The Snapshot Report provided  information on  housing, economy, town centre,
transport, built and  natural environment and  community infrastructure in  each  town. The Snapshot
Report and  consultation provided  a useful insight into the prominent planning  issues  in the Principal
Towns  and Key Service Centres and  promoted an  overall  understanding of Cheshire  East as  a unified
'place'.
Rural Issues Consultation (October / November 2011)
G.5 A discussion  paper  on rural  issues  was prepared  which  set out the planning  context, identified
emerging government guidance and key challenges for the  Local Plan Strategy to address. It included
topics on  the Rural  Economy, Green Belt, Landscape  Character, Biodiversity, Heritage, Renewable
Energy, Rural  Housing, Transport and  Community Facilities. The consultation provided  a greater
understanding of planning  issues  in the rural  areas  of the borough.
Minerals Issues Consultation (March 2012)
G.6 The Minerals  Issues Discussion  Paper served  to discuss  the importance of mineral  extraction
in the borough. It gave  an opportunity for those parties involved  in minerals  planning  in Cheshire  East
to offer their views  on how  the Local  Plan should  approach  key strategic minerals  planning  issues.
There was  also  an opportunity to provide  additional information on  possible  sites and  areas  of future
mineral  working  and safeguarding.
Town Strategies (March 2012  - October 2012)
G.7 Following on  from the Issues and  Options and  Place Shaping consultation, Town  Strategies
were  prepared  for Principal Towns  and Key Service Centres in  Cheshire  East in  workshop  settings
using  Advisory Panels. These Advisory Panels formed in  each  town were  made  up of town councils
(where applicable), community partnerships, local businesses and community groups. The draft Town
Strategies were  then consulted upon  with local  communities in  each  area.
G.8 The Town  Strategies set out a  vision  for each  town together with potential development
opportunities and  priorities for investment in  infrastructure. They also  covered  other issues  such  as
the future of each  town centre.
G.9 The draft Town  Strategies for Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich  and Sandbach were  prepared
first, as  part of a  Neighbourhood  Planning 'Frontrunner' project, with funding from the Department for
Communities and Local Government. The strategies for Alsager, Middlewich, Congleton, Sandbach(109)
and Wilmslow have  been  finalised following consultation and  approval  by their respective Town
Councils. A similar  tailored approach  was  then used  in the preparation of each  of the other Town
Strategy documents. The draft Town  Strategies for the remaining  towns of Crewe, Macclesfield,
Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and Poynton have been subject to consultation with local communities.
G.10 The Town  Strategies for Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich, Sandbach and  Wilmslow and  the
draft Town  Strategies in  Crewe, Macclesfield, Handforth, Knutsford, Nantwich and  Poynton now  form
part of the evidence  base  for the Core  Strategy.
Development Strategy and Policy Principles (January / February 2013)
G.11  The Development Strategy and Policy Principles consultation presented the council's preferred
policy  and site options and  not favoured alternatives. The Development Strategy set out options for
109 Sandbach Town  Council  has agreed  the Final Strategy with the exception of Development Options which  have  not
been  endorsed.
453 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Evolution of the Local Plan Strategythe overall  number  of homes  and employment land  that will  be needed  in Cheshire  East over  the
next 17  years  and proposed  levels  of development for each  of our  Principal Towns  and Key Service
Centres. It also  set out the overall  level  of proposed  development within Local  Service Centres, other
settlements and  rural  villages  of the borough  with alternative options.
Possible Additional Sites Proposed by Developer and Land Interests Consultation (May  2013)
G.12 Responses  received  to the Development Strategy revealed  a number  of other possible
strategic sites that developer, landowners  and others considered  suitable for inclusion  in the  Local
Plan Strategy. To  ensure  everyone  had the opportunity to comment on  these possible  additional sites
a further consultation stage was  held  on these parcels  of land.
G.13 This consultation provided  members  of the public  and other interested parties with a  chance
to have  their say  on the sites included  in the document, prior  to the council  making  a decision  on
whether any  of the sites should  be included  in the Local  Plan Strategy.
G.14 This consultation included  a number  of potential strategic sites submitted by  developer  and
land interests that had  not previously  been  subject to consultation during  the evolution of the  Local
Plan Strategy.
Pre-Submission Core Strategy (November / December 2013)
G.15 The Pre-Submission Core  Strategy set out the case  for sustainable economic  growth and
was the first draft of the strategy that the council  wished  to adopt to deliver  a vibrant sustainable
community and  for the management of development in  Cheshire  East up  to 2030.
G.16 The consultation also  included  a 'Non-Preferred Sites' document which  enabled  further
comment to be  made  on all sites considered  in the Development Strategy and  Potential Additional
Sites Consultation to help  make  sure  the final selection of sites are  the most appropriate.
G.17 This consultation allowed  interested parties a  chance  to have  their say  on the draft document
prior to the council  finalising the Local  Plan Strategy -  Submission Version.
Submission, Examination and Adoption (Spring 2014  - Summer 2017)
G.18 Following consultation, the Submission Local  Plan Strategy was  submitted to the Secretary
of State in  May  2014. Over the course  of the examination, changes  were  proposed  to the Submission
document which  resulted in  further consultations on  the Local  Plan Strategy (Proposed Changes
Version)  in Spring 2016  and Proposed Main  Modifications in  Spring 2017.
G.19 The Local  Plan Strategy was  adopted on  27 July 2017.
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 454
 Evolution of the Local Plan StrategyAppendix H:  Partners and Initiatives
H.1 The Local  Plan Strategy is  the spatial expression  of the borough's priorities and  development
needs  going  forward. As a  key council  document, it provides  the planning  framework to support the
priorities identified in  other plans  and programmes  prepared  by the council  or in the wider  sub-region.
Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership Business Plan (2012  - 2015)
H.2 The Cheshire  and  Warrington Local  Enterprise Partnership
ambition is  for Cheshire  and Warrington to be  the best performing
sub-regional  economy  outside of the South East. The LEP has
produced  a business  plan  with six  strategic priorities, based  upon:
Skilled and  productive workforce
Business Investment
Infrastructure and  connectivity including  bringing  forward
employment and  residential sites
Deregulation
The Rural  Economy
Promoting Cheshire  and Warrington
H.3 Since the development of this Business Plan, the government has  invited LEPs to develop
Strategic Economic Plans (SEP) for their sub-regions.  These have  a fundamentally different purpose
to the Business Plan as  they will  form the basis  for negotiations between the government and  LEPs
on allocations for more public sector funding for local  projects and programmes which deliver  economic
growth.  This funding will  be through the Single Local  Growth Fund, and  the next round  of European
Structural and  Investment funds.
H.4 The SEP is  currently being  developed  ahead  of a draft submission  to government (October
2013), and  will be informed by  key policy  frameworks, including  the Local  Plan Strategy and  its key
proposals  to promote economic  growth.
H.5 The Business Plan contains several  transformational projects located in  Cheshire  East.  These
include  maintaining Alderley Park as  a global  centre of research  excellence  and High  Growth City,
which  is a longer-term plan  for the super-growth of Crewe, delivered  on the back  of the announced
key rail interchange on  the new  High  Speed 2  railway  route.  High  Growth City will  initially focus on
linking  Crewe  and Macclesfield by  way of Congleton creating ‘a  corridor  of opportunity’.
'Ambition for All' -  the Sustainable Community Strategy 2010
H.6 The Local  Plan Strategy will  deliver  the place
shaping  aspects and  objectives of the Sustainable
Community Strategy (SCS). It will  also  play  a key
role in delivering  the council's corporate objectives
and other relevant strategies prepared  by Cheshire
East Council  and its partners.
H.7 ‘Ambition for All’ is  the Cheshire  East
Sustainable Community Strategy (2010)  for the
period  2010  to 2025. The purpose  of the strategy is
to set out how, over  the 15  years, the Partnership
for Action for Cheshire  East (PACE) will  seek  to
ensure  that Cheshire  East continues to prosper. The activities outlined in  the strategy are  intended
to improve  the quality of life of all  the people  of Cheshire  East and  to contribute to the achievement
of sustainable development through action to improve economic, social  and environmental well-being
across  the area. The Strategy provides  a high-level  vision  for Cheshire  East centred around  seven
priorities for action, which  are:
455 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Partners and InitiativesNurturing strong communities, including  the delivery  of services  as locally  as possible  and
ensuring  that communities feel safe;
Creating conditions for business  growth, including  making  the most of our  tourism, heritage and
natural assets and  ensuring  there is  a range  of available  high  quality employment sites and
premises  in all parts of Cheshire  East with good  transport links, to attract new  and expanding
businesses;
Unlocking  the potential of our  towns; this focuses firstly on  the regeneration of Crewe  including
the redevelopment of the town centre and  the provision  of new  homes  and jobs. Secondly, on
the revitalisation of Macclesfield, including improving the quality and choice  of shops and services
in the town centre and  progressing  the development of South Macclesfield; and  thirdly, on
retaining the vitality and  viability of our  market towns to ensure  that they continue to deliver
essential services, retail, leisure  and employment opportunities;
Supporting our  children  and young  people;
Ensuring a  sustainable future by  providing  affordable and  appropriate housing  to meet future
needs, by  promoting energy  efficiency and  the use  of renewable  energy, by  ensuring  that all
major  developments are  located with good  access  to local  amenities, cycle  and walking  routes,
by developing  a green  infrastructure plan  to safeguard, manage  and enhance  our green  assets,
giving  priority to the redevelopment of our  vacant brownfield sites and  by recognising  the
importance of mineral  extraction to the local  economy;
Preparing for an  increasingly  older  population including  the provision  of an  adequate supply  of
suitable extra care  housing; and
Driving  out the causes  of poor  health including  investment in  green  infrastructure to encourage
active and  healthy lifestyle choices.
Local Area  Partnerships
H.8 In 2009, Cheshire  East Council  established 7  Local  Area
Partnerships (LAPs), which  bring  local  partner organisations together to
improve  services, influence decision  making  and empower  communities,
focusing on what really matters to local people. The LAPs produce  annual
Area Plans, which  inform their work  plans  each  year. The Area Plans
focus on  local  issues  that cannot be  tackled by  one organisation on  its
own, bringing  together all  those with an  ability to make  a difference.
Priorities are  identified by  community led  planning, partner agencies  and
local data.
H.9 Cheshire East Council and partners are currently developing a new approach to locality working,
reviewing  how  the council  and partners devolve  and integrate a  wide  range  of service  delivery  and
activities and  how the more  resilient and  self sufficient local communities are developed, which reduce
unnecessary  demands  on public  services. The new  approach  needs  to balance  citizens' rights and
their responsibilities, along  with ensuring  that local  needs, preferences and  aspirations are  met.
Cheshire East Council -  Three Year  Plan 2013  - 2016
H.10 The Cheshire  East Council  three year  plan  details the purpose  of the council  to serve  the
people  of Cheshire  East through fulfilling a  community leadership  role, ensuring  quality and  value  in
public  services  and safeguarding the most vulnerable  in society.
H.11 The three year  plan  sets out 6  outcomes, including:
Local  communities as  strong and  supportive
A strong and  resilient economy
People have  the life skills  and education they need  to survive
A green  and sustainable place
People live  well and for longer
Good place  to live  and work
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 456
 Partners and InitiativesLocal Transport Plan
H.12 The Local  Transport Plan (LTP) aims  to capitalise on  the
strengths of the existing transport system in  Cheshire  East, including
good  transport links  to major  centres via  the rail  and  motorway
network.
H.13 The Plan identifies that good transport connections are integral
to plans for economic growth and to protect our environment to ensure
a sustainable future for all  our residents and  businesses. Following
consultation, the priorities for the LTP are  to ensure  a sustainable
future and  to create the conditions for business  growth. Future
investment in  transport will  be directed towards the policies  and
interventions which  support these priority areas  to help  grow  the
economy  and tackle carbon  emissions.
All Change for Crewe 2010  - 2030
H.14 All Change  for Crewe  is an ambitious strategy to support
Crewe’s  economic  development over  the 20  year  period. The
strategy intends that by  2030  Crewe  will be:
a nationally significant economic centre with a total population
in excess  of 100,000 people  (currently it has  about 83,000);
one of the leading  centres for advanced  engineering  and
manufacturing centres in  England; and
recognised  as a sought-after place  for people  to live, work, put down  roots and  develop  their
talents.
H.15 In 2011, a  business-led  Partnership Board was  established, with the support of the Council,
to assist in  shaping  and driving  the All Change  for Crewe  programme. It articulated its ambitions in
the 2012  Prospectus for Crewe, which  also  identified key  town centre development opportunities,
resulting in  significant interest from developers, investors and  other partners.
      
 
 
High Growth City
H.16 The government's current plans for a High Speed Railway (HS2) include
a route through Crewe  Station, with a  partial connection to the West Coast
Mainline, have  given  added  impetus for economic  growth in  Crewe, the rest
of the sub-region  and beyond. High  Growth City is  the programme  that will
deliver  the ambitions of All Change  for Crewe  up to 2030.  However, with the
prospect still remaining of a HS2 Hub station at Crewe with a  direct interchange,
the prospects for super-charged  growth beyond  2030  arise  that will  take the
town forward from this point with even  higher  levels  of growth.  This could  be
focused around  a new  Central Business District at the HS2 Hub  Station at
Crewe.
Make  it Macclesfield
H.17 Make  it Macclesfield is  a business-led  initiative to make
Macclesfield a  place  where  people  want to live, work  and visit, which
enhances their quality of life and life chances with a focus on improved
economic  prosperity and  success, increased  community cohesion
and increased  environmental sustainability.
H.18 Led through a  Community Interest Company, it helps  shape
and deliver  projects that enhance  the assets of the town to deliver
economic  prosperity for everyone  in the town.  It focuses on  economic
development, town regeneration, visitor economy and communications.
457 CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030
Partners and InitiativesH.19 Make  It Macclesfield’s  aspirations and  the range  of development opportunities in  the town
are articulated in  its Investment Prospectus and  Business Plan.
Housing Strategy -  Moving Forward 2011  - 2016
H.20 The Cheshire  East Housing  Strategy 'Moving Forward' 2011  - 2016  sets out the council's long
term housing  vision  for the borough. The strategy has  been  developed  at a time of significant change
within the housing  sector, with a  move  towards localism  and the flexibility to make  local  decisions.
These changes  are identified as  great opportunities for the authority to address  housing  at a local
level, in  order  to create balanced  and sustainable communities across  Cheshire  East.
H.21 The Strategy establishes five key  objectives. These are: delivering  market and  affordable
housing; making the best use of our existing stock; meeting the needs of our most vulnerable residents;
meeting the needs  of an  ageing  population; and  investing in  our neighbourhoods.
Vision and Strategy for Economic Growth: East Cheshire -  Engine of the North
H.22 This high  level  vision, investment plan  and economic  strategy identified the role  of the council
in delivering  economic  growth through initiatives including  the Local  Plan Strategy as  part of the Local
Plan; place  based  initiatives; commissioning; investment; and  the council's own  assets, to enable  the
conditions for growth.
H.23 The three key  elements of the strategy for growth are:
Productive and  competitive businesses  - a focus on  key assets, established and  emerging
sectors and  image  and identity
New investment and business development -  a focus on capacity, the package and the proposition
Creating the conditions for sustainable growth - a focus on sustainable development, connectivity,
housing  and neighbourhoods, town centres and  the rural  and visitor offer.
Economic Development Strategy
H.24 The Cheshire  East Economic Development Strategy sets out the council's understanding of
the local  economy  and the key  challenges  ahead. It presents the council's economic  development
objectives at the strategic level  and how these translate into our  thematic and  spatial priorities for the
Borough. The principal  focus is  on three spatial priorities relating to Crewe, Macclesfield and  our
market towns and  rural  hinterlands.
Cheshire East Visitor Economy Strategy 2011
H.25 The Visitor Economy Strategy is a strategically important component of the council’s economic
development priorities. It is  an important contributor to the economy  of Cheshire  East, contributing
to local  quality of life, and  has a positive impact on  decisions  over  business  location and  individual
choices over where to live and work. The strategic framework outlines some of the issues and priorities
that the Council  must consider  and resource, the opportunities to align  the needs  of residents and
visitors and a model for partnership working to help realise the potential of Visitor Economy in Cheshire
East.
H.26 The outcome targets we  seek  to achieve  are:
Develop  a Visitor Economy with a  value  of £818m  by 2015;
Increase jobs  directly related to the Visitor Economy by  around  1,271 over  the same  period;
Increase visitor numbers  to Tatton to 1m  by 2015; and
Increase the number  of businesses  achieving  quality accreditation.
Connecting Cheshire
H.27 This initiative has  an objective to make  Cheshire, Halton and
Warrington one  of the best connected regions  in the Country in  terms of
CHESHIRE EAST LOCAL PLAN  Strategy 2010-2030 458
 Partners and Initiativesbroadband  and digital services, and  to ensure  businesses  and citizens have  the support and  skills
to exploit the benefits of faster services. The Connecting Cheshire  Partnership is  to deliver  increased
high speed  broadband  to a further 80,000 homes  and businesses  by 2015. The project is  focused
on achieving  the objectives of economic  growth and  enabling  communities through improved
connectivity and  infrastructure to create high  growth businesses  and  social  benefits, including
technology to enable  people  to remain  independent and  in their own  homes.
Ageing Well in Cheshire East Programme
H.28 The Ageing Well  in Cheshire  East Programme highlights that
Cheshire  East has  the fastest growing  ageing  population in  the North West;
and that by  2033  more  than 45%  of our  population will  be over  50 years  of
age. It aims  to make  Cheshire  East a  better place  to grow  old. If the programme  is successful then
Cheshire  East will  see a fundamental cultural and  organisational shift, so  that over  time:
Older people  will have  more  choice  and control, can  receive  the help  they need  and are valued
and respected within their communities.
Public, private and  voluntary sectors will  work  with communities to ensure  that services, facilities
and resources  are accessible  and able  to meet demand.
Services and  support will  be locally  based, cost-effective and  sustainable.
Cheshire Joint Municipal Waste  Management Strategy 2007-2020
H.29 This strategy sets out how  Cheshire's Local  Authorities intend to reduce, recycle, recover  and
dispose  of municipal  waste between 2007  and  2020. It was  prepared  by the Cheshire  Waste
Partnership (a  partnership between the former County Council  and six former District Councils  in
Cheshire  prior  to local  government reorganisation).  The strategy details measurable  objectives
divided  into key  themes: waste reduction and  re-use; recycling  and  composting; residual  waste
management; working  together; promoting and  delivering  the strategy; and  environmental protection
and compliance. A reviewed  Waste Strategy for Cheshire  East has  been  scheduled.
Cheshire Region Local Nature Partnership Vision
H.30 The vision  for this partnership, that includes  the five local  authority areas  of Wirral, Halton,
Warrington, Cheshire  West and  Chester and  Cheshire  East is  for healthy, connected, productive
landscape  richer  in biodiversity, where  the natural environment is  embedded  in decision  making,
managed  for wildlife, and  supports healthier lifestyles and  farming, creating attractive places  and
delivering  sustainable economic  growth.
Green Infrastructure Framework for North East Wales, Cheshire and the Wirral
H.31 This partnership of local  authorities and  environmental agencies  was formed in  2010. It has
a vision  of how  a healthy natural environment can  help  sustain economic  growth and  thriving
communities. The Crewe  Green Infrastructure Action Plan has  been  prepared  under  this Framework.
Rights of Way  Improvement Plan
H.32 The Rights of Way  Improvement Plan identifies:
the extent to which  the local  rights of way  network meets the present and  future needs  of the
public; 
the opportunities provided  by local  rights of way  for exercise  and other forms of open-air  recreation
and the enjoyment of the local  authority's area;
the accessibility of local rights of way for blind or partially sighted persons and others with mobility
problems; and
identification of potential actions to manage  and enhance  the local  rights of way  network.
