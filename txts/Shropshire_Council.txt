  2. Introduction  
2.1. The pursuit of sustainable development is at the heart of the planning 
process.  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) quotes the United 
Nations General Assembly in defining what this means at a strategic level:  
“meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet t heir own needs”  
2.2. The role of the Shropshire Local Plan is to translate this high -level objective 
into a meaningful and positive framework at the local level to inform decision 
making for the benefit of the County. This relates to both strategic issues, 
such as the amount of growth proposed and how it is distributed , and how the 
County moves towards a net zero carbon economy ; through to  more detailed 
issues , such as the design and layout of new development  and how 
environmental assets are to be protected .     
2.3. Achieving sustainable development will mean that decision takers must look 
at all facets of sustainability in arriving at decisions : economic, social and 
environmental.  In all cases a balance of considerations is needed, and it is 
accepted this will often lead to a variety of opinions being expressed. This 
includes the need for growth in meeting the future housing and employment 
needs of communities in the long -term. All this should be done in collaboration 
with a range of stakeholders from local comm unities, Parish and Town 
Councils, infrastructure providers, statutory organisations, local businesses, 
landowners and developers amongst others.  The Shropshire Local Plan is for 
the long -term, covering a 22 -year period from 2016 to 2038.  
  
Shropshire’s C haracter  
2.4. The Shropshire Local Plan covers the administrative area of Shropshire 
Council; a large and diverse County, predominantly rural in nature, covering 
around 320,000 hectares, 98% of which is classified as rural. The County is 
situated in the far we stern corner of the West Midlands Region on the border 
with Wales and has close relationships and strong sub -regional ties with 
Herefordshire and Telford and Wrekin, highlighted by the fact these areas 
together form the Marches Local Economic Partnership ( LEP) area.  
2.5. Shropshire1 has an estimated population of around 323,000 people , living in 
around 138,000 households . Shropshire contains a diverse range of 
settlements, each with its own character and identity. Shrewsbury, the County 
Town and Strategic Centre of Shropshire is the largest  settlement , with an 
estimated population of around 75,000. The Principal Centres of Bridgnorth, 
Ludlow, Market Drayton, Oswestry and Whitchurch each have a population of 
more than 10,000. The remaining urban se ttlements consist of the Key 
Centres of Albrighton, Bishop’s Castle, Broseley, Church Stretton, Cleobury 
Mortimer, Craven Arms, Ellesmere, Highley, Much Wenlock, Shifnal and 
Wem. Within the rural areas there are hundreds of  small villages, hamlets and 
isolated dwellings . 
2.6. Around 65% of those living in Shropshire are  within the Strategic, Principal 
and Key Centres, whilst the other 35% live in the rural area . Shropshire has a 
                                            
1All references to Shropshire within this document exclude the Telford and Wrekin Council area . Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 7 
  population density of 1.0 0 person per hectare compared to 4.24 for England, 
3.87 for England and Wales and 4.46 for the West Midlands.  
2.7. The divergence between Shropshire and England’s population age is evident, 
with Shropshire having a much greater proportion of people in all age gr oups 
above 50 years. In contrast England has a substantially higher proportion of 
population in all the younger age groups.  
2.8. In 2018, there were 15,710 enterprises in Shropshire, which were represented 
by 17,865 local VAT or PAYE registered units. Since 20 11, when the number 
of enterprises dipped by 165 ( -1.2%), growth has been sustained in each 
year, with 1,570 additional enterprises operating in 2018 than there were in 
2010. This represents growth of 11.1% over the eight year period.  
2.9. The richness of Shrop shire’s historic environment is reflected in the number of 
designated heritage assets. There are 6,913 listed buildings, 441 Scheduled 
Ancient Monuments, 34 Registered Historic Parks and Gardens (including 3 
which are cross -border) and a Registered Histori c Battlefield. The wider value 
of historic landscapes and townscapes is recognised through the designation 
of 127 Conservation Areas in Shropshire, together with the wealth of non -
statutory undesignated heritage assets (c 35,000) recorded on the Historic 
Environment Record.  
2.10.  The great diversity of underlying rock types means that Shropshire possesses 
one of the richest and most varied landscapes in England , as evidenced by 
the 300 or so regionally important geological sites (RIGs) . The countryside 
ranges fro m the gently undulating landscape in the north through the low -lying 
fertile valleys of the meandering River Severn and its tributaries to the distinct 
hills and open, windswept moorlands of the south.  
2.11.  Around 23% of Shropshire forms part of the Shropshire  Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB ). National Nature Reserves (NNRs), Sites 
of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and non -statutory Wildlife Sites together 
cover approximately 6% of the land area. Approximately 7% of the land area 
of Shropshi re is covered by woodland which includes a higher than average 
proportion of ancient woodland.  
2.12.  The County has a road network with approximately 5,100km of carriageway 
and is easily accessible by road (including the A5/M54 motorway). Shropshire 
has a high level of car ownership, with 84.2% of households having access to 
at least one car or van. Shrewsbury acts as a rail hub with easy access to 
Wales, Cheshire, the West Midlands, and London and beyond. There are 1 5 
other  railway stations across Shropshire and an extensive bus network which 
together aim to provide accessible public transport to residents and visitors.  
2.13.  Because of the County’s size, the Local Plan uses a series of smaller Place 
Plan Areas, normally consisting of a main Market Town and its surrounding 
hinterland. These Place Plan geographies are well established and represent 
areas with functional relationships with each other  and as such  have been 
used to capture the infrastructure needs of Shropshire  in a manageable way.  
For the purposes of the Shropshire Local Plan they are used to present a 
series of localised strategies, although they in themselves have no planning 
status.  
  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 8 
  National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  
2.14.  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was first published by th e 
Government in March 2012 and has had several iterations since, most 
recently in February 2019. The NPPF forms national planning policy, and 
whilst it is not part of the development plan, it is a significant material  
consideration in decision -taking and p lan-making.  The NPPF is supported by 
a range of National Planning P ractice  Guidance (NPPG) notes.   
2.15.  The importance of a plan -led system is a central feature of the NPPF. This 
key principle is supported by the ‘presumption in favour of sustainable 
developm ent’, which sets out that Local Plans should positively seek 
opportunities to meet the development needs of their area, and be sufficiently 
flexible to adapt to rapid change. Whilst the NPPF establishes a number of 
‘ground -rules’ to guide both decision mak ing and the preparation of Local 
Plans, such as the requirement to meet an area’s housing needs as a 
minimum requirement, it is for the Local Plan to distil this into an appropriate 
long-term strategy for the County  and to prepare policies to guide and 
manage development effectively.    
  
The S hropshire Local Plan 2016 to 2038  
2.16.  The current Development Plan in Shropshire consists of the Core Strategy 
(2011) ; the Site Allocations and Management of Development (SAMDev) Plan 
(2015) ; and any adopted formal Neighbourhood Plans . These documents 
provide a positive framework for managing development in the County  up to 
2026 and are currently considered to be up -to-date.  It is however a 
requirement for Council’s to review their development plans regularly and at 
least every five years.  
2.17.  Upon adoption the policies of the Shropshire Local Plan 2016  to 2038 will 
replace the policies of the Core Strategy and SAMDev Plan, except for the 
SAMDev site allocations which have yet to be delivered, which will be ‘saved’ 
and therefore continue to form part of the Development Plan.  The policies and 
proposals within adopted formal Neighbourhood Plans which conform with the 
Shropshire  Local Plan 2016 to 2038 will also continue to apply.  
2.18.  The NPPF states that from adoption, the strategic polices of the Local Plan 
should look ahead over a minimum of 15 years. It is anticipated that the Local 
Plan will be adopted in 2022, subject to indep endent examination, and it is 
therefore considered the plan meets this longevity requirement.    
2.19.  The Shropshire Local Plan seeks to provide a sustainable pattern of growth, 
responding to the varying scales, needs and functions of the County’s 
hierarchy of settlements. This means recognising the County’s diverse  
features and characteristics , including such factors as the Shropshire Hills 
AONB , the many designated  heritage  and natural environment asset s and the 
presence of  Green Belt, but also responding positively to a range of evidence 
which underpins many of the Local Plan’s policies.   
2.20.  The Shropshire Local Plan does not sit in isolation; it is supported by and has 
regard to a number of other strategies produced by the C ouncil and other 
bodies, including: The draft Housing Strategy 2020  to 2025; The draft Climate 
Change Strategy; the Economic Growth Strategy 2017  to 2021; the emerging 
Local Transport Plan; and AONB Management Plan. Where relevant , the 
policies of th is Local Plan specifically reference where these documents may Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 9 
  be considered  material in decision making. In addition , the Local Plan is 
supported by a robust evidence base , key evidence for each Policy in this 
Local Plan, is  identified in  Appendix 3:  of this document .  
2.21.  This Local  Plan seeks to respond effectively to these strategies and evidence, 
and in doing so should not be categorised as having any one overarching 
theme. Instead the Plan provides a broad basis for dealing with a number of 
challenges in a balanced and positive m anner, from the need to deliver 
affordable housing for local needs; the need to provide improved conditions 
for economic growth; the need to protect and enhance the County ’s wealth of 
natural and historic assets; and the need to respond to the climate chan ge 
emergency .  Where decisions on land allocations have been taken , they have 
been done so having regard to a full balance of considerations, with the aim of 
achieving sustainable development.  
2.22.  It is accepted that development can sometimes be a contentious issue. With 
this in mind , the preparation of the Shropshire Local Plan has not been a 
rushed process, and instead  the Council have sought to build consensus 
around shared local  priorities and proposals .   The Council began preparing 
the Local Plan review in 2017.  At the core of this process is continuous and 
meaningful community engagement , in line with the Council’s Statement of 
Community Involvement (SCI) .  To this end the Council has undertaken f ive 
consulta tion stages as part of the Regulation 18 stage of plan preparation:  
1. Issues and Strategic Options (January 2017 - March 2017 );  
2. Preferred Scale and Distribution of Development  (October 2017 - 
December 2017 );  
3. Preferred Site s (November 2018  - February 2019) ; 
4. Strategic Sites (July 2019  - September 2019) ; 
5. Regulation 18: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan  (August 
2020  – September 2020 ). 
2.23.  These documents, which are available on the Council’s website, each dealt 
with specific aspect s of the plan mak ing process and sought to provide the 
opportunity for communities and other stakeholders to make comments on 
emerging proposals. Notably there were :  
a. Around  400 unique respon dents  to the  8-week I ssues and Strategic 
Options  consultation;  
b. Around  600 unique respon dents  to the 8 -week Preferred Scale and 
Distribution of Development consultation;  
c. Around  3,600 unique respon dents  to the 12 -week Preferred Sites 
consultation;  
d. Around 2,300 unique respondents to the 10 -week  Strategic Sites 
consultation; and  
e. Around  2,500 unique respondents to the 8 -week Regulation 18: Pre -
Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan consultation.  
2.24.  Every comment made as part of the Regulation 18 stages undertaken have 
been considered in arriving at the Council’s Regulation 1 9: Pre -Submission 
Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan.   
2.25.  The Regulation 1 9: Pre-Submission Draft  of the Shropshire Local Plan 
identifies a vision and framework for the future development of Shropshire to 
2038, addressing such issues as the needs  and opportunities in relation to 
housing, the local economy, community facilities and infrastructure; and seeks Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 10 
  to safeguard the environment, enable adaptation to climate change and helps 
to secure high -quality and accessible design.  
2.26.  The Regulation 1 9: Pre-Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan is 
supported by a Sustainability Appraisal and Habitat Regulation Assessment.     
Cross Boundary Issues and the Duty  to Cooperate  
2.27.  Legislation requires Council’s preparing Local Plans to undertake a ‘duty to 
cooperate’, which makes it a legal requirement for Council’s and statutory 
bodies to work together on strategic cross -boundary issues.  In Shropshire’s 
case the County is adjoined by several Local Authority areas, and there are 
areas beyond this with a fun ctional relationship, most notably the Black 
Country.  Positive conversations with relevant bodies have been ongoing over 
the course of the preparation of the Plan, and ahead of the submission of the 
Plan for Examination a full set of Statements of Common Ground will be made 
available.  Where these cross -boundary discussion s have led to a direct 
impact upon the Plan this is outlined in the respective policy or explanatory 
text.     
 
Infrastructure  
2.28.  The availability of sufficient infrastructure underpins goo d plan making, and 
quite rightly is one of the issues which attracts comments at consultation. The 
Council have worked alongside infrastructure providers in preparing the Plan 
and these conversations are captured within the Infrastructure Plan which 
itself draws upon the conclusions of the County’s 18 Place Plans.  Where 
there is a known infrastructure constraint from otherwise sustainable 
development proposals, the individual settlement policies identify these 
needs.  
  
Neighbourhood Pl ans and Community Led  Plans  
2.29.  Adopted (or ‘made’) Neighbourhood Plans form part of the Development Plan 
for the area in which they cover, known as the Neighbourhood Area. In 
Shropshire, as of June 2020 there are currently three ‘made’ Neighbourhood 
Plans at Much Wenlock, Shifnal and Wo ore, with several others at various 
stages of preparation.  The Council has always taken a positive and proactive 
approach to Neighbourhood Plans and has sought to work constructively with 
local areas to advance their aspirations.    
2.30.  The Shropshire Local P lan works alongside the aspirations of Neighbourhood 
Plans where they share the same plan period. In the case s of Much Wenlock 
and Shifnal , both their Neighbourhood Plan s cover the period to 2026, in line 
with the SAMDev Plan, and therefore there is a need  for the Council to plan 
effectively for a further 12 years to the end of the new plan period to 2038. In 
these cases , the Shropshire Local Plan provides a development strategy for 
these areas.      
 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 11 
  Spatial Vision   
2.31.  The Vision for Shropshire in 2038 reflects the wide role of the Local Plan to 
promote all aspects of sustainable  development , and takes its lead from a 
range of other strategies it seeks to deliver.   
 
 
“In 2038 , communities will be safe and healthy as Shropsh ire moves 
positively towards a zero carbon economy; all residents will be able to 
access well -designed, decent and affordable homes in the right location; 
economic productiv ity will be maximised through greater investment; 
and the County’s historic and nat ural environmental assets will be 
protected and enhanced”.  
 
 
2.32.  Policy SP1 The Shropshire Test provides a high level ‘mission statement’ 
policy encompassing those important priorities the Council will require new 
development to address. The inclusion of this within p olicy ensures  sufficient 
weight is attached to the pursuit of these objectives.

  3. Strategic Policies  
 
SP1.  The Shropshire Test  
1. Development will contribute to meeting local needs and making its settlements more 
sustainable, providing the right mix of new housing, employment and other types of 
development  which :  
a. Supports the health, well -being and safety of communities;  
b. Supports cohesive communities;  
c. Addresses the causes and mitigates  the impacts of climate change;  
d. Conserves and enhances the high -quality natural environment and p rovides 
opportunities for green  and blue networks;  
e. Raises design standards and enhances the area’s character and historic 
environment;  
f. Makes efficient use of land; and  
g. Provides sufficient infrastructure, services, facilities, and where necessary provides 
opportunities for their enhancement . 
2. In addition, and where appropriate, proposals should seek to reflect relevant 
considerations of Shropshire Council’s other strategies, including its Com munity Led 
Plans, Local Economic Growth Strategies (including the Shrewsbury Big Town Plan), the 
Local Transport Plan, and the Public Health Strategy.  
 
Explanation  
3.1. The Shropshire Test is a ‘gatewa y’ policy and establishes those issues 
considered of most i mporta nce in  supporting Shropshire grow th to occur  in a 
sustainable manner. The origins of this policy la y in Shrewsbury’s Big Town 
Plan, adopted by the Council in 2018, which established the concept of a 
Shrewsbury Test to guide and manage development wit hin the town.  Whilst 
Policy S16 of the Local Plan  provides an effective strategy for Shrewsbury , 
the concept of an overarching policy, or ‘test’ was nevertheless considered 
important in order to give a clear indication to future applicants of the high 
standards  the Council will seek to apply  in managing development .    
3.2. The issues identified in this policy are not placed in order of priority, and it is 
recognised proposals will inevitably  vary in how far they can accommodate 
each issue  within their schem es. It is nevertheless considered appropriate for 
all proposals to have consideration to these strategic issues as a starting point 
with which to guide and influence the evolution of their development. The 
remaining strategic and development management pol icies of this Plan 
elaborate on the  issues . 
 
 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 13 
  SP2.  Strategic Approach  
1. Shropshire will flourish, accommodating investment and new development that 
contributes to meeting needs and making its settlements more sustainable. New 
development will be supported by necessary infrastructure and be of a high -quality 
which positively responds to its setting, local needs and our changing climate.  
2. Over the plan period from 2016 to 2038, around 30,800 new dwellings and around 300 
hectares of employment land wi ll be delivered. This equates to around 1,400 dwellings 
and around 14ha of employment land per annum. This Local Plan ensures that sufficient 
land in the right locations  is available to achieve these growth aspirations, however the 
availability of land wil l be kept under review to ensure a continuous supply of suitable 
sites is available.  
3. Delivery of affordable housing remains a key priority in Shropshire, as such around 
7,700 affordable dwellings (equating to around 25% of the total housing requirement) 
will be delivered during the plan period from 2016 to 2038.  
4. Main town centre uses will be focused into the diverse network of town centres and 
recognisable  high streets across Shropshire. It will complement the ir scale and 
character and support appropriate d iversification.  
5. To achieve a sustainable and appropriate  pattern of development which also maximises 
investment opportunities, new development will be focused in the urban areas identified 
in Schedule SP2.1. Specifically:  
a. Shrewsbury will bloom, fulfilling its role as a strategic centre and acting as a focus 
for well-designed new housing and employment development. This will be supported 
by the provision of supporting infrastructure, high-quality retail , leisure , transport and 
other public realm improvements  within and on the edge of the town centre  in 
support of the delivery of the Big Town Plan and its related  masterplans.   
b. Principal and Key Centres will accommodate significant well -designed new housing 
and employment development, supported by necessary infrastructure. Growth within 
these diverse settlements will maintain and enhance their roles, support key 
services and facilities and maximise their economic potential.  
c. Strategic Settlements will form successful, well -designed and sustainable 
communities, delivering new housing and employment deve lopment. They will 
provide an appropriate mix of housing, employment, local services and facilities and 
infrastructure.  
d. RAF Cosford Strategic Site will form a centre of excellence for aviation and 
engineering, meet military personnel accommodation needs an d support the 
aspirations of the Ministry of Defence, the RAF Museum and the Midlands Air 
Ambulance Charity.  
6. Recognising the rurality of much of Shropshire and the importance of ensuring the long -
term sustainability of rural communities, growth in urban a reas will be complemented by 
appropriate new development within Community Hubs, identified in Schedule SP2.2, 
which are  considered significant rural service centres; and to a lesser extent Community 
Clusters, identified in Schedule SP2.3, which consist of settlements with aspirations to 
maintain  or enhance their sustainability. Outside these settlements, new development in 
the wider rural area will consist of affordable housing where there is evidenced  local 
needs and appropriate rural employment and economic diversification.  
7. The production of formal Neighbourhood Plans will be supported and can identify 
development opportunities which will complement proposals in this Local Plan. Where 
appropriate they  can also identify additional Community Clusters.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 14

  Explanation  
3.3. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out Government’s 
planning policies for England and how these should be applied. With regard to 
housing need, the NPPF states that “to determine the minimum number of 
homes needed, strategic policies should  be informed by a local housing need 
assessment, conducted using the standard method in national planning 
guidance – unless exceptional circumstances justify an alternative approach 
which also reflects current and future demographic trends and market signa ls. 
In addition to the local housing need figure, any needs that cannot be met 
within neighbouring areas should also be taken into account in establishing 
the amount of housing to be planned for”2. 
3.4. The National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) provides de tails of the 
Standard Method for assessing Local Housing Need (LHN).  
3.5. Shropshire  Council has undertaken an assessment of the LHN using 
Government’s Standard Methodology, which indicates a housing need of some 
25,894 dwellings over the plan period from 2016 to 2038, as at April 2020.  
3.6. The housing requirement for Shropshire of around 30,800 dwellings o ver the 
plan period from 2016 to 2038 will meet housing need and support the long -
term sustainability of the County. It also provides some flexibility to respond to 
changes to LHN over the plan period and an opportunity to:  
a. Respond positively to specific sustainable  development opportunities;  
b. Increase the delivery of family and affordable housing to meet the needs of 
local communities and support new families com ing into Shropshire;  
c. Support the delivery of specialist housing for older people , people with 
disabilities  and the needs of other groups within the community;  
d. Support the diversification of our labour force; and  
e. Support wider aspirations, including increased economic growth and 
productivity.  
3.7. Effective and on -going joint working between strategic policy -making 
authoritie s is an important part of plan -making and delivered through  the Duty 
to Cooperate. With this in mind, and further to discus sions with the Black 
County Authorities  as part of their ongoing plan making process , Shropshire ’s 
housing requirement  of around 30,800 dwellings  incorporate s 1,500 dwellings 
to support the housing needs of the emerging Black Country  Plan, where  
evidence indicates housing delivery opportunities are constrained . This 
reflects a positive approach to cross boundary cooperation and responds to  
the functional relationshi p between the two area s. This cross -boundary 
housing need will be accommodated thr ough the distribution of growth 
outlined in this policy  and delivered through  policies S1-S21 of this Local Plan .      
3.8. The housing requirement for the plan period equates to around 1,400 
dwellings per annum. The types of site available to achieve the housing 
requirement in Shropshire are varied  and extensive. They include small, 
medium and large:  
a. Sites with planning permis sion or prior approval;  
b. Sites with a ‘ resolution to grant’ planning permission;  
c. Saved SAMDev Plan allocations;  
d. Local Plan allocations; and  
e. Windfall opportunities, where sites comply with the requirements of this 
Local Plan.  
                                            
2 MHCLG, (2019), The NPPF – Paragraph 60  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 18 
  3.9. The range of this supply is unsu rprising given the diverse nature of Shropshire 
which includes a network of Strategic, Principal and Key Centres and an 
extensive rural hinterland containing hundreds of small rural villages, hamlets 
and numerous dispersed dwellings.  
3.10.  Having reflected  on the various components of the housing land supply and 
best available information regarding likely timescales for their delivery, past 
rates of delivery, past trends within the market, known factors which may 
influence the housing market and housing  delivery  rates in the short to 
medium term and the myriad of other factors which are unknown and may 
influence the housing market and housing delivery rates in the short, medium 
and long -term, the expected rate of housing delivery over the Local Plan 
period is around 1,400 dwelling per annum, which is consistent with the 
annual housing requirement.  Whilst it is acknowledged that there will 
inevitably be fluctuations over time, which may result in annual rates of 
delivery falling below or exceeding this level, it  is expected that this will 
‘balance out’ to ensure that the housing requirement is achieved.  
3.11.  As such it is considered that this expected rate of delivery over the Local Plan 
period of around 1,400 dwellings per annum forms the most robust trajectory 
of future housing deliver y in Shropshire and will be used to assess 
annual housing delivery.  
3.12.  This is considered a reasonable and precautionary approach to preparing a 
housing trajectory. This trajectory of future housing delivery will be kept up to 
date and a  revised version published each financial year within Shropshire 
Council’s Authorit y Monitoring Report (AMR).  
3.13.  This AMR will be informed by an annual assessment of the five -year housing 
land supply, a requirement of national policy. The annual assessment of  the 
five-year housing land supply will also highlight any issues with the supply or 
delivery of new dwellings, and whether  there is a need to respond through 
such measures as preparation of a Housing Delivery Action Plan or Local 
Plan Review.  
3.14.  Appendix 5 o f the Local Plan provides information on the residential 
completions achieved since the start of the Local Plan period and the various 
commitments (including allocations) available, which will contribute towards 
achieving the identified housing requirement . 
3.15.  The provision of affordable housing is a local priority and the demand for such 
accommodation is well evidenced. For instance, there are in excess of 5,000  
households on the Councils Choice based housing register who are looking 
for homes.  Furthermore, t he Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 
(2020) for Shropshire conclude d that during the Local Plan period from 2016 
to 2038 an estimated 799 households per year will require affordable housing.  
3.16.  The Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire (2017 -2021) sets out 
Shropshire Council’s commitment and ambition to grow the local economy of 
the County. The Strategy identifies a vision for Shropshire “To be the best 
place to do business and invest, renowned for its pool of local talent and 
expertise. We will str ive to maximise our economic potential and increase 
productivity by fully utilising the benefits of our special environment and high 
quality assets”3. 
3.17.  To achieve the aspirations in the Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire, it 
is important to encourage appropriately located and high -quality new 
                                            
3 Shropshire Council, (2017), Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire 2017 – 2021  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 19 
  employment development which contributes to making Shropshire more 
productive, prosperous and sustainable. Th e employment requirement for 
Shropshire of around 300ha of employment land o ver the plan period from 
2016 to 2038 seeks to implement  the aspirations of the Economic Growth 
Strategy for Shropshire and provide  a sufficient scale of employment land to 
deliver  enough jobs to achieve a sustainable balance with the housing 
requirement.  
3.18.  As already stated, effective and on -going joint working between strategic 
policy -making authorities is an important part of plan -making and delivered 
through the Duty to Cooperate . With this in mind, and further to discussions 
with the Black County Authorities as part of their ongoing plan making 
process, Shropshire’s employment requirement of around 300ha of 
employment land incorporates up to 30ha of employment land to support the  
employment needs of the emerging Black Country Plan, where evidence 
indicates employment delivery opportunities are constrained. This again 
reflects a positive approach to cross boundary cooperation and responds to 
the functional relationship between the two areas. This cross -boundary 
employment land need will be accommodated through the distribution of 
growth outlined in this policy and delivered through policies S1 -S21 of this 
Local Plan.      
3.19.  A sufficient supply of employment land , focused within the ur ban areas,  has 
been provided to enable choice and competition within the market and to also 
recognise the diverse needs of different employers, particularly within the 
Strategic and Principal Centres of Shropshire.  The urban areas will also 
perform their e conomic roles in support of the employment needs of 
settlements and communities in the rural areas of the County.  
3.20.  The employment land requirement for the plan period equates to around 
14ha of employment land per annum. This annualised requirement forms 
the basis for assessing annual employment land delivery.  The supply and 
delivery of employment land will be monitored within the AMR.  
3.21.  Appendix 6 of the Local Plan provides information on the employment 
completions achieved since the start of the Local Plan pe riod and the various 
commitments (including allocations) available, which will contribute towards 
achieving the identified employment land requirement.  
3.22.  The strategic approach is to accommodate development in such a way that 
helps make more sustainable, balanced, vibrant, resilient and self -reliant 
places in which to live and work.  
3.23.  It represents a sustainable pattern of growth, directing the majority of n ew 
development towards the larger settlements with the most extensive range of 
services, facilities and infrastructure to support new development. These 
settlements are identified in Schedule SP2.1.  
3.24.  However, it also allows for appropriate levels of develop ment within rural 
areas, to support the longer -term sustainability of rural communities. 
Community Hubs which are  considered significant rural service centres and 
Community Clusters which consist of settlements with aspirations to enhance 
their sustainabil ity, are the focus for rural development. These settlements are 
identified within Schedules SP2.2 and SP2.3 respectively.  
3.25.  This will be complemented by affordable housing provision for evidenced  local 
needs and appropriate rural employment and economic dive rsification in the 
wider rural area.   Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 20 
  3.26.  Figure SP2. 1 shows the location of the Strategic, Principal and Key Centres, 
the Strategic Settlements, the Strategic Site, Community Hubs and 
Community Clusters.  
Figure SP2.1: Map of Shropshire  
 
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 21 
  3.27.  The strategic approach reflects the distinctive, rural nature of Shropshire and 
the connection between the Strategic Centre of Shrewsbury, the Principal and 
Key Centres, smaller Community Hub and Community Cluster settlements 
and the rural areas they serve. It  is an approach that seeks to nurture, protect 
and develop the social and physical fabric of communities, supporting new 
economic potential within their environmental settings.  
3.28.  The strategic approach also responds directly to the Economic Growth 
Strategy f or Shropshire (2017 -2021) and specifically reflects the objective to 
prioritise investment in strategic locations and growth zones along strategic 
corridors utilising existing road and rail connections. The strategic corridors 
are: 
a. Eastern Belt M54/A5/A41/A464/A5 and A454/A458 , supporting 
Shropshire’s links to the West Midlands region and the role of the West 
Midlands Combined Authority, including opportunities around Bridgnorth 
as a Principal Centre within the context of the ongoing Green Belt R eview;  
b. A5 West corridor , including the Principal centre of Oswestry as 
Shropshire’s second largest market town;  
c. Central Shropshire , focussed primarily on opportunities in Shrewsbury 
as the County Town and Strategic Centre;  
d. North East Shropshire and the A41 corridor ; including Whitchurch and 
Market Drayton, and also supporting opportunities connected to the 
delivery of HS2 in the second half of the Plan period; and  
e. A49 corridor, including settlements along the corridor especially 
opportunities around Lud low as the key historic, market town.

  SP3.  Climate Change  
Development in Shropshire will support the transition to a zero -carbon economy in 
accordance with the policies of the Local Plan by: 
1. Reducing carbon emissions through a number of means, including:  
a. Minimising the need to travel and maximising the ability to make trips by sustainable 
modes of transport , including through the urban approach to development identified 
within Policy SP2; 
b. Supporting the principle of delivering higher density development on the most 
accessible urban sites;  
c. Supporting the transition to a circular economy by reducing waste and maximising the 
re-use and recycling of material resources;  
d. Prioritising use of active travel through the creation and enhancement of walking and 
cycling links within and between new developments and from new developments to 
existing neighbourhoods and community facilities  in accordance with Policy DP28 ;  
e. Encouraging new developmen t to link to and where possible integrate public 
transport;  
f. Wherever possible, enabling integrati on of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in to 
new development , in line with the requirements of DP11 ; and 
g. Promoting fabric energy  efficiency , including  as part of the retrofitting of existing 
buildings .

energy, including by:  
a. Integrating renewable and low carbon energy systems into all residential 
developments of one or more dwellings  in line with the requirements of DP11 ;  
b. Promoting the productive use of renewable and low carbon energy sources in 
business in line with the objectives of SP12 . 
c. Supporting the development or extension of district heating  and cooling  networks; 
and  
d. Supporting the development of community energy generation and distribution 
schemes , where they meet the policy requirements of the Local Plan and any 
relevant national policy.    
3. Maximising  carbon sequestration , including by:  
a. Encouraging development to offset its carbon emissions through investment in 
carbon capture and storage , informed  by the Shropshire Climate Change Strategy;  
b. Seeking opportunities to restore wetlands; and  
c. Significantly increasing the number of hedgerows, trees and extent of woodland in 
accordance with the Shropshire Tree and Woodland Strategy.

 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 23 
  Explanation  
3.29.  The Climate Change Act (2008 ) introduced a legally binding target for the UK 
to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 
levels. The target  was changed in June 2019 to ‘net zero carbon emissions by 
2050 ’ by The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment ) Order  
2019.  This is a very challenging target, and the planning system will need to 
play a full role in its achievement. The widespread and potentially devastating 
impacts of climate change place a responsibility on us all to minimise our 
carbon emission s, and this must be seen as an essential component of all 
development. As well as taking actions to reduce emissions, it will also be 
important to maximise natural processes that can take carbon out of the 
atmosphere and lock it into features such as peat and trees, known as ‘carbon 
sequestration . 
3.30.  Total greenhouse gas emissions in Shropshire were 1.76 million tonnes CO2e 
in 2017. The sectors  making the biggest contributions were: business energy 
use (39%); road transport (33%); and domestic energy use (26%) . However, 
even with concerted action, current levels of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere will lead to changes in the climate, such as increased average 
global temperatures, more extreme weather events and heightened flood risk. 
It will therefore be vita l to the long -term sustainability of Shropshire, and the 
health, safety and quality of life of its communities, that the County is able to 
adapt to changes in the climate.  
3.31.  On 19th December 2019, Shropshire Council approved a Climate Change 
Strategy Framew ork which identifies the risks posed by the current climate 
crisis to Shropshire and establishes an overall goal of making Shropshire 
Council net greenhouse gas neutral by 2030 . The document also identifies a 
set of clear objectives and principles to guide future corporate actions and a 
number of key themes where both direct and indirect interventions to reduce 
Shropshire’s carbon footprint and improve its resilience to the clim ate crisis 
will have the greatest effect, including : 
a. Demand management : ‘Hard’ measures (physical or technology changes) 
to reduce the consumption of energy and water and waste production and 
‘Soft’ measures such as staff training and optimising control sy stems;  
b. Transport and travel:  Measures which reduce the need or impact of travel 
such as the planned distribution of future growth and staff flexible and agile 
working policies. Support for active travel and invest in infrastructure which 
enables the rapid take up of electric and ultra -low emission vehicles;  
c. Renewable energy generation and storage:  The development of solar 
arrays, wind turbines, hydro -electric power, battery or heat storage 
solutions and heat networks to help meet business and community ener gy 
needs;  
d. Sustainable land management:  Supporting the delivery of multiple 
benefits including carbon sequestration , reduced flood and drought risk, 
wildlife gains, positive impacts on human health and wellbeing and 
adaptation measures to mitigate risks fro m extreme climate events;  
e. Clean and inclusive growth:  Support skills investment and business 
growth which accelerates Shropshire’s transition to a low carbon economy 
and investment in low carbon infrastructure;  and 
f. Adaptation and resilience: Further change s to the climate are now 
inevitable, and the frequency of extreme weather is likely to increase. Both Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 24 
  physical infrastructure and skills training will require investment to allow our 
services, businesses and communities to adapt and become more resilient 
in the face these changes .

  SP4.  Sustainable Development  
1. Shropshire Council takes a positive approach to considering development proposals, 
reflecting the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Where appropriate, Shropshire Council 
will work p roactively with applicants to jointly find solutions which mean that proposals 
can be approved wherever possible.  
2. Planning law requires planning applications to be determined in accordance with the 
development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Planning 
applications that accord with the policies in the development plan (including, where 
relevant, with policies in Neighbourhood Plans) will be approved without delay, unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise. Proposed development  that conflicts with the 
development plan will be refused, unless other material considerations indicate 
otherwise.  
3. Where there are no policies relevant to a planning application or the policies which are 
most important to determining the application are out of date at the time of making the 
decision, then planning permission will be granted unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise – taking into account whether:  
a. The application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas or assets of particular 
importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or  
b. Any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the 
benefits, whe n assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole . 
 
Explanation  
3.32.  Government has placed a presumption in favour of sustainable development 
at the heart of its approach to planning, this presumption is articulated in the 
National Planning Policy F ramework (NPPF) (2019).  
3.33.  This policy aims to ensure that decisions in Shropshire are taken in line with 
this presumption. It will also help to achieve the core objectives of this Local 
Plan.

  SP5.  High -Quality Design  
1. New development will deliver high quality design by ensuring the creation of better 
places in which to live and work, improving sustainability, supporting active and healthy  
lifestyles and ensuring individual and community well -being.  
2. Development  must maintain and enhance the character, appearance and historic 
interests of settlements, streetscenes, groups of buildings, individual buildings and the 
landscape and, reinforce the hierarchy of networks and spaces in accordance with 
national planning p olicy and the design principles set out in the West Midlands Design 
Charter.  
3. Planning applications will set out how these principles have been considered in 
proportion to and taking into account the scale and type of development, with an 
emphasis on design  quality and consideration of the context, place and local 
distinctiveness, to ensure the following:  
a. Design and layout positively respond s to our changing climate  by taking opportunities 
to maximise energy efficiency  (including maximising opportunities for  solar gain) , 
minimise carbon emissions and make efficient use of water, in accordance with 
relevant policies of this Local Plan ; 
b. Building design and features relating to locally distinctive development, and reinstate 
local distinctiveness where it has bee n eroded, or represent an innovative design that 
will positively contribute to the character, appearance and local identity of an area;  
c. Building scale, proportion, massing and formality responding to the neighbouring and 
surrounding properties and reinforc es road hierarchy;  
d. Elevations responding to their surroundings and position within the road hierarchy 
through levels of enrichment (including decorative details such as projecting gables, 
roof articulation, cill and lintel details, plinths and render bandi ng), balance and 
proportion, and uniformity/irregularity;  
e. Fenestration that is appropriate, in terms of size, proportion and arrangement, to the 
architectural design of the building and responds to local context and identity;  
f. Extensions to existing dwellin gs (and other buildings) being  appropriately sited and 
proportionate in scale to the existing structure with roof lines that do not exceed the 
height of the original building, utilising consistent or complementary materials, finishes 
and fenestration, and ensuring that they are not overbearing or have an adverse 
impact on the design, amenity, light and privacy of any neighbouring property;  
g. Consistency in the quality of design and use of the type and standard of materials 
across a development, where there ar e different elements to the scheme, e.g. in 
developments of mixed affordable and market housing ensuring that these are 
visually indistinguishable from each other in design and quality, whilst allowing for 
buildings to be individual and have character in a ccordance with Policy  DP3 
Affordable Housing Provision;  
h. Features that could erode from good design, such as external services, vents, plant, 
antennae, meter housing, expansion joints, pipework and render beads being ou t of 
public view or are designed to complement the building;  
i. The health and well -being of neighbours and the other nearby residential, occupiers, 
business and visitors;  
j. Principal entrances being  located where they benefit from natural surveillance, and 
are easily identifiable from the public realm.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 27 
  k. Sensitive siting that responds to local identity, whether urban or rural, and the 
relationship between existing buildings in the streetscene or landscape, including 
views and vistas, whilst making efficient and e ffective use of land and topography;  
l. Relating the design, scale and materials of the building to its function and location 
within the network or space hierarchy;  
m. Using materials, and applying them in a way, that reflects those that reinforce local 
character, such as stone, render, cob, brickwork, slate and thatch, which are applied 
in a way that references local character or used with innovation;  and 
n. Reinforcing aspects that make a positive contribution to an area’s character and 
locally distinctive  identity . 
4. The level of information to be submitted with a planning application should reflect and  be 
proportionate to the type, size and complexity of the development, and include the 
necessary relevant supporting information and assessments.  
5. Permission w ill be refused for development of poor design and that fails to take the 
opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area, the way it 
functions where it would adversely affect the well -being of others and where inadequate 
informat ion has been submitted to demonstrate how new development will ensure the 
quality of design.  
 
Explanation  
3.34.  Shropshire Council will seek to ensure the delivery of high -quality design in all 
new development . This will:  
a. Ensure  the creation of  better places ; 
b. Promote  individual and community well -being ; and 
c. Promote healthy and active lifestyles  
d. Enhance  the way places are enjoy ed and experience d by those who  live, 
work or visit. 
3.35.  The Council  is especially concerned to ensure that new development 
maintains  and enhances the character, appearance and historic interests of 
the County’s settlements  and countryside, including its distinctive landscape in 
accordance with national planning policy and in particular the design 
principles set out in the West Midlands  Design Charter.  
3.36.  The West Midlands Design Charter is not intended to set local design policies 
but seeks to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the West 
Midlands’ place -making expectations , create a level playing field for 
developers across th e region, to define ‘good design quality’ and indicate  what 
is expected from developers when planning applications are submitted.  
3.37.  The Design Charter consists of 12 principles based around the six themes of: 
Character, Connectivity and Mobility, Future -Read iness, Health and 
Wellbeing, Engagement and Stewardship and Delivery.  
3.38.  Community -led plans can also provide  information on locally distinctive d esign 
factors , which should be considered in the context of this Policy.    
3.39.  The level of information to be submitted with planning applications should 
reflect and be proportionate to the type, size and complexity of the 
development, and should include the necessary relevant supporting 
information and assessments.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 28 
  3.40.  All planning ap plications for new development should set out how they 
comply with Policy SP5, the principles of the West Midlands Design 
Charter and comply how they comply with the design requirements of 
the other policies contained in this Local Plan.   
3.41.  Where development  proposals are located within the Shropshire Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), Policy DP24  which addresses  the need 
to achieve highest quality design which respects the natural beauty and built 
heritage of the Shropshire Hills AONB; enhances the sense of place and local 
character; and enables better management of wildlife sites, heritage assets or 
the wider countryside also applies . 
3.42.  Permission will be refused for development of poor design and that fails to 
take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an 
area, the way it functions, where it would adversely affect the sense of place, 
the well -being of oth ers and where inadequate information has been 
submitted to demonstrate how new development will ensure the quality of 
design.

  SP6.  Health and Wellbeing  
New development should ensure the health and well -being of individuals, 
communities and places. This will be achieved by ensuring the quality of life and 
delivery of community well -being, through the use of land ; type of development ; 
the safeguarding, maintenance and improvement of community facilities and 
services ; and by ensuring that the form, design, location and layout of new 
development enhances community wellbeing. Development proposals should:  
1. Ensure a high -quality of living a nd working environment through good design 
and environmental quality . This  includ es good location and access ; 
relationship with the existing built, historic and natural environment ; and 
contributing to a sense of place and identity, in accordance with Poli cy SP5  
(High Quality Design ). 
2. Where it involves provision of housing , ensure they are  of an appropriate type 
and size ; are in the right location ; and are built to appropriate internal and 
external space standards,  including the provision of appropriate levels of 
private and public open space , in accordance with Policies DP1 (Residential 
Mix) and DP15  (Open Space ). 
3. Ensure that new housing is well located to employment opportunities, 
community services and facilities and transport connections, links and routes.  
6. Consider  the ‘10 principles of active design ’ set out in Sport England and 
Public Health England’s Active Design guidance.  
7. Promote safe and well -lit high -quality walking and cycling routes, cycle 
parking, changing facilities and secure lockers in destinations suc h as places 
of work, to increase people’s activity rates. Wherever possible, new 
development should be located within walking distance of open space - to 
increase people’s quality of life and enable active and healthy lifestyles.  
4. Be adaptable - creating hi gh quality development which is capable of being 
modified either for different uses or to suit people with different needs; 
reducing the opportunity for crime - considering factors such as natural 
surveillance, boundaries and security features, lighting an d the management 
of public space to promote safe living environments:  
a. Being accessible and inclusive, ensuring that people of any age, gender, 
ethnicity and ability can use and access the development; and  
b. Having regard to the Police Secured by Design princ iples to reduce 
opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour.  
5. Creat e sustainable communities through the retention of existing and the 
provision of new community infrastructure that promotes healthy and active 
lifestyles . This is a priority and ensures  that people have the opportunity to 
exercise and improve their health by:  
a. Supporting the maintenance and delivery of health facilities to serve an 
expanded population, particularly in the growth areas of the Strategic 
Centre of Shrewsbury , Shropshire’s ne twork of Principal and Key Centres , 
Community Hubs and Community Clusters; and  
b. Protecting, retaining or enhancing sports, leisure, recreation and 
education facilities including children’s playgrounds in accordance with 
Policy DP15  or creating new facilities in accessible locations where an 
existing need can be justified (see also Policy DP15  for sport and Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 30 
  recreation facilities)  and without compromising the environmental quality 
of the area.  
6. Ensur e the health and well -being both of individuals and the community as a 
whole through:  
a. The retention and development of existing local services and community 
facilities, including local shops, meeting places, sports venues, open 
space, cultural buildings and facilities, public houses and places of 
worship, and guarding against and preventing the loss of valued facilities 
and services, especially in rural areas where this w ould reduce the 
community’s ability to meet its day -to-day needs;  
b. Ensuring access for all to high speed broadband networks to facilitate the 
delivery of fibre broadband services; and  
c. Having regard to the Shropshire Council’s Health and Well -Strategy.  
7. Ensur e access to healthy food by: 
a. Ensuring good access to appropriate food shops; and  
b. The need to promote healthy eating through taking into consideration the 
cumulative impact of A5 uses (hot food takeaways).  
8. Protect against exposure to pollution in line with policy DP18  by: 
a. Minimising exposure to airborne pollutants in the location and design of 
new development and securing the implementation of the Council’s Air 
Quality Action Plans, having regard to national and international 
obligations; and  
b. Safeguarding against the environmental impacts of new development in 
terms of community/public safety, noise, vibrations and odour and the 
legacy of contaminat ed land.  
9. Use D esign and Access Statements to set out how development proposals for 
all applications, other than householder and single dwellings, have taken 
health and well -being objectives into account, taking into account the other 
policies in this plan.  
10. Where it involves m ajor development proposals , be accompanied by a 
proportionate Health Impact Assessment detailing how they respond to the 
above contributors to health and well -being, including details of ongoing 
management or mitigation of issues where necessary.  
 
Explanation  
3.43.  The design and layout of where we live and work plays a vital role in keeping 
us healthy and active. Currently half of women and a third of men are not 
active enough and this costs the NHS around £7.4 billion a year. Decisions 
made through the planning sys tem often provide the opportunity to create the 
right environment to help people get more active, more often.  
3.44.  The quality not only of our community services and facilities but also of the 
built and natural environment, including the historic environment , are 
increasingly recognised for the critical role they play in the health and welfare, 
both of individuals and of our communities as a whole. The planning system 
has a vital role in ensuring health and well -being through our experiences of 
places in which we live , work and visit and development proposals may affect 
these experiences.   Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 31 
  3.45.  The level of information to be submitted with planning applications should 
reflect and be proportionate to the type, size and complexity of the 
development, and should includ e necessary relevant supporting information 
and assessments. Planning applications for new development should set how 
they comply with Policy SP6 and the health and well -being requirements of 
the other policies contained in this Plan. This includes appropriate 
consideration of Sport England and Public Health England guidance on the 
‘10 principles for active design’4, which identifies how to get more peo ple 
moving through suitable design and layout of development.  
3.46.  Permission will be refused for development proposals that would adversely 
affect or prejudice the health and well -being  of individuals, communities and 
places and should provide adequate safeguards, mitigation or the provision of 
alternatives services or facilities where it proposed that these would be close 
or moved . In the case of commercially operated services and facil ities, 
planning applications must be supported by detailed financial information to 
demonstrate that the continued operation of such services is no longer viable, 
that an alternative management and financial strategy would not work and that 
any on -going vi ability issues are not related to the personal circumstances of 
the applicant.

  SP7.  Managing Housing Development  
1. In addition to supporting the development of the housing on the allocations  set out in 
Policies S1-S20, there will be positive consideration of other sustainable housing 
development where this does not conflict with the Policies of the Local Plan.  
2. In particular, additional housing development opportunities which would support the 
reuse of disused land or premises within settlement development boundaries  as shown 
on the Policies Map ; or contribute towards achieving wider town centre regeneration will  
be supported.  
3. The residential development guidelines for settlements set out in Policies S1-S20 are a 
significant policy consideration. Where  housing proposals  which are otherwise compliant 
with the policies of th is Local Plan  would  lead to the residential development  guideline 
for a settlement  being exceed ed, having taken ac count  of the number of completions 
since the start of the plan period as well as and any outstanding commitments, including 
site allocations,  regard will be had to all of the following:  
a. The benefits arising from the proposal, aside from increasing housing supply;  
b. The likely delivery of the outstanding commitments;  
c. Any cumulative impacts arising from the development, especially on infrastructure 
provision; and 
d. The increase in the number of dwellings relative to the guideline . 
4. Additional market  housing  development outside the settlement development boundaries  
shown on the Policies Map  will be strictly controlled in line with Policy SP10 , and will 
only be considered potentially acceptable where there is cle ar evidence that the 
residential development  guideline for the settlement appears unlikely to be met  over the 
plan period , or where there are specific considerations set out in the Settlement Policies .    
 
Explanation  
3.47.  Delivery of the Shropshire wide housing requirement of around 30,800 
dwellings between 20 16 and 2038 is essential for the long -term prosperity of 
Shropshire. The  settlement  and strategic settlement  policies covered in 
Policies S1-S20 indicate how the residential  development guidelines  are to be 
met, through  combination s of Local Plan  alloca tions , ‘saved’ SAMDev Plan 
allocations, completions already achieved  since the start of the Local Plan  
period , existing commitments , appropriate windfall d evelopment, affordable 
and cross -subsi dy exception schemes, entry level and single plot exception 
schemes.   
3.48.  Both the NPPF and Policy SP4 of the Local P lan identify the need to apply the 
presumption in fa vour of sustainable development. This emphasises the 
statutory status of the development plan as the starting point for taking 
decisions.  The NPPF and NPPG also emphasise the importance of ensuring 
housi ng delivery, expressed through the Housing Delivery Test, as well as 
requiring that plans remain flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances.  
Policy SP7 is designed to address these issues in a positive manner, whilst 
retaining the importance of the plan -led approach to development.           
3.49.  The policy sets out the importance of the settlement residential development  
guidelines for the Shrewsbur y (as the Strategic Centre), Strategic 
Settlements, Principal Centres, Key Centres  and Community Hubs in relation Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 33 
  to managing the development of a settlement . The se guideline s have been 
subject to detailed consideration by the Council , infrastructure providers and 
the community. The guideline is not intended to represent a ceiling on 
development, but going beyond it by too great a degree could result in 
unsustainable development. Th e policy therefore sets out a clear set of 
considerations  which regard will be had to in determining planning 
applications which would result in the provision of more dwellings that the 
settlement ’s residential development  guideline.   
3.50.  Conversely, the poli cy also identifies the specific circumstances where 
consideration will be given to the grant of approval for market housing 
schemes beyond a defined development boundary. In doing so th e Policy is 
clear in the role  development boundaries play as a mechanis m to positively 
manage development. In assessing whether there is a risk to the delivery of a 
settlement’s residential development  guideline, it is considered there will 
normally need to be a demonstrable risk to delivery of a site allocation within 
the pl an period.   
3.51.  To ensure there are no unnecessary barriers to development, the Local Plan 
only seeks to apply phasing to site allocations where this is linked to a specific 
infrastructure constraint.  It is considered the phasing of development is likely 
to occur naturally, reflecting market conditions. Appendix 7 of the Local Plan 
provides information on expected delivery timescales for Local Plan  
allocations.

  SP8.  Managing Development in Community Hubs  
1. Community Hubs are considered significant rural service centres and the focus for 
development within the rural area. As such appropriate development will be permitted on 
allocated sites and other sustainable sites within the development boundary of 
Communi ty Hubs, as identified on the Policies Map, where it complies with all the 
following  considerations : 
a. It is of a scale, design and layout that is appropriate to the site and its surroundings, 
respects natural and heritage assets, safeguards residential amenity and is 
responsive to and in keeping with the character and identity of the settlement and its 
environs, consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
b. The design and layout of development positively responds to our changing clima te by 
taking opportunities to maximise energy efficiency (including maximising opportunities 
for solar gain), minimise carbon emissions and makes efficient use of water, in 
accordance with relevant policies of this Local Plan;  
c. It maintains the integrity of  strategically important gaps between settlements.  
d. There is sufficient infrastructure capacity to support the development, or any 
infrastructure capacity constraints can be addressed through the development, 
consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
e. Any residential development provides an appropriate mix of dwelling types, tenure 
and affordability in accordance with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
f. The granting of permission would not result in the settlement’s residential guideline 
being exceeded, taking into consideration completions since the start of the plan 
period and outstanding commitments (including site allocations). If  it does, regard will 
be given to policy requirements identified within Paragraph 3 of Policy SP7 and any 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
g. Cumulatively, any employment development and other non -residential development, 
in combination with comple tions since the start of the plan period and any outstanding 
commitments (including site allocations ), is considered appropriate and complements 
the size, character and identity of the settlement.  
h. All necessary supporting studies in relation to site constr aints, infrastructure and other 
development requirements specified by the policies in this Local Plan have been 
undertaken by a suitably qualified individual and the specified requirements can be 
provided and any identified adverse impacts satisfactorily m itigated through the 
development.  
i. It positively responds to design criteria and policies identified within relevant 
Neighbourhood Plans and Community Led Plans . 
2. Development proposals outside the development boundary of Community Hubs will be 
managed in acc ordance with Policy SP10  and any other relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
3. Community Hubs are identified within Schedule SP2.2 of Policy  SP2 of this Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
3.52.  The strategic approach to the distri bution of development  which underpins this 
Local Plan is one of urban focus, whereby the majority of development is 
focused into the urban areas identified within Schedule SP2.1 of Policy SP2 of 
this Local Plan.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 35 
  3.53.  However, recognising th e rurality of much of Shropshire and the importance of 
ensuring the long -term sustainability of rural communities, the strategic 
approach to the distribution of development also allows for  appropriate 
development  in rural areas.   
3.54.  Community Hubs have been id entified through a Settlement Hierarchy 
Assessment, which assessed settlement function through consideration of:  
a. The population and number of households within a settlement; and  
b. The extent to which the settlement provides services and facilities; high 
spee d broadband; employment opportunities; and public transport links.  
3.55.  The identified Community Hubs are considered significant rural service 
centres and as such are a focus for much of the  development considered 
appropriate within  the rural area.  
3.56.  The Communi ty Hubs in Shropshire are listed in Schedule SP2.2 of Policy 
SP2 of this Local Plan.  As illustrated in Figure SP2.1: Map of Shropshire 
within the Explanation  of Policy SP2, the Community Hubs  are widely 
distributed across Shropshire .SP2, the Community Hubs  are widely 
distributed across Shropshire . 
3.57.  This policy provides the starting point for assessing the appropriateness of 
development proposals within Community Hubs. However, it is important to 
emphasise that all relevant policies of this Local Plan will in form decisions on 
whether development proposals within Community Hubs are appropriate.  
3.58.  This policy recognises  that the Community Hubs are diverse . They range in 
size, offer differing levels and combinations  of facilities , have differing levels of 
constrai nts and opportunities  and have their own unique character and 
identi ty.  
3.59.  To further r ecognis e this diversity , each Community Hub has a development 
boundary, as identified on the Policies Map, and a residential development 
guideline, as identified within th e Settlement Policies  (S1-S18) of this Local 
Plan. These have been in formed by consideration of the characteristics of 
each Community Hub and provide greater certainty to local communities and 
the development industry.  Where appropriate within the Explanation of the 
Settlement Policies  (S1-S18), further information is provided about the specific 
circumstances, constraints or opportunities present within a Community Hub.  
3.60.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide s information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of each 
Community Hubs residential development guideline.  Appendix 7 of the Local 
Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the 
Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
3.61.  It is important to note that the residential development guidelines for 
Community Hubs are significant policy considerations, consiste nt with Policy 
SP7. This Policy also provides details of how the cumulative impact of non -
residential development is to be considered.  
3.62.  Outside the  development boundaries of Community Hubs,  new development 
will be managed in accordance with Policy SP10  and any other relevant 
policies of this Local Plan.

  SP9.  Managing Development in Community Clusters  
1. Community Clusters consist of individual or groups of small rural settlements of varying 
function but with aspirations to maintain or enhance their sustainability through modest 
levels of appropriate development.  
2. Residential development will be delivered:  
a. On saved SAMDev allocations;  
b. Through the conversion of existing buildings within or immediately adjoining the built 
form of the settlement; and  
c. On suitable small -scale infill sites of 0.1ha or less, which are clearly within and well 
related to the built form of the settlement, have permanent and substantial buildings 
on at least two sides and are for up to a maximum of 3 dwellings; and  
d. By afforda ble exception sites , cross -subsidy exception  sites and entry level exception 
sites meeting evidenced need and the other requirements of Local Plan Policies. 
3. Employment development which is of a type and scale appropriate to the settlement and 
other non -residential development that benefits the rural community by providing required 
community facilities and infrastructure will be supported where it can be achiev ed through 
the reuse of existing buildings or on suitable sites within or immediately adjoining the built 
form of the settlement and meets other requirements of Local Plan Policy.   
4. To be considered appropriate, development proposals within Community Clust ers must 
also comply with all of the following:  
a. Be of a scale, design and layout that is appropriate to the site and its surroundings, 
respects natural and heritage assets, safeguards residential amenity and is 
responsive to and in keeping with the charact er and identity of the settlement and its 
environs, consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
b. The design and layout of development positively responds to our changing climate by 
taking opportunities to maximise energy efficiency (including maxi mising opportunities 
for solar gain), minimise carbon emissions and makes efficient use of water, in 
accordance with relevant policies of this Local Plan;  
c. It maintains the integrity of strategically important gaps between settlements.  
d. There is sufficient infrastructure capacity to support the development, or any 
infrastructure capacity constraints can be addressed through the development, 
consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
e. Any residential development provides an appropriate mi x of dwelling types, tenure 
and affordability in accordance with relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
f. Cumulatively, any development, in combination with completions since the start of the 
plan period and any outstanding commitments (including site alloca tions ), is 
considered appropriate and complements the size, character and identity of the 
settlement.  
g. All necessary supporting studies in relation to site constraints, infrastructure and other 
development requirements specified by the policies in this Loca l Plan have been 
undertaken by a suitably qualified individual and the specified requirements can be 
provided and any identified adverse impacts satisfactorily mitigated through the 
development.  
h. It positively responds to design criteria and policies identi fied within relevant 
Neighbourhood Plans and Community Led Plans . Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 37 
  5. The rural area outside the immediate built form of the settlement and between 
Community Cluster settlements is considered countryside, as such development will 
managed in accordance with Pol icy SP10  and any other relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
6. Existing Community Clusters are identified within Schedule SP2.2 of Policy SP2. New 
Community Clusters can be brought forward by the community through the 
Neighbourhood Plan process and will be subject to this Policy and the other requirements 
of the Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
3.63.  The strategic approach to the distribution of development which underpins this 
Local Plan is one of urban focus, whereby the majority of development is 
focused into the urban areas identified within Schedule SP2.1 of Policy SP2 of 
this Local Plan.  
3.64.  However, r ecognising the rurality of much of Shropshire and the importance of 
ensuring the long -term sustainability of rural communities, the strategic 
approach to the distribution of development also allows for appropriate 
development in rural areas.  
3.65.  Community Clu sters consist of individual or groups of small rural settlements 
of varying function but with aspirations to maintain or enhance their 
sustainability through modest levels of appropriate development.   
3.66.  Community Clusters have been identified through a ‘bottom-up’ approach. 
Specifically, Shropshire Council has undertaken proactive engage ment  with 
Town and Parish Councils , as the elected representatives of communit ies, in 
order to understand the aspirations  of rural communities , which have not been 
identified as Community Hubs , over the Local Plan period . Where appropriate 
this engagement has been informed by the evidence base for this Local Plan 
and other relevant information  in order to allow an intelligent analysis of how 
comm unities function and can be improved.   
3.67.  Following th is engagement , where Town and Parish Councils have indicated 
aspirations for modest levels of appropriate development in a community , 
whether singly or as a part of a networked group of settlements, in ord er to 
maintain or enhance sustainability , Community Clusters  have been identified.  
3.68.  This approach  provides Town and Parish Councils as the elected 
representatives of communities, with an opportunity to appropriately consider 
and take ownership of decisions about meeting local needs, managing 
development and maintaining/enhancing sustainability within rural 
communities  which have not been identified as Community Hubs.  
3.69.  The current Community Clusters in Shropshire are listed in Schedule SP2.3 of 
Policy SP2 of this Local Plan. As illustrated in Figure SP2.1: Map of 
Shropshire within the Explanation  of Policy SP2, the current Community 
Clust er settlements are widely distributed across Shropshire .SP2, the current 
Community Cluster settlements are widely distributed across Shropshire . 
3.70.  Where appropriate within the Explanation of the Settlement Policies  (S1-S18), 
further information is provided about the specific circumstances, constraints or 
opportunities present within Community Clusters.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 38 
  3.71.  In recognition of the fact that the needs and as pirations of communities 
change over time, new communities can ‘opt -in’ as Community Clusters at a 
later time, through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
3.72.  This policy recognises the diversity of Community Clusters and the 
settlements within them. It provides t he starting point for assessing the 
appropriateness of development proposals within Community Cluster 
settlements. However, it is important to emphasise that all relevant policies of 
this Local Plan will inform decisions on whether development proposals wi thin 
Community Clusters  are appropriate.  
3.73.  In order to provide certainty to communities and the development industry , 
this policy includes clear definitions  of the types of residential and non -
residential development that are considered appropriate  within C ommunity 
Clusters . To prevent fragmented development, no other forms of development 
are considered appropriate within Community Clusters. It should also be 
noted that for planning purposes, the countryside between the settlements is 
not part of the Communi ty Cluster and development proposals in these 
locations will managed in accordance with Policy SP10  and any other relevant 
policies of this Local Plan.  
3.74.  The policy also provides details of how the cumulative impact of development 
are to be considered.

  SP10.  Managing Development in the Countryside  
1. The management of development in the countryside will reflect the Plan’s urban 
focused development strategy  which seeks to direct the majority of new development to 
the Strategic, Principal and Key Centres and new Strategic Settlements. Within the 
rural area, the Plan identifies Community Hubs and Community Clusters as the focus 
for new development, whilst also supporting new affordable housing provision for 
evidenced  local needs and fostering appropriate rural employment opportunities, 
subject to the further controls over development that apply to the Green Belt, the AONB 
and other designated areas . 
  
Economy & Community   
2. Employment, business , operational defence , renewable energy and community 
development in the countryside will be considered against national policy and the 
criteria in other relevant  policies of this Local Plan  which together recognise  the need 
for flexibility in delivering development to support and meet economic , community  and 
associated  needs whilst ensuring that development does not result in unacceptable 
adverse impacts.  
3. Sustainable employment, tourism, leisure, other business and community development 
proposals in the countryside will be positively considered, where they maintain or 
enhance countryside vitality and character, including through the use of previously 
developed land, and are consistent with national Green Belt policy and the wider 
policies of this Local Plan and relate to:  
a. Small -scale new economic development diversifying the rural economy, including 
farm diversification schemes;  
b. The retention and appropriate expansion of an existing established business, unless 
relocation to a suitable site within a settlement or other established or allocated 
employment location would be more appropriate  taking into account  operational  
requirements , infrastructure capacity, environmental and amenity impacts  and other 
relevant mat erial considerations ;  
c. Agricultural, horticultural, forestry, or mineral related development and other uses 
related to the management of the land on which they are located, although proposals 
for large scale new development will be required to demonstrate that there are no 
unacceptable adverse environmental impacts  or that they can otherwise meet the 
requirements set out in DP12 and DP13 and other relevant  policies  of the Plan , 
including for mineral development  Polic ies SP16, DP30, DP31 ; 
d. Sustainable rural tourism, sustainable leisure or sustainable recreation proposals 
which require a countryside location, in accordance with Policy DP10  (Tourism , 
Culture and Leisure) ; 
e. Required community uses and infrastructure which cannot be accommodated within 
settlements; and  
f. The sustainable  reuse of redundant or disused buildings or replacement of suitably 
located buildings for small scale economic development / employment generating 
use. 
 
Housing  
4. New market housing will be strictly controlled outside the development boundaries of 
the Strategic Centre of Shrewsbury, the Principle Centres, the Key Centres, the new Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 40 
  Strategic Settlements and the Commun ity Hubs. Within Community Clusters only new 
market housing which meets Community Cluster Policy SP9 criteria will be acceptable. 
Outside these areas,  subject to the further controls that apply in Green Belt,  residential 
development proposals will be positively considered where they  meet all the relevant  
requirements of  Local Plan policies , do not lead to an adverse cumulative impact on the 
character of communities and  relate  to: 
a. Suitably designed and located affordable exception site dwellings , entry level 
exception sites  and cross subsidy exception  housing schemes which meet 
evidenced local housing needs and the other requirements of  Local Plan  Policies 
relating to affordable exception provision  and Green Belt in DP3, DP4, DP5, DP6, 
DP7 and SP11 where this applies ;   
b. Gypsy and traveller development that meets the requirements of Policy DP8; 
c. Residential conversions of permanent buildings in locations which are not isolated 
and are reasonably accessible to services and facilities. Minimal alteration or 
rebuilding should be required to achieve the development and the conversion 
scheme must respe ct any heritage  significance the building  has, its setting and the 
local landscape character and avoid harm to natural assets in accordance with Local 
Plan Policies SP5, SP11 , DP12 , DP17 , DP23 ,  and DP24 ; 
d. The optimum  viable and sustainable  reuse of buildings with heritage significan ce, 
particularly where this also secures retention of the building as a significant 
landscape feature and/or achi eves environmental enhancement,  and meets the 
criteria set out in Local Plan Policies SP5, SP11 , DP12 , DP17 , DP23 , and DP24 . 
Where buildings are not of heritage significance , any proposal for reuse should  
evidence how the developmen t will result in an enhancement of the immediate 
setting which is sympathetic to the local character and context and that the benefits 
of the development are not otherwise outweighed by other sustainability , Green Belt  
or Local Plan policy considerations. For all buildings, m inimal alteration , extension  or 
rebuilding should be required to achieve the development ;    
e. Schemes for the sympathetic subdivision of existing dwellings which do not exceed 
the ability of local infrastructure to service the additional dwellings;  
f. Replacement dwelling houses, where it can be demonstrated the dwelling to be 
replaced is a permanent structure with an established continuing residential use and 
that the proposal also meets the general criteria for repla cement buildings set out 
below. Replacement dwellings should not be materially larger and must occupy the 
same footprint, unless the dwelling is outside the Green Belt and it can be 
demonstrated why this should not be the case. In the case of replacement r ural 
workers dwellings,  it must also be demonstrated that the size and type of dwelling 
proposed will not prejudice the on -going financial viability of the agricultural holding. 
Where the original dwelling had been previously extended or a larger replaceme nt is 
approved, permitted development rights will normally be removed; and  
g. Essential rural workers dwellings, where these are geographically and functionally 
closely linked to an activity relating to the management of the land, for agriculture, 
forestry or  another land based rural business, on which the dwelling is proposed to 
be located and where applicants have demonstrated that:  
i. There are no other existing suitable and available dwellings or other buildings 
which could meet the need, including any recent ly sold or otherwise removed from 
the ownership of the rural business; and  
ii. in the case of a primary dwelling to serve a business without existing permanent 
residential accommodation, relevant financial and functional tests are met , and it Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 41 
  is demonstrated t hat the business is viable in the long -term and that the cost of 
the dwelling can be funded by the business. If a new dwelling is permitted and 
subsequently evidenced as no longer required as an essential rural workers’ 
dwelling, a financial contribution t o the provision of affordable housing will be 
required, calculated in accordance with the current prevailing target rate in relation 
to the floorspace of the dwelling  
or, 
iii. in the case of an additional dwelling to provide further accommodation for a 
worker w ho is required to be present at the enterprise for the majority of the time, 
a functional need is demonstrated, the dwelling and any garage meet the size 
requirements set out in Paragraphs 1(f) of Policy DP6 in relation to single plot 
affordable dwellings and if a new dwelling is permitted and subsequently 
evidenced as no longer required as an essential rural workers’ dwellin g, a 
financial contribution to the provision of affordable housing, equivalent to 50% of 
the difference in the value between the restricted occupancy dwelling and market 
dwelling will be required.  
 
It will be expected that all such dwellings will be subject to restrictive occupancy 
conditions and where appropriate any existing dwellings associated with the rural 
business may also be subject to occupancy restrictions. For primary and additional 
rural workers’ dwellings permitted prior to March 2011, where occupancy restrictions 
are agreed to be removed, an affordable housing contribution will be required at the 
current prevailing target rate and related to the floorspace of the dwelling.   
5. The use of e xisting holiday let properties as permanently occupied residential dwellings 
will only be supported if the buildings are of permanent construction, have acceptable 
residential amenity standards for full time occupation; and, the dwellings are restricted 
as affordable housing for local people; or,  the dwelling design is of exceptional quality 
(as defined  in NPPF paragraph 79); or, the use provides the only viable option to 
continue to preserve a building which is a heritage asset and, in both cases, any 
nece ssary affordable housing contribution necessary is made . All applications would 
need to demonstrate that the loss of the holiday use would not be detrimental to the 
local visitor economy.  
 
General Development Requirements  
6. To further protect countryside character and safeguard its natural and heritage  assets, 
whilst recognising the significant role of agriculture and land -based activities in 
Shropshire and supporting rural vitality by retaining a range of community facilities, 
housing and employment opportunities:  
a. Proposals for the replacement of build ings which contribute to the local 
distinctiveness, landscape character and historic environment, will be resisted unless 
other sustainability considerations can be demonstrated and the requirements of 
Historic Environment P olicy DP23  can be met . Any negative impacts associated with 
the potential loss of these buildings, including the loss of embodied energy,  will be 
weighed with the need for the repla cement of damaged, substandard and 
inappropriate structures and the benefits of facilitating appropriate rural economic 
development.  
b. Where proposals for the re -use of existing buildings require planning permission, if 
required in order to safeguard their heritage significance  and/or other elements of 
the character of the converted buildings and/or their setting, Permitted Development 
Rights will be removed from any planning permission.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 42 
  c. Building s and sites used by community facilities and services such as lo cal shops, 
meeting places, sports venues, open space, cultural buildings, public houses and 
places of worship, will be protected from change of use to dwellinghouses or 
redevelopment to housing unless it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that the 
continui ng use as a community facility or service , including alternative community 
uses , would not adversely impact on the well -being the local community in 
accordance with the Policy SP6 (Health &  Well Being) and would be unviable in the 
longer term.    
d. Planning applications for agricultural development will be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that the development is:  
i. Of a size/ scale and type which is consistent with its required agricultural purpose 
and the nature of the agricultural enterprise or business that it is intended to 
serve;  
ii. Well designed and located in line with the other requirements  of relevant Local 
Plan policies  and where possible, site d so that it is functionally and physically 
closely related to existing farm buildings; and  
iii. There will be no unacceptable impacts on environmental quality , including the 
historic environment  and existing residential amenity , and the proposal complies 
with the requirements of all the other relevant policies of this Local Plan including  
DP12 , DP17 , DP18 , DP19 , DP23  and DP24 . 
e. Development design and layout should  positively respond to our changing climate by 
taking opportunities to maximise energy efficiency (including maximising 
opportunities for solar gain), mini mise carbon emissions and makes efficient use of 
water, in accordance with relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
f. Where appropriate, mitigation measures will be required to remove any adverse 
effects from development on the integrity of internationally desi gnated sites identified 
within the Habitats Regulations Assessment of the Local Plan and in accordance 
with Policy DP12 . 
 
Explanation  
3.75.  The policy reflects the Local Plan’s overall approach of focusing growth in 
strategically agreed   locations (as identified and set out in Strategic Approach  
Policy  SP2) whilst supporting rural communities by enabling some controlled 
development to maintain local sustainability.  Although identified Community 
Hubs and Community Clusters provide the main opportunities for the delivery 
of local housing a nd employment opportunities and the foci for sustainable 
development in rural areas, this policy clarifies what types of development are 
appropriate in the countryside beyond these settlements. In particular the 
policy considers requirements for: affordabl e and specialist housing needs ; 
rural land uses and employment opportunitie s and tourism  and community 
infrastructure. It considers how beneficial development can be achieved 
which, together with other Local Plan policies, optimises opportunities to re -
use land and buildings, conserves the natural and historic environment , 
considers climate change and  is sympathetic to local character  and landscape  
setting whilst supporting economic and community needs.  This recognises the 
countryside as a ‘living -working’ environment, where appropriate development 
to facilitate its various functions and the wider sustainability of rural 
communities will be needed.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 43 
  3.76.  Whilst this policy sets out the overall approach for the management of 
development in the countryside,  there are additional  policy constraints and 
requirements that apply in the Green Belt, AONB and the other designated 
areas that cover a significant proportion of the rural area in Shropshire. Green 
Belt and the AONB are subject to specific policies , SP11  and DP24  
respectively , but in addition  the other relevant policies of this Local Plan will 
also inform decisions on whether development proposals are appropriate . 
3.77.  When considering development proposals, the need to support rural vitality 
and the viability of countryside as a dynamic, functional environme nt and an 
environmental and economic resource will be a significant consideration. The 
NPPF positively encourages flexible working practices including the 
integration of employment and residential uses. It also highlights that isolated 
new homes in the cou ntryside should be avoided, therefore this will also be a 
factor taken into consideration in assessing proposals for live work units, 
particularly where it is apparent the residential use far outweighs the work 
element. In line with the sustainability aspi rations expressed in this Plan and 
facilitated by part 3 (f) of this policy, the re -use of existing buildings provides 
an opportunity for these types of combined uses where proposals take into 
account the suitability of buildings and location for the use a nd other policy 
requirements. Where live work is proposed it would be expected that : the 
proposed work use is shown to be viable and appropriate in that location and 
likely to remain so; in most cases that the residential element is subsidiary to 
the work use and the applicant is willing to accept appropriate  restrictions 
which  tie the residential and work elements together.  
3.78.  The housing element of the Policy reflects the approach set out in national 
policy which seeks to direct new housing development away from isolated 
rural locations  to places where it will support the role of existing settlements 
and their communities.  Affordable housing exception schemes, including via 
cross subsidy, in appropriate  locations are enabled as sustainable housing 
solutions to meet recognised local housing needs.  The Policy also recognises 
specialist rural accommodation requirements in the form of rural worker 
dwellings and gypsy and traveller requirements. The criteria for consideration  
of gypsy and traveller applications and for  exception proposals, are set out 
Local Plan policies, DP3 to DP8. An updated Housing  Supplementary 
Planning Document (SPD)  is also being prepared to provide detailed guidance 
on the range of rural housing issues, including the  assessment and 
subsequent treatment of exception housing proposals, rural worker dwellings 
and gypsy  and traveller sites.  
3.79.  The control of replacement of  dwellings in the countryside needs to be 
considered in conjunction with the general development criteria set out in the 
policy which also highlights and addresses visual, heritage loss and other 
impacts associated with proposals for replacement buildings.  In the case of 
residential properties, there is additionally the objective of regulating the size 
of replacement properties in order to limit the tendency towards the provision 
of larger dwellings in the countryside and to maintain a mix of dwelling types  
in rural areas in line with the objectives of the Local Plan’s Residential Mix 
policy DP1.  
3.80.  The detailed assessment criteria for the evaluation of a pplications for rural 
workers’ dwellings in Part 4 of this Policy and guidance in the Housing SPD 
will provide the necessary clarity for applicants in relation to the consideration 
of applications in Shropshire for new rural workers’ dwellings and for the 
removal of occupancy restrictions attached to existing dwellings. This Policy Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 44 
  continues the approach established by the previous Plan, SAMDev DPD. The 
requirement for financial contributions to provision of affordable housing when 
a rural worker’s dwelling  is lost has  been retained  as a requirement.  This 
reflect s the ongoing significant need for affordable housing provision in rural 
areas. The contribution requirement is related to , what is in effect , the creation 
of a new open market dwelling (which has b een justified by a functional need 
which no longer exists ) in an open countryside  location , where such a  dwelling 
would otherwise not normally be permitted.  
3.81.  The Policy identifies two categories of rural workers’ dwellings and sets out 
what the approach will be to each, including what conditions will be attached. 
These include occupancy conditions, limiting occupation to a rural worker 
meeting specified criteri on and/or limiting the dwelling for occupation in 
conjunction with the rural business operation to which it relates, recognising 
that there may be more than one rural enterprise within a rural business.  
These conditions may be attached to existing unrestr icted dwellings 
associated with the business, as well as the newly permitted unit, in order to 
prevent rural workers dwellings being lost from the available stock. The first 
type of rural worker’s dwelling is the main house for the business (for 
agricultur al businesses, traditionally the main farm residence) and the second 
relates to additional dwellings to provide for other workers who are employed 
by the enterprise(s).  
3.82.  For new primary dwellings, relevant financial and functional tests are required 
to asse ss need and viability, and the occupation of the dwelling will be 
appropriately limited by condition. It would be expected that the scale and type 
of dwelling proposed is closely related to the evidenced needs of the business 
and proportionate to the scale  of the business. However, in recognition that it 
is the primary dwelling, potentially serving as a family home, and providing 
specialist accommodation such as business office and utility areas, there is no 
firm restriction on the size of the dwelling, alt hough the applicant must be able 
to demonstrate that the cost of the dwelling can be funded solely by the 
business itself. In the eventuality that the dwelling is no longer required and 
sold on the open market, an affordable housing contribution will be re quired in 
accordance at the current prevailing target rate with  further guidance set out in 
the Housing SPD. As the rate is applied to the floorspace of the dwelling, the 
larger the dwelling the greater the contribution. This is a different approach 
than f or additional rural workers’ dwellings (see below) on the basis that the 
dwelling is the primary residence, is integral to the business and may be tied 
to the business and its financing.  
3.83.  The second category of rural workers dwelling, relating to the provis ion of 
further accommodation, is essentially a specialist type of  single plot affordable  
dwelling and will be treated in a similar way when considering proposals. It 
should be noted that the single plot affordable dwellings  (under Policy DP6) 
are subject to restrictions on location, size and value to ensure that the 
dwelling remains affordable to future generations. This is reflected in the 
requirement for the affordable dwelling to be subject to a legal agreement to 
protect occupation and value in perpetuity.  Thus, s hould the rural workers 
dwelling no longer be required as an occupational dwelling to serve any part 
of the farm business, it is expected that it will be offered for rent or sale to 
other individuals who would meet the necessary occupancy criteria.  Where 
this cannot be achieved within an appropriate time frame and planning 
permission is given for the lifting of occupancy conditions, when th e property 
is sold on the open market, there will be requirement that a financial Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 45 
  contribution equivalent to 50% of the uplift in market value that is achieved 
through the removal of the restriction will be paid to the Council. These 
monies will be used by  the Council to fund the provision of affordable housing. 
This approach continues  that set out in the previously  adopted Plan, SAMDev 
DPD,  with further guidance to be set out in the Housing SPD.   
3.84.  The local needs exception policy mechanism also facilitates the delivery of 
affordable exception dwellings, not tied to a rural enterprise or business but in 
other appropriate locations to provide for evidenced local needs and  offers an 
alternative means o f meeting the housing requirements of people who work in 
rural areas but do not meet the definition of rural workers.  
3.85.  The policy also clarifies the Council’s approach regarding affordable housing 
contributions in relation to the removal of occupancy condit ions on essential 
rural workers’ dwellings permitted prior to the adoption of the previous Plan, 
the Core Strategy, in March 2011. In these cases, as with new primary 
dwellings, an affordable housing contribution will be required at the current 
prevailing target rate and related to the floorspace of the dwelling, reflecting 
that the effect of the removal of the conditions is the creation of a new 
unrestricted dwelling in the countryside.  An affordable housing contribution 
will however not be required from pre-existing dwellings which have 
retrospectively become subject to occupancy conditions as a result of a 
planning approval for a new rural worker  dwelling for the enterprise or 
business.  
3.86.  Holiday lets are essentially residential properties in the countrysi de which are 
limited in the extent of their occupation by conditions attached to the planning 
permission. They encompass a wide range of building types, from chalets to 
barn conversions, and may have been supported, as dwelling units in the 
countryside, on  the basis of their contribution to economic sustainability, in 
particular the local tourism base. The policy sets out the criteria that will be 
taken into consideration when applications are received to use holiday 
properties as permanent dwellings. It se eks to limit potential full -time 
occupation to appropriately located, permanent dwellings meeting relevant 
building regulations and other housing standards. Thus,  permanent 
occupation of structures such as caravans and chalets would not normally be 
appropr iate.  Additionally, applicants will also need to justify that the loss of 
the properties would not have a significant adverse impact on the local visitor 
economy. Where it is accepted that a full -time dwelling is appropriate, the 
preference will be for a change to an affordable dwelling. Open market 
residential use will normally only be accepted where it has been a new build of 
exceptional  quality in line with the requirements of paragraph 79 of the NPPF  
or it is a conversion  that retains identifiable heri tage value.  Where additional 
alterations are proposed these must respect the significance of the heritage 
asset, its setting and the local landscape character.  An affordable housing 
contribution at the current prevailing rate may also be required,  if it has not 
been previously paid, in accordance with guidance which will be set out in the  
Housing SPD.  
3.87.  In order to promote a sustainable approach to development, proposals which 
minimise the impacts of new development, appropriately conserve the existing 
historic and landscape resource, and/or provide environmental amelioration 
are encouraged. This will include the appropriate re -use of existing suitable 
buildings and previously developed land.  Whilst national policy gives 
substantial weight to the benefits of  use of suitable brownfield land within 
settlements for homes and other needs it also seeks to avoid isolated Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 46 
  residential development in the countryside and does not identify use of 
brownfield land by itself  as specific circumstance to support such 
development.  
3.88.  Shropshire has a wealth of traditional rural buildings which can be important 
landscape features and form part of the heritage resource but may no longer 
be particularly suitable for their original purpose. Alternative uses, which can 
help ens ure that these buildings are retained, limit the visual impact of new 
construction and provide recycling of the building resource, are generally 
encouraged by the Local Plan. However,  to achieve sympathetic schemes for 
reuse of buildings it  is essential th at conversions incorporate the principles of 
Policy SP5 (High  Quality Design) which requires appropriate materials and 
detailing together with consideration of local character. Where buildings are 
heritage assets , and subject to Policy DP23 , this is of particular importance  
and a high standard is required; it will be normally be expected, for example, 
that all windows and doors should be made of timber  rather than uPVC.  
3.89.  In order to ensure that the benefits of a conversion scheme are maintained 
and that future visual impacts on the building and setting are managed, this 
Policy allows subsequent changes to converted properties to be controlled 
through co nditions attached to the planning permission for conversion. An 
element of new build , alteration, extension and rebuilding  will only be  
considered where it meets the criteria in Policy SP5 (High Quality Design) and 
delivers the benefits identified in Policy DP23  (Historic Environment).  
Decision making on conversion proposals will also be informed by relevant 
evidence  and assessment , including the Shropshire Historic Farmstead and 
Landscape Project, other Plan criteria, in particular those set out  in Policy 
DP23 , and relevant national guidance . 
3.90.  Proposals for replacement of dwellings and other buildings can significantly 
impact on the character of the countrysi de and , and on the wider environment 
through the loss of the embodied energy within existing buildings. As a result , 
there is a need to ensure appropriate scale, design and location of new 
development. Where planning applications for replacement buildings for 
economic purposes are proposed that differ significantly from the original 
building, it should be demonstrated why a particular design or scale of 
replacement building is required. There are also  specific  restrictions in Green 
Belt locations which seek  to limit the impact of development  on Green Belt by 
requiring replacements to relate to the same use and not  be materially larger 
than the original building.  
3.91.  The changing needs and effects of agricultural and other related businesses 
in the countryside are a particular local issue, in particular the impacts of 
large -scale  agricultural buildings.  General sustainable design criteria and 
development management co nsiderations are as relevant to this type of 
development as other proposals in the countryside and the Plan seeks to 
balance the needs of the countryside as a working environment with its role as 
a place to live and enjoy. The policy defines the primary co nsiderations that 
will be taken into account in considering agricultural development proposals 
which require planning consent. Additional criteria set out in other relevant 
policy such as :  SP5 (High Quality Design) ; Policy DP17  (Landscape and 
Visual Amenity), DP18  (Pollution and  public amenity) , DP19  ( Water 
Resources and quality),  Policy DP23  (Historic Environment) ; SP4 
(Sustainable Design ); DP12  (The Natural Environment) and DP24  (Shropshire 
Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) which highlights special 
requirements in the Shropshire Hills AONB, will also be taken into account in Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 47 
  considering applications. It should be noted that where appropriate, planning 
conditions will be attached to a permission to control the quality of the 
development and to ensure the scheme incorporates appropriate agreed 
mitigation measures such as coloured external cladding, landscaping and 
waste management.  
3.92.  Policy DP12  states that p ermission will be refused for development where the 
Habitats Regulations Assessment ( HRA ) identifies  an adverse effect on the 
integrity of a designated site which cannot be avoided or fully mitigated . 
Where mitigation  is possible to remove  the adverse effect , it will be a 
requirement of any planning permission.

  SP11.  Green Belt and Safeguarded Land  
1. Following review,  the extent of Green Belt within Shropshire is identified on the Policies 
Map. This includes amendments to the Green Belt as specified  within Table SP11.1  to 
facilitate the strategic approach to the distribution of development identified w ithin Policy 
SP2. It is expected that this Green Belt boundary will not need to be altered at the end of 
the Local Plan period.  
2. Land within the devel opment boundaries for the settlements of: Albrighton, Alveley, 
Bridgnorth  (which is enclosed on its eastern side by Green Belt) and Shifnal; the 
Strategic Site at: RAF Cosford; and the Industrial Estates at: Alveley and Stanmore is 
excluded from the Green Belt. The villages of Beckbury, Claverley and Worfield are also 
inset in th e Green Belt but function as countryside, as such Policy SP10  (Countryside) 
applies. Safeguarded land, being land removed from the Green Belt for futu re 
development needs beyond the current Local Plan period, is shown on the Policies Map.  
3. The Green Belt will be protected against inappropriate development, as defined by 
national policy. As such in addition to meeting the general requirements that apply i n the 
countryside as set out in Policy SP10 , development proposed in the Green Belt must 
also be able to demonstrate that:  
a. It is not inappropriate development (as set out by national policy) and does not 
otherwise conflict with the purposes of the Green Belt; or  
b. Very special circumstances apply.  
4. Open market housing in the Green Belt will only be considered appropriate development 
where  it: 
a. Relates to a reuse of buildings of permanent and substantial construction which 
preserves Green Belt openness and meets the requirements for conversions in 
Local Plan Policy SP10  (Countryside) or SP9 (Community Clusters) where this 
policy is relevant;  
b. Is a replacement dwelling which is not materially larger than the one it replaces and 
otherwise meets the criteria for replacement buildings set out in Local Plan Policy 
SP10  (Countryside); and  
c. Is infill development or a replacement dwelling in a settlement which becomes a 
Community Cluster through a Neighbourhood Plan, where it otherwise meets the 
criteria set out in SP9 (Community Clusters) and in all other respects meets the 
policy tests set out in the Local Plan.  
5. Proposals on previously developed sites, which would not have a greater impact on the 
openness of the Green Belt than the existing development, will be restricted to 
development for employment or economic uses, defence uses, local community use, 
including outdoor sport and recreation, or affordable housing. Development to meet an 
identified local affordable housing need, as defined by relevant Local Plan Policies, 
through the reuse of previously developed land, will also be acceptable where it can be 
demons trated not to cause substantial harm to the openness of the Green Belt.  
6. Proposals for limited affordable housing to meet a proven local affordable housing need 
that is demonstrated through an up -to-date and robust local housing needs survey, in 
the locati ons identified in Policy DP4 (Affordable Exception Sites) and DP6 (Single Plot 
Exception Sites), which meet the other requirements of Affordable Housing Policies 
DP3, DP4 and DP6 and other releva nt Local Plan policies will be supported.  
7. RAF Cosford is a strategic site inset within the Green Belt to facilitate military and charity 
operational and development needs. Future additional development at this strategic site 
would be expected to take place  within the area of land inset within the Green Belt Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 49 
  unless it is one of the exceptions to inappropriate development within the Green Belt 
identified within national policy or very special circumstances can be demonstrated.   
8. Proposals, including changes of uses of land, which increase the beneficial use of the 
Green Belt, by enhancing green infrastructure, biodiversity, visual amenity and 
landscapes or improving derelict land and opportunities for access, outdoor sport and 
recreation, will be supported where this does not conflict with Green Belt or other policy 
objectives.  
 
Explanation  
3.93.  The Shropshire Green Belt is on the outer edge of and forms part of the wider 
West Midlands Green Belt. It encompasses an area in the south e ast of the 
County that lies to the east of the River Severn and south of the A5, as shown 
on Figure SP11.1 below:   
Figure SP11.1: Location of the West Midlands Green Belt  
 
3.94.  The five fundamental purposes of the Green Belt set out in national policy are 
to:  
a. Check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas;  
b. Prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;  
c. Assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;  
d. Preser ve the setting and special character of historic towns; and  
e. Assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and 
other urban land.  
3.95.  Green Belt is a strategic planning tool designed primarily to prevent the 
spread of development and the  coalescence of urban areas, designated 
because of its position, rather than its landscape quality or recreational use. 
However, it should be noted that within Shropshire the Green Belt also 
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 50 
  includes non -designated areas of landscape value, heritage and ec ological 
designations and it also fulfils a recreational function in some locations.  
3.96.  The NPPF advises that, Green Belt boundaries should only be altered in 
exceptional circumstances through the preparation or updating of Local Plans. 
The Green Belt within Shropshire was last subject to review, some time ago, 
during the preparation of the Bridgnorth Local Plan 1996 -2011 (adopted 
2006). However, much of the safeguarded land provided at Shifnal and 
Albrighton to make provision for longer term development needs  has been 
used or is now allocated for development within this Plan. On this basis, and 
subsequent to a commitment made by the previously adopted Local Plan, a 
review of the Green Belt boundary has been undertaken to support the 
preparation of this Local P lan. This has formed part of the process of 
considering the development strategy and options for a sustainable pattern of 
future growth in the County. Policies and allocations within this Plan all 
reference the reviewed area of Green Belt within Shropshire  as identified on 
the Policies Map.  
3.97.  To support the Green Belt review consultants were commissioned to look at 
the role that the Green Belt is playing in Shropshire, in particular how well it 
performs against the five purposes defined in national guidance.  This initial 
assessment (Shropshire Green Belt Assessment LUC September 2017) of the 
relative performance of the Shropshire Green Belt helped provide a picture of 
Green Belt and its function in Shropshire and formed the basis for a second 
study which under took a detailed consideration of the harm to Green Belt that 
could result from the release of land for development.  
3.98.  The second stage study (Shropshire Green Belt Review; Stage 2 Final Report 
LUC November 2018) focused on: areas around existing identified 
settlements which are in or adjoin the Green Belt including Albrighton, 
Bridgnorth and Shifnal as the Principal and Key Centres within or adjoining 
the Green Belt; Alveley as a Community Hub identified within the Green Belt; 
land around Cosford village and  military base, as an identified existing major 
developed area; and considered locations along the M54/A5 strategic corridor. 
The assessment did not draw conclusions as to where land should be 
released to accommodate development, which is necessarily a pro duct of the 
consideration of the full range of constraints and strategic issues that apply as 
well as Green Belt designation. Rather it identified relative variations in the 
harm to the designation if parcels were released. Thus, the key 
recommendations an d issues raised in this evidence formed only part of the 
exceptional circumstances case which was prepared to support this Local 
Plan.   
3.99.  These Green Belt studies, together with other evidence, allowed the Council 
to examine a range of options, including Gr een Belt release, in considering an 
appropriate strategy to meet the development requirements of the Local Plan 
review. A longer -term view was taken in line with national guidance which 
requires that when defining Green Belt boundaries that Local Plans sho uld, 
where necessary, identify safeguarded land to meet development needs 
significantly beyond the Plan period. Thus, the Local Plan review, in 
considering the Green Belt, has looked both at Shropshire’s current Plan 
development requirements and the need t o safeguard land to accommodate 
future development needs beyond 2038.  
3.100.  Subsequent to this review the Local Plan has identified areas of land for 
release from the Green Belt at Albrighton, Alveley, Cosford, Shifnal and Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 51 
  Stanmore (Bridgnorth) as shown on the table below, discussed further under 
the relevant settlement policies a nd shown on the Policies Map. Green Belt 
release includes: 50.4ha land specifically released for employment purposes, 
with 11.4 ha of land at Stanmore and 39.0 ha at Shifnal; 1.4 ha solely for 
housing and a 2.4 ha mixed use incorporating housing at Alveley ; the RAF 
Cosford Strategic Site of around 214.2 ha for military and charity operational 
and development needs ; and a total of some 116.3 ha of safeguarded land 
with 19.9 ha at Albrighton, 3.6 ha at Alveley and 92.8 ha at Shifnal.

3.101.  The settlements of Beckbury, Claverley and Worfield, and the Industrial 
Estates at Alveley and Stanmore, will continue to not be included in the Green 
Belt. Local Plan policy SP10  (Managing Development in the Countryside) will 
apply in the se settlements rather than Green Belt policy. It is expected that the 
industrial estates will continue in employment use and addition al land has 
been identified at Stanmore Industrial Estate to meet expansion needs as set 
out in S3, the Bridgnorth Place Plan Area Settlement Policy.   
3.102.  There are no existing Community Clusters within the Green Belt, but 
settlements may opt in via the Neigh bourhood Plan process. Settlements that 
are ‘washed over’ by the Green Belt but which become Community Cluster 
Settlements at any time during the Plan period will be considered suitable for 
limited infilling which meets the criteria set out in this Policy,  Local Pan Policy 
SP9 (Managing Development in Community Clusters) and the requirements of 
national Green Belt policy.  
3.103.  Whilst safeguarded land has bee n removed from the Green Belt it has been 
specifically identified in order to meet any sustainable development needs that 
may exist beyond the Plan period and remains unavailable for permanent 
development until allocated by a future Local Plan. The Policie s Map shows 
the locations of safeguarded land in Shropshire  
3.104.  Within the Green Belt and safeguarded land, Countryside Policy SP10  
applies, with Green Belt Policy providing an additional policy that reflects the 
extra protection afforded to Green Belts by national policy.  Policy SP11  
provides an ap proach that is consistent with, but does not repeat, national 
policy on Green Belt. Like national policy, Local Plan Policy SP11  assumes 
that inappropriate development is harmful to the Green Belt and identifies 
circumstances when development may be accept able and not conflict with 
National Policy, where appropriate, providing additional clarification in the 
Shropshire context.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 52 
  3.105.  This Policy continues the approach set out in the previous Plan (SAMDev 
DPD) that development on previously developed (brownfield)  sites will be 
limited to employment, economic, community , including outdoor sport and 
recreation, or affordable housing uses in accordance with Strategic Policy 
SP2 which states that outside identified settlements, ‘new development in the 
wider rural area will consist of affordable housing where there is evidenced 
local needs and appropriate rural employment and economic diversification’. 
Strategic Policy SP10  (Countryside Policy) also seeks to support the delivery 
of rural economic and community needs whilst strictly controlling market 
housing outside identified settlements.  
3.106.  Proposals for limited affordable housing to meet a proven local affordable 
housing need on exception sites is facilitated by national Green Belt policy 
and allowed on suitable sites in the specific circumstances set out this Policy. 
Exception site proposals will also need to meet the relevant requirements of 
Local Plan Policies DP3 (Affordable Housing Provision), DP4 (Affordable 
Exception Sites) and DP6 (Single Plot Affordable Dwel lings). It should be 
noted that in line with national guidance Entry Level Exception Housing 
(Policy DP5) is not supported in Green Belt. Cross subsidy exception 
schemes (Policy DP7) by their nature provide some dwellings which are not 
affordable, and as  Green Belt policy only expressly makes an exemption for 
affordable housing and limited infilling in villages, very special circumstances 
would need to be demonstrated for such schemes in Green Belt locations, in 
addition to meeting the criteria in Policy DP7. 
3.107.  RAF Cosford has been identified as a strategic site inset within the Green 
Belt. Local Plan Policy S21 sets out the proposals for the site and relevant 
considerations.  
3.108.  Potential opportunities for enhancing the beneficial use of the Green Belt exist 
and need to be positively planned for as requi red by NPPF paragraph 141. 
The Green Belt Review evidence prepared to support the Local Plan sets out 
some potential mitigation measures that can be applied to improve the quality 
and accessibility of Green Belt and reduce the potential harm where land is 
taken out from the Green Belt including, integrative landscaping, 
reinforcement of Green Belt boundaries, appropriate development design and 
layout and provision of access/enhanced access. Such measures are 
specifically identified in site guidelines where Local Plan allocations are 
proposed in Green Belt locations. However, there will be other opportunities to 
encourage the enhancement of Green Belt, including when unallocated 
development comes forward in Green Belt, and the policy recognises this.  
Additio nally, it will be expected that when safeguarded land is allocated for 
development within a future Local Plan, that it will provide compensatory 
improvements to wider Green Belt.

  SP12.  Shropshire Economic Growth Strategy  
1. Shropshire will be the best place to do business and invest. The County will promote its 
economic potential by positively supporting enterprise, developing and diversifying the 
local economy , targeting growing and under -represented sectors  and by using its high -
quality assets and special environment . It will increase its productivity by improving 
digital and transport connectivity, making productive use of low carbon energy s ources , 
meeting skills needs,  and by using the benefits of its local talent  and business expertise . 
2. The spatial  strategy to achieve these objectives is to deliver sustainable economic 
growth and investment in our strategic and principal settlements, strategic corridors , 
new strategic settlements and sites and appropriate rural locations.  This will take into 
account the special considerations in the Green Belt, Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty and t he need to protect and improve areas of higher landscape value and the 
natural and historic environment.  
3. Economic growth and investment will be supported in:  
a. Shrewsbury to develop its role as the County Town and Strategic Centre;  
b. The Principal Centres  and Key Centres as the key employment and service centres;  
c. The ‘Strategic Corridors’ , ‘Strategic Settlements ' and ‘Strategic Sites’ identified in 
the Plan;  
d. Community Hubs on saved allocations or windfall development on established 
employment areas or suitable sites or buildings for small scale employment 
generating uses;  and 
e. Community Clusters and the Countryside through windfall development where the 
location, scale, land use and impacts of the proposals will conform with the existing 
land uses, settlement form and environmental qualities  in accordance with relevant  
Polices o f the Local Plan . 
4. Economic development proposals will be supported that deliver employment through:  
a. Provision of serviced land and buildings for the types of employment generating 
uses  identified in SP13 ; 
b. Provision of additional floorspace for expansion of existing businesses;  
c. Provision of opportunities and facilities for mobile/agile/home working;  
d. Existing businesses that relocate into and / or expand in the County especially those 
within Shropshire’s key business sectors and clusters;  
e. New businesses that start in the County or which seek to invest and grow;  and 
f. Rural economic enterprises through : 
i. Agriculture, horticulture, forestry, food production and processing, rural 
diversification, tourism and leisure ; and  
ii. Opportunities created by improving digital connectivity for home working or to 
re-use previously developed land, appropriate rural buildings or to replace 
suitably located rural buildings for small scale e conomic development  / 
employment generating uses  subject to policies SP8, SP9, SP10 , SP14  and 
DP24 . 
5. The delivery of employment will be supported by investment in:  
a. Housing of the right type, quality , tenure  and affordability  that will support the move 
towards increased home /agile  working , in the right locations with jobs, services, 
facilities and leisure to make Shropshire a good place to live, work and play;  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 54 
  b. Renewable and low carbon energy generation including decentralised energy 
sources and to promot e the productive use of this energy by business es to reduce 
energy costs and increase energy ‘independence ’ in the local economy;  
c. Digital connectivity to broadband, mobile and fixed wireless networks to improve the 
links between businesses, their employees and their customers and suppliers;  
d. Education, training, apprenticeships and centres of excellence to provide the skills 
needed by existing companies, and our future business activities;  
e. Transport and utilities infrastruc ture and the adoption of new and more sustainable 
transport options to improve accessibility in Shropshire , remove capacity constraints 
to future business investments  and to contribute to climate management objectives ; 
and 
f. Public services and assets, cultu re, leisure , net gains in the natural environment and 
heritage led regeneration  to continue to shape the County and to attract people and 
businesses to locate in Shropshire.  
 
Explanation  
3.109.  Shropshire set out its economic growth vision in the Shropshire Economic 
Growth Strategy 2017 to 2021 that seeks “ To be the best place to do business 
and invest, renowned for its pool of local talent and expertise.  We will strive to 
maximise our economic potential and increase productivity by fully utilising the 
benefits of our special environment and high -quality assets ”. 
3.110.  The strategy of the Local Plan is to achieve an urban focus to development.  
The primary focus for employment investment is Shrewsbury , and the 
Principal  and Key Centres  of the County with their employment land offer, 
housing, services and accessibility.  Creating a sustainable pattern  of 
development will mean that employment development should be directed to 
Shrewsbury, our Principal Centres  and our Key Centres.  A portfolio of 
employment sites has been identified to provide a range and choice of sites to 
meet the requirements of the development strategies for these settlements.  
3.111.  Shropshire and The Marches have a number of business sectors and clusters 
that are performing well with extremely  successful companies operating in and 
around the County.  Our strategy for these sectors is to work with companies 
investing in these enterprises and to suppo rt their growth in the competitive 
national and international economy. It will be important to ensure these 
companies find the locations and expansion opportunities they seek and can 
invest in the following activities:  
a. Advanced  manufacturing including engi neering, agri -food, and agri -tech;  
b. Visitor economy and heritage based businesses;  
c. Environmental sciences and technologies;  
d. Creative and digital industries;  
e. Food and drink processing;  and 
f. Health and social care . 
3.112.  The support  for Shropshire’s key business sectors and clusters must be 
balanced with the need to protect Shropshire’ natural and historic environment  
and to achieve climate management objectives , by ensuring that development 
is properly located , will respect the char acter of the locality  and will enable Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 55 
  businesses and their employees to both increase their productivity and to 
reduce their carbon footprint.  
3.113.  A key element of this aim is to move towards a ‘zero-carbon ’ economy by 
encourag ing greater use of renewable and ‘low carbon energy sources ’ (i.e. 
wind, solar, hydro, biomass or nuclear  energy ) as an economic opportunity . 
This has the potential to offer lower energy costs and energy ‘independence ’ 
provided by decentralised  energy generation. This economic opportunity ma y 
translate into lower production costs , greater ‘added value ’ and a stronger 
asset base where the b usiness  owns or has a stake in decentralised energy 
generation technologies. This will assist the Shropshire economy by 
translating cleaner and greener energy us age into improv ed productivity and 
greater resilience of businesses to with stand changes in our economic 
circumstances.  
3.114.  The Shropshire economy is fuelled by the creation and growth of small to 
medium sized companies . This reflects a capacity for entrepreneurship and 
the creation of significant numbers of new businesses. Shropshire Council 
actively supports new business form ation, identifying companies with growth 
potential that can increase their output and employee numbers. The Council 
wishes to support the development needs of new businesses and to provide 
opportunities for companies to continue to grow in size, expand the ir physical 
operations where this is necessary or to relocate within the County.  
3.115.  A key element of entrepreneurship is the capacity to build a business from 
concept and prove its effective operation.  This requires support for 
appropriate  home -based enterpr ises and the appropriate use of residential 
properties or rural buildings for home working supported by the development 
of business hubs to deliver support services for these growing  businesses.  
3.116.  The Council also supports the business and environmental benefits to be 
obtained from mobile / agile / home working for employees of businesses that 
still maintain fixed business premises.  This change in working patterns will 
influence our travel behaviou r in favour of many more sustainable choices  
over the need to travel, the type of transport mode , the type of energy used  
and the basis on which future travel and transport services may be provided .  
It is recognised that this will require investment to deliver more and new 
infrastructure both for fixed and mobile electronic communications and for 
travel and transport to firstly,  remove the need to travel for work, goods and 
services as well as for leisure and social interaction  and secondly, to change 
the ways in which we travel  and how we may access transport services . 
3.117.  To facilitate sustainable economic growth, a ‘step change’ i s needed in 
Shropshire’s economic  productivity because the County has the potential to 
do more and to do it better.  Shropshire Council is focused and committed to 
achieving maximum economic productivity from the assets and opportunities 
across the County . This is based on four key objectives to: support and grow 
new and existing businesses; attract inward investment to the County , 
develop and retain workforce talents and skills  and to facilitate new ways of 
working that transform business environment s into digital ‘workplace s’, 
reducing the need to travel, changing the requirement s for business premises 
and contributing towards a more sustainable w ork/life balance.  
3.118.  To support the ‘step change’ in the economy, ‘strategic corridors’ comprisin g 
those principal settlements located on transport corridors will be important in 
providing further investment opportunities.  These have the potential to 
support the economic growth of the County in two key areas: they are the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 56 
  preferred locations for busi ness investment on allocated employment sites in 
Shrewsbury and the  Principal and Key Centres  and they may provide further 
significant sites for larger windfall development opportunities that are suitable 
and accessible for inward investment.  The need for a supply of sites for 
business investment and the development of business premises in the County 
and the rate at which the supply of these sites is developed for these 
purposes will be kep t under review through the Local Plan period to 2038.  
3.119.  Some ‘strategic corridors’ pass through protected areas including Green Belt 
and the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Here ‘very special ’ or 
‘exceptional’  circumstances’ for development will need to be proven to justify 
further employment development in these locations beyond the sites allocated 
for this purpose.  The Council recognise the need to protect and maintain 
these special environments but will give  careful consideration to the needs of 
communities in these locations and to the needs of businesses wishing to 
invest in the sustainability of settlements in these areas.

  SP13.  Delivering Sustainable Economic Growth and Enterprise  
1. Shropshire will deliver around 300 hectares of employment development from 2016 
to 2038 and will protect established employment areas for employment uses  to 
achieve the objectives of Policy SP12 . The strategic supply of land and protecte d 
employment areas are identified on the Policies Map and in the Authority Monitoring 
Report which will monitor the delivery of this employment development.  
2. Employment generating uses  will comprise : 
a. Primary employment uses in Class es B2, B8, E(g)( i),(ii),(iii) and Sui Generis 
Waste I nstallations  for recycling/treat ing/dispos ing of recovered materials  to 
diversify the local economy of Shropshire;  
b. Secondary employment uses in  Classes E(a),(c),(d),(e), C2, C2 A, and Sui 
Generis Waste Material Recovery Facilities, Retail Warehousing and Sales 
(including vehicle sales) and Vehicle Hire (including taxis and ‘vehicle sharing’ 
services) to diversify the employment offer on larger employment areas ; 
c. Ancillary ess ential or exceptional service uses in Classes E(b), (f), C1  and Sui 
Generis Hot Food and Takeaway Services and Hostels  to diversify the  effective 
operation and self-containment of larger employment areas.  
3. Development of employment generating uses will be expected to demonstrate that  
the: 
a. Site has the capacity to accommodate the scale of the proposed development  
particularly uses which attract visiting members of the public ; 
b. Proposed use s and any intensification of use conforms with neighbouring uses  
particularly primary employment uses on or close to the site ; 
c. Infrastructure investment is sufficient to serve the proposed or intensified use s 
particularly to provide sufficient capacity in key utilities and to facilitate  the use of 
renewable and low carbon energy and decentralised energy sources ; 
d. Development  satisfies the requirements of national and local policies especially 
to: 
i. Protect the Green Belt  or safeguarded land  except where there are very 
Special circumstances for development ,  
ii. Protect the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  except where 
there are exceptional circumstances for development , 
iii. Conserve  areas of higher  landscape value except where justified ; or  
iv. Conserve the natural and historic environment s except where justified . 
4. Development on m ixed-use employment sites will be expected to utilise return s from 
higher value land uses  to bring the remaining  land within the employment site/area to 
the market through the provision of access es, servic ing and other infrastructure to 
facilitate the development of other employment uses on the land. 
5. Development on allocated sites will be expected to satisfy the:  
a. Economic growth objectives of Policy SP12  (Economic Growth Strategy) ; 
b. Strategy for the settlement in which the proposed site is located;  
c. Development guidelines for allocated employment site s or mixed -use sites with 
employment generati ng uses  in Settlement Policies S1-S18, Strategic Settlement 
Policies S19-S20, Strategic Site Policy S21 or approved Neighbourhood Plans;  
and 
d. Requirements of Local Plan policies relevant to the proposed location or use s of 
land.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 58 
   
Explanation  
3.120.  This policy contributes to the economic vision and strategy for Shropshire set 
out in Policy SP12 . These objectives are further supported by mixed use  
developments proposed on the ‘Strategic Settlements and ‘Strategic Site’ 
identified in the Local Plan and on sites along the ‘Strategic Corridors’ 
identified in Policy SP14 . 
3.121.  This policy seeks to provide certainty in the delivery of the economic growth 
strategy by shaping  the delivery of the strategic land supply and the use of 
established employment areas to satisfy the objectives of the strategy. The 
aspiration for this approach is to promote a ‘step change’ in the economic 
productivity of the Shropshire economy.  
3.122.  It is proposed to plan for 300 hectares of land to be developed for Class B 
office, research and development, workshop, general industry, sto rage and 
distribution development  for the period 2016 to 2038.  The delivery of this 
development will satisfy the strategic approach set out in Policy SP2 in 
relation to the settlement hierarchy and the proposed distribution of 
development within the County.  6. Windfall Class B employment development on other sites will be supported , where 
the proposal is:  
a. To expand the premises or to intensify the operation of an existing business;  
b. For the change of use / conversion of an existing building to employment use;  
c. Located on a site within or adjoining an established employment area;  
d. For development of a suitable scale located within a Community Hub, Community 
Cluster or in the Countryside that satisfies Polic y SP12 , SP8, SP9, SP10 ; or is 
e. Distributed according to the strategic approach in Policy SP2; 
f. Consistent with the economic growth objectives of Policy SP12 ; 
g. For major employment  development including large scale inward investment  for a 
known ‘end user s’ or occupiers , that satisfies the objectives of Policy  SP14 . 
7. To support strategic and local employers, there is a presumption to protect allocated 
employment land and e stablished employment areas  primarily for Class B 
employment uses.  Proposals for change of use or for the loss of employment land 
and premises will only be supported where:  
a. A contemporary market assessment of the employment land in the Settlement 
demonstr ates a satisfactory supply for the remaining period of the Local Plan  
which does  not compromise the supply of land in the County ; and 
b. A comprehensive marketing exercise demonstrates the site is not suitable or 
viable:  
i. For the established use; or  
ii. Any other employment use; or  
iii. Employment uses no longer conform with the majority of the neighbouring 
uses;  and 
c. The application demonstrates that the proposed use will make a significant 
contribution to the local economy, the local community or to other significant 
Local Plan objectives.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 59 
  3.123.  It is recognised that Shropshire has a diverse economic structure with a focus 
on ‘servi ce industries’ and there will be a need for flexibility in the delivery of 
employment sites to allow  for other employment generating uses.  This policy 
recognises the need for flexibility in the development of the employment land 
supply to meet the needs o f Shropshire and its communities.  This includes a 
special presumption for recycling and environmental industries identified in the 
development guidelines for specific allocated employment sites.  
3.124.  This policy identifies those land uses which are taken to be  ‘employment 
generating uses’ based on the changes  to the Use Classes Order 1987 (as 
amended). This identifies three groupings of ‘employment generating uses’ 
with the ‘primary’ uses focusing on business and industrial uses along with t he 
special presumpti on for ‘higher order ’, recycling and environmental process ing 
that together, seek to diversify the larger ‘service’ sector of the Shropshire 
economy.  It is expected that these uses will be grouped together and 
adequately protected from any unintentional im pacts on the amenity of other 
uses  which may draw visiting members of the public into the se more 
conventional ‘business’ environment s.  It is considered that the ‘primary’ uses 
deliver utilitarian building format s with the potential to a ccommodate , or be 
readily altered to serve , a broad range of alternative uses over the building’s 
lifespan. These ‘primary’ uses also have the potential to offer higher skilled 
‘production’ employment or higher value ‘administrative’ or ‘managerial’ 
employ ment  that is much needed in the Shropshire economy . 
3.125.  The ‘secondary ’ uses recognise the ‘service’ base of the Shropshire economy , 
the greater flexibility for change of use of buildings and the greater locational 
choice for many businesses over their  preferred ‘business ’ environment. This 
grouping offers a significant range and variety of uses that may choose to 
locate in an employment area including ‘lower order ’, recycling activities. This 
greater locational choice w ill also carry certain responsibilities  for many of 
these uses . This will include consideration of : how to manage  the needs and 
impacts of visiting members of the public attracted into more conventional 
business environments ; and avoid ing potential amenity impacts from locating 
too close to conventional business uses operati ng in these locations. The 
advantages of this greater locational choice are that higher value uses may 
cross subsidise the d elivery of new employment land a nd these ‘service’ uses 
may offer higher value ‘professional’ or ‘technical’ employment. It is 
considered that these uses are better accommodated on medium and larger 
employment sites and areas.  
3.126.  The ‘ancillary’ uses recognise that the ‘service’ base of the  Shropshire 
economy performs an important function meeting the needs of residents and 
workers. It also re cognises that con ventional business es often prefer self -
contained locations where employees can meet their day to day need s without 
travelling too far beyond their workplace. The se ‘ancillary’ employment 
generating uses comprise two distinct groupings which are both expected to 
locate on larger employment areas: the ‘essential ’ uses that meet the day to 
day needs of surrounding businesses and other l and uses  in the locality . Also , 
those  ‘exceptional ’ uses that broaden the range of services available in an 
employment area , point ing to the ‘maturity’ of the locational ‘ offer and mak ing 
it a more desirable business location.   
3.127.  Where employment uses are provided in a mixed -use development the return 
from the higher land values must be used to deliver the development of the 
remaining employment land  through cross subsidy of some of the 
development costs .  This will require a n investment  from the higher value Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 60 
  uses ideally to provide highway access and internal distributor road s with 
servicing into the employment area and provision  of engineer ed, market ready 
plots with utility services to the plot boundaries.  
3.128.  To deliver th e required scale of development, a strategic supply of 
employment land is identified on the Policies Map and in the Shropshire 
Authority Monitoring Report at: https://shropshire.gov.uk/planning -
policy/monitoring -and-site-assessment/authority -monitoring -report -amr/.  The 
Authority Monitoring Report identifies a portfolio of sites and records both the 
delivery of development on completed sites and the ‘pipeline’ supply of sites 
with planning permission , the saved SAMDev Plan allocations identified in 
Appendix 2  and those allocated in Settlement Policies S1-S18, Strategic 
Settlement Policies S19-S20 and the Strategic Site s Policy S21. The  saved 
SAMDev Plan and Local Plan allocat ions will be accorded the same weight in 
planning decisions. The Authority Monitoring Report also identifies the 
established employment areas protected by this policy.  
3.129.  This policy recognises the need for flexibility o ver the location of employment 
development. This allows for windfall development primarily for the growth of 
existing  businesses through the expansion of their business premises, 
redevelopment of existing employment areas or through the conversion or 
chang e of use of other existing buildings , where this complies with the 
relevant policies of the Local Plan .   
3.130.  The need for new sites is also recognised, where these demands may not be 
met on allocated employment sites  due to issues including locations, scale 
and suitability . The primary focus for this development, particularly for inward 
investment will be  sites within or adjoining  Shrewsbury and the Principal or 
Key Centre s located on the identified ‘strategic corridors’.  Major employment  
development on windfall sites may also be permitted on brownfield sites 
located close to Shrewsbury and the Principal or Key Centres or, in 
exceptional circumstances, on greenfield sites close to the settlements in the 
‘strategic corridors’.  
3.131.  New developme nt will also be permitted on sites of a suitable size within the 
Community Hubs in addition to any saved employment allocations.   
3.132.  In the Community Clusters and in the Countryside, the location, scale, land 
use and impacts of windfall development proposals  must conform with the 
existing land uses, settlement form , environmental qualities.  
3.133.  Development in rural areas beyond preferred settlements (i.e. Community 
Hubs, Clusters and Countryside) should be appropriate in scale and impact to 
the proposed location for the development. This should address the 
accessibility of the site, the character and quality of the landscape setting and 
protection of the natural and historic environment.  This policy recognises that 
small scale economic developments (up to 1ha) in cluding workshops, 
professional services, goods distribution companies should be supported in 
the Community Hubs and Community Clusters.  In the Countryside, 
agricultural and non -agricultural diversification and green tourism and leisure 
may also be suppor ted at a scale that is appropriate for their location as these 
are important economic activities in the rural economy.  
3.134.  All development proposals should respond positively to the presence of 
environmental constraints on and around potential development site s 
particularly in relation to the Shropshire Green Belt, the Shropshire Hills Area 
of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the landscape and character of the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 61 
  surrounding area and the significance of the natural and historic environment .  
These matters are addressed  further in the objectives of other policies in the 
Local Plan and in Neighbourhood Plans, Community / Parish Plans and in 
growth strategies for settlements across the County.  
3.135.  The ‘Strategic Corridors’ in Policy SP14 , provide flexibility to facilitate a ‘step 
change’ in our economic performance.  The ‘Strategic Corridors’ comprise 
groups of settlements on transport corridors where releasing additional 
empl oyment land, may help support existing business and attract larger 
windfall developments  into the County.  The primary purpose here is for 
Shropshire to respond positively both to demand from the growth of existing 
business or to demand from new businesses  attracted into the County as 
inward investment  and to support unmet development needs in the Black 
Country particularly  along the M54 / A5 growth corridor . This may require the 
release of significant sites with the potential to function as ‘growth zones’ on 
the ‘strategic corridors’ for larger employment or mixed -use developments.  
3.136.  Shropshire Council places a premium on the protection of existing 
employment land and premises in the County.  This protection is important 
because these established business locations  accommodate our existing 
employers, provide grow on space and increase our capacity to accommodate 
new growth and investment.  This ensures that strategic and local employers 
can secure their operational base and meet their future development needs 
for growth and expansion of their business.   
3.137.  It is recognised that employment sites and buildings may be suitable for other 
uses or may be affected by permitted changes of use rights, but their loss still 
affects our economic capacity and productivity.  T his policy recognises such 
losses may occur and supports them where satisfactory evidence is provided.  
This evidence must justify the need for the alternative use proposed, the loss 
of the utility of the site in terms of its suitability and viability for employment 
uses and the impacts on the supply of employment sites and premises in 
Shropshire.  This approach will be based on the empl oyment generating uses 
identified in this policy reflecting the changes in the Use Classes Order 1987 
(as amended).  
3.138.  The pro tection of existing employment areas is based on evidence of the 
purpose, viability and redevelopment potential of the sites.  This evidence is 
set out in the Shropshire Strategic Sites and Employment Areas Study for 
Shrewsbury (Phase 1) and the Market Tow ns and Key Centres (Phase 2) 
which identify a hierarchical ranking of existing employment areas in the 
principal settlements of the County which is shown in Figure SP1 3.1 below : 
 
Figure SP 13.1: Hierarchy of Existing Employment Areas  
The protection of existing employment areas will be proportionate to the 
significance of the site in accordance with the following guidance.  The hierarchy 
of existing employment areas shown on the Policies Map for Shrewsbury, the 
Market Towns and Key Centres is presented in the Authority Monitoring Report.  
1. Regional and Sub -Regional Sites  – identified sites are expected to deliver:  
a. Uses specified for the area but will only include new waste management 
development where there are opportunities for co -location wi th existing 
waste management operations;  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 62 
  b. High quality development with skilled employment including inward 
investment providing strong economic benefits to enhance the Shropshire 
economy;  
c. Non class B uses will be ancillary to the proposed development or wi ll 
improve the benefits and viability of the employment area.  
2. Key Shropshire / Local Sites  – identified sites are expected to deliver:  
a. Good quality development providing strategic and local employment 
opportunities with clear economic benefits for the Shropshire economy;  
b. Uses specified for the area including waste management facilities;  
c. Opportunities for mixed commercial development on Key Local Sites 
where appropriate in relation to policy.  
3. Mixed Commercial Sites  – identified sites are expected to deli ver: 
a. Mixed commercial uses (excluding retail) to provide affordable business 
locations and accessible local employment;  
b. Class B employment uses including waste management facilities on 
regeneration opportunities which support the physical and economic 
improvement of the area.  
 
3.139.  The methodology in the Shropshire Strategic Sites and Employment Areas 
Study and the tests in this policy will also be used to determine the degree of 
protection to be afforded to existing employment areas not shown on the 
Policies Map.  This will include commercial office locations (including those 
affected by permitted development rights) and existing employment sites in 
rural locations. The significance and protection of sites not previously 
identified in the Plan will be  recorded in the Authority Monitoring Report.

  SP14.  Strategic Corridors  
The Shropshire Economic Growth Strategy seeks to deliver a ‘step change’ in the capacity 
and productivity of the local economy. To contribute to this aim, ‘Strategic Corridors’ along 
the principal rail and strategic road routes through the County will be t he primary focus for 
major employment development especially along ‘strategic corridors’ with both rail and road 
connectivity.  Major employment  development in the County will be expected to recognise 
that: 
1. The strategic approach in Policy SP2 seeks to deliver significant development and 
infrastructure investment within the ‘strategic corridors’ served by the principal rail 
network and strategic and pri ncipal road networks in Shropshire.  
2. Development in the ‘strategic corridors’ through the Green Belt or Shropshire Hills Area 
of Outstanding Natural Beauty will be subject to appropriate national and local policy. 
Development likely to affect an internation ally designated wildlife site, through 
atmospheric emissions must comply with the requirements for a project level HRA in 
accordance with policy DP12 . 
3. Development on these ‘strategic corridors’ will be located in accordance with the 
following sequential preference : 
a. In Shrewsbury or the Principal or Key Centres on an allocated site;  
b. On the identified ‘Strategic Sites’ in the Local Plan;  
c. On appropriate windfall development sites  which are:  
i. Located immediately adjoining Shrewsbury or a Principal or Key Centre; and  
ii. Brownfield sites with direct access to the rail and road routes in the c orridor; or  
iii. Greenfield sites in exceptional circumstances where the:  
• Strategic objectives of national and local policy are fully satisfied and comply 
with Policy SP13 ; 
• Proposal will strengthen the role and function of strategic settlements 
particularly Shrewsbury and the Principal Centres;  
• Proposal is a large and significant investment opportunity that cannot 
reasonably access sequentially preferable sites;  
• Proposal will : 
o Deliver the greenfield site as a fully serviced and developed employment 
area,  
o Meet the needs of the proposed ‘end user’ or occupiers; and  
o Deliver off -site infrastructure investments within the ‘strategic corridor’.  
4. Proposals for development in the ‘strategic corridors’ must satisfy the requirements of 
Policy SP13  and consider : 
a. The need to achieve a sustainable pa ttern of development particularly to balance 
the delivery of housing with employment growth;  
b. The need for infrastructure investment to support the:  
i. Delivery of the development; and  
ii. Accessibility of the rail and road networks; and  
iii. Further growth in the ‘str ategic corridor’.  
c. The scale of the proposal in relation to the location, landscape, character of the 
surrounding area and the significance of the natural and historic environment;  
d. The availability of land allocated for the proposed use in the same locality;  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 64 
  e. Other sites with long -term potential around the Strategic, Principal and Key Centres;  
f. The policies and strategies of adopted Neighbourhood Plans, Community / Parish 
Plans or growth strategies for the Strategic, Principal or Key Centres.  
 
Explanation  
3.140.  The primary purpose of this policy is to enable Shropshire to respond 
positively to demand from new businesses attracted into Shropshire as inward 
investment and the significant growth o f existing businesses, supported by the 
delivery of new housing as set out in the Shropshire Economic Growth 
Strategy.  
3.141.  This approach responds to the Council’s objective to prioritise significant new 
development and infrastructure investment  into the Strategic, Principal and 
Key Centres and identified Strategic Sites to create ‘growth zones’ along the 
‘strategic corridors’ through Shropshire and making effective use of the rail 
and road routs through these corridors. The sequential release of  additional 
employment land for development in the ‘strategic corridors’ may also help to 
attract major employment development into the County.  
3.142.  The ‘strategic corridors’ are:  
a. Eastern Belt M54/A5, A41/A464 and A4169/A458/A454 , supporting 
Shropshire’s motor way, road and rail links to the West Midlands region 
and the role of the West Midlands Combined Authority, including 
opportunities in and around:  
- Shrewsbury as the Strategic Centre and County Town of Shropshire;  
- Bridgnorth as a Principal Centre in the Shro pshire Green Belt;  
- Shifnal and Albrighton as Key Centres in the Shropshire Green Belt;  
- RAF Cosford as a significant location in the Shropshire Green Belt;  
- Ironbridge through the redevelopment of the former Power Station site.  
b. A5 West corridor  supporting Sh ropshire’s road and rail links to the 
Northern Powerhouse through Cheshire and Mid / North Wales including 
opportunities in and around:  
- Oswestry as a Principal Centre and the second market town in 
Shropshire.  
c. Central Shropshire  supporting the primary locat ion for growth in the 
County situated around the hub of the road and rail networks and 
focussed on opportunities in and around:  
- Shrewsbury as the Strategic Centre and County Town of Shropshire.  
d. North East Shropshire and the A41 corridor supporting Shropshi re’s 
links to the Northern Powerhouse through Cheshire and connected to the 
delivery of HS2 later in the Local Plan period, including opportunities in 
and around:  
- Whitchurch and Market Drayton as Principal Centres;  
- Tern Hill through the redevelopment of th e Clive Barracks;  
- Shifnal and Albrighton as Key Centres in the Shropshire Green Belt;  
- RAF Cosford as a significant location in the Shropshire Green Belt.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 65 
  e. A49 corridor  supporting Shropshire road and rail links to other English 
regions to the north and in the south -west and to South Wales including 
opportunities in and around:  
- Whitchurch as a Principal Centre;  
- Wem as a Key Centre;  
- Ludlow as a Principal Centre;  
- Craven Ar ms as a Key Centre  
- Church Stretton as a Key Centre within the Shropshire Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
3.143.  Shropshire Economic Growth Strategy  seeks to promote a ‘step change’ in 
the capacity and productivity of the local economy.  The ‘strategic corridors’ 
have the potential to support this economic objective in two key areas: they 
are the preferred locations for business investment on allocated employment 
sites in Strategic, Principal and Key settlements; and they may function as the 
location for  the release of significant sites that are suitable and accessible for 
inward investment on identified ‘Strategic Sites’ at RAF Cosford, at Clive 
Barracks, Tern Hill and Ironbridge Power Station and on larger windfall sites.  
3.144.  Development proposals in ‘strat egic corridors’ should respond positively to the 
presence of environmental constraints particularly in the Shropshire Green 
Belt and the Shropshire Hills AONB. In these locations there will be a need to 
prove the ‘very special circumstances’ for developmen t in the Green Belt and 
the ‘exceptional circumstances for development in the AONB as required in 
Policy SP13 . This requires further justification for  those types of development 
that are not considered appropriate under national policy.  These types of 
development will be determined against the requirements of national and local 
policy.  
3.145.  Development proposals in ‘strategic corridors’ should also recognis e the need 
to protect the intrinsic character and beauty of the Countryside, landscape 
character and value and the significance of the natural and historic 
environment.  These matters are addressed further in the objectives of other 
policies in the Local P lan and in Neighbourhood Plans, Community / Parish 
Plans and in growth strategies for settlements across the County . 
3.146.  The County accommodates a broad range of existing land uses in the 
countryside between settlements.  As some of these land uses mature and 
the sites they occupy are no longer needed or prove to be unsuitable for 
modern business operations these sites may be capable of redevelopment for 
alternative uses. This has already occurred at Ironbridge Power Station 
(Ironbridge) and is expected to occu r at the Clive Barracks, Tern Hill.  These 
sites may be considered for redevelopment especially where they will perform 
a function within the employment land supply not already served by the 
existing employment allocations in the plan or where they satisfy  a demand for 
inward investment into the County and may also improve the housing offer 
within the Place Plan area or ‘strategic corridor’.  
3.147.  This requires the identification of sequentially preferable development in the 
Strategic Corridors to sustain the urb an focus in the Strategic Approach of the 
Local Plan.  The Strategic, Principal and Key settlements in these ‘strategic 
corridors’ are the primary focus for development and infrastructure investment 
for economic growth.  This urban focus will help to creat e a sustainable 
pattern of development in the County, support the needs of the majority of 
Shropshire’s communities, significantly reduce the need to travel and to help Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 66 
  the County respond positively to the challenges of the Climate Change 
emergency.  
3.148.  It will be essential when promoting development in the ‘Strategic Corridors’ to 
sequentially promote the ‘Strategic Sites’ identified at Clive Barracks, Tern Hill 
on the A41 and RAF Cosford at the junction of the A41 with the M54 Junction 
3 where development can not reasonably be accommodated on existing 
allocated sites in the Strategic, Principal or Key Settlements.  The sequential 
release of windfall sites will prefer brownfield windfall development 
opportunities which respond to a clearly identifiable, investme nt demand, are 
in locations close to a settlement and which benefit from accessibility to the 
rail and road network through the ‘strategic corridor’ and in accordance with 
national and local policy.  
3.149.  The release of greenfield sites for windfall development will only be permitted 
in exceptional circumstances where the strategic objectives of national and 
local policy are fully satisfied in relation to the protection of the Green Belt, 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Countryside, landscape value and the 
natural and historic environments. These proposals are expected to be large 
and significant investment opportunity that cannot reasonably access 
sequentially preferable sites for reasons including the location, scale, 
availability and accessibility of those alternative sites.  These proposed 
developments will secure the delivery of the greenfield site as a fully serviced 
and developed employment area, meeting the needs of the proposed 
occupiers of the site and the requirements for off -site infrastructure 
investments to serve the ‘strategic corridor’.  
3.150.  It is essential that proposals for development sites in the ‘strategic corridors’ 
provide the infrastructure to ensure these sites are readily available for 
development.  This infrastructure investment should furt her realise the 
benefits of rail and road connectivity in the ‘strategic corridor’ and deliver 
significant investment and employment especially in Class B land uses.  This 
focus on Class B land uses seeks to diversify the mainly ‘service based’ 
economy of Shropshire and to boost employment in key business sectors and 
clusters.

  SP15.  Whole Estate Plans  
1. Whole Estate Plans are a method by which Estates can articulate their long -term vision 
for their land and premises  interests and how these will be achieved. In recognition of the 
nature of Shropshire, and the potentially important role they play in managing land within 
the County, Whole Estate Plans prepared by Estates will be endorsed by the Council and 
used as a mat erial consideration in decision making where they have demonstrated all of 
the following:    
a. The objectives, policies and land use proposals of the Whole Estate Plan complement 
and are consistent with the objectives and policies of the Local Plan;  
b. It has been prepared in collaboration with relevant external organisations, including 
statutory bodies; and 
c. It has been subject to meaningful public consultation . 
 
Explanation  
3.151.  Whole Estate Plans are non -statutory plans , produced by Estates themselves,  
which can cover a number of issues based around the central principle of 
ensuring  sustainable land management.  The intention is these are used to 
express a long -term vision and objectives for the way an Estate manages and 
utilises its land and assets.  
3.152.  Given the rural nature of much of Shropshire, it is perhaps unsurprising  that 
there are a large number of Estates  active in the County , many of whom are 
engaged in the preparation of Whole Estate Plan s. This policy therefore 
acknowledges the  important role these organisation s play in the general day 
to day management of land and premises, and recognises that there is 
potentially a planning related role for Whole Esta te Plans in the decision 
making process.      
3.153.  The policy therefore seeks to identify the considerations which will need to 
apply before the Council will consider ‘endorsing’ a Whole Est ate Plan as a 
material consideration in relevant planning decisions.  This does not replace 
the primacy of the Local Plan in decision making, rather it seeks to identify 
where there could be positive added value  to the planning process.

  SP16.  Strategic Planning for Minerals  
Shropshire’s important and finite mineral resources will be safeguarded to avoid 
unnecessary sterilisation and there will be a sustainable approach to mineral working which 
balances environmental considerations against the need to maintain an adequate and 
steady supply of minerals t o meet the justifiable needs of the economy and society.  
This will be achieved by:  
1. Protecting Mineral Safeguarding Areas (MSA’s) and rail freight facilities which could 
contribute to the sustainable transport of minerals. The broad extent of MSA’s is defin ed 
on Figure SP1 5.1. Non -mineral development within and adjacent to these areas or near 
protected rail  freight sites will be expected to avoid sterilising or unduly restricting the 
working of proven mineral resources, or the operation of mineral transport facilities, 
consistent with the requirements of national policy and Policy DP29 ; 
2. Encouraging the comprehensive working of mineral resources wherever possible and 
improved resource efficiency by supporting the development and retention of recycling 
facilities which will im prove the availability and quality of secondary and recycled 
aggregates in appropriate locations as set out in Policy  SP17 ; 
3. Maintaining landbanks of permitted reserves for aggregates consistent with the 
requirements of national policy guidance. Shropshire will save existing unimplemented 
allocations for sand and gravel to help deliver productive capacity over the Plan period 
at the level of the 3 year average production in 2018 plus 20%, as its contribution to the 
sub-national guidelines for the West Midlands. (See Policy  DP30 ); 
4. Only supporting proposals for sand and gravel working outside these broad locations 
and existing permitted reserves, where this would prevent the sterilisation of resources, 
or where significant environmental benefits would be obtained, or where the proposed 
site would be significantly more acceptable overall than the allocated sites;  
5. Supporting environmentally acceptable development which facilitates the production of 
other mineral resources such as clay and building stone to meet both local needs, 
including lo cally distinctive materials, and to help meet cross boundary requirements;  
6. Priority will be given to environmentally acceptable restoration and aftercare proposals 
which can deliver targeted environmental or community benefits consistent with Policies 
DP12 , DP14 , DP16 , DP17 , DP19  and any other relevant policies within this Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
3.154.  Minerals are finite resources and so their conservation and waste 
minimisation are important planning considerations. In order to conserve 
mineral resources, every effort will be made to ensure that, where practicable, 
known mineral resources are not steri lised by other forms of development. 
The broad extent of Mineral Safeguarding Areas (MSAs) is illustrated on 
Figure SP13.1 . Where development is unavoidable, the value of mineral 
resources should be captured for appropriate end uses by prior extraction 
wherever possible (Policy DP29 ). However, the recognition of these areas 
does not imply that any application for the working of minerals within them will  
necessarily be granted planning permission.

More detailed information is available on an ‘interactive’ mineral safeguarding 
map which is available on the Shropshire Council’s website.  
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 70 
  3.155.  The comprehensive working of mineral resources will be expected unless the 
cumulative impacts of mineral working would make further development 
unacceptable. To meet the objectives of sustainable resource management 
and the principles of a circula r economy Shropshire Council will support the 
recovery and use of secondary and recycled materials wherever possible to 
limit the consumption of new mineral resources.  
3.156.  National policy requires strategic planning to secure an adequate and steady 
supply of mineral aggregates. Shropshire is an important source of mineral 
aggregates, particularly crushed rock. Mineral planning is co -ordinated at a 
sub-national level by the West Midlands Aggregates  Working Party, which has 
been chaired by Shropshire Council since 2014. Best available evidence 
indicates that aggregate production in Shropshire remains above both the 10 
year rolling average and the landbank of permissions for both sand and gravel 
and c rushed rock have remained consistently above the minimum level 
required by national policy.  
3.157.  Increasing rates of housing and employment development have strengthened 
the demand for construction aggregates within Shropshire and in the adjacent 
areas which i t supplies in recent  years. In light of the recovery of demand, and 
the fact that the last 3 years have seen record levels of housing delivery in 
Shropshire, the Local Plan adopts a precautionary approach to its Production 
Requirement for sand and gravel , based on the average of the last 3 years 
production plus a growth allowance of 20%.  
3.158.  Despite this increasing demand, significant  aggregate resources are already 
available from permitted sites and unimplemented site allocations made in the 
SAMDev Plan which have been saved. There are also a number of windfall 
applications for sand and gravel which have significantly increased productive 
capacity and further significant windfall applications are expected.  The 
availability of aggregates therefore remains well a bove minimum guidelines  
and no  additional site allocations are therefore proposed as part of this Local 
Plan.  In taking planning decisions, Shropshire Council has consistently 
responded positively to both planned and windfall applications to release more 
material to maintain productive capacity to counter balance the impact of 
unworked site commitments.  
3.159.  Mineral working is a temporary, but long -term activity. The restoration and 
aftercare of mineral sites provides positive opportunities to deliver 
environmen tal or community benefits, including land uses which will help 
adapt to or mitigate the effects of climate change and contributions to Green 
Infrastructure  in accordance with Policy DP14 . 
3.160.  Support will be given to the use of construction and demolition waste residues 
following appropriate recovery and recycling, as a restoration medium in 
suitable former mineral workings where this does not adversely affect the 
water environment and involves acceptable amenity effects.

  SP17.  Waste  Management Infrastructure  
Resource recovery and waste management facilities and services will help to deliver greater 
resource efficiency for communities and businesses and make a positive contribute to the 
transition to a low carbon economy. This will be achieved by:  
1. Encouraging proposals for additional capacity to divert waste away from landfill in a way 
consistent with the waste hierarchy and  the principles and targets of national and local 
policies and strategies, including the principle of ‘equivalent self -sufficiency’ and an 
allowance for cross boundary waste flows;  
2. Supporting the development of sites to deliver additional waste recycling a nd recovery 
facilities in accessible locations close to the Strategic, Principal and Key Centres  having 
regard to other relevant policies of this Local Plan . Outside these locations, Shropshire 
Council will support applications for smaller scale waste facilities capable of meeting 
local needs in locations which are consistent with the principles and site identification 
criteria set out in national and regional  policy;  
3. Supporting the co -location of waste facilities and the integration of new waste facilities 
or space in the design of new development;  
4. Requiring applications for all types of development to include information about the 
management of waste during t heir construction and subsequent operation;  
5. Ensuring that the continued operation of existing waste management facilities in 
locations which are consistent with the site identification criteria for new sites is 
safeguarded, including against the encroachme nt of incompatible uses, in a way 
consistent with national guidance.  
 
Explanation  
3.161.  The Government’s  25 Year Environment Plan (2018) promotes resource 
efficiency and supports the move to a low carbon, circular economy. The Plan 
identifies a number of waste management objectives, including:  
a. Eliminating avoidable waste of all kinds by 2050;  
b. Phasing out all avoidable plastic waste by 2030;  and 
c. Prevent food waste going to landfill by 2030.  
3.162.  The national  Resources and Waste Strategy (2018) sets out a series of 
targets to help deliver these objectives, including:  
a. 65% recycling of municipal waste by 2035;  
b. Mandatory business waste recycling, food waste and garden waste 
recycling collections;  
c. A maximum of 10% municipal waste to landfill and zero food waste to 
landfill by 2030;  
d. Eliminate avoidable plastic waste by 204 2 and all avoidable waste by 
2050;  and 
e. Reduce waste exports and manage more of our own waste in the UK . 
3.163.  Addressing these  targets may require the expansion or alteration of existing 
waste management facilities or the construction of additional facilities in  
Shropshire.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 72 
  3.164.  The Local Plan must address all types of waste. Our evidence base (see 
Waste Technical Background report) tells us that about half of the 1 million 
tonnes of waste generated  in Shropshire in 2018 was managed within the 
County and the majority of the remainder was managed in neighbouring areas 
of the West Midlands. Whilst Shropshire remains a net exporter of waste, 
around 163,000 tonnes of waste was imported to Shropshire in 2018. Over 
the Local Plan period to 2038, the quantity of Household Ind ustrial and 
Commercial waste is forecast to grow by 19% to around 723,000 tonnes. 
However, record levels of housing delivery in 2017 and 2018 mean that the 
annual quantity of construction waste is not expected to increase above the 
quantity generated in 20 18. In the absence of a detailed breakdown of 
projected economic growth, no change has been assumed in the quantity of 
hazardous waste produced in Shropshire. This approach is set out in Table 
SP17.1 below:  
Table SP1 7.1: Forecast Waste Arisings 2018 -2038  
Type of Waste  2018  Forecast 2038  
Municipal  166,000  197,000  
Industrial & Commercial  443,000  525,000  
Construction  346,000  346,000  
Hazardous  24,000  24,000  
Total  979,000  1,092,000  
 
3.165.  Of the waste generated in Shropshire, about 86% is recycled or has value 
recovered from it and only about 14% is sent for disposal. Of the waste 
handled at waste management facilities in Shropshire, 74% is recycled or has 
value recovered from it, often at composting and biological treatment facilities. 
The majority of imported waste was recycled  or recovered. Shropshire 
performs particularly strongly on municipal waste management, with 
approximately 57% of waste being recycled and composted in 2018 and a 
further 41% subject to energy recovery. This has delivered a significant 
reduction in landfill from 34% in 2013 to only 2% in 2018.  
3.166.  The best available information suggests that there were about 136 consented 
waste sites in Shropshire in 2018. Of these sites , about 70% are classed as 
operational. In theory, these sites provide almost 1 million tonnes of capacity, 
although they only handled approximately  613,000 tonnes of locally generated 
waste and imported materials in 2018. The new facilities which have bee n 
permitted during 2017 -18 will deliver 50,000 tonnes of additional annual waste 
management capacity for commercial waste recycling and recovery. 
Increases in energy costs and changes in international trade policy may be 
responsible for the continued incre ase in applications for new commercial 
waste management capacity, particularly farm -based anaerobic digesters and 
this will help local businesses to mitigate their energy costs and secure 
improved resource efficiency. The wider trend is that, during the pe riod 2013 -
2018, applications for new waste management facilities, once operational, will 
deliver about 5,000 tonnes of additional municipal waste management 
capacity and 310,000 tonnes of additional business waste management 
capacity.  
3.167.  Most modern waste ma nagement facilities are enclosed within buildings and 
can be satisfactorily located on industrial or brownfield land within or near 
urban areas.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 73 
  3.168.  Shropshire Council will safeguard existing waste management facilities and 
employment land suitable for waste i nfrastructure in appropriate locations in 
accordance with Policies SP13. Facilities designed to treat biodegradable 
wastes should generally be located away from sensitive land uses such as 
housing and schools in order to control potential environmental impacts.  
3.169.  The capacity of existing consented waste management facilities, together with 
those employment sites identified as suitable for recycling and environmental 
industries provide sufficient  throughput capacity to allow Shropshire to 
continue to manage an equival ent annual amount of waste to that which is 
forecast during the Plan period to 2038. The type of existing facilities and 
additional sites will support the development of facilities to recover the 
material resource and energy value from a greater proportion  of waste in line 
with national and local policy objectives. Shropshire is likely to remain reliant 
on the export of some material for specialist processing and disposal but will 
continue to counterbalance this through the provision of recycling and 
recove ry capacity, particularly for biodegradable wastes, for imported wastes.  
3.170.  The availability of landfill void in Shropshire is declining and the combination 
of economies of scale and environmental constraints such as groundwater 
means that the potential for n ew landfill is very limited. An assessment of 
potential locations for future landfill sites in Shropshire in 2003 resulted in the 
identification of a single site  which was subsequently rejected during 
examination.  
3.171.  The Shropshire Local Plan does not theref ore identify sites for landfill, but 
instead seeks to reinforce the development of a low carbon economy by 
identifying additional sites for recycling and recovery activities sufficient to 
provide an equivalent capacity to the quantity of waste which would be 
exported to neighbouring areas for disposal over the plan period to 2038.  
3.172.  Restricted access to recycling services, particularly for smaller companies 
which comprise the largest part of the Shropshire economy, means that they 
currently have higher overhe ads than companies in urban areas with better 
access to such facilities. Environmentally acceptable services and facilities 
which would improve access to more sustainable forms of waste management 
for smaller companies will be supported to help mitigate th is financial burden 
and support the transition to a low carbon economy.  
3.173.  The expansion of existing sites and the provision of new sites requires a 
pattern which addresses identified local need (derived from existing and 
projected shortfalls in capacity). Pr ovision should be integrated as part of new 
development wherever possible in order to promote source separation of 
materials.

  4. Development Management  Policies  
 
Residential  
DP1.  Residential Mix  
1. Residential development will be expected to provide a mix of dwelling sizes, types and 
tenures in order to meet the identified needs of local communities, including families 
with children, older people, people wishing to build their own homes and people with 
disabilities and special needs, in accord ance with Shropshire Council’s Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA).  
2. On sites of 5 or more dwellings : 
a. In locations where in the last 5 years a Local Housing Need Survey has been 
undertaken through the ‘Right Home Right Place’ initiative or an equival ent survey 
endorsed by Shropshire Council, at least 50% of open market dwellings will reflect 
the profile of housing need established within the survey . The remainder of the open 
market dwellings will include a suitable mix and variety of dwelling sizes ; or 
b. At least 25% of open market dwellings will be dwellings with 2 bedrooms or less. At 
least a further 25% of open market housing will be dwellings with 3 bedrooms or 
less. The remainder of the open market dwellings will include a suitable mix and 
variety o f dwelling sizes.  
3. All affordable dwellings will achieve the nationally described space standard. All open 
market dwellings are strongly encouraged to comply with the nationally described space 
standard.  
4. All dwellings specifically designed for older people  or those with disabilities or special 
needs will be built to the M4(3) (wheelchair user dwellings) standard within Building 
Regulations.  
5. On sites of 5 or more dwellings , at least  5% of the dwellings wil l be built to the M4(3) 
(wheelchair user dwellings) standard within Building Regulations and a further 70% of 
the dwellings will be built to the M4(2) (accessible and adaptable dwellings) or higher 
standard within Building Regulations, unless site -specific  factors indicate that step -free 
access cannot be achieved.  
6. On sites of  50 or more dwellings : 
a. An appropriate range of s pecialist housing designed to meet the diverse needs of 
older people, such as: age -restricted general market housing; retirement living or 
sheltered housing; extra care housing or housing -with-care; and/or residential care 
homes and nursing homes  will be provided . 
b. An appropriate range of s pecialist dwellings to meet the needs of those with 
disabilities and special needs  will be provided . 
 
Explanation  
4.1. Achieving an appropriate dwelling mix is an important element in seeking to 
create sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities. The key source of 
evidence for determining housing mix are the Strategic Housing Market 
Assessme nt (SHMA) for Shropshire , the Draft Housing Strategy for 
Shropshire , the Shropshire HomePoint Housing Waiting List  and the ‘Right 
Home Right Place’ Local Housing Need Surveys being undertaken across 
Shropshire .  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 75 
  4.2. The SHMA analyses the need for different siz es and types of dwellings 
recognising that households of different ages and different compositions will 
have differing needs. The Draft Housing Strategy for Shropshire presents a 
comprehensive picture of local housing needs, challenges, issues and sets 
out 6 key objectives matched with identified opportunities to take forward and 
action.  The Shropshire HomePoint Housing Waiting List provides a one -stop 
solution for people seeking housing. The ‘Right Home Right Place’ Local 
Housing Need Surveys are a Shropsh ire Council -led initiative to help identify 
housing needs in the communities across Shropshire.  
  
Number of Bedrooms  
4.3. The ‘Right Home Right Place’ Local Housing Need Surveys provide s 
information on the type, scale and location of future homes needed within a 
community . Further information on The ‘Right Home Right Place’ Local 
Housing Need Surveys is available at: www.righthomerig htplace.co.uk   
4.4. To ensure that new residential development meets the needs of communities 
across Shropshire, where in the last 5 years (reflecting the review cycle for the 
‘Right Home Right Place’ Local Housing Need Survey) a ‘Right Home Right 
Place’ Local Housing Need Survey or an equivalent Local Housing Need 
Survey endorsed by Shropshire Council  has been undertaken , it is considered 
appropriate on sites of 5 or more dwellings to require at least 50% of open 
market dwellings to reflect the profile of housi ng need established within the 
survey.  The remainder of the open market dwellings will include a suitable mix 
and variety of dwelling sizes.  
4.5. Where an appropriate Local Housing Need survey has not been undertaken  in 
the last 5 years , it remains important t o ensure that new residential 
development meets the ne eds of communities across Shropshire. Analysis 
within the SHMA indicates that a significant proportion of the new dwellings 
required during the Local Plan period will be  1, 2 and 3 bedrooms in size. 
Specifically, the SHMA indicates that around 3 2.7% of the dwellings needed 
will be  1 or 2 bedroom s in size and a further 43.5% will be  3 bedroom s in size . 
This demand for 1, 2 and 3 bedroom dwellings also reflects the view oft en 
expressed by local communities when discussing their local housing needs. 
As such it is considered appropriate to  require at least 25% of open market 
dwellings with 2 bedroom or less and a further 25% to be three bedroom or 
less, on sites of 5 or more d wellings . The remainder of the open market 
dwellings will include a suitable mix and variety of dwelling sizes.  
4.6. This approach ensures that new development will include an appropriate mix 
of dwellings to meet the needs of communities, provides certainty abo ut 
requirements and also allows flexibility for innovation within development.  
 
Nationally Described Space Standard  
4.7. Providing dwellings with sufficient internal floorspace positively contributes to 
the future occupier’s ability to achieve a high -quality of  life and is responsive 
to changing household requirements, by increasing the ability to include 
adaptations at a later date. This is particularly important given that people are 
living longer and Shropshire’s aging demographics. This is equally relevant t o 
market and affordable housing provision and is consistent with the key 
objectives of the Draft Housing Strategy and this Local Plan  (as captured 
within Policy SP1).  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 76 
  4.8. The Technical Housing Standards – National Described Space Standards 
(2015) offer a good basis for the design of new developments. They set out 
requirements for the Gross Internal (floor) A rea of new dwellings at a defined 
level of occupancy as well as floor areas and dimensions for key parts of the 
home, notably bedrooms, storage and floor to ceiling height.  
4.9. In summary, the nationally described space standard (2015 ), requires:  
a. The dwelling provides at least the following gross internal floor area and 
built-in storage area:  
 
b. A dwelling with two or more bedspaces has at least one double (or twin) 
bedroom.  
c. In order to provide one bedspace, a single bedroom has a floor area of at 
least 7.5m2 and is at least 2.15m wide.  
d. In order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor 
area of at least 11.5m2.  
e. One double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide and every other 
double (or twin) bedroom is at least 2.55m wide.  
f. Any area with a headroom of less than 1.5m is not counted within the 
Gross Internal Area unless used solely for storage (if the area under the 
stairs is to be used for storage, assume a general floor area of 1m2 within 
the Gross Internal Area).  
g. Any other area that is used solely for storage and has a headroom of 900 -
1500mm (such as under eaves) is counted at 50% of its floor area, and any 
area lower than 900mm is not counted at all.  
h. A built -in wardrobe counts towards the Gross Internal Area and bedroom 
floor ar ea requirements, but should not reduce the effective width of the 
room below the minimum widths set out above. The built -in area in excess 
of 0.72m2 in a double bedroom and 0.36m2 in a single bedroom counts 
towards the built -in storage requirement.  
i. The min imum floor to ceiling height is 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross 
Internal Area.  
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 77 
  4.10.  The full nationally described space standard can be viewed on the GOV.UK 
website at:  
www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/52453
1/160519_Nationally_Described_Space_Standard____Final_Web_version.pdf  
4.11.  The SHMA  calculat es that in Shropshire, households living in social rented 
accommodation are generally more likely to be overcrowded than households 
living in private rented and owner -occupied accommodation  (including shared 
ownership) . It calculates that  in 2018 around 11% of househ olds in social 
rented accommodation were overcrowded as opposed to around 6%  of 
households in private rented and 2 % of households in owner -occupied 
accommodation  (including shared ownership) .  
4.12.  Furthermore, trends indicate that the percentage of households in 
overcrowded accommodation is increasing faster for those in social rented 
accommodation than those in private rented or owner -occupied 
accommodation  (including shared ownership) . Specifically, the SHMA 
calculates that between 2011 and 2018 overcrowded h ouseholds increased 
by 103% in social rented properties, 84% in private rented properties and  49% 
in owner -occupied properties  (including shared ownership) .  
4.13.  Where households live in overcrowded properties, this adds pressure to and 
increases the importanc e of available floorspace. Given the percentage of 
households living in social rented accommodation that are overcrowded and 
the fact that the trend illustrates that this percentage is increasing, it is 
important that these properties have an appropriate a mount of floorspace 
through compliance with the nationally described space standard.  
4.14.  As such requiring compliance with the nationally described space standard 
through this Local Plan policy will ensure that households living in affordable 
properties have an appropriate amount of floorspace  and a high level of social 
amenity . It is also considered that such compliance will prevent an y 
unacceptable reduction s in the size of future affordable accommodation  
provided . 
4.15.  Furthermore, increasingly compliance with the nationally described space 
standard is a requirement to access many of the funding mechanisms 
available to support delivery of affordable housing, in recognition of the 
importance of ensuring affordable dwellin gs have sufficient floorspace to meet 
the needs of their occupiers. Therefore, this Local Plan policy ensures 
consistency with this funding requirement.  
4.16.  Open market dwellings are also strongly encouraged to comply with the 
Technical Housing Standards – National Described Space Standards (2015)  
to ensure that they provide a high level of social amenity, positively contribute 
to the future occupier’s ability to achieve a high -quality of life  and increase the 
ability  to respond to changes in household requirem ents. 
 
Access and Use of Dwelling s 
4.17.  Government’s reform of Health and Adult Social Care is underpinned by a 
principle of sustaining people at home for as long as possible . This was 
reflected in the recent changes to Building Regulations relating to adaptations 
and wheelchair accessible homes within the approved Part M of the Building 
Regulations, available to view on the GOV.UK website at : 
www.gov.uk/government/publications/access -to-and-use-of-buildings -
approved -document -m Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 78 
  4.18.  This introduces three categories of dwellings:  
a. M4(1) Categor y 1: Visitable dwellings.  
b. M4(2)  Category 2: Accessible and adaptable dwellings . 
c. M4(3) Category 3: Wheelchair user dwellings . 
4.19.  M4(1) is mandatory for all new dwellings unless one of the optional 
requirements M4(2) or M4(3) applies. M4(2) and M4(3) apply where a Local 
Plan introduces such a requirement.    
4.20.  Growth in the number of older persons’ households is a key feature in the 
population and household change which is projected  to occur in Shropshire 
over the Local Plan period from 2016 to 2038. According to analysis of 
projections within the SHMA , during the Local Plan period:  
a. Households with a Household Reference Person aged 65 -84 years are 
projected to increase by 42.8%. This level of growth is well above 
estimated growth nationally and regionally (41.0% and 32.8% 
respectively).  
b. Households with an elderly Household Reference Person (85 years and 
over) are projected to significantly increase by 130.5%, more than 
doubling in size from 6,900 households in 2016 to 15,900 by 2038. This 
growth is substantially highe r than that projected regionally and nationally 
(99.7% and 94.5% respectively).  
c. The balance of households with a working age Household  Reference 
Person  (16-64 years ) to those with a n older Household  Reference Person 
(65 years and over) will change from 64. 6% and 35.4% in 2016 to 51.9% 
and 48.1%  in 2038 . This suggests in the long -term there will be 
approaching as many working age independent households as older 
dependent households in Shropshire.  
d. Much of the household growth projected is driven by increases in 
households with an older Household Reference Person (65 years and 
over). 
4.21.  At the time of the 2011 Census, 8.4% of  people  in Shropshire had a long-term 
health problem or disability  that ‘limit ed day-to-day activities a lot’ and 10.2% 
of people  had a disability or long -term health problem that ‘limit ed day-to day 
activities a little’ . The prevalence rates of people living with a long-term health 
problem or disabilit y was also much higher amongst the older population , with 
54.6% of people in households  with a long -term health problem or disability  in 
the 65 years and over  age category .  
4.22.  According to the Projecting Older People Population Information (POPPI) 
System, the number of people aged  65 years and over who are unable to 
manage at least one activity on their own is projected to increase in 
Shropshire by around 63 .3% between 2017 and  2035 (data not available for 
2016 and after  2035).  
4.23.  Nationally , the English Household Survey  estimate d that: 
a. In 2007/08 , 2.8%5 of households had at least one wheelchair user ;  
b. In 2011/12, 3.3%5 of households  had at least one wheelchair user ; and 
c. In 2013/14, 3.4%6 of households  had at least one wheelchair user .

6 Shropshire Council, (2020), St rategic Housing Market Assessment (Part 2)  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 79 
  4.24.  It is perhaps unsurprising given the demographics of the Country that the 
percentage of households that had at least one wheelchair user increased 
during this period and is likely to have increased further since.  
4.25.  Furthermore, t he English Household Survey data from 2007/08  and 2013/14 
estimate d that the number of households that had at least one wheelchair 
user was notably higher for households living in affordable housing, at 7.1% in 
2007/08 and 6.7% in 2013/14  (data not available for 2011/12) . 
4.26.  The SHMA estimate s that for the total projected growth in households in 
Shropshire during the Local Plan period , 13% will require wheelchair 
accessible dwellings, M4(3) standard  and 33% will require accessible and 
adaptable dwellings to M4(2) standard.  
4.27.  However closer inspection of household  growth  by the age of Household 
Reference Person , reveals a significantly higher level of household growth in 
households with a Household Reference Person aged 65 years and over. 
With a higher prevalence of long-term health problem s or disabilit ies amongst 
older people, the importance of ensuring that th e Local Plan does  not 
underestimate the level of need for accessible housing that meets M 4(3) and 
M4(2) standards  is very much apparent . 
4.28.  As such, t he SHMA consider s the number of older households (with a 
Household Reference Person aged 65 years and over ) with a long -term health 
problem or disability that impacts on their housing needs . It estimates  that 
such households will  increase by an amount equivalent to 77% of the total 
growth in older households  over the Local Plan period , requiring either M4(2) 
or M4(3) standard dwellings .  
4.29.  The SHMA also estimate s that the number of older wheelchair user  
households  is projected to increase by an amount equivalent to 10% of the 
total growth in older households , requiring M4(3) standard dwellings . This 
suggest s the re maining 67 % of older households with a long -term health 
problem or disability that impacts on their housing needs will require M4(2) 
standard dwellings , although it is acknowledged that a proportion of this need 
will be met within specialist older person a ccommodation.  
4.30.  Therefore , it is considered appropriate to require that on sites of 5 or more 
dwellings 5% of dwellings meet M4(3) standard and a further 70% of dwellings 
meet M4(2) standard, unless site -specific factors indicate that step -free 
access cannot be achieved, given:  
a. Government’s aspirations to sustain people at home for as long as 
possible ;  
b. The projected growth in older households  and the contribution that th is 
growth make s to total household growth in Shropshire ;  
c. The higher prevalence of long -term health problems or disabilities amongst 
older people ; and  
d. The identified need for M4(2) and M4(3) standard dwellings to 
accommodate older households in Shropshire with a long -term health 
problem or disability that impacts on their housing needs over the Local 
Plan period . 
4.31.  It is also considered appropriate to require  all dwellings specifically designed 
for the elderly or those with disabilities to meet M4(3) (wheelchair user 
dwelli ngs) standard within  Building Regulations. If site -specific factors indicate 
that step -free access cannot be achieved, it is questionable as to whether the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 80 
  site or element of the site should be identified for dwellings specifically to meet 
the needs of the elderly or those with disabilities.  
4.32.  This policy requirement is consistent with the National Planning Practice 
Guidance advice on Housing: Optional Technical Standards, which specifies 
in Paragraph 5 (ID: 56-005-20150327)  “The National Planning Policy 
Fram ework (NPPF) is clear that local planning authorities should plan to 
create safe, accessible environments and promote inclusion and community 
cohesion. This includes buildings and their surrounding spaces. Local 
planning authorities should take account of evidence that demonstrates a 
clear need for housing for people with specific housing needs and plan to 
meet this need”.   
4.33.  It should be noted that M4(3) (wheelchair user dwellings)  standard within  
Building Regulations sets a distinction between wheelchair accessible (a 
home readily useable by a wheelchair user at the point of completion) and 
wheelchair adaptable (a home that can be easily adapted to meet the needs 
of a household including wheelchair users) dwellings.  
4.34.  Where dwellings are required to meet M4(3) (wheelchair user dwellings)  
standard within  Building Regulations to comply with this policy, they will 
normally consist of wheelchair adaptable homes. Wheelchair accessible 
homes will only be required where Shropsh ire Council is responsible for 
nominating a person to live in the dwelling.  
4.35.  This approach is co nsistent with N ational Planning Practice Guidance  advice 
on Housing: Optional Technical Standards, which specifies in Paragraph 9 
(ID: 56-009-20150327)  “Wheelcha ir accessible homes will only be required 
where the Council is responsible for nominating a person to live in the 
dwelling”,  
4.36.  It should also be noted that where references to the Building 
Regulations in this policy change, the requirement shall be taken to  refer 
to the most up -to-date standard.  
 
Housing for Older People and those with Disabilities or S pecial Needs  
4.37.  The policy approach which enables people to remain in their own homes for 
longer, is complemented by policies which support the provision of specialist 
accommodation for the elderly. The National Planning Practice Guidance  on 
Housing for Older People recog nises that there is a significant amount of 
variability in the types of specialist accommodation for older people, 
identifying four main categories which can be summarised as:  
a. “Age -restricted general market housing;  
b. Retirement living or sheltered housing;  
c. Extra care housing or housing -with-care; and  
d. Residential care homes and nursing homes”.  
4.38.  Ultimately access to care in these facilities enables provision to be sustainable 
for older people as physical and mental capacities diminish. As such provision 
of appr opriate care is crucial to ensure that facilities can meet the changing 
needs of older people.  
4.39.  Developers are encouraged to seek pre -application advice to establish 
whether their proposal may be classified as Use Class C2 or C3. When 
determining the Use Cl ass of housing for older people, Shropshire Council 
considers that it is most approp riate to apply the Office for National Statistics 
and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government definition of a Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 81 
  dwelling. Specifically, where a unit is self -contained, with its own living space, 
bedroom, bathroom and kitchen behind their own front door, they are 
considered to represent Use Class C3. Generally:  
a. Developments which align with the definition of age -restricted general 
market housing, retirement livin g or sheltered housing; and extra care 
housing or housing -with-care are considered Use Class C3. These types of 
facilities seek to maintain a balance between independent living and 
providing varying scales of care.  
b. Developments which align with the definit ion of residential care homes and 
nursing homes are considered Use Class C2. These types of facilities 
provide a high level of care but do not usually include support services for 
independent living.  
4.40.  The SHMA projects that over the Local Plan period, there  will be a need for 
around an additional 3,500 specialist older persons accommodation units and 
around 2,500 additional units of residential care provision.   
4.41.  Given th ese projections and the  significant growth in older households in 
Shropshire  projected to occur over the Local Plan period , it is considered 
appropriate to ensure that larger development sites include specialist housing 
designed to meet the diverse needs of older people , whilst also providing 
flexibility about types and levels of such accommodation to respond to site 
specific circumstances.  
4.42.  Appropriate accommodation is  also required by people with disabilitie s or 
special needs . As such it is also considered appropriate to ensure that larger 
development sites include specialist housing designed to meet the needs of 
people with disabilities or special needs , whilst also providing flexibility about 
types and levels of such accommodation to respond to site specific 
circumstances.

  DP2.  Self-Build and Custom -Build Housing  
1. Shropshire Council will support appropriately located Self -Build and Custom -Build 
housing developments where they comply with all relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
2. All sites  of 0.5 ha or more; sites of 5 or more dwellings in designated rural areas ; and 
sites of 10 or more dwellings elsewhere , are encouraged  to make 10% of the dwellings 
available as serviced plots for Self -Build and Custom -Build developers, particularly 
where there is an identified need on the Self -Build Register. Where such plots are 
provided, they should:  
a. Consist of a range of plot sizes wh ich are generally suitable for detached homes 
with scaffold margins within the plot boundary and respond to needs identified on 
the Self -Build Register;  
b. Be accessible via a suitably adopted or adoptable road at an early stage in the 
development (prior to 25% occupation of the relevant phase in which the serviced 
plots are located as agreed at planning application stage);  
c. Be free of ‘Party Wall’ requirements, unless only developable as a semi -detached or 
terraced dwelling; and  
d. When marketed, be serviced, av ailable for purchase and ready for development by 
a Self or Custom -Builder. This marketing should occur for at least 24 months at a 
fair plot valuation and in accordance with a marketing strategy to be approved by 
Shropshire Council.  
 
Explanation  
4.43.  The UK is a long way behind most other countries when it comes to the 
proportion of homes built via Self -Build and Custom -Build approaches. The 
need to look more closely at Self -Build and Custom -Build dwellings as a 
means of extending the range  of both open market  and affordable dwellings is 
as important in Shropshire as it is nationally and is now recognised in the 
National Housing Strategy ‘Foundations for Growth’ 2011, the Self Build and 
Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and the National Planning  Policy Framework  
(NPPF) . 
4.44.  Shropshire Council as one of the Self -Build Vanguard Authorities promotes 
the provision of appropriately located individual and group Self -Build and 
Custom -Build dwellings, where they comply with the all relevant policies of 
this Local Plan. These dwellings can provide a wider choice of quality homes 
for owner occupation and can contribute to meeting the needs of different 
groups in the community. As such they represent part of the solution to 
achieving mixed and balanced communiti es. 
4.45.  Shropshire Council has established and maintains a Self -Build Register for 
individuals or groups to register their interest in acquiring a serviced plot of 
land to complete a Self -Build or Custom -Build dwelling. To view or apply for 
inclusion on the Se lf-Build Register, please visit the Shropshire Council 
website at:  www.shropshire.gov.uk/affordable -housing/right -to-build/  
4.46.  According to the SHMA, over the Local Plan period from 2016  to 2038, around 
2,400 applications will be made for inclusion on the Self -Build Register. 
Although not directly comparable, this equates to  around 9% of the calculated 
local housing need. As such it is considered appropriate to encourage larger Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 83 
  development sites to make 10% of dwellings available for Self -Build 
developers, where there is an identified need on the Self -Build Register.  
4.47.  If Self -Build and Custom -Build plots are to be sold, this should only occur 
where they have the benefit of planning permission and arrangements for 
providing access and servicing to the boundary are in place. During the 
planning application process , the plot provi der will be required to enter into 
any necessary legal agreements or agree  to conditions on the planning 
decision to ensure the roads will be brought up to an adoptable standard and 
services will be available for connection.  
4.48.  Self-Build and Custom -Build dwellings for households  that are  in need of 
affordable housing and who wish to build their own dwelling are considered 
under Policy DP6.

  DP3.  Affordable Housing Provision  
1. Opportunities for people to access new homes which are well designed , of high quality, 
and the right  type, tenure and affordability will be achieved by:  
a. Requiring  new residential  development on all sites of 0.5 ha or more; sites of 5 or 
more dwellings in designated rural areas; and sites of 10 or more dwellings 
elsewhere  to provide on-site affordable housing , in accordance with the following  
percentages and geographic areas  as defined Figure  DP3.1 : 
i. 10% in the north; and  
ii. 20% in the south.  
b. Ensuring that only in exceptional circumstances will either an off -site provision or a 
financial contribution in lieu of on -site provision be supported on major housing 
development ; 
c. Ensuring  applications for development with a requirement to provide  affordable 
housing secure the interest of a Registered Provider , and that  the affordable 
dwellings will be transferred to a Registered Provider as soon as possible, and no 
later than at completion of 50% of  the consented market housin g; 
d. Ensuring that w here affordable housing is to be secured on site , its tenure  
comprise s 70% social or affordable rent accommodation and 30% intermediate or 
other affordable housing , unless evidence of  local need indicates otherwise ; 
e. Requiring a ffordable  rents to be set at 80% of open market rent and not to exceed 
Local Housing Allowance Housing Benefit ; 
f. Requiring s hared  ownership to be capped at 80% of the equity share ; 
g. Ensuring that  the affordable housing is indistinguishable from the open market 
housing , includ ing by way of character, design, location and size and is  consistent 
with policies SP5, DP1 and other relevant policies of this Local Plan ; 
h. Ensuring that affordable housing is appropriately distributed within the site , their 
locations maximise opportunities for future residents  to ac cess services and  facilities 
by walking , cycling or public transport and minimises the exposure of future 
residents  to sources of noise or reduced air quality ; and  
i. Ensuring new and existing affordable hous es are maintained as affordable  in 
perpetuity . 
j. All affordable housing provided onsite will be allocated in accordance with 
Shropshire Councils Allocations Policy.  
2. The provision of reduced rates of affordable housing due to viability concerns on 
otherwise sustainable schemes will be considered in exceptional circumstances where 
evidence is clearly presented  and agreed by the Council. In these circums tances  an 
overage clause will be sought in order to secure the potential for future contributions  
towards aff ordable housing .    
 
Explanation  
4.49.  The need for affordable housing is evident  throughout the County, there are 
currently in excess of 5,000 households on the Councils Choice based 
housing register who are looking for homes. Furthermore, the Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) (2020) for Shropshire concluded that Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 85 
  during the Local Plan period from 2016 to 2038 an estima ted 799 households 
per year will require affordable housing.  
4.50.  As such, on -site affordable housing will be required from residential 
developments on all sites of more than 0.5ha  or 5 or more dwellings in 
designated rural areas and 10 or more dwellings  elsewh ere in Shropshire . 
Recognising the viability of development in Shropshire, the percentage of 
affordable housing required on site is:  
a. 10% in the north of Shropshire; and  
b. 20% in the south of Shropshire.  
4.51.  The geographic extent of these areas is illustrated on Figure DP3.1:  
Figure DP3.1: Affordable Housing Target Rates  
   
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 86 
  4.52.  Approximately 70% of households on the Councils Choice based housing 
register are unable to  afford home ownership and will continue to require  
rented affordable homes. This tenure split is reflected in the high cost of 
market  housing in comparison to  household earnings. High affordability ratios 
are evidenced  throughout the County  and are particularly high in the 
settlements  in the south of the County. Affordable rents should  be maintained  
at 80% of the open market rent or below the maximum Local Housing 
Allowance Housing Benefit , whichever is the lower  to ensure affordability and 
compliance with Government regulations .  
4.53.  Affordable homes are made available for sale or rent for households whose 
needs are not met by the market. The affordable tenures are defined within 
Annex 2 of the NPPF (2 019) as being : affordable housing for rent; starter 
homes ; discounted market sales ho using and other affo rdable routes to home 
ownership.  Guidance in relation to  these tenures will be provided in the 
Housing SPD.   
4.54.  National policy promotes affordable home ownership and requires at least 
10% of new homes built to be available for this. In our towns where most new 
homes are built, we ask for a minimum of 10%  and rising to 20% . Under 
national policy requirement, this wo uld mean that in areas of 10% only 
affordable home ownership products  would be delivered.  Exemptions to this 
10% requirement are allowed where this would significantly prejudice the 
ability to meet the housing requirements of specific groups . High affordab ility 
ratios together with the significant number  of households on the housing 
register in need of rented property, means  that applying the 10% affordable 
home ownership requirement would not meet the identified needs.  
4.55.  Where there is a requirement for affordable housing there is an expectation 
that this will be provided on-site as an integrated part of the development  and 
promotes social inclusion. Therefore , in lieu financial con tributions will only be 
supported where there are  exceptional circumstances . Financial contributions 
will be required where the amount of affordable housing is less than one 
dwelling . The Housing SPD  will provide further guidance .  
4.56.  The Council reserves the right to calculate the capacity of the site to 
accommodate dwellings where it considers that the development proposed is 
not an appropriate density specifically for the purpose of avoiding the 
affordable housing threshold. The Coun cil may also consider the overall area 
and capacity of adjoining parcels of land where development is phased or 
subject to separate planning applications, where such parcels can be 
considered to make up a larger site.

  DP4.  Affordable Housing Exception Schemes  
1. Affordable exception schemes are developments consisting of 100% local needs 
affordable housing. Development of affordable exception schemes that are of a suitable 
scale, design, tenure and include appropriate prioritisation to people demonstrating a 
local connection to the area, will be positively considered where  all of the following are 
satisfied : 
a. It is within or immediately adjoining the built form of: 
i. A Strategic, Principal or Key Centre ; 
ii. A Community Hub or Community Cluster  Settlement; or   
iii. Another s ettlement  with a school  or the ability to  access a school by public  
transport . 
b. It will not result in development in an isolated location;  
c. There is a proven local affordable housing need that is demonstrated through an up -
to-date and robust local housing needs survey and the number of dwellings  provided 
does not exceed this identified local need;  
d. The type, size and tenure of the affordable housing meets  the local housing needs 
evidenced in the housing needs survey;  
e. All the dwellings  will be retained as affordable in perpetuity;  
f. The affordable housing is allocated in accordance with a Local Lettings Plan;  
g. The affordable housing  will be delivered and managed by a Registered Provider;  
h. A site in any locations set out in part (a) above also should also conform  with the 
requirements set out in Policy SP9 4(a – d) and Policy SP10 ;  
i. The design and character of the affordable housing complies with the design 
requirements identified within  Policy SP5 and DP1; 
j. It is served by an adequate access and infrastructure and has reasonable acce ss to 
local services by walking, cycling or public transport ; and 
k. They comply with all other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
2. Exception sites that are promoted and delivered through  a Community Led Approach 
will be supported as a means of delivery . Further to all of the above criteria being met, 
there is also an expectation that Community Led Housing schemes include and 
extensive and meaningful community engagement and participation , undertaken prior to 
the submission of any planning application . 
 
Explanation  
4.57.  Given the significant need for affordable housing in the County as a whole it is 
important that affordable housing is brought forward in the rural area. There 
are a number of wa ys affordable housing can be achieved; including  and in 
accordance with open market development (Policy DP3); cross subsidy 
(Policy DP7), single site exception sites (Policy DP6) and entry level  exception 
sites (Policy DP5).  
4.58.  Exception site schemes delivered and managed by Registered Providers have 
traditionally been the mainstay of rural housing delivery. Increased demand 
from households unable to secure either a rented or low cost home has Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 88 
  prompted a broader range of delivery  mechanisms reflected in the NPPF and 
in this Plan.  
4.59.  Exception sites can be supported in areas where housing development would 
not normally be encouraged and are based on identified need for qualifying 
households.  Qualifying households are those whose hous ing needs are not 
met by the market who live in or are employed in or have close connections 
with the relevant area. Any proposal for local needs housing will need to be 
fully evidenced and to accurately reflect evidence of local need.  
4.60.  Evidence provided i n respect of sites adjoining Strategic, Principal and Key 
Centres is likely to demonstrate  high affordable housing need, which should 
not automatically translate into larger exception sites. There is an expectation 
that exception sites will not exceed 25 d wellings. Where it is exceptionally 
considered appropriate for an exception site of more than 25 dwellings, 
significant  emphasis will be placed  on achieving an appropriate mix of house 
types, sizes and tenures , to ensure a balanced development . Further 
guidance will be included  in the Housing Supplementary  Planning Document 
(SPD). 
4.61.  There remains a reliance on exception site delivery by Registered Providers 
and for schemes to be brought forward as Community Led Initiative s, where 
possible and where there is s upport by the community to do so.  
4.62.  Acceptable tenures are defined in Annex 2 of the NPPF, with further guidance 
being provided by the updated Housing SPD.  There is an expectation that 
affordable homes will be retained as affordable in perpetuity, with sha red 
ownership being restricted in staircasing to 80% of open market value and 
rented tenure to 80% of open market rental value and capped at the local 
housing allowance.  
4.63.  Landowners considering bring forward a site forward as an exception site 
forward are e ncouraged to contact the Council’s Housing Enabling Team who 
will be able to assist in getting Registered Providers involved and to discuss 
the potential for a community led initiative.

  DP5.  Entry Level Exception Sites  
1. Entry  level exception sites for 100% affordable housing suitable for first time buyers (or 
those looking to rent their first home), will be positively considered  where they comply 
with all of the following:  
a. It is demonstrated  through  an up -to-date and robust  local housing needs survey , that 
there is a local need for these affordable dwellin gs and that this  need will not be met 
through any saved SAMDev Plan allocations, allocations in the Local  Plan or 
development with extant planning permission ; 
b. The site is no more than 1 hectare in size  and the number of dwellings provided does 
not exceed the evidenced need and at most  consists of no more than 5% of the 
number of homes in the existing settlement, based on the most recent data available 
from the Counc il; 
c. The site is within or immediately adjoining the built form of:  
i. A Strategic, Principal or Key Centre ; 
ii. A Community Hub or Community Cluster Settlement; or   
iii. Another settlement  with a school or appropriate access to a school by sustainable 
modes of transpo rt. 
d. The type, size and tenure of the affordable housing meets the local housing needs  
evidenced in the housing needs survey  and gives priority to those with a local 
connection ; 
e. All the dwellings will be retained as affordable in perpetuity;  
f. There has been  meaningful community engagement prior to the submission of a 
planning application;  
g. A site  in any locations set out in part ( c) above also should also conform with the 
requirements set out in Policy SP9 4(a – d) and Policy SP10 ;  
h. The design and character of the affordable housing complie s with the design 
requirements identified within Policy SP5 and DP1;  
i. It is served by an adequate access and infrastructure and has reasonable access to 
local services by walking, cycling or public transpor t;  
j. The site is not wholly or partly within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural

Explanation  
4.64.  Entry Level exception sites were introduced in the 2019 update to the NPPF .  
These are sites which offer one or more types of af fordable housing , including 
affordable housing for rent, discounted market sales and housing and other 
products which provide an affordable route to home ownership  as defined in 
Annex 2 of the NPPF.  
4.65.  This Policy complement suite of affordable exception site policies being 
promoted through this plan. The emphasis be ing in this instance on the need 
to demonstrate that the need is not already bein g provided for within this plan .  
4.66.  An updated Housing SPD is also being prepared to  provide detailed guidance 
on this Policy including the formula for calculating low cost ownership tenures.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 90 
  DP6.  Single Plot Exception Sites  
1. Recognising the diverse range of settlement patte rns within the rural area and the varied 
needs of the residents  of our  rural communities, single plot exception site s will be 
considered where:  
a. Applicants are able to demonstrate that:  
i. They require affordable housing and have a strong local connection and need to 
be located within the settlement that the site is proposed;  
ii. There are no other reasonable options which address their housing needs, having 
regard to the availability of low -cost housing options within the Strategic, Pr incipal 
or Key Centres; Community Hubs; Community Clusters; any other nearby 
settlements; and existing or planned rural exception schemes; and  
iii. Their need cannot be met through affordable housing provided in accordance  with 
Policies DP4, DP5 and DP7 and does not relate to self -build and custom -build 
housing under DP2. 
b. The site is within and well related to the built form of a settlement and has permanent 
and s ubstantial buildings on at least one side;  
c. It will not result in development in an isolated locati on; 
d. The dwelling will remain affordable in perpetuity through a percentage reduction on 
market value agreed by legal agreement;  
e. The site area, including any access arrangements , is no more than 0.0 5ha; 
f. The dwelling is designed to meet current and future ho usehold requirements and 
should not exceed the maximum floorspace prescribed in the Nationally Described 
Space standards for a 6 -person household, although the provision of a single 
detached garage to the maximum of 18 sq. metres would be supported in addi tion; 
g. The design and character of the affordable housing complies with the design 
requirements identified within Polic ies SP5, SP10  and DP1; 
h. It is served by an adequate access and infrastructure and has reasonable access to 
local services by walking, cycling or public transport; and  
i. They comply with all other relevant policies in the Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
4.67.  Within the rural area, the plan identifies Community Hubs and Community 
Clusters as the focus for new development, as well as supporting new 
affordable housing provision where there is evidenced need.  There is an 
expectation that low cost home  ownership need will be delivered through large 
exception  (Policy DP4) and cross subsidy (Policy DP7) or by policy provision 
on open  market sites. The Coun cil’s Right Home Right Place initiative was 
launched in 2018 to better understand the housing needs of rural communities 
through housing need surveys and working with communities. This approach 
has generated greater community understanding of the need to p rovide a 
range of types and tenures of affordable housing to address a variety of 
needs.  The Community Led approach to delivering rural housing is actively 
encouraged by the Council , together with Registered Provider exception site 
delivery. These deliver y opportunities provide a more sustainable pattern of 
development and assist in the rebalance of rural communities and are the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 91 
  preferred method of rural affordable housing delivery. Where there is no 
realistic option available through accessibility and/or affordability of the 
household, then a single plot exception site may be an appropriate route to 
home ownership.  
4.68.  Single plot exception site s should not automatically be considered where 
support is unsuccessful  under Policy DP2.  The single plot exception site 
policy is specifically to address unmet local affordable housing need.  
4.69.  Demonstrating appropriate circumstances will includ e: evidence of local 
connection ; being in housing need ; and having a need to reside in the local 
area, including being able to demonstrate why that need cannot be met 
elsewhere.  
4.70.  Restrictions on location, size and value of the dwelling will ensure that the 
dwelling remain s affordable to future generations. Specifically, the floorspace 
of the dwelling should not exceed that prescribed in the Nationally  Described 
Space standards for a four bedroom two storey dwelling for a 6 person 
household. The Nationally Described Space s tandards are  summarised within 
the Explanation to Policy  DP1. Dwellings in excess of the prescribed floor 
area will be regarded to be unaffordable. In this regard there will be a 
requirement for the dwelling to be subject to a legal agreement to protect 
occupation and value in perpetuity. In defining  affordability, the Council will 
consider average salaries and market values relevant to the local area.  
4.71.  An updated Housing SPD will provide detailed guidance on assessment and 
treatment of affordable housing exception site schemes. There will also be a 
revised Information pack available for the single plot exception site scheme.

  DP7.  Cross -Subsidy Exception Schemes  
1. Cross -subsidy exception schemes are developments consisting of a proportion of open 
market housing to facilitate the delivery of a significant proportion of local needs 
affordable housing. Development of cross -subsidy excep tion schemes that are of suitable 
scale, design, tenure and include appropriate prioritisation of local people for the 
affordable housing provided will be positively considered where  all of the following are 
satisfied : 
a. It is demonstrated that no public gra nt is available and that an affordable exception 
scheme is unviable.  
b. It is within or immediately adjoining the built form of : 
i. A Strategic, Principal or Key Centre ; 
ii. A Community Hub or Community Cluster  Settlement; or  
iii. Another s ettlement with a school  or the ability to  access a school by public  transport.  
c. It will not result in development in an isolated location;  
d. There is a proven local affordable housing need that is demonstrated through an up to 
date robust housing needs survey. The delivery of affordable housing will need to 
accurately reflect this need and be allocated in accordance with a Local Lettings Plan ;  
e. The scale of the development will solely be dictated by the evidence of local affordable 
housing need but will not normally exceed 10 dwellings ; 
f. At least 70% of the homes provided will be affordable housing and of a type, size and 
tenure that meets the lo cal housing needs evidenced in the housing needs survey ; 
g. All the affordable dwellings will be retained as affordable in perpetuity;  
h. There is a preference for the affordable homes to be delivered and managed by a 
Registered Provider. However, where this is  not an option, other delivery and 
management approaches will be considered, including by landed estates, community 
land trusts, development companies and private landlords;  
i. The affordable housing is appropriately distributed within the site, their locati ons 
maximise opportunities for future residents to access services and facilities by walking, 
cycling or public transport and minimises the exposure of future residents to sources of 
noise or reduced air quality.  
j. A site in any locations set out in part (b ) above should also conform  with the 
requirements set out in Policy SP9 4(a – d) and Policy SP10 ;  
k. It is served by an adequate access and infrastructure and has reasonable access to 
local services by walking, cycling or public transport;  
l. The design and character of the affordable housing complies with the design 
requirements identified within Policy SP5 and DP1; 
m. They comply with all other releva nt policies of this Local Plan.  
2. Cross -subsidy  exception s cheme s that are promoted and delivered as a Community Led 
Approach will be supported as a means of delivery . Further  to all of the above criteria 
being met, there is also an expectation  that Communit y Led Housing schemes include  
extensive and meaningful  community engagement and participation , undertaken prior to 
the submission of any planning application . 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 93 
  Explanation  
4.72.  Permitting exception schemes for local needs affordable housing where there 
are suitable sites and subject to evidence of need has been a longstanding 
policy.   
4.73.  Exception site schemes are important in providing opportunities for 
households with a local connection . Shropshire comprises a diverse range 
and type of communities , from those that are densely populated to those that 
are more  dispersed . The needs  of communities are equally variable , 
particularly with regard to  the number and type of affordable hous ing require d. 
Therefore , there is a need for a variety of delivery mechanisms. The National 
Planning Policy Framework suggests that Local Authorities should consider 
allowing some open market housing to facilitate the delivery of affordable 
housing. This i s outlined further in the updated Housing SPD  
4.74.  There is an assumption that these schemes will not receive any public sector 
grant and therefore, the provision  of market housing provides an enabling 
function by facilitating the delivery of local needs afford able housing.   
4.75.  In addition, such schemes may be achievable on sites with lower numbers of 
dwellings and therefore unviable for a wholly affordable scheme. Furthermore, 
cross subsidy options have the potential to benefit a broader range of housing 
needs wi thin a settlement, as evidenced in housing need surveys.  
4.76.  The policy is intended as a delivery mechanism for affordable housing and not 
the provision of open market . This is reflected in the need to deliver at least 
70% affordable housing tenures and should  directly reflect the needs outlined 
in the housing need survey based on tenure and size of dwellings.  This is 
outlined further in the updated Housing SPD . 
4.77.  As with all mixed tenure sites, the affordable housing dwellings should be 
indistinguishable  from th e market housing in terms of materials and design 
and there will be no segregation between the tenures.  
4.78.  Whilst there is a preference for registered providers to own and manage 
affordable housing stock, it is recognised that opportunities are available by 
other individuals and organisations that may be equally acceptable.  There 
would be a requirement for those who own or manage affordable in addition to 
the registered providers to be able to demonstrate the ability to manage the 
affordable housing stock in  accordance with the Councils Allocation Policy 
and management requirements.  
4.79.  Local connection  criteria or a Local Lettings Plan will be applied to these 
schemes.  
4.80.  Irrespective  of any longer term re classification of the land, there should be no 
expectation that the tenure of the local needs housing on the cross -subsidy 
site will change as a result of any land use policy change. The site shall 
remain affordable in perpetuity.  
4.81.  Existing Community Clusters are identified within SP2.2 of Policy SP2.  New 
Community Clusters can be brought forward by the community th rough the 
Neighbourhood Plan process and will be subject to this Policy and the other 
requirements of the Local Plan.

  DP8.  Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation  
1. The accommodation needs of those who identify as Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople will be addressed as part of meeting the housing needs of all sectors of the 
community. This will be achieved by supporting suitable development p roposals for sites 
for: 
a. Pitches or plots within the development boundaries of Shrewsbury, Principal and Key 
Centres, Community Hubs and Strategic Sites where these are allocated for 
residential uses;  
b. Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople (as def ined in Annexe 1  of CLG’s  
Planning Policy for Traveller Sites) in locations close to Shrewsbury, Principal 
Centres, Key Centres and Community Hubs , where this does not conflict with national 
policy and the applicant has demonstrated a clear need for a site of the scale and 
type proposed which cannot be met by existing available pitches;  
c. Single pitch /plot or family unit exception sites (of no more tha n 3 pitches) for all 
Gypsies and  Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in locations well related to 
Shrewsbury, Principal Centres,  Key Centres, Community Hubs, Community Clusters 
and other settlements defined by Local Plan Policy DP4 (Affordable Exception Sites ) 
in accordance with Local Plan Polic y SP10  (Countryside ) and other relevant Local 
Plan policies, where  the applicant has demonstrated a clear need for a site of the 
scale  and type proposed which cannot be met by existing available pitches and a 
local connection is satisfactorily evidenced ; and 
d. Transit provisio n in close proximity to the main established travelling routes in the 
area to meet any additional evidenced  need . 
2. Mixed uses will not be permitted on rural exception sites and all new sites should be in a 
sustainable location, reasonably accessible to education, health and welfare 
infrastructure and meet the following criteria:  
a. Be of a scale which respects that of any nearby settled community, the local setting 
and the ability of local infrastructure and services to serve the population ; 
b. Have safe access and be well located relative to the highway network which has 
enough capacity to meet the needs of the development;  
c. Not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding 
area or the natural environment  or heritage assets, meeting the requirements set out 
in the relevant policies of this Local Plan; 
d. Not conflict with the objectives of Green Belt o r AONB designation ;  
e. Be located outside of areas at high risk of flood ing and meet the requirements set out 
in Local plan Policies DP21  (Flood Risk) & DP22  (Sustainable Drainage ); 
f. Be designed in accordance with relevant  Good Practice guidance, with associated 
buildings such as amenity blocks proportionate in scale and bulk to the site and their 
intended use ; 
g. Incorporate suitable design, landscaping and screening in accordance with the 
requirements of Local Plan Policy DP16 , and make provision for recreational facilities, 
parking and manoeuvring as appropriate ; and 
h. Be in accordance with specific criteria in any relevant neighbourhood plan . 
3. Where a site is for permanent residential occupation, including a mixed -use site 
incorporating business and residential uses, it should be demonstrated to be suitable for 
residential development and that any necessary additiona l infrastructure can provided as 
part of the development , consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan . Any business Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 95 
  use proposed on a site should be able to be accommodated whilst maintaining 
acceptable standards of residential amenity, for both t he intended and existing residents. 
Preference will be given to brownfield sites.  
4. To ensure that a 5 year supply of pitches and plots is maintained and that there is 
adequate permanent and transit accommodation to meet the range of needs of gypsies 
and tr avellers over the Local Plan period , the Council will:  
a. Resist the loss of existing gypsy and traveller, transit and travelling showpeople sites 
to alternative development or other uses, unless it can be robustly evidenced that 
there is no longer a need for gypsy and traveller provision ; 
b. Use planning conditions and/or legal restrictions, as appropriate , to retain control over 
future  site occupation in order ensure that the pitches remain available to satisfy  
gypsy and traveller  local needs ; 
c. Positively consider applications  for alterations to existing sites to improve residential 
amenity , where these meet all other relevant policy requirements and are required to 
achieve modern residential standards or accommodate health related requirements ; 
and   
d. Review the GTAA evidence base within 5 years of Plan adoption and use this 
evidence to review strategic requirements for specific Gypsy and Traveller site 
allocations through Local Plan Review , a Gypsy and Traveller Site Allocations DPD 
or, where appr opriate, for Neighbourhood Plans to bring forward new sites.  
 
Explanation  
4.82.  It is recognised that the accommodation needs of all gypsies and travellers 
must be provided for. This includes those that meet the definition set out in 
Annexe 1 of Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) 2015 and settled 
travellers who do not meet that definition but identify as Gypsy and Travellers. 
The Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA 2019) which is 
a refresh of the 2017 study provides an up to date ass essment of existing 
provision and evidence of the likely future pitch needs, both permanent and 
transit, of Gypsies and Travellers in Shropshire. It includes ethnic gypsies and 
travellers who fall outside the definition of Travellers in the PPTS who 
noneth eless are able to demonstrate a right to culturally appropriate 
accommodation. Where Gypsy and Travellers wish to be accommodated in 
bricks and mortar accommodation these needs are considered as part of the 
broader housing need .  
4.83.  The GTAA identifies a tota l of 148 authorised pitches across Shropshire as 
well as a temporary showpersons yard . It looks at existing provision and 
occupancy of local authority sites and likely levels of future need, including 
population growth from emerging households.  Using this information, the 
assessment considers both 5 year need and that over the Plan period to 
2038.The gross needs identified by the GTAA are 24 pitches over the initial 5 -
year period and  113 pitches (43 PPTS definition) to 2038 based on a cultural 
interpretatio n of need. However, comprehensive site management data on the 
occupancy and re -occupancy of Shropshire Council pitches (described as 
turnover in the GTAA report) is considered in detail by the study alongside the 
study survey results . This provides informa tion on the significant, ongoing role 
of turnover in meeting identified needs based on a methodology employing a 
cautious interpretation of information to exclude turnover which does not result 
in the genuine release of pitches or that which may occur on p rivate sites 
which cannot be evidenced by the Local Authority.  In the light of this evidence 
the GTAA concludes that there is no current requirement for site allocations or Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 96 
  evidence of the need for the identification of sites for longer term provision for  
Gypsies and Travellers. Although there is a separate requirement identified for 
permanent provision for Travelling Showpeople , the need for a plot for has 
been  met by the grant of planning permission  (reference 19/04688/FUL) in 
Oswestry in May 2020 .  
4.84.  There is also a requirement in national policy to identify and address the likely 
transit needs of the Shropshire and these are also considered in the GTAA.  
This evidence  highlights that past unauthorised encampment activity provides 
an indicator of transit p rovision needs but that it is too soon to  fully assess the 
effect on levels of unauthorised encampment of a planning permission 
granted in November 2018  for 3 transit pitches. The GTAA therefore 
concludes that a period of monitoring is required. It is recognised however that 
additional Council provision would support transit capacity and the ability to 
manage unauthorised encampments, therefore the Counci l is actively 
exploring complementary transit provision outside the Local Plan process.  
4.85.  The GTAA does conclude that non -strategic needs for small sites will 
nevertheless arise where available supply does not meet need a specific 
requirement and makes a re commendation for criteria -based policy to provide 
a basis for the consideration of planning applications sites  and to facilitate 
additional pitch provision where required. These requirements are reflected in 
Policy DP8 which  allows for the positive consideration of appropriate planning 
applications and ensures that there is flexibility and a mechanism to provide 
for arising needs. Th e use of a p olicy framework to guide and enable the 
provision of sites would provide for  a con tinuation of the current approach 
which has resulted in the delivery of: small sites in Shropshire through the 
development management process; provision of additional pitches at existing  
Shropshire Council managed sites and a site for Travelling Showpeople . 
4.86.  In the past there has been a focus on public pitch provision, but the 
Government indicates in PPTS that it wishes ‘to promote more private 
traveller site provision’ in addition to provision for those who are not able to 
provide their own sites. To this e nd Shropshire Council manage sites, which 
provide affordable pitches for rent, and have created additional capacity and 
improved a number of their sites, whilst new private sites have been brought 
forward through the development management process. In ligh t of GTAA 
evidence and government aspirations , any new pitch provision will be 
facilitated by th is local plan policy which sets out clear guidelines to deliver 
development which meets national policy requirements and is appropriate in 
the Shropshire contex t. Whilst allocations are not considered  to be required 
and therefore are not identified , the Policy sets out a positive, facilitating 
approach to meeting the accommodation needs of individuals and families as 
they arise . Such a criteria -based policy approach will provide greater clarity for 
applicants as to the basis against which their application will be considered 
and allow for the delivery of sites of an appropriate scale in the most suitable 
locations.  
4.87.  The locations identified by the Policy seek to direct pitch and plot provision to 
locations which are in reasonable proximity of sustainable settlements with 
services and facilities to enable the population to access education, health, 
welfare and employme nt opportunities. Appropriate locations are identified in 
the same way as they are for general housing requirements by reference to 
the Local Plan’s broader settlement hierarchy and exceptions housing 
approach. Whilst  it is recognised that to promote susta inable lifestyles and 
communities, sites should be reasonably accessible to facilities and services , Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 97 
  this must be balanced with the need to: provide affordable opportunities for 
sites, given difficulties in acquiring land at a reasonable cost  on the edge of 
settlements ; the requirements of gypsy and traveller traditional lifestyles  and 
need  to consider interrelationships with existing settled communities, local 
environmental capacity  and the ability of local infrastructure to absorb 
additional requirement s. 
4.88.  It is accepted that the accommodation  needs of Gypsies and Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople tend to differ from those of the rest of the population 
and this is reflected in site design and requirements. Thus,  the Policy 
recognises , for example, need  to accommodate ancillary structures such as 
amenity blocks and business  and storage uses on pitches and plots and  also 
transit requirements.  Proposals for pitches and sites are however subject to 
general development criteria , the same as for other types of development. 
This will mean that sites should not be located in substandard and unsuitable 
locations, and be accepta ble in terms of their scale, design and  other potential 
impacts. National policy also sets out a range of matters to take into account 
when consider when assessing applications for Traveller site development 
which will also apply.  
4.89.  The need for affordable p rivate pitches, in addition to Shropshire Council’s 
affordable rented provision, is reflected in the Policy in that it allows  for small 
sites for all gypsies and travellers through an exception approach. This uses  a 
mechanism similar to that used for more traditional dwellings in Local Plan 
Policy DP6. It is expected that applicants will demonstrate both a local 
connection and need for the type of site  proposed, with the Council’s Gypsy 
Liaison Team providing support in the assessment of applications, including 
whether the level of accommodation and ancillary buildings are reasonably 
necessary to provide adequate accommodation and facilitate a tradition al 
lifestyle  for the applicants. As affordable provision it is expected that the pitch 
or plot size and  ancillary buildings such as amenity blocks will not be of 
excessive size and that the proposed  form of development on the site will 
reflect the requirem ents of a traditional lifestyle. Planning conditions to restrict 
occupancy, including personal or temporary conditions where appropriate, 
and, if necessary,  legal agreements  will be used to ensure that that a site is 
retained in  perpetuity for use by traveller families with a bona fide local 
connection . Additional guidance will be provided in the Housing SPD  
4.90.  To ensure that the levels of Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Show people 
accommodation are maintained, the facilitation of new sites needs to be 
accompanied by measures to retain existing sites and enable them to remain 
fit for purpose. Thus, in addition to ensuring that planning permissions for new 
sites are accompanied  by appropriate occupancy conditions and any 
necessary legal  restrictions, the Council will resist the loss of existing sites 
(where this is within their control) and facilitate appropriate modernisation and 
adaptions where this meets other policy requirem ents.  
4.91.  Shropshire Council also recognise that it is important that the approach to all 
gypsy and traveller provision remains consistent with the changing needs of 
the Traveller population and is therefore committed to reviewing evidence and  
the need for all ocations in future Local Plan reviews. Working with the 
Council’s Gypsy Liaison Team , cross boundary work with adjoining authorities 
and monitoring of: planning applications; the occupancy of Council sites and 
unauthorised encampments will check that the a pproach set out in this Policy  
is being successful and together with a refreshed GTAA provide a trigger for 
the review of provision, either directly by the Council or through allocations.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 98 
  Retail and Leisure  
DP9.  Managing and Supporting Town Centres  
1. Development and other measures will maintain and enhance the vitality and viability of 
Shropshire’s network of Town C entres  and High Street s in line with national policy, taking 
into account local regeneration strategies where appropriate , as well as the r equirements 
of this policy and any settlement specific guidance contained in policies S1 -S18.  
2. In doing so there is a clear preference to accommodate main town centre uses within the 
defined Town Centres  of Shrewsbury, and the Principal Centres  of Bridgnor th, Ludlow, 
Market Drayton, Oswestry and Whitchurch , as shown on the Policies Map.   Main town 
centre us es will also be supported within and adjoining the existing high streets of the 
following Key Centres: Alb righton, Bishops Castle, Broseley, Church Stretton, Cleobury 
Mortimer, Craven Arms, Ellesmere, Highley, Much Wenlock, Shifnal and Wem.         
3. Proposals for main town centre uses outside either defined Town Centres , or outside the 
recognised high street  in Key Centres , will need to prepare a sequential site assessment 
to show they cannot be reasonably accommodated within the Town Centre  or high street , 
having taken account of all reasonable opportunities to amend the scale and design of 
their proposal.  
4. The Council will not permit proposals in edge and out of centre locations , where it is 
considered there will be a significant adverse impact on either a defined Town  Centre  or a 
recognised High Street . In assessing this, Impact Assessments will b e required for new 
retail  and leisure proposals where they:  
a. Are located outside a defined Town Centre, or are more than 300 meters from a 
recognised high street;  and 
b. Are not in accordance with the Settlement Strategy for the area;  and 
c. Have a gross floorsp ace above the following thresholds:  
i. Shrewsbury – 500sqm;  
ii. Principal Centres and Key Centres – 300sqm  
5. In Shrewsbury, whilst it is acknowledged both Meole Brace and Sundorne Retail Parks 
provide a complementary retail offer, neither are defined as either a Town Centre or High 
Street,  and therefore the requirements of parts 3 and 4 of this policy apply.  
6. In supporting the appropriate management of uses within the defined Town Centres the 
following will apply:  
a. There is a presumption in favour of proposals for main town centre uses within 
defined Town Centres;  
b. Proposals for non -town centre uses within Town Centres, including residential, will be 
considered acceptable where they would support the vitality and via bility of the Town 
Centre;  
c. There is presumption in favour of retail (A1) uses within the Primary Shopping Area  in 
Shrewsbury ; 
d. Proposals for non -retail uses within Shrewsbury’s  Primary Shopping Area will be 
supported where it can be demonstrated this would  support the wider regeneration of 
the town centre and would not result in an over concentration or undue dominance of 
non-retail uses.   
7. In line with Policy SP6, the cumulative impacts on people’s health and wellb eing will be 
considered when assessing proposals for hot food  takeaways in Town Centres  and High 
Streets,  where  permission  is required . 
8. The provision of neighbourhood based local shopping and other community facilities will 
be supported where this will help consolidate and improve existing provision or will serve Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 99 
  significant new residential developments in main towns identified in policies S1 -S18, or 
the Strategic Sites and Strategic Settlements identified in Policies S19 -S21.   
9. In Community Hubs  and Community Clusters , the preferred location for additional main 
town centre uses will be in locations accessible on foot or cycle for the majority of the 
local population and should be consistent with the relevant Settlement Strategy policies 
contained in policies S1 -S18 or a Neighbourhood Plan where one is adopted.   
 
Explanation  
4.92.  There has been ongoing restructuring in the retail and commercial leisure 
market since the global  financial crisis in 2009. Online sales have continued to 
rise, most retailers are building less retail floorspace, operators have found 
that less existing floorspace is required and existing floorspace is being 
converted into alternative uses.  All retail  location types; town centres, retail 
parks and shopping centres, have experienced a rising vacancy rate and an 
increase in the net loss of retail units    
4.93.  Shropshire’s high streets have been impacted like everywhere  else.  It is 
therefore now more importan t than ever to evolve the role for town centre s 
and their main ret ail areas  to ensure flexibility and continued vibrancy.   
Planning policy has an important role to play  in the way in how this process is 
managed.  
4.94.  Policy DP9 therefore provides a flexible base by which to manage  and support  
development in defined town centres  and other recognised high streets , and 
in doing so accepting that these areas will need to expand beyond their more 
traditional  retail roles , incorporating  a wider range of main town centre uses  as 
defined by the National Planning Policy Framework .  However, it is still 
important to mainta in the integrity of these areas and in doing so the 
sequential  and impact tests continue to apply  to proposals  in appropriate 
circumstances.  
4.95.  Whilst Shrewsbury has experienced a number of notable closures of national 
multiple operators  recently , the overall offer in the town centre continues to be 
strong, supported by a well -regarded independent sector  and bols tered  by the 
aspirations of the Big Town Plan and as sociated maste rplanning work.   
Shrewsbury is the only Centre with a defined Primary Shoppin g Area 
reflecting the continued importa nce of retail uses within the overall mix  of 
uses.     
4.96.  The current  health  of the Principal Centres varies , but in each case,  there is 
an increasing need to diversify the mix of uses within town centres .

  DP10.  Tourism, Culture and Leisure  
1. To deliver high quality, sustainable tourism, and cultural and leisure development, which 
enhances the vital role that these sectors play for the local economy, benefits local 
communities and visitors, and is sensitive to Shropshire’s intrinsic natural and built 
environment qualities, emphasis will be placed on:  
a. Supporting new and extended tourism development, and cultural and leisure 
facilities, that are appropriate to their location, and enhance and protect t he existing 
offer within Shropshire;  
b. Promoting connections between visitors and Shropshire’s natural, cultural and 
historic environment, including through active recreation, access to heritage trails 
and parkland, and an enhanced value of local food, drink  and crafts;  
c. Supporting development that promotes opportunities for accessing, understanding 
and engaging with Shropshire’s landscape, cultural and historic assets including the 
Shropshire Hills AONB, rights -of-way network, canals, rivers , meres and mosses . 
Development must also meet the requirements of Policy DP14 ; 
d. Supporting appropriate regeneration schemes and tourism development proposals 
that seek to enhance the economic, social and cultural value of canals and heritage 
railways including , but not limited to : 
i. Shropshire Union Canal  
ii. Shropshire Union Canal - Llangollen branch  
iii. Shropshire Union Canal - Montgomery branch  
iv. The Cambrian Railway  
e. Promoting and preserving the distinctive historic, heritage brand and values of 
Shrewsbury, the Market Towns and rural areas;  
f. Supporting schemes aimed at diversifying the rural economy for tourism, cultural 
and leisure uses that are appropriate in terms of their location, scale and nature, 
which retain and enhance existing natural features where possible, and do not harm 
Shropshire’s tranquil nature;  
g. Development of high-quality  visitor accommodation in accessible locations served 
by a range of servi ces and facilities, which enhances the r eputation  of Shropshire as 
a tourist destination to stay. In rural areas, proposals must be of an appropriate 
scale and character for their surroundings, be close to or within settlements, or close 
to an established and viable tourism enterprise where accommodation is required , 
whilst meeting the requirements of DP24  where appropriate.  Where possible, 
existing bu ildings should be re -used (development must also accord with Policy 
SP11 ). 
2. Tourism, leisure and recreation development proposals that require a countryside 
location will be permitted where the proposal complements the character and qualities of 
the site’s immediate surroundings, and meets the requirements in Policies SP10 , DP12 , 
DP16 , DP23 , SP11  and relevant local and national guidance.  
3. All proposals should be well screened and sited to mitigate the impact on the visual 
quality of the area through the use of natural on -site features, site layout and design, 
and landscaping and planting schemes where appropriate. Proposals within and 
adjoining the Shropshire Hills AONB should pay particular regard to landscape impact 
and mitigation  and meet the requirements of DP24 . 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 101 
  Canal side facilities and new marinas:  
4. Proposals for canal side development that enhance the role of canal as a multifunctional 
resource and heritage asset will be supported.  
5. New marinas should be located within or close to settlements. Applicants should 
demonstrate the capability of the canal network to accommodate the development.  
6. The Policies Map identifies the canals and lines to be protected against other forms of 
development that conflict with their use as a multifunctional resource or potential for 
restoration or regeneration.  
 
Visitor accommodation in rural areas:  
7. Proposals for new and extended touring caravan and camping sites should have strong 
regard to th e cumulative impact of visitor accommodation on the natural and historic 
assets of the area, road network, or over intensification of the site.  
8. Static caravans, chalets and log cabins are recognised as having a greater impact on 
the countryside. Therefore,  in addition (to 7) schemes should be landscaped and 
designed to a high quality , and be at an appropriate capacity and scale.  
9. Further to 2 and 3 above, any holiday let development that does not conform to the legal 
definition of a caravan, and is not relat ed to the conversion of existing appropriate rural 
buildings, will be resisted in the countryside (unless it conforms to para 10 below) 
following the approach to open market residential development in the countryside under 
Policy SP10  and SP11 . 
10. Shropshire Council recognises the appeal of a holiday in a rural setting. Therefore 
permanent holiday let development may be approved in countryside locations provided 
that it can be demonstrated that the design is of exceptional quality (as outlined in NP PF 
paragraph 79 ) and help contribute to DP11 . Any subsequent changes to such holidays 
lets in these locations (such as change to residential occupati on) will be resisted, as per 
11 below.  
11. To retain the benefit to the visitor economy, robust conditions will be applied to new 
planning permissions for visitor accommodation to ensure the accommodation is not 
used for residential occupation. Proposals for t he conversion of holiday lets to 
permanent residential use should demonstrate that their loss will not have a significant 
adverse impact on the visitor economy and meet the criteria relating to suitability for 
residential use in Policy SP10 . 
12. For existing static caravan, chalet and log cabin sites in areas of high flood risk, positive 
consideration will be given to proposals for their relocation to area s of lower flood risk to 
ensure they are capable of being made safe for the lifetime of the development.  
13. New sites for visitor accommodation and extensions to existing chalet and park home 
sites in the Severn Valley will be resisted due to the impact on th e qualities of the area 
from existing sites.  
 
Explanation  
4.97.  Sustainable tourism and high quality cultural and leisure development can 
deliver wide ranging benefits for Shropshire by contributing to a successful 
visitor economy; providing a potential focus for regeneration; supporting the 
quality of life of local co mmunities; and promoting social inclusion. Along with 
cultural and leisure development these sectors can play a significant role in 
ensuring the economic prosperity of Shrewsbury and the Market Towns. Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 102 
  Appropriate tourism development in particular can also potentially help sustain 
rural services and facilities, particularly where they are connected, and 
contribute towards rural regeneration and community benefit.  
4.98.  The policy seeks to promote increased participation in cultural activities, 
appropriate leisure development, and the further development of a green 
tourism market that draws on, and develops, the interaction of humans with 
the produce, heritage and landscape of Shropshire. It is vital this is achieved 
without detracting from the intrinsic beauty and tranquillity which Shropshire is 
renowned for. As well as the wider social and health benefits from taking part 
in cultural and leisure activities and active recreation such as walking, cycling 
and horse riding, interaction with Shropshire’s assets can in turn promote an 
understanding and appreciation of the natural and built environment.  
4.99.  Shropshire has a number of regionally, nationally and internationally 
recognised attractions including the historic Market Towns of Shrewsbury, 
Ludlow and Bridgnorth, the  Shropshire Hills AONB, the meres and mosses of 
north Shropshire, RAF Cosford, Shrewsbury’s Theatre Severn, Oswestry Hill 
Fort and festivals such as the Shrewsbury Flower Show, Ludlow Food 
Festival, Bishop’s Castle Walking Festival and Clun Green Man Festi val. 
There are also a number of heritage and religious sites, castles, museums, 
historic houses, parks and gardens, including Acton Scott Historic Working 
Farm, which all contribute to the tourism and cultural offer for local 
communities and visitors alike . Shropshire also has a number of National 
Cycle Network and walking routes, including Offa’s Dyke National Trail  that 
runs alongside the border with Wales. They provide key links beyond 
Shropshire’s border and along with local routes contribute to the off er within 
Shropshire.  
4.100.  The heritage railways and canals contribute to the character and 
attractiveness of Shropshire. Appropriate regeneration schemes and tourism 
and leisure development relating to these assets can bring significant wider 
benefits. The Sev ern Valley Railway is an internationally renowned asset and 
schemes seeking to enhance and protect it will ensure its continued success. 
The Shropshire Union Canal – Llangollen branch, which links with the World 
Heritage Site of Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and C anal, contributes to the 
attractiveness of north Shropshire and also connects north Wales with 
Ellesmere and Whitchurch.  
4.101.  Parts of the Cambrian Railway in the north -west have been restored, including 
the station building in Oswestry. Further restoration of  the railway could bring 
wider benefits for the local economy and communities. The Shropshire Union 
Canal - Montgomery branch, which has a large number of listed structures 
along its banks, has close links to the Cambrian Railway and Llanymynech 
Heritage A rea and joins the Shropshire Union Canal - Llangollen branch. The 
restoration of the canal from Frankton Junction to near Newtown is recognised 
as a Canal & River Trust Priority One project. In total 13km of the canal on the 
Welsh border (5.3km in Shropshi re) needs to be restored to link -up the canal 
with mid -Wales. Together, regeneration and appropriate tourist development 
of these canal and railway assets could form a focus for tourism and 
regeneration in the north -west of Shropshire and provide links to areas 
beyond Shropshire’s border.  
4.102.  The rural and tranquil nature of Shropshire’s countryside is also a key 
component of Shropshire’s attractiveness as a visitor destination and 
significantly adds to the quality of life for residents. It is therefore vital that all Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 103 
  tourism, cultural and leisure facilities, particularly in rural areas, are 
compatible with their location so that Shropshire’s unique character and 
tranquillity is retained.  
4.103.  Holiday accommodation can make a positive contribution to the visitor 
economy and is often supported in locations that are not suitable for 
residential dwellings. The Council will continue to use conditions to restrict 
permitted visitor accommodation to residential use to ensure that the 
economic benefit from visitor accommoda tion is retained. Conversion of 
existing holiday lets to residential use potentially negatively impacts on the 
visitor economy this policy seeks to limit this impact.  
4.104.  The policy’s support for new and extended development does not seek to 
promote the furth er development of owner -occupied second homes. Any 
tourism -related development in the countryside will only be accepted if the 
design is of exceptional quality, meaning that any subsequent change from 
holiday use would still result in exceptionally designe d development. The 
policy reflects the NPPF para 83 – Supporting a prosperous rural economy, by 
only allowing tourism and leisure developments which respect the character of 
the countryside.  
4.105.  All proposals in the countryside must meet relevant consideration s within 
Policies SP10 , SP11  and DP10 . In areas of recognised scenic and 
environmental value proposals must pay pa rticular regard to the qualities of 
the area and the reasons for designation in line with Policies SP1, SP5, as 
well as relevant Development Management policies and the NPPF.

  Climate Change  
DP11.  Minimising Carbon Emissions  
1. New residential development will contribute to reducing the impact of climate change in 
accordance with Policy SP3 by: 
a. Being designed to maximise fabric energy efficiency including such measures as : 
building orientation ; high levels of insulation of roofs, floors and walls; maximising 
airtightness and using solar gain  through window /door o rientation  whilst avoiding 
overheating  and: 
b. Ensuring all proposals for 10 or more dwellings achieve a minimum of 19% 
improvement in the energy performance requirement in Part L of  the 2013 Building 
Regulations, until such time as the Building Regulations are increased to a level 
which exceeds this u plift and: 
c. Ensuring  all proposals for the formation of one or more dwellings provide a minimum 
of 10% of the predicted energy needs of the development from on -site renewable and 
low carbon energy sources.  
d. Strongly encouraging all proposals for one or more  dwellings and in particular 
residential development of 50 or more dwellings to:  
i. Achieve zero net -carbon emissions;  
ii. Maximise the use of on-site district heating and cooling systems, especially where 
these utilise renewable energy  and 
iii. Maximise opportunitie s to connect to wider heating and cooling network s both for  
energy  supply  and export , especially where these utilise renewable energy  
2. New n on-residential development of 1,000m2 or more floorspace or with a gross site area 
of 1ha or more will achieve the BREEAM Excellent rating  or equivalent standard  within  an 
alternative assessment endorsed by Shropshire Council . 
3. Where changes to existing buildings, including extensions and alterations, are being 
undertaken, maximis ing opportunities to increas e fabric energy efficiency, reduce carbon 
emissions and integrate on -site renewable energy technologies . 
4. The requirements  expressed in this policy  will apply  unless it is demonstrated through 
open book accounting that they would make the development unviable , having regard to 
the policy requirements of the Local Plan, in particular the delivery of affo rdable housing . 
 
Explanation  
4.106.  Shropshire Council declared a Climate Emergency in 2019. Climate change 
represents a major challenge to our way of life and, alongside ensuring that 
development meets today’s needs, comes a responsibility to future 
generations. The local plan promotes sust ainable development, including 
using resources efficiently. The Climate Change Act, 2008 requires the 
country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% (from the 
1990 baseline) by 2050. The target was changed in June 2019 to ‘net zero 
carbon e missions by 2050’ by The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target 
Amendment) Order 2019.  The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, 2004 
requires local plans to include policies to tackle climate change. This is 
reflected in the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework which sets 
out that planning plays a key role in delivering reduction s to greenhouse gas Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 105 
  emissions, minimising vulnerability and providing resilience to climate change. 
The NPPF also notes that planning supports the delivery of renewable and 
low carbon energy and associated infrastructure.  
4.107.  The two main policy responses to c limate change are adaptation and 
mitigation. Adaptation seeks to reduce the risks resulting from climatic 
changes, for example, through the provision of flood defences. Mitigation 
seeks to reduce the causes of climate change, such as reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions from development. This policy sets out measures designed to 
mitigate carbon emissions.  
4.108.  The energy hierarchy classifies energy options and sets out that organisations 
and individuals should pursue energy options in the following order (it should  
be noted that it is not possible to implement all of these through planning 
regimes):  
a. Reduce the need for energy ; 
b. Use energy more efficiently ; 
c. Use renewable energy7; 
d. Use low carbon sources7; and  
e. Use conventional energy . 
4.109.  This policy follows this approach by reducing the need for energy , using 
energy more efficiently through the design of development and requiring new 
development to generate some of its  energy needs from on -site sources.   
4.110.  The conservation of fuel, and power and water efficiency are matters that are 
covered by building regulations; however, planning can deliver higher rates of 
efficiency over and above the levels set out in the Building R egulations. 
Government guidance indicates that councils may require compliance with 
energy standards that exceed the Building Regulations  by 19%.  The Council 
considers that new development should reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and that setting local requi rements for building sustainability is justified.  
4.111.  Opportunities exist in every development to integrate renewable technologies, 
such as heat pumps and photo -voltaic cells. The provision needs to be 
proportionate to the development proposed but as technolo gies improve and 
prices fall, building renewables in as an integral part of a scheme will become 
normal practice . 
4.112.  Energy efficiency measures and the generation of on -site renewable energy to 
serve a development’s needs must not make the development unviable.  
4.113.  Larger residential developments have greater scope to incorporate measures 
that would result in greater levels of energy efficiency. The y also offer 
opportunities to do more by implementing district -wide energy and/or heating 
schemes. District heating consists of a network to deliver heat to multiple 
buildings from a central heat source. Heat is generated in  an energy centre 
and then pumped through underground pipes to the building s, which are 
usually connected to the network via a heat exchanger . This replaces 
individual boilers for space heating and hot water. This is a more efficient 
method of supplying he at than individual boilers and consequently, district 
heating is considered to be a low carbon technology. District heating schemes 
have the potential to serve areas beyond that of the development site itself.  
                                            
7 Renewable and low carbon energy refers to those sources of energy which are either not depleted, 
such a s wind or solar, or which are finite but which emit low amounts of carbon dioxide.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 106 
  Natural and Historic Environment  
DP12.  The Natural Environment  
The avoidance of harm to Shropshire’s natural assets and their conservation, enhancement 
and restoration will be achieved by:  
Designated sites and priority species and habitats  
1. Requiring a project -level Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) for all proposals 
where the Local Planning Authority identifies a likely significant effect on an 
internationally designated site. Permission will be refused where such a HRA indicates 
an adverse effect on the integrity of a designated sit e which cannot be avoided or fully 
mitigated. Where mitigation can remove an adverse effect, including that identified by 
the HRA for the Plan, measures will be required in accordance with  the Plan HRA  and 
supporting documents  and/or  as set out in the relevant settlement strategies  (policies S1 
-21); and/or  remedial actions identified in the management plan for the internationally 
designated site as appropriate ; and/or policies DP14 , DP15 , DP19 , DP22  and DP25 . 
Polic y DP13  sets out particular requirements for  development in the catchment of the 
river Clun Special Area of Conservation (SAC).  
2. Ensuring that the following types of development  are determined in line with national 
policy: 
a. on land within or outside a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and which is likely to 
have an adverse effect on it (either individually or in combination with other 
developments) ; or  
b. resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient 
woodland and ancient or veteran trees ) 
Biodiversity Net Gain  
3. Ensuring that all development delivers a t least a 10% net gain for biodiversity in 
accordance with the Environment Act , any future Local Nature Recovery St rategy 
(LNRS)  and policies DP14 , DP15 , DP16  and DP22 . 
Natural Assets  
4. Ensuring that proposals which are likely to have an adverse effect on  any of the 
following natural assets:  
a. Locally designated biodiversity sites;  
b. Locally designated geological sites;  
c. Priority species;  
d. Priority habitats; and  
e. Geological assets ; 
f. Habitats cr eated as part of a Biodiversity Net Gain plan  and not covered by a 
Conservation Covenant  
are accompanied by an Ecological or Geological  Impact Assessment  as appropriate.  
This should be carried out by a suitably qualified professional in accordance with 
industry standards and be proportionate to the scale of the impact and the importance of 
the asset.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 107 
  5. Ensuring that proposals which are shown to have an adverse effect , direc tly, indirectly or 
cumulatively, to those natural assets listed above will only be permitted if it can be 
clearly demonstrated that:  
a. there is no satisfactory alternative means of avoiding the adverse effect  through re -
design or by re -locating on an alternative site and;  
b. the social or economic benefits of the proposal outweigh the adverse effect . 
6. Ensuring that where proposals meet these tests, mitigation measures to reduce the 
harm will be sought in the first  instance. Compensation measures for residual harm will 
only be accepted as a last resort. Mitigation and compensation measures must be 
demonstrated to be achievable  and be in accordance with policies DP14 , DP15 , DP16 , 
DP17 , DP19 , DP22  and DP23 . Appropriate conditions and/or planning obligations will be 
used to ensure that such measures are fully implemented and monitored where 
required.  
7. Maximising opportunities to increase the quantity , quality and connectivity of natural 
assets  in accordance with policies  DP14 , DP15 , DP16  and DP22  through habitat 
creation and man agement measures, provision of appropriately designed and suitably 
located bat and bird boxes and any other such measures e.g swift bricks, which would  
support protected or priority species.   
 
Trees, Woodlands and Hedgerows  
8. The retention of trees and a significant increase in the extent and distribution of trees, 
woodlands and hedgerows in Shropshire will be achieved by :  
a. Ensuring that for all proposals directly affecting existing trees or where trees are 
immediately adjacent to a development site, such trees are recorded in line with 
guidance in the relevant British Standard and that the record is submitted as part of 
the planning application. Opportunities to retain trees of high amenity and 
environmental value taking into consideration both their indiv idual merit and their 
contribution as part of a group or broader landscape feature should be considered 
and documented as part of this ; 
b. Ensuring that applicants provide details as to how retained trees, hedges and hedge 
banks will be protected prior to, during and after construction ;  
c. Ensuring that no building, hard surfacing , drainage or underground works are 
permitted that do not accord with the principles of the relevant British Standard  and 
policy DP22  unless, exceptionally, the Council is satisfied that such works can be 
accommodated without harm to the trees concerned or there are overriding reasons 
for development to proceed ; 
d. Encouraging new development to plant new trees, woodlands and hedgerows in line 
with the Shropshire Tree and Woodland Strategy, Shropshire G reen Infrastructure 
Strategy  and the provisions of the Environment Act with respect to Biodiversity Net 
Gain ; and  
e. Ensuring that native species hedgerows are retained on development sites, unless 
there are overriding public benefits  that justify their removal. Where removal is 
deemed necessary, details addressing the criteria under the Hedgerow Regulations 
1997 (as amend ed) should be submitted to demonstrate the validity of removal along 
with details of replacement hedgerows. Replacement hedgerows should be of an 
equal scale, comprise an appropriate  mix of native species and where possible, 
should be provided on site. Where there are gaps in the existing native species 
hedgerows on the site, the development should provide sufficient additional 
hedgerow planting , with appropriate native species , to restore continuity.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 108 
  Explanation  
4.114.  This policy sets out the level of protection offered to Shropshire’s natural 
assets. Natural assets  include internationally and nationally designated sites, 
locally designated biodiversity and geological features and priority species 
and habitats.  
4.115.  Such as sets provide ecosystem services including; flood relief; soil retention; 
climate change mitigation  and adaptation; carbon sequestration; interception 
of airborne pollutants; water filtration; amenity value; health and well -being 
benefits and opportunities for tourism and recreational activities. These 
services are essential to a thriving economy.  
4.116.  Internationally and nationally important sites of wildlife conservation and 
geological interest as well as legally protected habitats and species will be 
afforded the highest level of protection in line with the relevant legislation and 
policy. Development proposals affecting or involving the following will be 
assessed in accordance with the relevant legislation and national policy; 
European and nationally designate d wildlife sites (Special Protection Areas 
(SPA), Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), Ramsar sites and Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and all candidate designations; ancient 
woodland and other irreplaceable habitats and aged or veteran trees ;  
4.117.  The Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) for the Plan identifies the 
potential for adverse effects on the integrity of a number of internationally 
designated sites. It also sets out the settlements where housing  and 
employment uses may cause such harm. The Plan HRA then also identifies 
the mitigation measures necessary to remove that harm and these are 
reflected where relevant in other parts of this Plan. Note: n o mitigation 
measures have yet been identified for devel opment in the river Clun 
catchment (see policy DP13 ). 
4.118.  However, other development may have an adverse effect on the integrity of 
an internationally des ignated site. Where Shropshire Council identifies the 
potential for such an effect, a project -level HRA will be needed and applicants 
will be required to supply sufficient and appropriate information to enable the 
Council to complete this.  
4.119.  Where a project -level HRA shows that development may have an adverse 
effect on the integrity of an internationally designated site, permission will be 
refused if this cannot be avoided or fully mitigated.  
4.120.  Project -level mitigation measures may include; phasing development to allow 
time for infrastructure improvements to be put in place; increasing the amount 
of semi -natural open space to provide alternative informal recreation 
opportunities in line with policy DP15  or developer contributions towards 
remedial actions identified in the management or action plan for the 
internationally designated site or in the Place Plan for the area.  
4.121.  The government announced in 2019 that it would mandate biodiversity net 
gain to ensure that new development enhances the environment, contributes 
to our ecological networks and conserves our precious landscapes. The 
Environment Act  will make it mandatory f or housing and development to 
achieve at least a 10% net gain in value for biodiversity – a requirement that 
habitats for wildlife must be left in a measurably better state than before the 
development. Developers must submit a ‘biodiversity gain plan’ alon gside 
usual planning application documents. The local authority must assess Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 109 
  whether the 10% net gain requirement is met in order to approve the 
biodiversity gain plan.  
4.122.  If net gain is not achievable on -site, the biodiversity gain plan will need to 
include o ff-site habitat enhancements, in line with the mitigation hierarchy . 
The local authority must be satisfied that this is secured through a planning 
obligation or conservation covenant. If habitats are significantly enhanced 
within the development site, thes e improvements must be secured in the 
same way , or through a planning condition. The biodiversity net gain 
requirement builds on existing good practice in industry and local planning 
policy and will include simplified processes for small developments.  
4.123.  Delivery of biodiversity net gain will be guided by Local Nature Recovery 
Strategies (LNRSs) and Nature Recovery Networks (NRNs) when available , in 
accordance with the Environment Act and existing biodiversity evidence bases 
including the Shropshire Environmen tal Network and Shropshire Green 
Infrastructure Strategy. Biodiversity net gain will focus on habitat creation or 
enhancement where it will achieve the greatest benefits for nature and 
communities.  
4.124.  The principle behind  the natural assets section of the policy follows the 
hierarchy of:  
a. Avoid loss or damage;  
b. Where the public benefits of the development clearly outweigh the value of 
any assets affected, provide adequate mitigation measures for any full or 
partial harm or loss;  
c. As a last resort, where neither a voidance nor mitigation is reasonably 
possible, provide adequate compensation measures.  
4.125.  Development proposals must firstly assess whether they are likely to affect a 
natural asset, using current  accepted guidance and best practice. The 
assessment should be  proportionate to the effect and the nature of the 
proposal. Effects can be direct, indirect or cumulative. Where an adverse  
effect is identified, further work should be carried out to define the significance 
of the effect as well as the  social or economic  benefits of the proposal.  
4.126.  Where loss or damage to an asset is likely then all reasonable alternative 
methods of delivering the proposal should be considered. If no solution can be 
found, through use of an alternative site or redesign to avoid harm for 
example, and the demonstrated  social or economic benefits of the proposed 
development clearly outweigh the harm to that asset, then mitigation and 
compensation measures will be sought through planning conditions or 
planning agreements.  
4.127.  Proposals should demon strate that on -site mitigation or compensation 
measures are not feasible, before off -site measures will be considered. Offsite 
compensation measures, including  tree and/or hedge planting, will be 
considered within the same settlement or Place Plan area in which the 
development is located. All on - and off -site compensation, mitigation or 
offsetting measures should be accompanied by a management plan detailing 
management and implementation provisions and indicating how these will be 
resourced, both financiall y and practically over an agreed timescale.  
4.128.  If neither on - nor off - site mitigation or compensation is possible, applicants 
will be encouraged, where appropriate, to make a contribution via a section 
106 agreement to funds to support the conservation and e nhancement of Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 110 
  natural assets (including the planting of trees, woodland and hedgerow) more 
widely in Shropshire in accordance with the Green Infrastructure Strategy, the 
Place Plans , any Local Nature Recovery Strategy  and other relevant 
Shropshire Council strategies for the natural environment.  
4.129.  Locally designated biodiversity and geological sites include Local Wildlife 
Sites, Local Geological  Sites, Local Nature Reserves and Local Green 
Spaces where the latter are notified (at least in part ), for their wild life value. 
Priority species and habitats are listed in the section 41 of the NERC Act 
2006.  
4.130.  Where habitat enhancement or creation measures fall within a designated 
Ministry of Defence safeguarding zone, care should be taken to ensure that 
they do not result in an environment which attracts large or flocking bird 
species that would reduce aviation safety.   
4.131.  Trees, woodlands and hedges are integral and significant features in 
Shropshire’s landscapes and town scapes and their retention and proper 
management is an essential factor in maintaining local distinctiveness and 
combatting climate change. Existing trees, woods and hedges make an 
important contribution to public amenity, biodiversity, landscape, heritage  and 
ecosystem services and make a significant contribution to the character of 
buildings and settlements , 
4.132.  Developers should provide a detailed tree survey as part of a planning 
application. This should be carried out in accordance with the relevant British 
Standard. Where trees are proposed to be removed, it should be 
demonstrated in the planning application t he reasons for the removal and any 
proposals for replacement trees. Where appropriate, replacement trees or 
mitigation measures will be sought / secured primarily through sustainable 
design agreed prior to the determination of the application and subsequen tly 
consolidated through the imposition of planning conditions . 
4.133.  Development proposals should ensure that proposed building works will not 
encroach into tree exclusion zones and that retained trees are protected 
during construction in accordance with the re levant British Standard. These 
measures should be outlined in the planning application.

  DP13.  Development in the River Clun Catchment  
1. To protect the integrity of the river Clun Special Area of Conservation and to comply with 
the Habitats Regulations and policy DP12 , development within the catchment of the river 
Clun will only be permitted if it can demonstrate either nutrient  neutrality or nutrient 
betterment.   
2. All measures relied on to deliver either nutrient neutrality or nutrient betterment must 
demonstrate with sufficient certainty that they:  
a. Meet the required nutrient reduction or improvement; and  
b. They can be secured and funded for the lifetime of the development’s effects.  
 
 
Explanation  
4.134.  The extent of the river Clun catchment is illustrated in Figure DP1 3.1.  
Figure DP1 3.1: Extent of the River Clun Catchment  
 
4.135.  Part of the river Clun is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) notified solely 
for the presence of Freshwater Pearl Mussels. The SAC is within Unit 6 of the 
River Teme Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which was assessed at 
March 2014 as being in  unfavourable declining condition for a number of 
reasons. These include high levels of silt and nutrients (particularly ortho -
phosphate and nitrogen) which affect the health of the pearl mussel 
population. A review of the monitoring data from the Environm ent Agency 
(EA) for the River Clun (2000 -2011), shows that although there has been an 
improvement in the ortho -phosphate (P) concentration, it is higher than is 
required for a recruiting pearl mussel population. Additionally, in most of the 
river Clun, inc luding within the SAC, it is higher than that required to maintain 
adult mussels. The River Clun Nutrient Management Plan 2014 was jointly 
commissioned by Natural England and the Environment Agency. It gathered 
together a wealth of information on the catch ment and SAC, set targets for 
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 112 
  ortho -phosphate, nitrogen and suspended solids to be achieved by 2027 and 
detailed a range of mitigation measures that could be applied to reach the 
targets. Improvements to waste -water treatment works serving the catchment 
were made as a result of this . 
4.136.  Notwithstanding these improvements, t he Habitat Regulation s Assessment 
(HRA) for th is Plan shows that most* development in the river Clun catchment 
is likely to have an adverse effect on the river Clun SAC. Practical mitigation  
measures which would remove this effect for larger applications have yet to 
be proposed, but this is not to say that they will not come forward during the 
Plan period. Accordingly, to comply with the requirements of the Conservation 
of Habitats and Specie s Regulations 2017, this policy restricts development to 
that which is either nutrient neutral in terms of its effect on the SAC or results 
in a betterment. This is in anticipation of measures to achieve either of these 
criteria being found in the future f or the majority8 of development in the 
catchment. Such measures could include an updated Nutrient Management 
Plan and sufficiently robust Action Plan to provide the level of certainty 
required by the Habitats Regulations that the SAC restoration targets ca n be 
achieved in an appropriate timescale.  
4.137.  Natural England’s advice on nutrient neutrality measures states that they 
should:  
a. Have sufficient certainty that the measures will deliver the required 
reduction to make the development neutral;  
b. Have sufficient certainty that the measures will be implemented, e.g. 
secured and funded for the lifetime of the development’s effects;  
c. Be preventive in nature so as to avoid effects in the first place rather than 
offset or compensate for damage. Consideration will therefore need to be 
given as to (i) when the measures will come online and into effect and (ii) 
when the pollutants come online as the impact may be phased and take 
place over the lifetime of a development, rather than on day one. It may be 
that a ra nge of measures may be helpful to address impacts over time;  
d. Not undermine the objective of restoring the site to favourable condition by 
making the restore objective appreciably more difficult, or prejudicing the 
fulfilment of that objective. For example,  where there is only a limited pool 
of measures available for addressing an existing exceeded threshold and 
these are used to enable growth rather than bring the site into favourable 
condition. The key question would be whether, in fact, there is actually a 
limited pool of measures in the relevant circumstances;  
e. Not directly use or double count measures that are in place to meet the 
Habitats Directive article 6(1)(2) requirements in order to justify new growth;  
f. Be carefully justified, together with calculat ions of the baseline nutrient 
contribution of the development and any avoidance land (e.g. wetland to 
avoid effects). For example, over -estimating the existing impact of 
development land and under -estimating existing benefits from avoidance 
land to reduce the amount of measures needed to meet nutrient neutrality  
would not satisfy the precautionary principle; and 
g. Ensure that the baseline for the development site and any avoidance land 
does not undermine the objective of restoring the site.  
                                            
8 Shropshire Council has produced a Guidance Note on Development within the river Clun catchment 
which gives information on what types of development are not likely to damag e the SAC and the 
information needed to support such applications www.shropshire.gov.uk/media/1874/gn12 -

  DP14.  Green Infrastructu re 
1. Development in Shropshire will be accompanied by an improved and expanded green 
infrastructure network  as an integral part of open space provision.  This will be achieved 
by ensuring that all new development:  
a. Avoids the loss of, or harm to, existing green infrastructure assets in accordance with 
Policy DP12  and the disruption or fragmentation of the existin g green infrastructure 
network  (which i nclud es the Shropshire environmental and ecological networks ). 
Proposals should be accompanied by a proportionate assessment (a G reen 
Infrastructure  Assessment) of existing green infrastructure assets and the green 
infrastructure network on and in the vicinity of the site  and address  the quality  and 
quantity  of such features ; 
b. Enhances existing green infrastructure assets and extends the green infrastructure 
network in accordance with the Shropshire Green Infrastructure Strategy. Proposals 
should also have regard to Neighbourhood Plans and  other relevant  local strategies 
such as the Shrewsbury Big Town Plan , where these are available ;  
c. Delivers good quality new green infrastructure on site  which can be acce ssed by 
people  of any age, gender  and ability , as an integral part of the open space provision  
and which  provide s as many of the following benefits as possible:  
i. Enhance s and enable s greater connectivity of the existing green infrastructure 
network and individual green infrastructure assets;  
ii. Conserve s and enhance s biodiversity in accordance with biodiversity net gain 
requirements and Policy DP12 ; 
iii. Supports the deliver y of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures  in line 
with Policies SP3 and DP11 . 
iv. Improve s air quality;  and 
v. Address es identified local health and wellbeing needs and encourag es active and 
healthy lifestyles  in line with Policy SP6. 
2. Where on site green infrastructure provision is demonstrably not possible or practical, 
there will be an onus on the delivery of good quality open space in line with the 
requirements of Policy DP15 .  
3. For significant new development , including  the strategic sites  and the settlements  
identified in Policies S1 -21, green infrastructure  should  be an integral part of a  
masterplan showing good quality and appropriate on -site provision  which :  
a. Delivers a green infrastructure network which links existing and new green 
infrastructure assets in a coherent manner and maximises the benefits outlined in 
(1(c)) above; and  
b. Connec ts to the green infrastructure network in the surroun ding area and improves 
that network’s accessibility and linkages where possible.   
4. Where a site delivers green infrastructure as part of its open space provision , its future 
management and maintenance  will be secured through a planning obligation.    
5. Development proposals that result in a significant fragmentation or loss to the green 
infrastructure network will be resisted. In such instances mitigation and compensatory 
measures will be expected with the aim of delivering a net gain in provision.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 114 
  Explanation  
4.138.  Infrastructure is a term typically applied to things like roads, sewers  and 
telecommunications, which are necessary to support our way of life. The term 
“green infrastructure” has been introduced to raise the profile of other things 
considered necessary to support our way of life, especially one that is 
sustainable, healthy and enjoyable. As such, green infrastructure (GI) refers to 
the network of natural and semi natural spaces and includes parks, pl aying 
fields, woodlands, allotments and street trees . These spaces can be in the 
urban and rural areas and also include ‘blue infrastructure’ such as ponds, 
streams and rivers. In Shropshire, green infrastructure also encompasses the 
environmental and ecol ogical networks.  
4.139.  The Shropshire Green Infrastructure Strategy states that GI comprises green 
or blue spaces (i.e. those which include some form of habitat or potential 
habitat) which can provide multifunctional purposes for the environment and 
quality of l ife, and which are strategically identified and /or planned at different 
scales to form a high -quality integrated network.   
4.140.  Green infrastructure is important as it can not only deliver environmental 
benefits but also benefits for humans in the form of acce ss to open space. A 
wide range of research has been produced which shows the benefit of green 
infrastructure and its positive impact on the health of the community and the 
natural environment.  
4.141.  This policy aims to plan for better green infrastructure from t he outset and 
looks to all new development to make a reasonable contribution wherever 
possible, including linking up to existing green infrastructure in the area. This 
also ties -in with other policy aims, including improvements in biodiversity, 
tackling cl imate change, protecting landscape, reducing recreational impact s 
on internationally designated wildlife sites and ensuring a high -quality local 
environment and an enhanced quality of life. The National Planning Policy 
Framework requires Local Authorities to plan positively for the creation, 
protection, enhancement and management of networks of biodiversity and 
green infrastructure.  
4.142.  Green infrastructure within Shropshire plays a vital role in: conserving, 
maintaining and enhancing existing natural features and networks; addressing 
identified health and well -being needs; supporting adaptation to, and 
mitigation of, climate change; improving air and water quality and increasing 
opportunities for active travel, walking and cycling. Good quality green 
infrastruc ture can also boost local economic activity.  
4.143.  The Shropshire Green Infrastructure Strategy (2020) recommends a policy 
approach to development based on an assessment of existing green 
infrastructure assets. This forms the basis for the protection of existing green 
infrastructure and the provision of new . The Strategy then identifies the 
opportunities for the protection, enhancement and provision of new green 
infrastructure around the Strategic, Key and Principal settlements based on 6 
key themes of:  
a. biodiversity and geology ; 
b. landscape heritage and culture ; 
c. water resources ; 
d. active travel, access and recreation ;  
e. health and wellbeing ; and  
f. climate change.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 115 
  Developers will be expected to deliver such opportunities  as part of planning 
proposals wherever possible.  Regard should also be had to community 
aspirations for green infrastructure as expressed in the Place Plans and in 
conjunction with Policy DP15 . 
4.144.  it is not feasible to identify every component of green infrastructure in and 
around Community Hubs and Community Clusters. However, even in the 
absence of a specific green infrastructure opportunity map for an area, 
improving the connectivi ty of green areas (including streams, ponds and other 
watercourses)  should still be considered. By identifying such areas in the 
vicinity of a development site, it is possible to consider the possibility of 
improving connections through development. An exa mple could be the 
provision of footpaths and cycle ways through a site to link existing publicly 
accessible green spaces, or a public green connecting a pond on site to a 
hedgerow and fields beyond the site boundary.  
4.145.  The requirement for new open spaces for  sport and recreation alongside new 
development is included in Policy DP15 .

  DP15.  Open Space  and Recreation  
1. To ensure people have sufficient opportunities to play, walk and generally stay healthy, 
the delivery of good quality, accessible and well -maintained open space is an essential 
part of new development.  
2. Existing  open space, sports and recreational building s and land, including playing fields , 
should not  be built on unless:  
a) an assessment has been undertaken which clearly show s the open space, buildings 
or land to be surplus to requirements; or  
b) the loss resulting from the proposed development would be replaced by equivalent or 
better provision in terms of quantity and quality in a suitable location; or  
c) the development is f or alternative sports and recreational provision, the benefits of 
which clearly outweigh the loss of the current or former use.  
3. There is an expectation that new housing developments provides on -site open space 
provision equivalent to 30sqm per person, assuming one person per bedroom.  
However, consideration will be given to reducing this level of provision in instances  
where the de velopment is able to provide a particularly high quality of open space on 
site which meet s the needs of all residents . 
4. For developments where an adverse effect on the integrity of an internationally or 
nationally designated wildlife site due to recreational impacts has been identified  (in 
accordance with Policy DP12  or the HRA for this Plan)  particular consideration will be 
given to the need  for semi -natural open space provision in excess of 30sqm per person.  
5. In line with Policy DP14 , there is a preference for open space provision to form an 
integral part of opportunities to improve green infrastructure networks.  In circumstances 
where this cannot be achieved, open space provision should be located appropriately  
within the site in order to offer the best opportunity for access to all res idents . Where 
sufficient open space provision is not possible, an appropriate off -site provision will be 
sought. In all cases f ragmented parcels of open space will not be acceptable.    
6. Consideration will be given to the need for housing developments to provide functional 
areas of play and recreation as part of their open space provision in proportion to their 
scale. Proximity and accessibility to existing quality play facilities will be taken into 
account in determining the level of need for such facilities. Where on -site provision is 
required, this will be located appropriately within the site, and must be accessible to all  
reside nts. 
7. The outcomes of the Shropshire  Playing Pitch and Open Space Strategy (PPOSS)  and 
the Leisure Facilities Strategy will be taken int o account in determining the level and 
type of sport and recreational  facilities  required to meet the needs of new development. 
Reference should also be made to the relevant Place Plan for other community 
identified  needs for open space.  
8. Where nece ssary,  consideration will be given to  seeking to address any settlement 
constraints as pa rt of new development, either on -site or by way of a developer 
contribution  for off -site provision.   
9. For non -residential development, open space provision should be design -led and 
informed by the character and context of the development proposed.  
10. Areas of open space will be managed and maintained in perpetuity by way of legal 
agreement.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 117 
  Explanation  
4.146.  The provision of good quality and accessible open space is an essential part 
of new development.  The benefits of this are many, from the encouragement 
of healthier lifestyles to the creation of more cohesive communities and 
neighbourhoods.  Whilst good qu ality open space can define a housing 
development for the better, poor quality open space is often equally as 
noticeable.   
4.147.  Policy DP15  outlines the standards expected in the creation of open space on 
new development. When read alongside Policy DP14 , these policies provide a 
clear emphasis for using open space provision as a means of creating and 
improving green infrastructure links as a priority wherever possible.  However, 
where this cannot be achieved there are many bene fits of creating good 
quality open space  on site .  On site open space provision can include a range 
of uses, such as formal and informal sport and recreation space, general 
amenity space, allotments , and can include dual purposes uses such as 
surface water  drainage. However, whatever its form, the importance lays in its 
accessibility and usability.  
4.148.  The policy provides the quantum of open space which will be sought from 
development as a starting point for discussions.  However, it is recognised the 
provision of open space should not be drive n purely by mathematical 
calculation, and with this in mind the Council will apply the notion of ‘quality 
over quantity’, especially in those instances  where a development is 
proposing an exceptionally high standa rd of provision. Equally , the Council will 
not accept open space proposals which provide fragmented and disjointed 
spaces, even if this technically complies with the quantum of open space 
sought.   
4.149.  The Shropshire Playing Pitch and Open Space Strategy ( PPOS S) provides an 
audit of existing outdoor sports facilities in Shropshire  structured along 
geographical groupings of Place Plan areas . It covers  football, cricket, rugby 
union, hockey, tennis, netball and crown green bowls  and was prepared in 
consultation with Sport England , each sport’s  National Governing Bod y (NGB ) 
and relevant sports clubs in Shropshire.  
4.150.  The PPOSS  identifies areas  of deficit and surplus provision  (including 
ancillary facilities ) and provides recommendations on the type and amount of 
sports pitches needed to support  housing growth. The Council will use the 
PPOSS in consult ation with  Sport England and relevant NGB s to determine  
playing field investment priorities arising from planning proposals.  Sport 
England’s  Playing Pitch Calculator (PPC) will form the basis for determining 
the level of developer contributions.  The PPOSS  will be reviewed annually 
and updated in  line with Sport England guidance  as necessary.  
4.151.  The Shropshire Leisure Facilities Strategy performs the same function as the 
PPOSS but covers sports halls, swimming pools,  fitness facilities, indoor 
bowls and squash courts. It identifies qualitative and quantitative needs 
arising from planned growth. As  with the PPOSS, the Council will use the 
Leisure Facilities Strategy to guide future investment needs arising from 
development, for indoor sports facilities   
4.152.  The Shropshire Place Plans set out community aspirations for open space 
provision  and development will be expected to deliver these where ver 
possible.

  DP16.  Landscaping of New Development  
To create and maintain an attractive and well -designed environment, development proposals 
will be expected to provide landscaping on site, unless the Council agrees that off -site 
landscaping would be more appropriate. Landscape schemes should meet all of t he 
following:  
1. Existing natural, semi -natural and formal landscape features as well as the presence of 
heritage assets and/or their settings, on and in the vicinity of the site should be recorded 
as part of a detailed survey in accordance with the principl es of the relevant industry 
guidance and best practice  
2. Existing features of landscape or ecological value or with heritage significance should be 
conserved and enhanced in accordance with Policies DP12 , DP23  and DP24 .  Scheme 
design should be sympathetic to their importance to avoid harm.  Proposals within or 
affecting the Shropshire Hills AONB should also refer to the AONB Management Plan for 
guidance.  
3. The proposed landscaping scheme should take into account:  
a. The existing character of the site (see also Policy DP17 ); 
b. The existing character in the vicinity of the site, including proposed landscaping as 
part of adjacent development proposals , in line with Policy DP17 ; 
c. Constraints such as flood risk  (see also Policy DP21 ) utility and service corridors ; 
d. Heritage assets and their settings on site and in the vicinity  (see also Policy DP23 ); 
e. Soil type  (see also Policy DP18 ); 
f. Ecological value  (see also Policy DP12 ); 
g. The proposed function of the development ; 
h. Opportunities to contribute to green infrastructure in accordance with Policy DP14 ; 
and to provide a diverse and interesting design which integrates with and makes a 
positive contribution to its surroundings  (see also Policy DP16 ). 
4. New tree planting as part of a proposed landscaping scheme should be selected, planted 
and established in accordance with current best practice guidance within the relevant 
British Standard  and Policy DP12 . Native species of local provenance are preferred.  
5. Hedgerow and shrub planting and other soft landscaping should include specimen trees 
with a m ature height up to  15-20 metres within both the hard and soft landscaped areas.  
6. Trees within adoptable areas should be incorporated as part of the infrastructure planning 
and design stage in accordance with current best practice.  
 
Explanation  
4.153.  The space that surrounds and is between  buildings as well as the boundaries 
of development sites can be just as important as the buildings themselves. 
Such landscaping is important not only for its visual qualities, but it can also 
help with climate regulation , biodiversity and the general mental wellbeing 
associated with being outdoors in a green space. Green roofs and walls can 
contribute to a feeling of naturalness  Published research identifies the benefits 
of green environments and landscaping in residentia l areas. the workplace 
and the streetscape. As part of the planning of developments, landscaping 
should be considered from the outset. The type and location of landscaping Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 119 
  proposed is important as it makes a crucial contribution to the sense of place 
and h elps to integrate new development with its surroundings.  
4.154.  Care should be taken when designing landscaping schemes in line with 
Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP17 , DP18 , DP22 , DP23  and DP24  and 
arrangements should be made to ensure the future survival of features 
provided and to avoid future maintenance problems .

  DP17.  Landscape and Visual Amenity  
1. Development proposals should respect, safeguard, and wherever possible, restore or 
enhance landscape character and visual amenity in Shropshire.  
2. All major development proposals and developments which are likely to generate 
significant effects as a result of the presence of highly sensitive landscape (see Policy 
DP24  for the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) and visual receptors 
and/or high magnitude of effect, must be accompanied by an appropriate and 
proportionate assessment of landsca pe and visual impacts, unless it is agreed by the 
Council that this is not necessary. The assessment of landscape and visual impacts 
must follow industry good practice, be carried out by a suitably qualified and 
experienced landscape professional and be su fficient to determine the significance of 
predicted effects on landscape character, landscape elements and visual amenity. 
Assessment of landscape effects must take account of the landscape characterisation 
set out in the Shropshire Landscape Typology, and  where applicable, the Shropshire 
Landscape and Visual Sensitivity Study.  
3. Significant adverse landscape and visual effects, either individually or cumulatively with 
other relevant proposed or exis ting developments, will be a material consideration in 
determining planning applications. Where such effects are identified, then the landscape 
and visual impact assessment should also provide details of measures to prevent or 
avoid these in the first instance. Measures to reduce such impacts should be identified 
before measures to offset or compensate any residual effects are set out. The nature of 
any landscape and visual effects remaining should be clearly defined to enable the 
impact of the proposal on landscape character to be identified.  
4. Proposals which safe guard key landscape and visual receptors, lead to the 
strengthening of landscape character or an improvement in visual amenity will be 
supported subject to other plan policies. Applicants should refer to the design guidelines 
section of the Shropshire Land scape and Visual Sensitivity Study (where appropriate) 
for guidance.  
 
Explanation  
4.155.  The definition of landscape is broad. The UK has signed and ratified the 
European Landscape Convention (ELC) since 2002, and the ELC adopts a 
definition of landscape as foll ows; ‘Landscape is an area, as perceived by 
people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural 
and/or human factors (Council of Europe, 2000)’.  
4.156.  The importance of the ELC definition is that it moves beyond the idea that 
landscape  is only a matter of aesthetics and visual amenity. Instead, it 
encourages a focus on landscape as a resource in its own right. Whilst it 
includes the visual appearance of land, including shape, form and colour, it is 
the interrelationship of the natural f actors of geology, topography, soils, 
ecology and the human factors of land use, archaeology and architecture 
which influence the formation of landscape.  
4.157.  In addition to the ELC definition of landscape, visual amenity is defined in 
GLVIA3 as; ‘The overall p leasantness of the views people enjoy of their 
surroundings, which provides an attractive visual setting or backdrop for the 
enjoyment of activities of the people living, working, recreating, visiting or 
travelling through an area.’  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 121 
   
4.158.  Shropshire offers a diverse range of scenery, from the large lakes and rolling 
pasturelands around Ellesmere in the north, to the hidden heritage of the Clee 
Hills with their stark industrial ruins in the south. The landscape forms an 
integral part of the County’s economy, not only because of the farming 
industries it sustains but also because of the residents, tourists and investors 
it attracts. The importance of the County ’s landscape is recognised as being 
part of the area’s special appeal, with the Shro pshire Hills being formally 
designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Great weight 
should be given to conserving landscape and scenic beauty in AONBs  
(national policy and Policy DP24 ) and the statutory Shropshire Hills AONB 
Management Plan  can be a material consideration in development 
management decisions.  
4.159.  The Council places a high priority on the conservation and enhancement of 
the landscape character and visual amenity of the distinctive landscapes of 
Shropshire for their own sake, so that they can contribute to quality of life in 
the County.  
4.160.  The Shropshire Landscape Typology provides a statement of the existing 
landscape character features and attributes which make up the 27 distinctive 
landscape types within the County . The Shropshire Landscape and Visual 
Sensitivity Study assesses the landscape around all the settlements identified 
for growth in th is Plan . It looks at landscape ch aracter and visual amenity and 
identifies how sensitive each is to change caused by housing and employment 
development.  
4.161.  There are no statutory criteria or standards laid down for the assessment of 
landscape and visual impacts which may arise from developme nt. However, 
best practice for this area of work in the UK is set out in the ‘Guidelines for 
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment’ 3nd Edition (GLVIA3), published 
by the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment and the 
Landscape Institute in 2013 (Landscape Institute, 2013).  
4.162.  Landscape and visual effects are separate, but closely linked. An assessment 
of landscape effects deals with the effects of change and development on 
landscape as a resource and how a development may affect the elements t hat 
make up the landscape, the aesthetic and perceptual aspects of the 
landscape and its distinctive character. An assessment of visual effects deals 
with the effects of change and development on the views available to people 
and their visual amenity, and how the surroundings of individuals or groups of 
people may be specifically affected by changes in the content and character 
of views as a result of the change to or loss of existing elements of the 
landscape and/or introduction of new elements.  
4.163.  Assessmen t of landscape and visual effects may be carried out formally, as 
part of an Environmental Impact Assessment, when a Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment (LVIA) should be carried out in accordance with the 
requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessm ent Regulations 2017, or 
as an informal assessment known as a Landscape and Visual Assessment. 
Assessment. The assessment should be used as part of an iterative design 
process.  
4.164.  As a minimum, an LVIA or LVA submitted to the Council for consideration 
should  be prepared taking into account the following : 
a. An emphasis on the identification of likely significant effects ; Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 122 
  b. An approach which is proportional to the scale of the project that is being 
assessed and the nature of its likely effects ; 
c. Judgements based on clear and transparent methods so that the 
reasoning applied at different stages can be traced and examined by 
others ; 
d. Evidence of the competency of the author should be provided ; 
e. A detailed methodology for the assessment of effects should be included ; 
f. Assessments should be provided separately for landscape and visual 
effects whilst understanding the overlap between them ; 
g. Assessments of landscape effects should include both the physical 
elements that make up the landscape as well as landscape c haracter. 
Assessment of effects on landscape character should have regard to the 
published character assessments contained in Natural England’s National 
Character Area profiles and the Shropshire Landscape Typology, and 
where appropriate, the assessments c ontained in the Shropshire 
Landscape and Visual Sensitivity Study  
h. Where appropriate, assessment of landscape character at a site -specific 
level should be undertaken ; 
i. Identification of the potential for and assessment of cumulative landscape 
and visual effe cts; and  
j. Identification of appropriate mitigation measures . 
4.165.  GLVIA3 sets out best practice for the assessment of landscape and visual 
effects and provides a framework which may be tailored to fit the needs of a 
particular project. In addition, an LVIA/LVA should take account of the 
guidance set out in Technical Guidance Note 06/19 Visual Representation of 
Development Proposals (The Landscape Institute, 2019). In considering the 
content of an LVIA/LVA, the Council will have regard to the guidance in  
Technical Guidance Note 1/20 Reviewing Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessments (LVIAs) and Landscape and Visual Appraisals (LVAs) (The 
Landscape Institute, 2020).

  DP18.  Pollution and Public Amenity  
Development will comply with existing pollution control regimes and national objectives for 
pollutants. Proposals should be designed from the outset to; safeguard  environmental 
qualit y and public amenity ; minimise pollution; mitigate adverse effects ; and maximise 
opportunities for improvements  where practicable.  
1. Development will ensure that it is appropriate for its location, during both construction 
and operation, and that the site is suitable for its proposed use taking into account 
existing conditions and any remediation  proposals. Developme nt affecting existing 
businesses and community facilities will be determined in line with national policy which 
places the onus on the person seeking planning permission to provide suitable 
mitigation before the development is completed.  
2. Development which  is likely to give rise to concerns about air quality, either on its own 
or cumulatively will provide an assessment proportionate to the scale of development 
and level of concern as follows:  
a. A baseline of the existing air quality on the site and surrounding area ; 
b. A prediction of the future air quality without the development ; 
c. A prediction of the likely effects of the development on air quality and suggested 
mitigation measures ; and  
d. A prediction of the future air quality if the development were to proceed  with the 
suggested mitigation measures in place . 
3. Opportunities to improve air quality through the provision of green infrastructure  in 
accordance with Policy DP14 , industry relevant best available techniques, traffic and 
travel management (including linking to active travel networks) and the provision of 
electric charging facilities for vehicles should be maximised. Proposals which would lead 
to an unacceptable risk from air pollution or prevent sustained compliance with limit 
values or national objectives for air pollutants will be refused unless they can be 
practicably amended to avoid that risk.  
4. Devel opment should avoid Shropshire’s best and most versatile agricultural land 
(grades, 1, 2 and 3a) wherever possible, unless the need for and benefit of the 
development justifies the scale and nature of the loss . 
5. The re -use of previously developed (brownfiel d) land is encouraged . Proposals on 
despoiled, degraded, derelict or unstable land or on land affected by contamination will 
be supported, subject to other plan policies, where it can be established by the applicant 
that the site can be safely and viably d eveloped with no significant impact either during 
the construction or operational stages of development on:  
a. Ground and surface water quality in accordance with  Policy DP19 ;  
b. Air quality ; 
c. Soil quality ; 
d. The natural and historic environment in accordance with  Policies  DP12  and DP23 ;  
e. Human health (for contaminated land) ; and  
f. Buildings (for unstable land) . 
6. Additionally, proposals on sites with a known or high likelihood of instability or 
contamination should be accompanied by proportionate and adequate site investigation 
prepared by a competent person. This should determine : 
a. The existence or otherwise of contamination or instability ; Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 124 
  b. The nature, extent and source of the instability or contamination and (for 
conta mination ), the potential pathways ;  
c. The risks associated with the instability or contamination and who these are likely to 
affect ; and  
d. A strategy which sets out measures to remediate any instability or contamination ; 
The developer may need to provide further information if this initial assessment shows 
that the risks cannot be reduced to an acceptable level. The relevant permits or 
permissions should be obtained for all site investigations.  
7. When development may create additional noise, during c onstruction or operation, or 
when new development would be sensitive to the existing noise environment (including 
any anticipated changes to that environment from activities that are permitted but not yet 
commenced) proposals should include a noise assessm ent proportionate to the scale of 
development and the level of concern which sets out:  
a. Whether or not an adverse effect on health and quality of life is occurring or is likely 
to occur ; 
b. The level of any adverse effect as defined in the Noise Policy Statement for England 
Explanatory Note and the noise exposure hierarchy table1; and  
c. Whether a good standard of amenity can be achieved taking into account 
appropriate mitigation measures. Such measures should not make the development 
unsatisfactory in othe r respects . 
8. The noise  assessment should be prepared by an experienced specialist and follow 
industry  good practice as set out in Professional Practice Guidance on Planning and 
Noise (ProPG). Proposals which result in an observed adverse effect2 will be per mitted 
where mitigation can either remove the effect or reduce it to a minimum. Proposals 
which cannot be practicably amended to prevent an unacceptable adverse effect2 or to 
avoid a significant observed effect2 will not be permitted.  
9. One of the special q ualities of the Shropshire Hills AONB is its tranquillity. Proposals 
should consider how they can protect the designated area from noise disturbance in line 
with Policy DP24  and how its tranquillity could be further enhanced through specific 
improvements in soundscape, the provision of green infrastructure in accordance with 
Policy DP14  and the use of quiet modes of access.  
10. It is important for people and wildlife to have the right levels of lighting in the right place 
and for it to be used at the right time. I f any of the following apply:  
a. An existing light installation makes the proposed location for development either 
unsuitable, or suitable only with appropriate mitigation ; 
b. Light levels in the environment around the site would be materially changed ; 
c. The light levels proposed by the development are likely to adversely affect the use 
or enjoyment of nearby buildings or open spaces ; 
d. The impact of new lighting conflicts with the needs of specialist facilities that require 
low levels of surrounding light ; 
e. The development is in or near a protected area of dark sky or an intrinsically dark 
landscape which would be conspicuously affected by new lighting ; 
f. If new lighting would have an impact on safety ; or 
g. If new lighting would have a significant impact on a prot ected site or protected 
species (in accordance with Policy DP12 ) or if it is likely to create light pollution that 
would affect the behaviour of wildl ife; Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 125 
  Then proposals should include a proportionate assessment detailing where the light 
shines, when it shines, how much light is likely to shine, any likely impacts on public 
amenity and habitats or species and how these can be appropriately mitigated. An 
explanation of the need for the light ing and its benefits e.g for sports facilities , should 
accompany the assessment. Proposals which cannot be practicably amended to prevent 
or avoid an unacceptable adverse effect from light pollution will not be permitted . 
11. Planning decisions should take wider security and defence requirements into account. 
Development proposals  within a designated Ministry of Defence Safeguarding Zone 
must ensure that they have no adverse effect on an operational defence site, 
  
1. As set out in national guidance . 
2. As set out in the noise exposure hierarchy table . 
 
Explanation  
4.166.  The NPPF sets out the need for local authorities to prevent development from 
contributing to, or being put at risk from, unacceptable levels of soil, air, light 
or noise pollution or land instability. The aim is to ensure that new 
developments do not harm existing residents, future residents or the natural 
environment and that soil quality is conserved. This includes minimising air, 
noise and ligh t pollution, to ensure that new developments are not harmful to 
other land uses, human health, tranquillity or the natural and built 
environment. The NPPF states that the local plan should seek to avoid and 
mitigate the impacts of pollution associated with  development.  
4.167.  There are two Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA) in Shropshire , in 
Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. Both are within the urban area where air pollution 
results mainly from traffic. Air quality will be considered when assessing 
development proposals , particularly in or near the AQMAs and where 
significant doubt arises as to the air quality impact then a cautious approach 
will be applied . 
4.168.  Background levels of ammonia in the air , and nitrogen loads deposited on 
natural habitats are generally well above  the levels and loads recognised as 
causing damage throughout Shropshire. Developments such as larger -scale 
combustion processes, industrial biomass boilers, anaerobic digesters and 
intensive livestock units may need a Habitat Regulation Assessment in line  
with Policy DP12  and in any event will need to pay particular attention to 
mitigation measures to avoid further impacts.  
4.169.  The planning system should protect and enhance soils. Some of the most 
significant impac ts on soils occur as a result of construction activity. A Code of 
Practice has been developed by DEFRA to assist anyone involved in the 
construction sector to better protect the soil resources with which they work 
and in so doing, minimise the risk of envi ronmental harm such as excessive 
run-off and flooding. The aim is to achieve positive outcomes such as cost 
savings, successful landscaping and enhanced amenity whilst maintaining a 
healthy natural environment  
4.170.  The re -use of brownfield land is often seen as  having a number of benefits: it 
is a form of recycling; it can regenerate and decontaminate an area, and it 
reduces the need for greenfield development. Therefore, the re -use of 
brownfield land should be preferred wherever possible, bearing in mind the 
viability of development and the potential for land to acquire biodiversity value.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 126 
  4.171.  Over many years, the re -use of brownfield land has enabled contamination to 
be addressed where necessary. There are sites in Shropshire where some 
historic contamination is possible , so the decontamination and re -use of land 
is likely to continue for some time. In order for development to go ahead, the 
possibility, nature and extent of any contamination  will need to be 
investigated; any disturbance of contaminants will need to avoid 
environmental damage and unacceptable health risks, both during and after 
development; and remediation measures will need to be introduced, as 
necessary.  
4.172.  Potentially noisy developments will be expected to be accompanied by an 
appropriate noise assess ment. Developers will be required to demonstrate the 
potential impact of proposals on the environment and on residential amenity 
and the ability to mitigate to an acceptable level. An appropriate noise 
assessment will also be needed w here new development would be sensitive  
to existing noise sources . This should consider noise arising from all sources . 
The Ministry of Defence should be consulted where the existing noise source 
is related to defence activities.  
4.173.  Light pollution refers to the effect of excessive or intrusive lighting arising from 
poor or insensitive design. The Council will seek to reduce light pollution by 
encouraging the installation of appropriate lighting and by only permitting 
lighting proposa ls which would not adversely affect amenity or public safety. 
Lights should be appropriately shielded, directed to the ground , sited to 
minimise any impact on adjoining areas, and be of a height and illumination 
level of the minimum required to serve their  purpose.  
4.174.  Internal and external lighting is important for sports facilities . Sport England 
has published a design guide for artificial sports lighting9 which should be 
followed when new lighting for recreation and sports facilities is proposed . 
4.175.  The Shropshire Hills AONB Management Plan sets out the special qualities 
(reasons for designation) of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty. These include tranquillity. The Management Plan can be  a material 
consideration for all planning proposals affecting the designated area (see 
also P olicy DP24 ). 
4.176.  Planning decisions should take public safety,  security and defence 
requirements into account . Wider public safety issues are covered in Policy 
SP6, but Shropshire has a number of military establi shments where the 
Ministry of Defence  (MOD)  have designated a safeguarding zone . 
Development in these zones has the potential to affect defence activities and 
the MOD should be consulted on all applications  affecting these areas . 
Permission will not be gra nted where adverse effects on operational defence 
sites cannot be avoided.

  DP19.  Water Resources and Water Quality  
Development must not adversely affect the quality, quantity and flow of both ground and 
surface water and must ensure that there is adequate water infrastructure in place to meet 
its own needs.  
1. Development proposals which would lead to deteriora tion or compromise the ability of 
those water bodies covered by the Water Framework Directive to meet good status 
standards, both during construction and when operational, will not be supported.  
2. Development proposals in a groundwater Source Protection Zone s (SPZ)  must show 
how they have:  
a. Considered the potential to encounter shallow groundwater. If shallow groundwater is 
likely, the Council  will expect the development to restrict the use of soakaways;  and 
b. Avoided direct discharge of hazardous substances to groundwater;  and 
c. Considered the potential for historic contamination to be encountered. Where historic 
contamination is likely, the Counc il will expect development to restrict deep 
penetrative foundation methods . 
3. Proposals in Source Protection Zone 1 are not encouraged.  
4. Proposals are required to demonstrate that they will be served by adequate water 
infrastructure in terms of water supply, foul drainage, wastewater and sewage treatment, 
without leading to significant problems for existing users or contamination of waterways 
(rivers or streams), clean water supply, surface water or groundwater. In particular, 
proposals should show how develop ment will be phased to allow the relevant water 
company sufficient time to undertake any necessary capacity improvement works to the 
existing water supply, wastewater and foul drainage networks and waste -water 
treatment works prior to construction and occu pation of the development. Where 
development is bought forward in advance of planned capacity improvements by the 
relevant water company through their Asset Management Process, any required 
capacity improvements should be delivered via agreement between th e developer and 
the water company . 
5. In order to avoid any adverse impacts of new development on the existing  foul drainage 
network, all development proposals are required to:  
a. Demonstrate how foul flows will be drained and identify the agreed point of 
connection to the public foul drainage network;  and 
b. Demonstrate that sewerage and surface water will drain separately. Where a 
development is connecting to a combined system, the drainage system proposed on 
site must remain separate up to the point of connection ; and 
c. Assess the potential impacts of non -mains drainage on water quality to ensure no  
detrimental impact on the water environment in accordance with Policies DP12 , 
DP13 , DP14 , DP17 , DP18 , DP23 and DP24 .  
6. Proposals should help to c onserve and enhance existing watercourses and riverside 
habitats in line with Policy DP12  wherever possible. Management, mitigation and 
compensation m easures should aim to improve water quality and create or enhance 
riverine and aquatic habitats.  
7. Consideration should be given to opportunities to undertake river restoration and 
enhancement as part of a development to make space for water. Enhancement 
opportunities when renewing assets will be encouraged, where viable (e.g . de-
culverting, the use of bio -engineered river walls, raising bridge soffits to take into 
account climate change).  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 128 
  Explanation  
4.177.  In England and Wales development is required to comply with the Water 
Framework Directive, through meeting the relevant River Basin Management 
Plans’ requirements. For Shropshire, the Severn River Basin Management 
Plan requires the restoration and enhancement of water bodies to prevent 
deterioration and  promote recovery. Any development must safeguard these 
important water resources and protect and improve water quality with an 
overall aim of getting water bodies to ‘good’ status as defined by the Water 
Framework Directive.  
4.178.  Water is an important and esse ntial resource that needs to be managed in a 
sustainable way, so that it may continue to support Shropshire’s homes, 
farms, industry, recreation and biodiversity. The mains supply provides most 
of Shropshire’s drinking water, but private water supplies are  a significant 
feature of some remoter rural areas. These private supplies are sourced from 
ground water and surface water. Surface and ground water are important to 
people and the wider natural environment, so their use needs to be 
sustainable, sources ne ed to be safeguarded from pollution and over - 
abstraction and development needs to avoid contamination or obstruction.  
4.179.  The prevention of pollution to rivers, clean water supply, surface water and 
groundwater are important environmental considerations for the Plan.  The 
Environment Agency has designated Source Protection Zones (SPZ) in 
Shropshire for clean water supply. Development activities pose a risk in these 
areas and this policy seeks to safeguard the most sensitive zone (SPZ1) and 
to minimise harm ar ising from development in zones 2 and 3. Important water 
quality restrictions apply to development in the River Clun catchment and this 
issue is covered by Policy DP13 . 
4.180.  The phasing of new sewerage and waste -water treatment infrastructure, 
which may be required to serve new development, will need to avoid 
overburdening water resources. The Shropshire Water Cycle Study (2020) 
assesses the impact of new de velopment on the county ’s water infrastructure 
and shows where development may be dependent upon upgrading and 
enlarging the existing network.  
4.181.  Existing watercourses play an important role in maintaining biodiversity, 
promoting wellbeing and supporting recreation and tourism and they are key 
connectors in the green infrastructure network. This policy recognises this and 
seeks to add value to the benefits they already deliver and enhance their 
contribution to the natural environment wherever po ssible  in accordance with 
Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP18  and DP24 .

  DP20.  Water Efficiency  
All new development will be expected to minimise the use of water to reduce environmental 
degradation, increase sustainability and mitigate the effects of climate change  in line with 
Policy SP3. To achieve this:  
1. New housing will be expected to meet the Building Regulations ’ 110 litres per person per 
day standard for water1, as recommended by the Shropshire Water Cycle Study. Proposals 
not meeting this standard must demonstrate how and why it cannot be attained.   
2. Non-domestic buildings will be expected to reach ‘Good’ BREEAM status or equivalent 
status  within  an alternative a ssessment endorsed by Shropshire Council, for water 
efficiency as a minimum, unless it can be demonstrated that this would make the 
development unviable.  
3. Major development schemes will be expected to provide a programme of water efficiency  
promotion and consumer education, as part of the new development with the aim of  
bringing about behavioural change with regards to water use . 
 
1 As currently set out in Approved Document G - Sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency (2015 
edition w ith 2016 amendments ). 
 
Explanation  
4.182.  Water resources are under pressure in England. The Shropshire Water Cycle 
Study (2020) reports that the Environment Agency and Natural Resources 
Wales ’ assessment  of the Severn Trent and United Utilities supply regions 
classes them as areas of “moderate” water stress. Lowering water 
consumption levels is therefore important to prevent further deterioration.  
4.183.  It is widely recognised that the climate is cha nging and in response 
Shropshire Council declared a climate emergency in May 2019. Climate 
change is predicted to increase pressure on water resources, increasing the 
potential for a supply -demand deficit in the future, and making environmental 
damage from  over abstraction of water resources more likely. Furthermore, 
the delivery of water and wastewater services and the heating of water in the 
home require high energy inputs, and therefore contribute directly to 
emissions of greenhouse gases.   Water efficie ncy thus reduces energy use 
and carbon emissions.  
4.184.  It is important therefore that new development does not result in an 
unsustainable increase in water abstraction. This can be achieved  in a 
number of ways but this policy focusses on reducing the water dema nd from 
new housing.  
4.185.  The Government has introduced an optional new Building Regulation 
standard that can be required through a Local Plan policy if it addresses a 
clearly evidenced need and its impact on viability has been considered. The 
Council can then  apply the optional requirement as a planning condition on 
residential development proposals. This will be overseen by Building Control 
bodies (local authorities or approved inspectors). The optional requirement set 
out in the Building Regulation restricts  water use to 110 litres per person per 
day whereas the normal requirement is 125 litres per person per day. The 
Shropshire Water Cycle Study recommends that new residential development 
in Shropshire adopts the 110 litres per person per day standard. This has 
been considered through the Shropshire Viability Study and forms the basis 
for this policy. It can be met through either a fittings -based approach, which 
imposes maximum consumption rates for various fittings such as WCs, basin 
taps, and showers, or by  calculating the whole house water consumption 
using a ‘water efficiency calculator’ for new dwellings.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 130 
  DP21.  Flood Risk  
The safeguarding of people and property and mitigation of the effects of climate change in 
accordance with Policy SP3 will be achieved by directing development to areas at least risk 
of flooding. Where development is permitted, the causes and impacts of flooding as well as 
residual flood risk, will be reduced through design measures, wherever possible.  
1. Development proposals must show how they have applied the Sequential Test1 in areas 
known to be at risk of any form of flooding now or in the future, including those : 
a. In an area which has critical drainage problems (as notified to Shropshire Council  by 
the Environment Agency);  and 
b. Where the proposed location of the development would increase flood risk 
elsewhere . 
2. The Sequential Test  is not needed for :  
a. Development on land allocated in this plan unless the use of the site , or is not in 
accordance with th e use specified in this Plan.  
b. Development in Flood Zone 1 unless the Shropshire Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA) or other more recent information indicates that there may be 
flooding issues now or in the future (for example through the impact of climate 
change ; or 
c. Minor development2 and changes of use other than to a caravan, camping or chalet 
site, or to a mobile home or park home site. In these latter  cases, the Sequential 
Test should be applied.  
3. Development will not be permitted if the Sequential Test shows that there are 
reasona bly available sites appropriate for the development in areas with a lower risk of 
flooding. The Sequential Test  should be based on the Shropshire S trategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (Levels 1 and 2) and should clearly set out : 
a. The flood risk for all forms of f looding on the development site;  and 
b. The extent of the area of search for alternative sites (taking a proportionate and 
pragmatic approach . Different ownership or the presence of a landowner agreement 
are not acceptable as reasons not to consider alternati ves; and  
c. The flood risk for all forms of flooding on the alternative sites . 
4. If it is not possible for development to be located in an area with a lower risk of flooding 
then the Exception Test1 should be applied in line with the Flood Risk Vulnerability 
Classification3 and for allocated sites, if either : 
a. Relevant aspects of the proposal had not been considered when the site was 
allocated; or  
b. More recent information about existing or potential flood risk is available which 
shows that the risk (from any form of flooding) has increased since allocation.  
5. The Exception Test  is not needed for Highly Vulnerable infrastructure3 in Flood Zones 3a 
and 3 b or for More Vulnerable  and Less Vulnerable development3 in Flood Zone 3b  
because  these types of development are not permitted. The Exception Test  is also not 
needed for minor development2 or changes of use other than to a caravan, camping or 
chalet site,  or to a mobile home or park home site . 
6. Development requiring the Exception Test  will be permitted when it can demonstrate all 
of the following : 
a. It provides wider sustainability benefits to the community that outweigh the flood 
risk; 
b. Having considered the vulnerability of its users, it will be safe for its lifetime;  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 131 
  c. It will not increase flood risk elsewhere;  
d. Where possible, it will reduce flood risk overall; and  
e. A site-specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)  shows that : 
i. Within the site the most vulnerable development is located in the areas with the 
lowest flood risk, unless there are overriding reasons to prefer a different location ; 
ii. It is appropriately flood resistant and resilient ; 
iii. It incorporates sustainable drainage systems in line with Policy DP22 ; 
iv. Any residual risk can be safely managed ; and  
v. Safe access, egress and emergency escape routes are included (where 
appropriate) in an agree d emergency plan.  
7. Where development in Flood Zones 3a and 3b is permitted it should be designed and 
constructed to remain operational and safe in times of flood. Development permitted in 
Flood Zone 3b should also be designed and constructed so that it does  not:  
a. Impede water flows; and/or  
b. Increase flood risk elsewhere; and/or  
c. Result in a net loss of floodplain storage.  
8. A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) will be required for all development 
proposals including those for minor development , changes o f use : 
a. In Flood Zones 2 and 3 ; 
b. In Flood Zone 1 if the site is 1 hectare or above ; 
c. In Flood Zone 1 where there are critical drainage problems ; 
d. On land which either the Shropshire SFRA (Levels 1 and 2) shows, or more recent 
information indicates, is at increased risk of flooding either now or in the future e.g. 
through the impact of climate change ; 
e. On land subject to other sources of flooding (surface water, groundwater, 
infrastructure/sewer failure, re servoir overspill) where development would introduce 
a more vulnerable3 use; and  
f. On land in those catchments identified in the Shropshire SFRA Level 2 as being at 
highest risk from the cumulative impacts of development.  
9. The FRA should demonstrate how flood  risk, including residual risk, will be managed 
now and over the development’s lifetime, taking climate change into account and with 
regard to the vulnerability of its users. It should cover all sources of flooding and be 
proportionate to the scale and nat ure of the development and the flood risk involved. 
The FRA  should show how the development has been designed to be resilient to both 
actual and residual flood risk. Information on the application of the Sequential and 
Exception Test s (as required) should be included in the FRA. Further guidance on FRA 
requirements is given in the Shropshire SFRA  Level 1.  
10. In those catchments where the cumulative effect of development is likely to have the 
greatest impact on flood risk, (as set out in the SFRA Level 2) oppor tunities for  the 
following should be maximised  and the FRA should show how all these have been 
considered : 
a. Natural flood management (in rural areas) ; 
b. SuDS retrofit (in urban areas) ; 
c. River restoration ; 
d. Wider community flood risk benefits ; 
e. Developer contributions to community flood defences outside the site boundary ; 
f. On- and off -site flood storage and safeguarding of land for such . Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 132 
  11. Where development in the vicinity of watercourses is acceptable, adequate and easy 
access to watercourses and flood defen ces should be maintained so that they may be 
managed by the relevant authority.  
12. Development should  seek to enhance as far as possible the natural capacity of soils, 
vegetation, river floodplains, wetland and upland habitats to reduce flood risk.  New 
devel opment should demonstrate no loss of open watercourse with culverts being 
opened up where possible to improve drainage and flood flows. Proposals involving the 
creation of new sections of culverted watercourse (unless essential to the provision of 
access) will not be permitted. Development should also help to conserve and enhance 
watercourses and riverside habitats, through mitigation measures where an adverse 
impact is identified ( in accordance with policies DP12 , DP14 , DP18  and DP24 ) and 
ongoing appropriate management to deliver environmental gain.  
 
1. As set out in national planning policy and guidance.  
2. As defined in national planning policy and guidance in relation to flood risk . 
3. As set out in the Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification  in national guidance  
 
Explanation  
4.186.  This policy synthesises the requirements of the NPPF and the guidance in the 
NPPG to provide a clear explanation  of the process by which planning 
proposals can minimise flood risk in the first instance and manage residual 
risk in the second.  
4.187.  The risk of flooding can come from various sources which include rivers  
(fluvial flooding) overloaded sewers (sewer flooding), rainfall or extreme 
weather events which can cause ground water flooding (where the water table 
rises) and surface water flooding (where excess water is unable to soak into 
the ground or water drainag e infrastructure).  
4.188.  This policy is supported by a level 1 and a level 2 Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA -1 and SFRA -2). The SFRA -1 considers the above 
sources of flooding and establishes the flood zones in the County . Flood 
zones are categorised by th e likelihood of flooding, with flood zone 1 being the 
least likely, then flood zone s 2 and 3a and finally flood zone 3b . The latter is 
known as the functional flood plain – those areas of land in Shropshire that 
are most likely to flood when excess water cannot be contained by rivers or 
streams. The SFRA -2 considers the flood risk for those sites proposed for 
allocation in this Plan which  were deemed to be at most risk  of flooding .   
4.189.  The NPPF states that inappropriate development in areas of flooding should 
be avoided by directing development away from areas of highest risk. Local 
Plans should apply a risk -based approach to the location of  development to 
avoid where possible , flood risk to people and property and manage any 
residual risk, taking account of the impacts of climate change, by:  
a. Applying the Sequential Test;  and 
b. If necessary, applying the Exception Test . 
4.190.  The Sequential Test is a decision -making tool designed to ensure that sites at 
little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to sites at higher risk. 
Where development of the latter cannot be avoided, application of the 
Exception Test allows de velopment if the flood risk is clearly outweighed by 
other sustainability factors. The Sequential Test has already been carried out 
for those sites allocated within this plan, and there is no need for this to be Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 133 
  repeated unless the proposed use differ s from the  use specified in the 
allocation. In such cases, the proposed use could be in a more vulnerable 
category than the allocated use , so the Sequential Test should be applied.  
Depending on the outcome, t he Exception Test may also then be needed . 
Information on how the Sequential and Exception Tests were applied to this 
Plan is given in a Sequential and Exception Test document on the Local Plan 
evidence base web page.  
4.191.  The Sequential Test is applied at all stages in the planning application 
proces s, both between different flood zones and within a flood zone. All 
opportunities to locate new developments (except Water Compatible) in 
reasonably available areas of little or no flood risk should be explored, prior to 
any decision to locate them in areas  of higher risk.  
4.192.  The Exception Test, as set out in the NPPF, is a method to demonstrate and 
help ensure that the flood risk to people and property will be managed 
satisfactorily, while allowing necessary development to go ahead in situations 
where suitable  sites at lower risk of flooding are not available. Th is policy 
details  the criteria that must be met for the Exception Test to be passed .  
4.193.  This policy sets out when a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is 
needed to inform a planning proposal. In co nsidering the safety of the 
development, the FRA must demonstrate the occupants of any new dwellings 
will have access to an area of safe refuge. Where prior evacuation is the 
safest option, the refuge should be an area outside of 1% annual exceedance 
proba bility flood event from all sources. Where prior evacuation is not 
preferred, internal safe refuge must be provided. The FRA should provide an 
evidence base for the Council to determine which option is the safest for that 
particular proposal.   
4.194.  The effects of flooding are expected to worsen with climate change  and this 
needs to be taken into account when considering development. The 
Environment Agency has produced guidance on the allowances for climate 
change for each river basin district. Shropshire  falls within the Severn river 
basin district. Depending on the vulnerability of development proposed, and 
the flood risk classification, different allowances should be taken into account 
as set out in the Shropshire SFRA -1.  
4.195.  Maintenance easements for wate rcourses are set out in the Shropshire 
SFRA -1. These are typically a minimum 8m width access strip adjacent to the 
top of both banks of any Main River and 5m for Ordinary Watercourses, 
unless agreed otherwise with Shropshire Council.  They should be 
appropr iately landscaped for open space , green infrastructure  and biodiversity 
benefits  in accordance with Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15  and DP16 .

  DP22.  Sustainable Drainage Systems  
Developments will integrate measures for sustainable water management to reduce flood 
risk, avoid adverse impacts on water quality and quantity within Shropshire  (including 
groundwater resources ), and provide opportunities to enhance biodiversity, health and 
recreation  in accordance with Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15  and DP24 . 
1. All major developments must incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in 
accordance with Shropshire Council’s Surface Water Management: Interim Guidance for 
Developers or Shropshire Council’s SuDS Handbook (whiche ver is the later), unless 
such a drainage system can be clearly demonstrated to be inappropriate. SuDS 
systems should be designed in accordance with the most recent version of the 
Construction Industry Research and Information Association ( CIRIA ) SuDS Manu al. 
Where the use of on -site SuDS is not possible, feasible or appropriate , other means of 
flood prevention and water management may be utilised with the prior agreement of the 
Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA). All other forms of development are strongly 
encouraged to incorporate SuDS wherever these are reasonably practical and viable.  
2. Opportunities to achieve multiple benefits in addition to the drainage function, for 
example through green infrastructure provision and biodiversity enhancements should 
be sought wherever SuDS are provided in line with Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP16 , 
and DP24 . Schemes should ensure that the movement of water through vertical 
infiltration as well as horizontal run -off does not worsen contamination effects.  
3. Surface water should be managed at source and the provision of SuDS should follow 
the hierarchy of drai nage options as follows:  
a. Into the ground (infiltration)  
b. To a surface water body  
c. To a surface water sewer  
d. To another drainage system with the permission of the relevant owner  
e. To a combined sewer  
Guidance on what SuDS system would be reasonably practicable for all forms of 
development can be found in the Shropshire Council  SuDS  Handbook . 
4. All development proposals should be accompanied by a surface water management 
plan or statement. Where SuDS are being delivered, this should include :  
a. A management and maintenance plan setting out how the features will be effectively 
managed for the lifetime of the development and by whom ; and  
b. Arrangements, including financial for adoption by any public authority or statutory 
undertaker.  
5. To reduce the impact of urban creep (the conversion of permeable surfaces to 
impermeable ones over time) all SuDS serving residential developments should be 
designed to provide an additional allowance for the lifetime of the development. 
Guidance on the allowance, based on housing density, is provided by the LLFA.  
6. All development must avoid increasing flood risk elsewhere. Runoff from the site post 
development mu st not exceed pre -development rates for all storm events up to and 
including the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP)1 storm event with an allowance 
for climate change. The appropriate climate change allowances should be defined using 
relevant Environmen t Agency guidance. Brownfield run -off rates at the site boundary 
should be reduced as close as reasonably practicable to greenfield run -off rates. 
Regardless, where there is opportunity, all run off rates should be reduced to the 
minimum feasible. Proposal s will need to demonstrate that the discharge location has 
sufficient capacity to receive the post development flows. Proposals will also be Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 135 
  expected to have no adverse effect on the receiving water bodies, both during 
construction and when operational.  
 
1 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 1 in 100 chance of flooding in any one year . 
 
Explanation  
4.196.  The Council will expect all major developments, (as defined in Annex 2 of the 
NPPF), to include sustainable drainage measures in the form of Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SuDS). SuDS provide opportunities to; reduce the causes 
and impacts of flooding; reduce the burden on traditional water management 
systems such as sewers; remove pollutants; and provide amenity, recreation 
and biodiversity ben efits. They should be considered at an early stage in the 
design process and be reflected in the site layout.  
4.197.  Wherever possible the Council will require SuDS to be naturalistic, using 
softer green infrastructure options. In any event, SuDS should consider the 
following:  
a. Integration with existing landscape;  
b. Tree planting provision fed by groundwater runoff that functions effectively 
in place of attenuation tanks;  
c. Additional capacity to cater for future development; and  
d. Techniques including, but not limited t o, permeable pavements, swales, 
basins, rain gardens, green roofs, rainwater re -use, infiltration trenches, 
ponds and wetlands.  
4.198.  SuDS  have benefits not only in terms of biodiversity, green infrastructure and 
place making but they also help reduce the cost a nd burden of future 
maintenance over the lifetime of the development and minimise the risk of 
drainage failures as a consequence of neglect. The l ifetime of development is 
considered to be 100 years for residential and 60 years for commercial 
properties.  
4.199.  Schemes for SuDS need to avoid causing contamination of watercourses and 
groundwater. Soakaways in contaminated land will not be appropriate. 
Infiltration SuDS techniques should: only dispose of clean roof water into 
clean, uncontaminated ground; not be use d for foul discharges or trade 
effluent; and may not be suitable within Source Protection Zone 1  (see also 
Policy DP19 ). 
4.200.  The SuDS elements of the policy apply to major development. Small -scale 
developments will be encouraged to adopt elements of SuDS wherever 
practicable, including the provision of permeable surfaces within the site, e.g. 
on front gardens or car parking area s.  
4.201.  Further guidance on SuDS can be provided by Shropshire Council as the 
Lead Local Flood Authority  (LLFA)  by reference to the Shropshire Council 
SuDS Handbook and through the Construction Industry Research and 
Information Association  (CIRIA) SuDS Manual.

  DP23.  Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment  
Shropshire’s heritage assets will be protected, conserved, sympathetically enhanced and 
restored, by : 
1. Ensuring that wherever possible, proposals avoid harm or loss of significance to 
designated or non -designated heritage assets, including their settings.  
2. Ensuring that proposals which are likely to affect the significance of a designated or non -
designated heritage asset, including its setting, are accompanied by a Heritage 
Assessment. The level of detail in the Heritage Assessment should be proportionate to 
the asset’s significance.  
3. Ensuring that proposals which are likely to result in any loss of, harm to,  the significance 
of a designated heritage asset, including its setting, either directly or indirectly, are 
determined in line with the National Planning Policy Framework.  
4. Ensuring th at proposals which are likely to result in loss of, or harm to, the significance 
of a non -designated heritage asset and/or its setting, either directly or indirectly, will only 
be permitted if it can be clearly demonstrated that on balance,  the benefits of t he 
proposal outweigh that loss or harm. In making this assessment  the following will be 
taken into account : 
a. The degree of harm or loss of significance to the asset and/or its setting; and 
b. The importance of the asset; and  
c. Any potential beneficial use . 
5. Where such proposals are permitted, measures will be required to: 
a. Mitigate and record the loss of significance to the asset and/or it’s setting ; and 
b. Advance understanding in a manner proportionate to both the asset’s and/or its 
setting’s importance and the  level of impact . 
6. Encouraging development which delivers positive benefits to heritage assets. Support 
will be given in particular, to proposals which appropriately conserve, manage or 
enhance the significance of a heritage asset including its setting, esp ecially where these 
improve the condition of those assets which are recognised as being at risk or in poor 
condition.  
7. Ensuring that development proposals affecting designated or non -designated heritage 
assets are determined in line with more detailed suppl ementary planning documents , 
where applicable.  
 
Explanation  
4.202.  This policy sets out specific guidance on the protection of Shropshire’s historic 
environment, including the requirements that need to be met for those 
development proposals which are likely to have an impact on the significance, 
including the setting, of a heritage asset.  
4.203.  Heritage assets are buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes 
that merit consideration as part of the planning process. The term includes all 
designated and non -designated assets. Designated assets comprise Listed 
Building s, Conservation Areas, World Heritage Sites, Registered Parks and 
Gardens, Registered Battlefields and Scheduled Ancient Monuments. Non -
designated heritage assets include structures, features or deposits with 
archaeological interest, historic buildings  (including those associated with ou r Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 137 
  industrial past such as canals, warehouses and other similar structures ) 
historic farmsteads, the historic character of the landscape as expressed in 
the patterns of fields  and woods and includes locally derived building 
materials and the distinctive forms, details and design of buildings. The 
Shropshire Historic Environment Record sets out Shropshire’s non -designated 
heritage assets.  
4.204.  Through their contribution to the character of the County , heritage assets play 
an important role in promoting economic regeneration and growth.  
4.205.  This policy is based on the following hierarchal approach:  
a. Wherever possible, avoid harm or loss to the significance of heritage 
assets, including their se ttings;  
b. Where development proposals can be justified in terms of public benefits 
which outweigh the harm to the historic environment, provide mitigation 
measures for any loss of significance to the affected heritage asset, 
including the setting;  
c. Where a de velopment proposal results in the partial or total loss of 
significance to an asset, including the setting, record and advance the 
understanding of that significance.  
4.206.  In order that the degree of impact of a development proposal can be fully 
assessed it is essential that the significance of heritage assets including their 
setting, is fully understood. A Heritage Assessment is therefore required for 
any development proposals which is likely to affect the significance of a 
heritage asset, including its setting . Where necessary, the Heritage 
Assessment should include a qualitative visual assessment to show how the 
proposal affects the heritage significance of its surroundings. Heritage 
Assessments will be needed for any proposals within or affecting; the histori c 
core of a settlement; a Conservation Area; a Listed Building; a Scheduled 
Monument; a World Heritage Site or a Registered Park and Garden; a 
Registered Battlefield and all non -designated heritage assets.   
4.207.  The level of detail provided in a Heritage Asses sment should be in proportion 
to the significance of the heritage asset and the scale of any impacts upon it. 
For assets with archaeological interest this may include a desk -based 
assessment and where necessary, a field evaluation carried out by an 
appropr iate professional. Such assessments should be carried out well in 
advance and must be submitted with the planning application.  
4.208.  Heritage assets are a finite, non -renewable resource and great care must be 
taken when determining applications which result in a loss of significance, 
either partial or total. Proposals adversely affecting either the significance or 
setting of heritage assets will therefore be rejected unless the harm to the 
significance of the asset is outweighed by the public benefits of the pro posal. 
In making this decision the significance of the asset, its level of importance, 
the degree of impact and opportunities for a viable beneficial use of the asset 
will be taken into account. Proposals which would result in harm, or a loss of 
significan ce, to a designated heritage asset, including the setting, will be 
determined in line with national policy.    
4.209.  Where the public benefits of a proposal are deemed to outweigh the loss of 
significance, measures to mitigate the loss will be required. These ma y 
include but are not limited to, design or landscaping measures and/or the use 
of appropriate building materials or construction methods  in accordance with Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 138 
  relevant policies of th is Plan. The submission of additional information relating 
to these for prio r approval may sometimes be necessary. In addition, the 
preparation of a comprehensive record of the asset by a suitable qualified 
person, in a manner proportionate to the significance of the asset and the 
impact of the proposal, may be required. A copy of  the final report should be 
deposited in the Shropshire Historic Environment Record within an agreed 
time period, where it will be made publicly accessible. When required a report 
should also be published in an appropriate manner. Any resulting archive 
should be deposited with the Shropshire Museum Service, again within an 
agreed timescale.  
4.210.  Shropshire has a rich diversity of heritage assets, which make an important 
contribution to the County ’s character and local distinctiveness. Development 
proposals offer valuable opportunities to enhance the historic environment, 
including by achieving the  aspirations set out within the Place Plans. This may 
involve improving the condition of heritage assets and their settings, and/or 
enhancing or better revealing their significance, particularly for those assets 
recognised as being at risk. Proposals shoul d also seek to increase the 
connectivity between assets in line with Policy DP14  to provide benefits to 
both the natural and historic environment.

  DP24.  Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  
Great weight will be given to conserving and enhancing the landscape and scenic beauty of 
the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) by limiting the scale and 
extent of development in the designated area.  
1. Planning proposals affecting t he Shropshire Hills  AONB are encouraged to positively and 
appropriately contribute  towards  conserving and enhancing its natural beauty , in 
accordance with the AONB Management Plan . In particular, opportunities to deliver the 
highest quality design (in acco rdance with Policies SP5 and DP16 ) which respects the 
natural beauty and built heritage of the Shropshire Hill s AONB ; enhances the sense of 
place and local character; and enable s better management of wildlife sites, heritage 
assets or the wider countryside; should be maximised.  
2. Proposals for major development (as defined within Annex 2 of the NPPF) within the 
Shropshire Hills AONB should be accompanied by a proportionate assessment setting 
out: 
a. The need for the development, including in terms of any national considerations and 
the impact of permitting or refusing it on the local economy;  
b. The cost of, and scope for, developing outside the designated area, or meeting the 
need for that development in some other way; and  
c. Any detrimental effect on the environment, the landscape (see Policy DP17  also) and 
recreational opportunities and the extent to which that could be moderated.  
Permission will be refused for major development other than in exceptional circumstances 
and where it can be demonstrated that the development is in the public interest based on 
a consideration of issues a to c above.  
3. Where major development is permitted in the Shropshire Hills AONB, mitigation and 
compensation measures to offset any residual environmental, landscape or recreational 
impacts will be required in line with policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP16 , DP17 , DP18 , 
DP19  and DP22 . These measures should be compatible with the conservation of the 
designated area and the priorities set out in Shropshire Hills AONB Management Plan 
and must be demonstrab ly capable of being implemented to ensure that harm is 
minimised.  
4. Planning proposals for minor development in the Shropshire Hills AONB and all 
development proposals outside the designated area which are likely to have a significant 
adverse effect on the s pecial qualities of the AONB (as set out in the AONB Management 
Plan) will be resisted in the interests of conserving the area’s natural beauty.   
 
Explanation  
4.211.  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) represent areas of the highest 
scenic quality, and, in landscape terms, are deemed in government policy to 
have  equal landscape quality and protection to National Parks. The primary 
purpose of the Area of Outstand ing Natural Beauty designation is to conserve 
and enhance  natural beauty.  
4.212.  ‘Natural beauty’ encompasses the natural and human elements that make the 
AONB distinctive – geology and landform, climate and soils, wildlife and 
ecology, the history of human settl ement and land use, archaeology and 
buildings, cultural associations and people. In line with national policy, great 
weight will be given in planning decisions to the purpose of AONB Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 140 
  designation, and account taken of the policies and guidance within the AO NB 
Management Plan as a material consideration.  
4.213.  The legal framework for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is set out in Part 
IV of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW). Section 85 of the 
CROW Act places a legal duty on the Council: “In exerc ising or performing 
any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land in an Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty, a relevant authority shall have regard to the purpose of 
conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the Area of Outstanding 
Natural Bea uty.”  
4.214.  The National Planning Policy Framework( NPPF) advises that “great weight 
should be given to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty in 
National Parks, the Broads and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which 
have the highest status of protection in relation to landscape and scenic 
beauty” but also that due regard is had to the economic and social well -being 
of all rural communities.  
4.215.  This policy reflects the strategic objectives of this legal framework, giving 
priority to the natural bea uty of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
4.216.  The Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is a living landscape 
encompassing a variety of character areas and a range of settlements. The 
key components of the AONB landscape are the hills, farm ed countryside, 
woodlands, rivers and river valleys. Other special qualities are found across 
the whole designated area and include, geology, wildlife, heritage assets, 
environmental and scenic quality, tranquillity, culture and opportunities for 
enjoyment .  
4.217.  The Shropshire Hills AONB covers two local authority areas: Shropshire and 
Telford and Wrekin. The Councils work together to safeguard the future of this 
shared nationally protected area through the Shropshire Hills AONB 
Partnership. The AONB Partnershi p prepares  the statutory 5 -year AONB 
Management Plan  and this is then formally approved by both local authorities. 
The AONB Management Plan may  be used to as a material consideration in 
the determination of planning applications.  
4.218.  All development in the AON B should be sustainable, consistent with the 
primary purpose of the designation and support the special qualities of the 
AONB as set out in the AONB Management Plan.   
4.219.  Section 1 of policy expects all development affecting the Shropshire Hills 
AONB to conserve the area’s natural beauty. Development should also, 
wherever possible, provide for positive enhancement. The Council recognises 
that not all development can enhance  natural beauty, but where there are 
opportunities to do so, then these should be taken.  
4.220.  Section 2 of the policy is taken from paragraph 172 of the NPPF which sets 
out a public interest exception  test for major development: this Plan policy 
uses the defin ition of major development in Annex 2 of the NPPF . In applying 
this policy, the Council will require developers to provide an assessment 
proportionate to the scale of the proposal and its effect, for all major 
development within the AONB. Reference should be made to the relevant 
sections of the AONB Management Plan in preparing this assessment and to 
other policies in this plan which cover natural and historic assets, landscape 
and visual amenity, design of development and green infrastruct ure (SP5, 
DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP16 , DP17 , DP18 , DP19  and DP22 ). Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 141 
  4.221.  Section 3 of the policy covers those instances where major development 
passes the tests set out in section 3 and is permitted. In these circumstances, 
any harm remaining after the detrimental effects on the environment, the 
landscape and recreational opportunities have been moderated, will require 
mitigation measures in the firs t instance and compensation measures in the 
second . The AONB Management Plan contains information on such 
measures. Applicants should also be able to demonstrate that all mitigation 
and compensation measures do not cause harm in themselves and are 
capable of being implemented, preferably before work commences, but in any 
event, during the lifetime of the permission.  
4.222.  Section 4 of the policy relates to minor development in the AONB and any 
type of  development outside the designated area which is likely to ha ve a 
significant adverse effect on the AONB’s special qualities. Section 85 of the 
CROW Act requires the Council to have regard to Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty purposes in the exercise of their functions not only in relation to land 
within the AONB i tself but also as they might affect land in an AONB. For 
example, views into and out of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty from 
key visitor viewpoints can be very significant. Developments which, by virtue 
of their nature, size, scale, siting, material s or design are likely to have a 
significant  adverse  impact, on the natural beauty and special qualities of the 
Shropshire Hills AONB will be  resisted.  Where less than  significant adverse 
effect s are identified, it must be remembered that these still erode natural 
beauty and moreover, they may accumulate over time  to create a significant 
effect in combination.  All such lesser adverse effects  should be minimised 
wherever possible.

  Transport and Infrastructure  
DP25.  Infrastructure Provision  
1. New development should only take place where there is sufficient existing infrastructure 
capacity available.  Where a new development would lead to a shortfall in infrastructure 
provision, the development will be required to fund necessary impro vements through a 
suitable developer contribution, unless the identified shortfall is being addressed by 
other means.   
2. For new development where the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  applies, priority 
will be given to using CIL funds  to support any crit ical or statutory infrastructure 
requirements resulting from the development.    
3. CIL f unds  derived from specific development  which are not required to make the 
development acceptable in planning terms,  will be prioritised according to the 
infrastructure ne eds of communities identified in the Shropshire Place Plans and the 
Local Infrastructure Plan.  
4. On proposals where it is  considered  CIL funds will not be sufficient to meet the specific 
infrastructure needs of development, consideration will be given to applying additional 
Section 106 contributions  for specific infrastructure items where this meets national 
requirements for planning obligations . 
5. For development where the CIL does not apply, necessary infrastructure improvements 
will be secured through planning obligations  where this meets national requirements .     
 
Explanation  
4.223.  It is fair that the burden of new infrastructure is shared by all development, in 
proportion to its scale. It is also important to ensure that development remains 
viable in order to ensure delivery.  Many of the site allocations contained in 
the Local Plan  contain a number of on -site requirements of development and 
it is expected that these will be delivered either through on-site design or 
through developer contributions.   
4.224.  The Shropshire Place Plans are documents which bring together a range of 
informatio n about a defined area, including the identified infrastructure needs 
of settlements and their relative priority.  They are developed in collaboration 
with local parish and town council and infrastructure providers.  They include a 
focus on  local needs suc h as highways, flood defences, educational facilities, 
medical facilities, sporting and recreational facilities and open spaces. The 
Shropshire Local Infrastructure Plan provides a composite of the needs 
identified in the Place Plans with a focus on the hi ghest priority issues, 
including those critical needs necessary to ensure development can happen.   
4.225.  Since 2012 the Council has operated a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
on new market housing development.  The rates imposed on liable new 
development are captured in the adopted CIL Charging Schedule which 
applies two rates for the County : urban and ru ral.  These rates can only be 
changed through a formal review of the CIL Charging Schedule.   A key benefit 
of CIL is that funding from several development s can be pooled to support the 
delivery of a single piece of infrastructure  in recognition of the cumu lative 
impact of development .  However, in the first instance it is  expected that the 
use of CIL funds will  be used to meet the needs of new development and Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 143 
  should not be used to remediate an y existing infrastructure constraints, except 
where the se are exa cerbated by the new development.      
4.226.  To ensure  the viability  of development,  Policy DP25  provides a clear 
prioritisation for the use of CIL funds.  I n the first instance the statutory and 
critical needs of a development that are required to make a development 
acceptable should be met.  This includes necessary education provision 
directly resulting from the development, as well as contributions to local and 
strategic highway improvements and the provision of additional health 
facilities.   Where the CIL derived from a scheme is not required to meet the 
needs of that development, the CIL will be used to fund wider priorities 
identified in the relevant Plac e Plan.   
4.227.  In some cases  it is likely that the CIL derived from a development will be 
insufficient to meet the specific infrastructure needs of that proposal.  In these 
instances the Council will consider applying additional Section 106 
contributions to development where these are necessary to make the 
development acceptable in planning terms; are directly related to the 
development; and are fairly and reasonably  related in scale and kind to the 
development. It is expected th is is only likely to be necessary  on larger 
proposals of over 50 dwellings .  Where this is considered  necessary, 
consideration will be given to the viability of the proposal.

  DP26.  Strategic, Renewable and Low Carbon Infrastructure  
The delivery of sustainable communities in Shropshire relies on the provision of new 
strategic infrastructure and the continued operation of existing strategic infrastructure. 
Proposals which are likely to affect an internationally designated wildlife site  will require a 
project level HRA in accordance with Policy DP12 . 
Existing Strategic Infrastructure  
1. Development will be expected to demonstrate that it will not adversely affect, either 
directly or indirectly, the continued operation and potential expansio n of existing 
strategic infrastructure.  
New Strategic Infrastructure  
Non-wind renewable and low carbon development  
2. Non-wind renewable and low carbon development will be supported where its impact is, 
or can be made, acceptable. To aid in this determinatio n, all applications should be 
accompanied by an assessment of the proposal’s effect on the following during both the 
construction and operational stages:  
a. Visual amenity (including the considerations within Policy DP17 ); 
b. Landscape character (including the considerations within Policy DP17 ); 
c. Natural assets (including the considerations within Policy DP12 ); 
d. Historic assets (including the considerations within Policy DP23 );  
e. Air quality, noise and public amenity (including the considerations within Policy 
DP18 ); 
f. Water quality and water resources noise (including the considerations within Policy 
DP19 ); 
g. Traffic generation and the nature of vehicle movements ; 
h. The Shropshire Hills AONB (including the considerations within Policy DP24 ); 
i. Hydropower applications should pay attention to fish stocks and normally be 
accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment (see also Policy DP21 ); 
j. Biomass, energy from waste, biogas and anaerobic digestion proposals should also 
address the impact on vibration, odour and dust (the latter for biomass and energy 
from waste only). Opportunities to recover heat and power are encouraged in 
accordance with P olicy SP3; and 
k. Large scale ground mounted solar photovoltaic solar farm proposals should show 
how they have made effective use of previously developed  and non -agricultural land. 
Where a proposal requires the use of agricultural land, poorer quality land should be 
used in preference to land of a higher quality (see also Policy DP18 ). Proposals 
should allow for continued agricultural use wherever possible and/or encourage 
biodiversity improvements around arrays. The assessment should pay particular 
attention to the impact of glint and glare on neighbo uring land uses and residential 
amenity as well as aircraft safety, (including defence operations) .  
3. The assessment should be proportionate to the development proposed and include 
sufficient information to allow for an accurate evaluation of all impacts, b oth negative 
and positive. It should cover necessary ancillary development such as security 
measures, lighting, access tracks and fencing. Impacts should be considered 
cumulatively against those existing or consented development types with similar impacts 
in the surrounding area. Mitigation measures to remove or reduce adverse impacts 
should be identified.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 145 
  Wind energy development  
4. In addition to the above criteria for non -wind schemes, proposals for wind energy 
development of any scale (excluding microgener ation) will only be approved if:  
a. The proposed site is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy development in 
an adopted Neighbourhood Plan; and  
b. Following consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by 
affected local communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has 
their backing.  
Monitoring and Decommissioning  
5. Where planning permission establishes performance standards, applicants will be 
expected to demonstrate compliance through the  submission of regular monitoring 
reports.  
6. Proposals  for temporary infrastructure will be expected to include measures for 
satisfactory restoration, including progressive restoration, of the site at the earliest 
practicable opportunity to an agreed after -use or to a state capable of beneficial after -
use. 
7. Where appropriate, planning obligations will be sought in order to secure the after -use, 
long term management and maintenance of the site.  
 
Explanation  
4.228.  Strategic infrastructure includes transport, water management, 
telecommunications, broadband and energy generation, including 
decentralised, low carbon and renewable energy. Policies DP25 , DP27  and 
DP28  cover developer contributions for new infrastructure, broadband and 
mobile communications and transport respectively, whilst Policy DP19  covers 
water infrastructure.  
4.229.  It is important to ensure the continued operation and potential for necessary 
expansion of existing strategic infrastructure, which makes an essential 
contribution to the sustainability of communities in Shropshire.  
4.230.  It is equal ly important to ensure that new strategic infrastructure is positively 
considered where it will contribute to national priorities and/or locally identified 
requirements and this contribution outweighs any potential adverse impacts. 
Such infrastructure has the potential to support to the sustainability of 
communities in Shropshire in the same was as existing strategic 
infrastructure.  
4.231.  Locally identified requirements for strategic infrastructure derive from the 
requirements of national policy and infrastructur e planning programmes. 
These requirements are identified in the Implementation Plan or Place Plans.  
4.232.  Planning applications for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are 
decided by the Planning Inspectorate rather than Shropshire Council. Such 
decisions are guided by National Policy Statements which also provide useful 
guidance for local decision making. Further information is available at: 
https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/  
4.233.  Planning applications for other strategic infrastructure in Shropshire will be 
determined by Shropshire Council. This policy supplements national Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 146 
  guidance, identifying criteria which are intended to be us ed as a benchmark 
against which to assess such proposals.  
4.234.  Generating heat and electricity from renewable and low -carbon technologies 
is a good way of reducing carbon emissions, but government guidance makes 
it clear that the infrastructure required needs t o be located and designed to 
avoid negative and unsustainable environmental impacts. The suitability of 
specific sites for development needs to be determined on an individual site 
basis, taking account of a range of relevant planning considerations. 
Applic ants should show how those issues listed in the policy have been 
assessed. Where a particular technology is unlikely to give rise to an impact 
on one or more of the factors listed, the assessment should explain why 
this/these have been omitted.  
4.235.  The cumulat ive impacts of renewable and low carbon development require 
particular attention. Infrastructure developments may have combined effects 
where similar developments exist or are planned in the area —for example, 
installing a solar array where there are others , either already constructed or 
with planning permission, may raise concerns about changes to landscape 
character and loss of visual amenity. Similarly, a grouping of biomass or 
energy from waste proposals may lead to unacceptable traffic impacts. These 
cumulative effects can stretch beyond Shropshire’s boundaries and applicants 
should be aware of the need to consider a wider sphere of influence in such 
situations.  
4.236.  The National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019) states that 
applications for new wind  energy development involving one or more turbines 
should not be considered acceptable unless they are in an area identified as 
suitable for wind energy development in the development plan (this can be 
either the Local Plan or a Neighbourhood Plan). This L ocal Plan does not 
identify such areas, but Neighbourhood Plans are encouraged to do so.

  DP27.  Broadband and Mobile Communications Infrastructure  
1. Shropshire businesses and communities require quality broadband provision and 
mobile network connectivity to support economic growth, social inclusion and 
community safety.  
2. Development proposals will be expected to provide the infrastructure for broadband 
and mobile communications as essential utilities.  
 
Broadband Provision  
3. Residential and commercial developments including change of use or conversion of 
existing buildings will be expected to deliver:  
a. Gigabit -capable broadband infrastructure using ‘fibre to the premises’ technology 
wherever practical, recognising that provision in residential  developments of less 
than 10 dwellings or small -scale employment developments may be subject to 
viability constraints affecting the development; OR  
b. Alternative gigabit -capable technologies where justified for reasons including 
viability, distance from the  network or other constraints preventing ‘fibre to the 
premises’ . 
4. Residential and commercial developments including change of use or conversion of 
existing buildings will also deliver passive ducting wherever possible, to facilitate the 
delivery of competi tive fibre broadband services.  
 
Mobile and Fixed Wireless Network Provisions  
5. Residential and commercial developments will be expected to:  
a. Maintain and improve connectivity to mobile voice and data communications 
networks;  
b. Ensure that new mobile and fixed wireless network apparatus is appropriately 
located and sympathetically designed to reduce their visual impacts on the 
surrounding area by mounting the apparatus:  
i. On existing installations used for that purpose; or then  
ii. On buildings where the apparatus will not cause any adverse impacts; or then  
iii. On new installations with capacity for both the proposed and future apparatus;  
c. Ensure that where technical evidence justifies the provision of new installations for 
mobile and fixed wireless infrastruct ure, the applicant will demonstrate:  
i. That existing installations or buildings cannot be used; and  
ii. The new installation is of an appropriate scale, suitably located preferably on a 
private site with restricted access, sympathetically designed, reduces any 
impacts on both the area surrounding the new installation; distant views from 
publicly accessible locations or views from any other sensitive sites;  
d. Demonstrate that new mobile installations or adaptations (including the addition of 
network apparatus) will safeguard public health in relation to the individual effects of 
the new proposal and the cumulative effects of all network facilities in that location.  
 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 148 
  Explanation  
4.237.  Delivering high quality, digital infrastructure that meets the needs of 
businesses and communities is a key priority within Shropshire’s Economic 
Growth Strategy. This recognises  that the provision of the best available 
digital connectivity is also an esse ntial utility for businesses and communities. 
The intention is to ensure that mobile connectivity and broadband provision 
across Shropshire meets the needs of employers and residents , supports how 
they choose to work and live  and will enable them to lower the ‘carbon 
footprint’ of their business operation or lifestyle . 
4.238.  This connectivity is an essential utility and should be provided to communities 
as a means to support their quality of life, to facilitate social inclusion and to 
reduce the need to travel to access work, services and leisure opportunities. 
This connectivi ty should now be provided as an integral component of new 
development to secure the long -term social and economic vitality and viability 
of Shropshire’s communities. Shropshire Council recognises the need to 
balance the delivery of the best available conne ctivity to high -quality 
communications infrastructure with the viability of new development proposals  
within any relevant ‘cost cap’ per dwelling for connection to  electronic 
communication , network connections . 
4.239.  The provision of new digital infrastructure a nd gigabit -capable access will 
support agile working, a reduction in commuting and the growth of smart 
home technology to enable businesses and communities to contribute 
towards a cleaner and healthier environment and a reduction of their ‘carbon 
footprint ’. 
 
Mobile Telephony  
4.240.  There is likely to be a need to establish new mobile and fixed wireless 
infrastructure over the lifetime of the Local Plan to support new residential and 
commercial developments. Developers will be expected to consider the need 
for ade quate coverage for mobile communications in all new developments. 
Where there is a need to build additional capacity, they will be expected to 
work with Mobile Network Operators to overcome existing locational issues 
and to address any capacity issues crea ted by their development proposals.  
4.241.  New mobile and fixed wireless infrastructure proposed within designated 
Ministry of Defence safeguarding zone s should through its design or any 
necessary mitigation , ensure that it does not adversely impact on Ministry of 
Defence  operational sites, informed by appropriate consultation with the 
Ministry of Defence.   
4.242.  This policy seeks to ensure that all new apparatus makes use of existing 
installations  and sites where possible. Any applications  for essential new 
installations for mobile and fixed wireless infrastructure will be expected to 
demonstrate the need for the installation and for the proposed location.  
 
Broadband Access  
4.243.  Applicants will be required to actively demonstrate they have consi dered the 
need for ‘gigabit -capable’ broadband infrastructure in their proposals, the 
digital requirements of the development and the level of connectivity that can 
be achieved. Where a proposal is classed as major development, applicants 
should engage wit h communication providers and/or the local authority to Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 149 
  identify where the development may contribute to, and integrate with, existing 
broadband infrastructure provision.  
4.244.  All new developments will be expected to conform to the Government’s 
evolving ambitio n for ‘gigabit -capable’ broadband infrastructure to be available 
to all premises in the UK by 2025. As of March 2020, 6.5% of properties in 
Shropshire had access  to full -fibre connections (12.4% in the UK).  The costs 
of installing gigabit -capable broadband infrastructure will be balanced against 
the increased sales values likely to be achieved by providing fast and reliable 
broadband speeds in the development.  
4.245.  All developments providing gigabit -capable broadband infrastructure should 
offer customers a choice of service from various Internet Service Providers. 
Gigabit -capable  broadband means full -fibre technology, but could also 
comprise cable broadband, fixed wir eless and 5G capability.  Gigabit -capable 
broadband infrastructure means any technology that can deliver 1 gigabit per 
second (1 Gbps is equal to 1,000 Mbps).  
4.246.  Full-fibre broadband infrastructure is where a fibre optic cable provides a 
broadband connection to each premises rather than using a copper telephone 
line. The current copper network is expected to become redundant by 2030.

  DP28.  Communications and Transport  
1. Shropshire will continue be an attractive place to live and work by improving its 
communications and transport networks and supporting the infrastructure and services 
to widen travel and transport choices  and to improve connectivity and accessibility  whilst 
moving towards reduced  car dependency and managing the impacts of transport 
movements on communities and our environment.  
2. Responding positively to changes in our climate will require access to better 
communications infrastructure and more sustainable travel options and services offering 
choices about the need to travel a nd the best transport modes. This will help to manage 
the environmental impacts of travel on climate change, air quality, network noise and 
public health contributing to the sustainability of communities and protecting our 
environment.  
3. These objectives wil l be achieved by delivering a sustainable pattern of growth and 
development, investment in the necessary communications and transport infrastructure 
and services, facilitating remote access to services and employment and making 
available , more  accessible, safe, reliable, low carbon transport modes and active travel 
choices through:  
a. Provision  of infrastructure for broadband, mobile and fixed wireless networks 
offering remote access to employment through mobile/agile working, to retail and 
commercial services, to social networks, to health and other public services;  
b. Protection , extension or imp rovement of footways, cycleways, public rights of way 
and bridleways for active travel and canals to provide local transport routes to home, 
work, services and leisure;  
c. Promotion  of passenger transport services comprising rail, bus, Park & Ride, 
coaches, t axis, community transport services and car share schemes that provide 
accessible, affordable and responsive transport choices;  
d. Changes  in transport technologies and services towards more sustainable transport 
modes and choices including ultra -low emissions  vehicles, pure electric vehicles, or 
alternative vehicle systems including autonomous vehicles , provision of 
infrastructure investment including domestic charging points and commercial 
charging places  and looking towards the provision of enhanced consumer  choice in 
transport services ; 
e. Investment  in and promotion of strategic and local highways including the 
Shrewsbury North West Relief Road and the rail network connecting Shropshire to 
national and regional networks and linking Shrewsbury with other settlements in the 
County to drive opportunity, investment and growth of the Shropshire economy;  
f. Investment  in network  location s where economic a ctivity or other development will 
necessitate improvements in communications and transport infrastructure and 
services ; and  
g. Continuing  to support freight movements through and around the County by rail and 
road, promoting a modal shift from highway networks to commercial rail freight 
transport  and direct ing commercial traffic movements to appropriate highway routes . 
 
Explanation  
4.247.  Shropshire will continue to promote and support improvements to the 
communications a nd transport infrastructure serving the County. This is Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 151 
  central to the delivery of sustainable economic growth and the creation of 
sustainable patterns of development in the settlements, ‘strategic corridors’ 
and ‘strategic sites’ of Shropshire . This will still require everyone to consider 
how they contribute to the process of reversing the adverse changes to our 
climate, global temperature and to our seas and oceans.  
4.248.  This process of improving our connectivity whilst seeking to manag e the 
change s to our glo bal environment  requires a positive response to our 
personal communication and travel needs in the workplace and in our daily 
lives. It will be important to locate new development on transport networks 
where travel needs are met; to make alternative modes of travel accessible 
and affordable and provide access to new technologies to remove the need 
to travel or to change the environmental impacts of our travel behaviour. It 
will also be important to mov e towards a zero carbon economy combined 
with the soluti ons offered by investment in travel and tran sport technologies 
to bring forward greater consumer choices in  sustainable travel and transport 
services similar to the expanding market s in communications and 
entertainment services.  
4.249.  Key objectives are to reduce our dependency on private motor vehicles and 
fossil fuels by using ‘active’ travel opportunities by walking , ‘wheeling ’ (using 
all forms of mobility devices or aids for the very yo ung and the very old) or 
cycling wherever possible before using public transport or ‘shared ’ vehicles 
and before using private vehicles.  This is explained by the Hierarchy of 
Sustainable Transport that encourages the patterns of behaviour that will 
move t he UK towards its ambition to reduce CO2 emissions from travel, to 
reduce traffic congestion, dependency on powered transport and reduce the 
energy requirements of our transport networks.  Th is Hierarchy is a simple 
decision pathway for everyone to follow when making their travel choices:  
 
Figure DP2 8.1: Hierarchy of Sustainable Transport  
 
4.250.  This process of managing change starts with the decision whether we need 
to travel at all.  The most sustainable travel option is to access work, goods, 
services, leisure and social interaction remotely using electronic 
communication media  or to achieve ke y elements of these activities in this 
way, as our first choice, irrespective of age or technological ability. The 
response to the Coronavirus restrictions shows how we might  respond 
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 152 
  positively to the effect s of global challenges on  our lives and realise tangible  
benefits for ourselves and our local, national and global communit ies. 
4.251.  This will require the delivery of infrastructure for broadband, mobile and fixed 
wireless networks to remove the need to travel.  This infrastructure 
investme nt will support the decision pathway in the Hierarchy of Transport 
and will help to  reduce or avoid adverse impacts on our landscape, 
townscape and natural and historic environment as well as reducing the 
effects of our travel patterns on the qualit ies of our air, rivers, seas, 
atmosphere and climate.  
4.252.  Development in our settlements will support their role and function and 
contribute to the vitality and viability of these communities. The cumulative 
effects of development in settlements may lead to safety is sues, congestion, 
rising emissions, air quality effects and public health issues.  Developer 
contributions to improvements in our transport networks and infrastructure 
will be encouraged where ver possible, to increase the capacity , function and 
safety of o ur footways, cycleways,  roads , rail and public transport networks.  
The Council will consider the implications of this requirement  on the viability 
of development proposals, where necessary.   
4.253.  Local travel options play an essential role in influencing trave l behaviour 
including footways, cycleways (including National Cycle Network), public 
rights of way, bridleways and the canal network especially within or close to 
settlements. These strategic and local networks will be protected and 
enhanced as important l ocal routes through Shropshire. These provide 
alternative modes of travel for local communities and for tourism and leisure, 
improve the permeability of neighbourhoods and accessibility to employment 
and key services. It is important to recognise that walk ing, wheeling (using 
mobility devices or aids) and cycling contribute to the health, wellbeing, 
accessibility and quality of life for many people in our communities.  
4.254.  Passenger transport services reduce the cumulative effects of individual 
travel choices by helping to lower congestion, improv e air quality and 
mitigat e other impacts. The Local Transport Plan identifies public transport 
networks and service improvements a nd seeks to supports less accessible 
communities. The extension of community transport networks, the 
maintenance of Park & Ride and local rail improvements are also 
encouraged.  
4.255.  A flexible approach to the uptake of new technologies will be promoted to 
realise the benefits of cleaner and more sustainable communication choices 
and transport options and services especially in urban environments.  This 
will require the infrastructure to support these alternative technologies to be 
delivered close to its consume rs and to facilitate the delivery of greater 
consumer choice about transport services . This will enable a more rapid 
uptake of the technologies including broadband , mobile and fixed wireless 
networks , domestic vehicle charging points in dwellings and comme rcial 
charging places. This will especially support the adoption of sustainable 
transport modes including ultra -low emissions vehicles, pure electric 
vehicles, or alternative vehicle systems. The advent of autonomous vehicles 
lies within the foreseeable fu ture and the strategy of the Local Plan is to 
support the uptake of this transport option by seeking to facilitat e the 
essential  infrastructure for this technology , when  it is proven .  
4.256.  The national policy decision to remove petrol and diesel vehicles by 20 30 
will, along with the move to reduce the need for domestic gas supplies, 
increase demands for electricity supplies across the network, at sub -station Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 153 
  distribution points and in the ‘internal fit’ of new homes. Shropshire Council 
recognises the need to ba lance the delivery of new infrastructure for 
domestic electricity usage including electric vehicle charging points (and 
home heating) with the viability implications for new development arising 
from essential electricity network upgrades. This will be  managed within any 
relevant ‘cost cap’ per dwelling for extending electricity networks and 
improving their supply capacities. This will also consider the potential to 
deliver  decentralised energy sources and to use  local distribution networks.  
4.257.  Shropshire w ill support improvements to the Strategic and Local Highway 
Networks particularly to support the growth of our local economy. The sub -
regional role of Shrewsbury is to be enhanced by the delivery of the North 
West Relief Road to extend the A53 around the n orth and west of 
Shrewsbury .  This will complete the existing by -passes  to reduce journey 
times around the town and to increas e the connectively of Shrewsbury in the 
strategic road network.  The Outline Business Case for the Shrewsbury 
North West Relief Ro ad sets out the case for the cons truction of this new 
highway to complete a circular by-pass  of Shrewsbury:  
‘Shrewsbury lies at the intersection of the A5 with the A49 on the 
Strategic Road Network which by -pass es Shrewsbury  to the south and 
east of the town . Within Shrewsbury, a partial ring of local distributo r 
roads also serves the developed areas of the town but again, only to the 
south and east . The connectivity of Shrewsbury and the built areas of the 
town are therefore affected by the lack of equivalent road connections 
serving  the north and west  of the town. This lack of direct links between 
the northern and western ar eas has been a major source of traffic 
problems for many decades. Consequently, the northern and western 
approaches to Shrew sbury  become heavily congested at peak times . 
This traffic has to either pass through the town centre or take the longer , 
alternative route around the A5 and A49 by -passes , adding to congestion 
within the town centre or on the Strategic Road Network  particularly at 
key by-pass junctions. The existing  traffic routes within and around the 
town are therefore not suitable for managing northern and western traffic 
and there are no practical alternative routes for most trips other th an the 
provision of a n ew North West Relief Road to complete a circular by -pass 
around the town of Shrewsbury ’. 
4.258.  The provision of a Shrewsbury Parkway Station will promote rail travel and 
reduce traffic on the strategic highway network. Shropshire will welcome 
investment to improve highway safety especially on the A49, or by duelling 
or partial ly duelling the A5/A483 north of Shrewsbury and with junction 
capacity improvements to the A5 Shrewsbury and Oswestry bypasses.  
4.259.  Shropshire recognises its sub -regional rol e in the movement of freight 
through the rail network and the A5 / A49 between  the English regions, 
Wales and the seaports serving Ireland. Improvements to freight movements 
will be facilitated where possible particularly through the direction of 
commercia l traffic to appropriate highway routes and more importantly 
through  the transfer of freight to the rail network.  This significant modal shift  
will be supported to combat climate change and to reduce the impacts on the 
strategic road network.  
4.260.  Development within designated Ministry of Defence safeguarding zone s 
should through its design and any necessary mitigation,  ensure it does not 
adversely impact on Ministry of Defence operational sites , informed by 
appropriate consultation with the Ministry of Defence.   Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 154

1. Mineral Safeguarding Area (MSA) boundaries are identified on Figure SP16 .1 of Policy 
SP16 . Applications for non -mineral development which fall within a MSA an d which could

a. The applicant can demonstrate that the mineral resource concerned is not of 
economic value; or  
b. The mineral can be extracted to prevent the unnecessary sterilisation of the 
resource prior to the development taking place without causing unacceptable 
adverse impacts on the environment and local community; or  
c. The development is exempt as set out in the Explanation  below.  
2. The buffer zones surrounding safeguarded mineral transport and processing facilities are 
as follows:  
Safeguarded Mineral Transport and Processing Facilities  Buffer Zone  
Main access road to mineral site  100m  
Haul road within minerals site  50m 
Existing mineral processing plant  250m  
Extraction area: Sand & Gravel & Clay  100m  
Extraction area: Crushed Rock & Opencast Coal  250m  
3. Applications  for non -mineral development within the buffer zones  surrounding the 
safeguarded  mineral transport and processing facilities will not be granted unl ess the 
applicant can demonstrate that:  
a. The development proposed would not prevent or unduly restrict the continued 
operation of the protected infrastructure; or,  
b. That the identified facilities are no longer required or that viable alternative facilities 
are available.  
4. Applications for permission for non -mineral development in a MSA must include an 
assessment of the effect of the proposed development on the mineral resource beneath 
or adjacent to the site of the development or the protected mine ral handling facility 
(termed a Mineral Assessment). This assessment will provide information to accompany 
the planning application to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the MPA that mineral 
interests have been adequately considered and that known mineral resources will be 
prevented, where possible, from being sterilised or unduly restricted by other forms of 
development occurring on or close to the resource;  
5. Identification of these areas does not imply that any application for the working of 
minerals withi n them will be granted planning permission.   
 
Explanation  
4.261.  Minerals are finite resources and so their conservation and waste 
minimisation are important planning considerations. National policy 
recognises that minerals are a finite resource and a key part o f our natural 
capital. In order to conserve mineral resources, every effort will be made to Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 155 
  ensure that, where practicable, known mineral resources are not sterilised by 
other forms of development.  
4.262.  The boundaries of Mineral Safeguarding Areas (MSAs) and the location of 
protected mineral transport and processing facilities are illustrated on Figure 
SP16 .1 of Policy SP16 . More detailed information is available on an 
‘interactive’ mineral safeguarding map which is available on the Shropshire 
Council’s website.  
4.263.  The MSA includes information the Coal Authority’s 'Surface Coal Resource 
Plan' which defines consultation arrangements for circumstances in which the 
Coal Authority need to be consul ted on coal resources.  
4.264.  Non-mineral development which is exempt from the requirements of this 
Policy comprises:  
a. Applications for householder development;  
b. Applications for alterations and extensions to existing buildings and for 
change of use of existing dev elopment, unless intensifying activity on site;  
c. Applications that are in accordance with the development plan and site 
allocations where the assessment of site options took account of potential 
mineral sterilisation and determined that prior extraction was  not required;  
d. Applications for advertisement consent;  
e. Applications for Reserved Matters, including subsequent applications after 
Outline consent has been granted;  
f. Prior notifications (telecoms, forestry, agriculture, demolition);  
g. Certificates of Lawfulnes s of Existing Use or Development (CLEUD) and 
Certificates of Lawfulness of Proposed Use or Development (CLOPUD);  
h. Applications for works to trees;  
i. Applications for temporary planning permission;  
j. Development types already specified in the Local Development P lan as 
exempt from the need for consideration on safeguarding grounds; and  
k. Applications for development of national, regional or local significance 
which outweighs the value of the mineral.  
4.265.  For the purposes of Paragraph 4  of this Policy DP29 , where required, the 
assessment of the effect of the proposed development on mineral resources 
or mineral handling facilities can form part of any Design & Access Statement.

  DP30.  Sites for Sand and Gravel Working  
1. The supply of sand and gravel during the Plan period should be provided in the first 
instance from existing permitted sites and then from the development of mineral working 
at the saved SAMDev Plan mineral allocation s identified within Appendix 2 of this 
document and identified on the Proposals Map.  
2. Proposals for mineral working falling outside the allocated areas will be permitted where 
developers can demonstrate that:  
a. The proposal would meet an unmet need or would prevent the sterilisation of the 
resource; and,  
b. The proposal would not prejudice the development of the allocated sites; or,  
c. significant environmental benefits would be obtained as a result of the exchange or 
surrender of existing permissions or the site might be significantly more accept able 
overall than the allocated sites, and would offer significant environmental benefits.  
 
Explanation  
4.266.  National policy guidance requires Shropshire to maintain an adequate and 
steady supply of sand and gravel during the Plan period, taking account of the  
existing production guideline  established by the West Midlands Aggregate 
Working Party. The latest approved Local Aggregates Assessment (2019) 
indicates that , at 0.71mt, sand and gravel production in Shropshire and 
Telford & Wrekin in 2018 is slightly abo ve both the 10 year rolling average for 
sand gravel sales (0.68mt) and the same as the 3 year average (0.71mt). The 
landbank of permissions for sand and gravel working has remained 
consistently above the minimum level required by NPPF. The permitted 
landbank was equivalent just over 16 years’ production in 2018. The LAA also 
notes that record levels of housing deliv ery in 2017 and 2018 mean that 
annual demand for construction aggregates is not expected to increase 
demand above the level experienced in those years.  
4.267.  Shropshire  is a significant mineral producer, but the majority of sand and 
gravel working in Shropshire  is now from glacial or bunter deposits which  are 
of more variable quality than river terrace materials which have now been 
largely worked out. Sand and gravel deposits in Shropshire frequently contain 
a high proportion of sand and more limited quantities of gravel and often suffer 
from clay and lignite contamination. These characteristics mean that deposits 
often require additional processing to generate a saleable product.  
4.268.  The majority of the material produced is currently used locally within 
Shropshire to supply the construction industry with building sand, concrete 
and concrete products. In 2018 there were 10 permitted sand and gravel sites 
in the Plan area, 6 of which were operational.  
 
 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 157 
  4.269.  Shropshire Council will adopt an approach during the Plan Period which 
increases productive capacity to reflect local growth as set out in Policy  SP16  
and Table DP30 .1:

  DP31.  Managing Development and Operation of Mineral  Sites  
1. Applications for mineral development will be supported where applicants can 
demonstrate that potential adverse impacts on the local community and Shropshire’s 
natural and historic environment can be satisfactorily controlled  in line with  Policies 
DP12  to DP24  (especially with reference to the need for a project level Habitat 
Regulation Assessment in DP12 ). Particular consideration will be given (where relevant) 
to: 
a. Measures to protect people and the environment from adverse effects, including 
visual, noise, dust, vibration and traffic impacts;  
b. The site access and traffic movements, including th e impact of heavy lorry traffic on 
the transport network and the potential to transport minerals by rail. Where 
opportunities to transport minerals by rail are not feasible there will be a preference 
for new mineral sites to be located where they can obtai n satisfactory access to the 
Primary Route Network;  
c. The cumulative impact of mineral working, including the concurrent impact of more 
than one working in a specific area and the impact of sustained working in a specific 
area;  
d. Impacts on the stability of the site and adjoining land and opportunities to reclaim 
derelict, contaminated or degraded land (Policy DP18 );  
e. Effects o n surface waters or groundwater and from the risk of flooding  (Policies 
DP19 , DP20 , DP21  and DP22 ); 
f. Effects on ecology and the potential to enhance biodiversity;  
g. The method, phasing and management of the working proposals;  
h. Evidence of the quantity and quality of mineral and the extent to w hich the proposed 
development contributes to the comprehensive working of mineral resources and 
appropriate use of high -quality materials;  
i. Protecting, conserving and enhancing the significance of heritage assets including 
archaeology.  
Where necessary, outp ut restrictions may be agreed with the operator to make a 
development proposal environmentally acceptable.  
2. Mineral working proposals should include details of the proposed method, phasing, long -
term management and maintenance of the site restoration, inclu ding progressive 
restoration towards full reinstatement of occupied land and removal of all temporary and 
permanent works. A satisfactory approach will avoid the creation of future liabilities and 
will deliver restoration at the earliest practicable opport unity to an agreed after -use or to a 
state capable of beneficial after -use. Where the proposed after -use includes agriculture, 
woodland, amenity (including nature conservation) or other uses, a satisfactory scheme 
will need to include the following:  
a. Proposals which take account of the site, its surroundings, and any development 
plan policies relevant to the area;  
b. Evidence to show that the scheme incorporates best practice advice and is practical 
and achievable;  
c. A Management Plan, which should address the management requirements during 
each phase of the proposed development;  
d. A Reclamation Plan;  
e. Provision for a 5 year period of aftercare.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 159 
  Where appropriate, a planning obligation will be sought in order to secure the after -use, 
long-term management and ma intenance of the site.  
3. Proposals for the working of unconventional hydrocarbons should clearly distinguish 
between exploration, appraisal and production phases and must demonstrate that they 
can satisfactorily address constraints on production and processi ng within areas that are 
licensed for oil and gas exploration or production. Particular consideration will be given to 
the need for comprehensive information and controls relevant to the protection of water 
resources.  
4. Where relevant, applications for the w inning and working of coal should include 
proposals for the separation and stockpiling of fireclay so that its value as a mineral 
resource can be captured.  
5. Sustainable proposals for the working of building stone will be supported, and a flexible 
approach w ill be adopted to the duration of planning consents for very small scale, 
intermittent but long -term or temporary working to produce locally distinctive building and 
roofing stone consistent with the objectives of Policy SP5 and other relevant policies of 
the Local Plan . 
6. Where ancillary development is proposed, proposals should include satisfactory 
measures to minimise adverse effects, including:  
a. Locating the ancillary development within or immediately adjacent to the area 
proposed for mineral working or on an established plant site;  
b. Restricting the principal purpose to a purpose in connection with the winning and 
working of minerals at the site or the treatment, storage or removal of minerals 
excavated or brought to the surface at that site;  
c. For imported minerals, where necessary, to limit the quantities involved to control 
the volume and type of traffic, and the establishmen t of an acceptable route for the 
traffic to and from the site;  
d. The cessation of the ancillary development when working of the mineral for which 
the site was primarily permitted has ceased and removal of plant and machinery to 
allow full restoration of the site. 
7. Where ancillary development could have an adverse effect on the local environment 
which cannot be mitigated to acceptable levels, a condition may be attached to the 
planning permission to control the adverse effects by limiting development to an 
established plant site, or introducing a stand off from sensitive land uses, or mitigating 
effects in other ways, or as a last resort, withdrawing permitted development rights so 
that the ancillary development can be properly controlled by the terms of the pla nning 
permission.  
 
Explanation  
4.271.  Mineral working is a temporary, but often long -term activity, which is essential 
to provide the infrastructure, buildings, energy and goods that the country 
needs. Technical background work prepared in support of the Local Plan 
describes the range of aggregate and industrial mineral resources which are 
currently worked in Shropshire. The best available data and discussion with 
neighbouring mineral planning authorities confirm that no additional mineral 
allocations are required during the Plan Period.  
4.272.  National Planning Policy requires us to identify criteria against which planning 
applications for mineral working will be assessed so as to ensure that 
permitted operations do not have unacceptable adverse impacts on the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 160 
  natural and historic environment or human health. Mineral working has the 
potential to impact on both groundwater and surface water as a result of 
removal of materials, dewatering activities and restoration activities. It is 
important that these aspects are fully considered at an early stage and 
applications should be accompanied by a hydro -geological risk assessment to 
assess the potential impacts of the proposal on environmental features 
supported by groundwater, for example, wetlands, watercourses, ponds o r 
existing water supplies. A programme of groundwater level monitoring should 
commence well in advance of the submission of a planning application in 
order to inform the risk assessment. The assessment must consider whether 
potential impacts are deemed acc eptable and/or can be appropriately 
managed through avoidance or mitigation measures. A Scheme of working 
based upon the HRA and groundwater level monitoring results should be 
submitted with any planning application. A ‘water features survey’ will also be 
required to identify environmental features and may require installation of 
monitoring infrastructure and implementation of a long -term monitoring 
programme for the water environment.  
4.273.  Minerals are a finite resource and applications should be accompanied by  
appropriate evidence, collected through a professionally undertaken 
programme of drilling and mineral assessment, to demonstrate the quantity 
and quality of mineral.  
4.274.  Mineral working can also help to deliver substantial environmental and 
community benefits . We therefore also need to establish policies to support 
mineral working which helps to secure locally sensitive design and to ensure 
that high quality restoration and aftercare of mineral sites takes place at the 
earliest opportunity and, wherever possib le, helps to secure green 
infrastructure  or environmental and community benefits identified in the 
relevant local Place Plan. The restoration of mineral sites can make a positive 
contribution to Climate Change by supporting multi -functionality in after use  
schemes including environmental enhancements such as flood management 
and biodiversity benefits from wet washland attenuation.  
4.275.  Where restoration proposals  fall within a designated Ministry of Defence 
safeguarding zone, care should be taken to ensure that they do not result in 
an environment which attracts large or flocking bird species that would reduce 
aviation safety.

  DP32.  Waste  Management Facilities  
1. Further to Policy  SP17 , the development of waste transfer, recycling and recovery 
facilities will be supported where applicants can demonstrate that potential adverse 
impacts on the local community and Shropshire’s natural and historic environment can be 
satisfactorily controlled. Particular consideration will be given (where relevant) to:  
a. Measures to protect people and the environment from adverse effects, including: 
visual; noise; vibration; dust; litter; vermin and birds; air and water pollution; odour; 
or traffic impacts;  and 
b. The site access and traffic movements, including the impact of heavy lorry traffic on 
the transport network, in particular the quality of the p roposed access to the Primary 
Route Network.  
2. In the case of specific types of waste management facility, the following criteria will also 
apply:  
a. In-vessel composting and anaerobic digestion facilities will be permitted in 
appropriate locations, including the re -use of existing buildings or as part of an 
integrated waste management facility. Open air composting facilities will be 
permitted in appropriate locations where bio -aerosol emissions can be acceptably 
controlled and the scale and impacts o f the operation do not materially conflict with 
surrounding land uses;  
b. Facilities for the recycling of construction and demolition materials may be 
acceptable on existing landfill and mineral working sites provided that the agreed 
restoration of the site i s not unduly prejudiced and that waste recovery operations 
are linked to its agreed operational life;  
c. Proposals to recover energy from waste will be permitted in appropriate locations 
where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Waste Planning A uthority 
that the proposal does not undermine the provision of waste management facilities 
further up the waste hierarchy. Proposals for energy recovery facilities should 
include provision for the recovery of both heat and power, unless this can be 
demonst rated to be impracticable;  
d. Facilities for the handling, treatment, processing or disposal of Hazardous Wastes 
will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the facility is in an 
appropriate location and the proposal complies with other relevant policies in the 
Development Plan;  and 
e. Where planning permission is required, development proposals for the spreading 
onto land of untreated or treated wastes or waste derivatives including liquids, 
sludges or solids will not be permitted unless it can be s hown that alternative 
methods recovering material or energy value from the waste, consistent with the 
waste hierarchy, are impracticable.  
 
Explanation  
4.276.  This policy builds on Policy SP17  to provide more detailed guidance for 
developers and communities about the management of potential impacts 
which may arise from waste management development. The Waste and 
Resources Strategy ( DEFRA 2018) sets out the Government’s key objectives 
and actions on waste management. Since waste policy is not explicitly 
addressed in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), national policy 
guidance is given by National Planning Policy for Waste ( October 2014).  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 162 
  4.277.  Shropshire Council will support and encourage the management of waste 
resources in a manner consistent with the ‘waste hierarchy’. The hierarchy 
gives top priority to waste prevention, followed by preparing for re -use, 
recycling, other types  of recovery (including energy recovery), and last of all 
disposal. Circular economy principles low carbon transition, sustainable waste 
management can make a big contribution to resource efficiency.  
Figure DP32 .1: The Waste Hierarchy  
 
4.278.  Policy SP17   identifies accessible locations close to the main urban areas 
within which additional waste management facilities could come forward. 
Policy SP13  makes provision for a strategic supply of employment land and 
premises across Shropshire which have the potential to deliver additional 
capacity to meet these objectives. Specific sites which ma y be suitable for 
waste management facilities are identified as part of the guidelines for specific 
employment site allocations in the relevant settlement strategies.  
4.279.  The settlement pattern and distribution of business waste producers in 
Shropshire means t hat the County  is unable to support more specialised 
waste management processes. Natural geology and water resources 
significantly restrict opportunities for landfill. This means that some waste 
material, including hazardous wastes and Very Low Level Radio active Waste 
(VLLRW) is likely to continue to be exported for management and disposal 
outside the County . Shrewsbury, in particular, remains heavily dependent on 
waste management services delivered from facilities in neighbouring local 
authority areas, par ticularly Telford & Wrekin.  
4.280.  Planning applications for waste management activities should provide an 
appropriate level of detail to inform a reasonable degree of certainty on the 
planning application and to ensure the principle of the development and use o f 
the land is acceptable with cross reference to permitting constraints. Where 
development is also subject to approval under pollution control regimes, 
Shropshire Council will continue to work closely with the Environment Agency 
to manage the relevant impa cts. Further guidance is available from the 
Environment Agency.  
4.281.  Where waste management sites fall within a designated Ministry of Defence 
safeguarding zone, care should be taken to ensure that development does not 
result in an environment which attracts  large or flocking bird species that 
would reduce aviation safety.  
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 163 
  DP33.  Landfill and Landraising Sites  
1. Proposals for new sites or extended landfill or landraising facilities will only be supported 
where:  
a. No viable alternative form of waste management, higher up the waste hierarchy, is 
available or practicable;  
b. The proposed development would provide a solution for waste generated in 
Shropshire or for cross boundary waste flows consistent with the principle of 
‘equivalent self -sufficiency’;  
c. The additional capacity generated would not prejudice the completion or restoration 
of existing landfill and landraising sites.  
2. Proposals for new landfill or landraising facilities or extensions to existing facilities must:  
a. Comply with relevant water management and water resource protection policy 
requirements;  
b. Make provision for the management and control of the generation of any leachate 
and landfill gas, including, wherever feasible, the recovery of energy from landfill 
gas; 
c. Comply with other releva nt policies of the Development Plan.  
3. Proposals for new landfill or landraising facilities or extensions to existing facilities will 
include measures for satisfactory restoration, including progressive restoration, of the site 
at the earliest practicable op portunity to an agreed after -use or to a state capable of 
beneficial after -use. On non -hazardous landfill sites interim restorations will be required 
to allow time for settlement to slow sufficiently before restoration is completed. Where the 
proposed afte r-use includes agriculture, woodland, amenity (including nature 
conservation), renewable energy generation or other uses, a satisfactory scheme will 
need to include the following:  
a. Proposals which take account of the geography of the site, its surroundings,  and any 
development plan policies relevant to the area;  
b. Evidence to show that the scheme incorporates best practice advice and is practical 
and achievable;  
c. A Management Plan, which should address the management requirements during 
each phase of the propos ed development;  
d. A Reclamation Plan;  and 
e. Provision for a 5 year period of aftercare.  
Where appropriate, a planning obligation will be sought in order to secure the after -use, 
long-term management and maintenance of the site.  
 
Explanation  
4.282.  Shropshire Council supports the objective of achieving ‘Zero Waste to 
Landfill’, whereby the value of resources consumed in Shropshire is fully 
captured in a way consistent with the Waste Hierarchy. No new landfill sites 
are therefore proposed or identifie d, but detailed policy criteria are required as 
a benchmark against which to assess any applications for new or extended 
landfill or landraising sites which may come forward during the Plan period.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 164 
  4.283.  Natural geology and the geography of water resources in Shropshire 
significantly restrict opportunities for landfill because of the potential for 
adverse impacts on groundwater. The availability of landfill void in Shropshire 
is declining and only one land fill site accepting mixed (non -hazardous) waste 
now remains operational near Ellesmere. National guidance from the 
Environment Agency restrict or prevent landfill and land raising sites where 
there is a significant risk that water quality could be adversel y affected. Any 
proposals for new or extended landfill or landraising sites should comply with 
relevant water management and protection policy requirements.  
4.284.  Where landfill or landraising  sites fall within a designated Ministry of Defence 
safeguarding zone,  care should be taken to ensure that development does not 
result in an environment which attracts  large or flocking bird species that 
would reduce aviation safety.

  5. Settlem ent Policies  
5.1. This section of the Local Plan contains the settlement policies. These p olicies 
are grouped by areas which reflect approximate functional zones of influence 
(known as Place Plan Areas).  Place Plan Areas generally consist of a main 
centre , its surrounding s ettlements and rural hinterland.   
5.2. The boundaries of the 18 Place Plan Areas are shown below:

  S1. Albrighton Place Plan Area  
 
S1.1.  Development Strategy : Albrighton Key Centre  
1. Albrighton will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth objectives in 
the east of the Count y, deliver ing around 500 dwellings and around 5 hectares of 
employment development.  New housing and employment development will respond to 
local needs.  
2. Albrighton is inset within the Green Belt. Development proposals in the Green Belt or on 
safeguarded land must be in accordance with National and Local policies on  Green Belt , 
which specify the development types and the circumstances when development may be 
acceptable.  They must also comply with all other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
3. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the saved  SAMDev 
residential a llocation s and a comprehensive development of the Local Plan residential 
site allocation. Th ese allocations  will be complemented by appropriate small -scale 
windfall residential development within the Albrighton development boundary  shown on 
the Policies Map , where it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan ; and 
appropriate exception development , where it is consistent with  relevant National and 
Local policies, including Policy SP11  (Green Belt) .  
4. New employment development will primarily be delivered at the nearby RAF Cosford 
Strategic Site. This will be complemented by any appropriate small -scale windfall 
employment development within the Albrighton development boundary  shown on the 
Policies Map , where it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
5. New retail development will be directed towards the village centre, in line with Policy 
DP9, where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic  character of the village  and 
the overall sustainability of the village  and its services . 
6. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2 of this document  and 
identified on the Policies Map . Local Plan s ite allocations are identified in Schedule 
S1.1(i) below and identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should 
be in accordance with specified development guidelines and approximate site provision 
figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development  proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within  the Albrighton Plan, other  relevant community -led plans and any 
relevant masterplans that are agreed  by Shropshire Council  to support the delivery of 
allocated s ites. 
8. To provide long -term locations for growth, three areas of land beyond the Albrighton 
development boundary that are not part of the Green Belt are safeguarded for 
Albrighton’s future development needs beyond the current Local Plan period. Th is land 
is set out in Schedule S1. 1(ii) and identified on the Policies Map.  Safeguarded land is 
not allocated for development at the present time, rather it has been safeguarded for 
Albrighton’s future development needs beyond the current Local Plan period.

An appropriately designed roundabout will be provided on 
Kingswood Road at the point of access into the site.  
The 30mph zone on Kingswood Road will be extended to 
reflect the extent of the site and the impact on Beamish 
Lane/A41 junction assessed a nd mitigated. This will likely 
involve closure of this junction.  
To enhance access to services and facilities in the town 
and achieve integrated communities, the development will 
include a northern and southern vehicular, cyclist and 
pedestrian connection into the saved SAMDev Allocation

Opportunities to provide on-site public car parking facilities , 
to alleviate pressure on existing facilities , should be 
considered.  
Green infrastructure will be provided through the site and 
link into the wider area. This provision will include a n 
appropriate green buffer of the railway line and the 
associated green infrastructure  corridor.  
The pond on ALB017 will be appropriately assessed and 
managed (opportunity to integrate into open space 
provision). Where possible trees and hedgerows on the 
site should be retained and enhanced, supported by 
positive tree planting, particularly on areas of open space.  
The site will incorporate appropriate sustainable drainage, 
informed by a sustainable drainage strategy. Any residual 
surface water flood risk will be managed by excluding 
development from the affected areas of the site, which will 
form part of the Green Infrastruc ture network. Flood and 
water management measures must not displace water 
elsewhere.

  Explanation  
5.3. The current Albrighton community -led Plan (the non -statutory ‘Albrighton 
Neighbourhood Plan Light’, hereafter called ‘the Albrighton Plan’) was 
adopted by the Parish Council in June 2013 and adopted by Shropshire 
Council for development management purposes on 26th September 2013.  
The policy  will continue to apply to any updated or replacement community -
led Plans for Albrighton that are formally adopted by Shropshire Council in the 
future.  
5.4. Albrighton is located within the West Midlands Green Belt , which surrounds 
the settlement, except where there is safeguarded land specifically identified 
through the Local Plan p rocess to meet the settlements future development 
needs  beyond the current Local Plan period . 
5.5. The nature and scale of development is designed to maintain and enhance 
Albrighton’s role as a Key Centre  and ensure that local housing need is 
achieved, whilst also respecting the settlement’s  location in the Green Belt.  
5.6. Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery 
of Albrighton’s residential and employment development guideline s. Appendix 
7 of the Local Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the 
delivery of the Loca l Plan allocations .   
5.7. The Local Plan  residential  allocation consists of the remaining land previously 
safeguarded for future development. To ensure that the long -term growth 
needs of the community can be met, new safeguarded land has been 
identified.  Safeg uarded land is not allocated for development at the present 
time, rather it has been safeguarded for Albrighton’s future development 
needs beyond the current Local Plan period.  
5.8. When safeguarded land is allocated for development within a future Local 
Plan, it will provide compensatory improvements to wider Green Belt.  
5.9. To ensure that new development meets local housing need s, the type, size 
and tenure of housing provided within new development should reflect local 
evidence in accordance with Policy DP1 (Residential  Mix), DP3 (Affordable 
Housing  Provision ) and other relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
5.10.  The importance of smaller housing types and housing for the elderly  in 
Albrighton  is apparent from both the national population data and local 
community surveys. Specifically:  
a. The 2011 Census and subsequent mid -year population estimates illustrate 
that the settlement of Albrighton has a higher age profile than the 
Shropshire and National average s. 
b. The community survey on which the Albrighton Plan is based found that 
57% of those answering the Question about their unmet housing 
requirements , needed a one or two bedroomed home (97 out of 169 
respondents to this question).  In response, Policy ALB1 of the Albrighton 
Plan requires a high proportion of one and two bedroomed units.  
5.11.  Saved SAMDev Plan residential allocation ALB003 at White Acres  (site ALBa 
in the Albrighton Plan)  is identified as being capable of meeting the housing 
requirements of people of  retirement age and should therefore include a mix 
of housing designed to be attractive for the 55 -75 or 75+ age groups.  The site 
is particularly well located for the active retired market, being within easy Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 169 
  walking distance of the services and facilities  within Albrighton village centre.  
An attractive pedestrian route that maximises the opportunity provided by the 
existing right of way should be an integral part of any scheme.  
5.12.  The development of the saved SAMDev residential allocation ALB002 East of 
Shaw  Lane (site ALB2b in the Albrighton Plan) will include  provision of land on 
or adjoining the site for open space and leisure facilities and help provide 
additional parking in the vicinity of Albrighton railway station . It is envisaged 
that Community Infras tructure Levy (CIL) monies will be used to help provide 
the sports facilities on the reserved land.  
5.13.  Development of the Local Plan  residential  allocation ALB017 & ALB021 , will 
be informed by a masterplan  ensuring a comprehensive and sustainable 
development with vehicular, cyclist and pedestrian access and green 
infrastructure links through ALB017 into ALB021 , linking the tw o components 
of the site, and from the site into the northern and southern elements of saved 
SAMDev Allocatio n ALB002.  
5.14.  RAF Cosford has been identified as a strategic site in order to facilitate its role 
as a centre of excellence for both UK and International Defence Training; 
plans to form a specialist aviation academy; any opportunities to co -locate 
other MOD se rvices; plans for the expansion of the Cosford Air Museum; and 
plans for the formation of a new headquarters for the West Midlands Air 
Ambulance Charity. The Strategic Site is addressed within Policy S21 of this 
Local Plan.  
5.15.  Recognising the relationship between Albrighton and the nearby Strategic Site 
at RAF Cosford, with many employees and personnel based at RAF Cosford 
choosing to live in Albrighton and/or use the facilities within the settlement  and 
certain  facilities clustering around  RAF Cosford being available for residents 
of Albrighton , new employment development to serve the Albrighton 
community will primarily be delivered at the RAF Cosford Strategic Site.  
5.16.  All development will need to take account of known critical i nfrastructure 
constraints and requirements, as identified within the Albrighton Plan, the 
Albrighton Place Plan and the Implementation Plan. Development should be 
phased appropriately to take account of critical infrastructure delivery and 
seek to positive ly contribute towards local infrastructure improvements, 
including the provision of community benefits in accordance with Polic y DP25  
(Infrastructure Provision ) and other relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
5.17.  The Donington and Albrighton Local Nature Reserve runs along the village’s 
northern development boundary, details of which are at www.dalnr.org/ .  
Development must have no adverse impact on the Local Nature Reserve or 
on local watercourses, in accordance with ALB10 of the adopted Albrighton 
Plan, Policy DP12  (Natural Environment) , Policy DP19  (Water Resources and 
Water Quality) and other relevant policies of the Local Plan . 
 
S1.2.  Community Hubs : Albrighton Place Plan Area  
1. Cosford has been identified as both a Strategic Site and a Community Hub . 
Development proposals in this location have been addressed through Policy S21. 
2. There are no other Community Hubs within the Albrighton Place Plan A rea. 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 170 
  S1.3.  Community Clusters : Albrighton Place Plan Area  
1. There are no Community Clusters within the Albrighton Place Plan A rea. 
 
S1.4.  Wider Rural Area: Albrighton Place Plan Area  
1. There are no saved SAMDev Plan site allocations or Local Plan site allocations within 
the wider rural area of the Albrighton Place Plan Area.  
 
Explanation  
5.18.  No settlements within the Albrighton Place Plan Area have been identified as 
Community Hubs. Furthermore, no settlements have opted -in as Community 
Clusters.  However, new Community  Clusters can be brought forward by 
communities through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.19.  The small village of Beckbury is inset (not included) in the Green Belt and is 
treated as countryside under Policy SP10  and other relevant policies of the 
Local Plan. The remaining rural area is designated as Green Belt  as such 
national policies on Green Belt, Polic y SP11  and other relevant policies of the 
Local Plan apply .

  S2. Bishop ’s Castle Place Plan Area  
 
S2.1.  Development Strategy: Bishop ’s Castle Key Centre  
1. Bishop ’s Castle  will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth 
objectives in the south of the County, delivering around 150 dwellings and around 3 
hectares of employment development. New housing and employment development will 
respond to local needs.  
2. The Plan HRA identifies that development in Bishop’s Castle is likely to have an adverse 
effect on the River Clun SAC so Policy DP13  applies. Mitigation measures will be also 
required to remove any adverse effect from increased recreational pressure arising from 
development in Bishop’s Castle on the integrity of the Stiperstones and Hollies SAC in 
accordance with Polices DP12 , DP14  and DP15 . Mitigation measures for recreational 
impacts are identified in the Plan Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) and supporting 
documents . 
3. A Neighbourhood Plan is being progressed for the Bishop ’s Castle Town Council area. 
The Neighbourhood Plan will include the strategy for achieving the housing and 
employment guidelines for the Key Centre of B ishop ’s Castle .  
4. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the saved SAMDev 
reside ntial allocation  and any residential development allocated  within the B ishops 
Castle  Neighbourhood Plan . This  will be complemented by appropriate small -scale 
windfall residential development within the B ishop ’s Castle  development boundary 
shown on the Poli cies Map, where it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan 
and the B ishop ’s Castle Neighbourhood Plan. It will also be complemented by 
appropriate cross -subsidy and exception development , where it is consistent with the 
Bishops Castle Neighbourhood Plan and relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5. New employment development will be delivered through  the saved SAMDev 
employment allocation  and any employment development allocated  within the Bishop’s 
Castle Neighbourhood Plan . This will be complemented by  any other appropriate small -
scale employment windfall development , where it  is consistent with relevant policies of 
this Local Plan and the B ishop ’s Castle  Neighbourhood Plan.  
6. New retail develop ment will be directed towards the town centr e, in line with Policy DP9, 
where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town.  
7. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Ma p. Development of site allocations should be in accordance 
with specified development guidelines and approximate site provision figures and all 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
8. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to pol icies and guidelines 
identified within the B ishop ’s Castle  Neighbourhood Plan, any other relevant community -
led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by Shropshire Council.  
 
Explanation  
5.20.  Bishop’s Castle provides services and facilities for a large, remote, deeply 
rural and in places sparsely populated part of south Shropshire. The nature 
and scale of future development is designed to maintain and enhance this 
small settlement’s role as a Market Town.  
5.21.  Appendix 5 and 6 of this Local Plan provide  information on the levels of 
residential and employment c ompletions achieved since the start of the Plan Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 172 
  period and commitments available within Bishop’s Castle, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment developme nt 
guideline s. Appendix 7 of this Local Pl an provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations .   
5.22.  Bishop’s Castle  lies to the west of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty (AONB) and much of the remainder of the Place Plan  area is 
within this nationally designated landscape.  
5.23.  The town’s medieval settlement pattern with its narrow roads means that 
vehicular access is often difficult. Much of the town centre lies within a 
Conservation Area, ther e are a large number of listed buildings and the castle 
site is a Scheduled Monument.  
5.24.  Bishop’s Castle Business Park is a small but successful employment area, 
located to the south east of the town which is now nearing full capacity. 
Planning permission has  been granted for development of Phase 2 of this 
business park, (which is a saved SAMDev Plan employment allocation) . This 
development will provide much needed opportunities for existing businesses 
on the estate to expand and new businesses to be attracted  into the town.  
5.25.  Bishop’s Cast le is located within the catchment of the r iver Clun. Part of the 
River Clun is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) notified solely for the 
presence of Freshwater Pearl Mussels. The Habitat Regulation Assessment 
(HRA) for this Local Plan shows that development in the river Clun catchment 
is likely to have a n adverse effect on the River Clun SAC. There are currently 
no mitigation measures which would remove this effect, but this is not to say 
that they will not come forward during the Local Plan period.  
5.26.  Accordingly, to comply with the requirements of the Hab itat Regulations and in 
accordance with Policy DP13  of this Local Plan, development in Bishop’s 
Castle is restricted to that which is either nutrient neutral in terms of its effect 
on the SAC or results in a betterment, in anticipation of measures to achieve 
either of these criteria being found in the future. Further information is 
available in the Habitats Regulations Assessment of this Local Plan . 
5.27.  A Neighbourhood Plan is at an advanced stage of preparation for the Bishop’s 
Castle Town Council area, including the Key Centre of Bishop’s Castle. When 
adopted (or ‘made’) the Neighbourhood Plan will establish the long -term 
delivery strategy to achiev e the h ousing and employment guidelines for the 
Key Centre of Bishop’s Castle. However, any proposals within the 
Neighbourhood Plan  must comply with Policy DP13  of this Local Plan.  Should 
the Neighbourhood Plan propose site allocations and alterations to the 
development boundary the Policies map will be amended to reflect these 
changes.   
5.28.  Development in Bishop’s Castle will be expected to meet the policies and 
guidelines contained in  the B ishop’s Castle  Neighbourhood Plan and any 
other future community -led plan or masterplan that is adopted by Shropshire 
Council.

  S2.2.  Community Hubs: Bishop ’s Castle Place Plan Area  
1. Within the Bishop ’s Castle Place Plan Area, a number of Community Hub settlements 
have been identified. These settlements and their residential development guidelines 
are listed below:  
Community Hub Settlements  Residential Guideline  
Bucknell  Around 110 dwellings  
Chirbury  Around 45 dwellings  
Clun Around 95 dwellings  
Worthen and Brockton  Around 55 dwellings  
2. Within these  Community Hub s, new residential development will be delivered through  
any identified s aved SAMDev residential or mixed -use allocations ; identified Local Plan 
residential allocations; appropriate small -scale windfall residential development within 
the settlements development boundary, as shown on the Policies Map , where it is 
consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant policies of this Local 
Plan; and  appropriate cross -subsidy and exception development where it is consistent 
with Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
3. Within these  Community Hub s, new employment development will be delivered through 
any identified  saved SAMDev mixed use  allocations; and appropriate small -scale 
windfall employment development within the settlements development boundary, as 
shown on the Policies Map, where it is consistent with Community Hub Policy  SP8 and 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
4. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations within these Community Hubs are listed in 
Appendix 2  of this document and identified on the Policies Map. Lo cal Plan site 
allocations within these Community Hubs are identified in Schedule S2.2(i) below and 
identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance 
with specified development guidelines and approximate site provision figures and all 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
5. Bucknell is partly , and Clun is entirely , located within the Shropshire Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Development proposals within the AONB must 
recognise the importance of conserving and where possible enhancing, the special 
qualities of the Shropshire Hills AONB as set out in  the AONB Management Plan and 
should be in accordance with Policy DP24  and other relevant policies of this Local Plan. 
Particular care should be take n with the design and layout of development in 
accordance with Policies SP1, SP5 and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
6. The Plan HRA identifies that development in Bucknell, Clun and Worthen and Brockton 
is likely to have an adverse effect on the River Clun SAC so Policy DP13  applies. 
Additionally, mitigation measures will be required to remove any adverse effect from 
increased recreational pressure arising from development in Chirbury and Worthen and 
Brockton on t he integrity of the Stiperstones and Hollies SAC in accordance with Polices 
DP12 , DP14  and DP15 . Mitigation measures for recreational impacts are identified in 
the Plan Habitat Regulations Ass essment (HRA) and supporting documents .  
7. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
within any relevant community -led plans and local needs.

 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 178 
  Explanation  
5.29.  The Community Hubs of Bucknell and Clun, the Community Clusters of Abcot, 
Beckjay, Clungunford, Hopton Heath, Shelderton and Twitchen (Three 
Ashes); and Aston on Clun, Hopesay, Broome, Horderley, Beambridge , Long 
Meadow End, Rowton, and Round Oak and much of the wider rural area of 
the Bishop’s Castle Place Plan area are within the River Clun Catchment. The 
extent of the River Clun Catchment is illustrated within Figure DP13 .1. 
5.30.  Part of the River Clun is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) notified solely 
for the presence of Freshwater Pearl Mussels. The Habitat Regulation 
Assessment (HRA) for this Local Plan show s that development in the River 
Clun catchment is likely to have an adverse effect on the River Clun SAC. 
There are currently no mitigation measures which would remove this effect, 
but this is not to say that they will not come forward during the Local Pla n 
period.  
5.31.  Accordingly, to comply with the requirements of the Habitat Regulations and in 
accordance with Policy DP13  of this Local Plan, development in these areas 
is restricted to that which is either nutrient neutral in terms of its effect on the 
SAC or results in a betterment, in anticipation of measures to achieve either of 
these criteria being found in the future. Further information is available in the 
Habitats Regulations Assessment of this Local Plan.   
5.32.  Part of Bucknell and all of Clun are within the Shropshire Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The highest and most sensitive design 
standards will be sought for all forms of new deve lopment to minimise any 
adverse effects on the environment, landscape and recreational opportunities 
in line with Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP16  and DP17 . Guidance on how 
new development can conserve and en hance the distinctive characteristics of 
the town and its surroundings is provided in the AONB Management Plan.  
 
Community Hubs  
5.33.  There are four Community Hubs in the Bishop’s Castle Place Plan Area : 
Bucknell, Chirbury , Clun and Worthen and Brockton.  
5.34.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of each 
Community Hubs residential  development guideline.  Appendix 7 of the Local 
Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the 
Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
5.35.  Bucknell  is located on the southern border of Shropshire , where  the B4367 
passes into  Herefordshire to join the A 4113  before it quickly pass es over the 
Welsh Border into Powys  and links to the adj acent principal town of Knighton. 
Bucknell is an important service centre for local communities in the 
surrounding rural areas of these three Count ies. Bucknell’s significance is also 
enhanced by its operational rail station linking with other rural stations in 
Shropshire and the principal station at Knighton.  
5.36.  The provision of land for de velopment in Bucknell is affected by the cen tre 
and west of the village being within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty (AONB), the presence of the Conservation Area with its former 
castle site at the historic core of the village and t he importance of areas of 
open land within the village to the established character of the settlement.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 179 
  5.37.  As a Community Hub in the SAMDev Plan, Bucknell already provides planned 
development on an existing allocation  (BUCK001) comprising a mixed 
housing and employment redevelopment on a largely redundant brownfield 
site at the southern edge of the village. Although development has been 
delayed at BUCK001  to protect the Special Area for Conservation in the River 
Clun, from rising phosphate levels, there is a need to continue to support the 
sustainable growth of Bucknell .  
5.38.  The strategy for  Bucknell is to meet the needs of the local communities whilst 
recogn ising its landscape and historic significance by extending the village to 
the east into countryside away from the AONB  and Conservation Area . The 
release of part of this larger  greenfield land  parcel at BKL008a , adjoinin g the 
contemporary Redlake Meadow development , will permit new housing to be 
delivered quickly when issues affecting development in the River Clun 
catchment are resolved.  Bucknell will also make a small allowance for 
windfall development in the remainder of the village . 
5.39.  Chirbury is  an accessible village on the junction of the A490 from Welshpool 
(north -west) and the B4386 , close to the Welsh Border with Powys. The 
B4386 provides a western link into Powys, to serve the principal town of 
Montgomery.  The A490 provides a southern link to Church Stoke on the A489 
between Craven Arms (Shropshire) and Newtown (Powys). Chirbury provid es 
a range of services to complement  the town of Montgomery and  the small 
communities around  the border between  Shropshire an d Powys .  
5.40.  The saved SAMDev residential allocation for up to 30 dwellings will be 
compleme nted by two further allocations with a combined capacity for up to 
14 dwellings.   Chirbury is an historic settlement with a significant Conservation 
Area that includes most of the village with Scheduled Monuments to the north 
and west. Development of the allocated sites should respect the historic 
character of Chirbury and not adversely affect the historic assets in the village.  
5.41.  Clun is located in the south -west of Shropshire , on the junction of the B4368 
with the A488 where it provides a key bridging point over the River Clun close 
to the Welsh Border with Powys. The town  serves the remote border 
communities of this area known as the ‘Clun Forest ’.  
5.42.  Clun is historic ally significan t due to the presence of the Castle, evidence of 
historic settlement and the historic assets, medieval street pattern and 
archaeology that comprise the Conservation Area within and extending 
beyond the town. The physical location and historic significance of Clun 
makes it an attractive place to live and drives demand for housing.  
5.43.  As a Community Hub  in the SAMDev Plan , Clun already provides planned 
development  on an existing allocation (C LUN002) at Turnpike Meadow, in the 
east of the t own. Although development has been delayed here to protect the 
Special Area for Conservation  in the River Clun, there is a need to continue to 
support the potential for sustainable growth of  Clun.   
5.44.  The strategy for Clun is to meet the needs of the  local c ommunities a nd 
protect the landscape and historic sig nificance  of the town by extending the 
existing allocation (CLUN002) further east along Turnpike Meadow , through 
the releas e of adjacent land at CLU005 and to make a small allowance for 
windfall development in the remainder of the town.  These developments will 
be able to come forward quickly when issues affecting development in the 
River Clun catchment are resolved  and development proposals should be 
considered with reference to the Clun Design St atement . Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 180 
  5.45.  Worthen and Brockton are located close to the Welsh border on the B4386 . 
These two settlements are on the junction with the B4499 that links to the 
town of Minsterley (Shropshire) to the south -east. Worthen and Brockton  
comprise two adjacent and loosely connected villages with clearly separate 
characters and identities , but which benefit from a number of shared services 
and facilities . The two villages are identified  as a single Community Hub due 
to these shared services and facilities.  
5.46.  Two Local Plan residential allocations have been identified to meet the needs 
of the Community Hub, both located in Worthen. Land to the south of the 
B4386 in Worthen offers an important opportunity to deliver much needed 
community  benefits through the provision of a footway  as part of the 
development. Proposals for land to the east of Worthen must take account of 
community concerns about highway safety  and surface water drainage  by 
provid ing improvements wherever possible.  
5.47.  Importan tly, the distribution of development , especially  through  the 
management of small -scale windfall residential  development , will maintain the 
land between the se villages  as a strategic gap between the two settlements, 
consistent with Policy SP8 of this Local Plan .  
 
Community Clusters   
5.48.  There are five Community Clusters i n the Bishop’s Castle Place Plan Area  
which are identif ied in Settlement Policy S2.3.  Development in these 
Community Clusters will be managed through Policy SP9 of this Local Plan.  
5.49.  The village of Lydbury North is a Community Cluster with four saved SAMDev 
Residential Allocations to deliver  up to 20 dwellings in the period to 2038.  
These sites are loc ated in the east of the village , comprising  a group of three 
adjacent sites to the south -east for up to 15 dwellings and a single site to the 
north -east for up to 5 dwellings. Th is range of  sites are capable of providing a 
mix of dwelling types and sizes t o accommodate a broad range  of ho using 
needs and demands , but their proximity to the Conservation Area including 
the listed Church of St Michael’s and All Angels requires a sensitive  design of 
dwellings to respect the historic c haracter  of the village.  
5.50.  New Community  Clusters can be brought forward by communities through the 
Neighbourhood Plan process.  
 
Wider Rural Area  
5.51.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is classified as ‘countryside’ for planning policy 
purposes, where new development is st rictly controlled in accordance with 
Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Plan and national policy.

S3.1.  Development Strategy: Bridgnorth Principal  Centre  
1. Bridgnorth will fulfil its role as the second largest Principal Centre and contribute 
towards strategic growth objectives in the east of the County, delivering around 1,800 
dwellings and making available around 49ha of employment land  to create choice and 
competition in the market . New housing and employment will make provision for the 
needs of the town and surrounding hinterland, including attracting inward investment  
and allowing existing businesses to expand.   
2. Bridgnorth is bounded on its eastern side by the Green Belt. Development proposals in 
the Green Belt must be in accordance with National and Local policies on Green Belt, 
which specify the development types and the circumstances when development may be 
acceptable.  They must also comply with all other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
3. A comprehensive mixed use sustainable urban extension will contribute to new 
residential and employment development guidelines, whilst also delivering new 
community facilit ies within a new local centre and significant areas of open space .  
4. New residential development will also be delivered through the saved SAMDev mixed 
use and residential allocations; appropriate windfall residential development within the 
Bridgnorth develo pment boundary,  shown on the Policies Map , where it is consistent 
with relevant policies of this Local Plan ; appropriate cross -subsidy development outside 
the Green Belt and where it is consistent with rele vant policies of this Local Plan; and 
appropriate exception development where it is consistent with Green Belt Policy  SP11  
and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5. New employment development will also be delivered through extensions to the 
successful Stanmore Industrial Estate and the saved SAMDev employment allocations , 
of which around 6.6 hectares is for the relocation of the existing Livestock Market.  This 
will be  complemented by any appropriate windfall employment development , where it  is 
consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
6. Existing employment land at Bridgnorth Aluminium campus, Faraday Drive, Stanmore 
Industrial Estate and Stanley Lane as shown  on the Policies Map will be safeguarded  for 
business and industrial uses. Development on these safeguarded employment sites will 
be in accordance with  Policy  SP13 . 
7. Retail provided within the village centre of the mixed use sustainable urban extension 
Local Plan allocation  and the neighbourhood centre of the saved SAMDev mixed use 
allocation will complement and not negatively impact on the viability of the town centre. 
All other n ew retail development will be directed towards the town centre  in line with 
Policy DP9, where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town.  
8. To provide certainty about the ability to meet future development needs, a n area of land 
beyond the Bridgnorth development boundary has been identified as a potential future 
direction of growth , beyond the current Local Plan period. This land remains open 
countryside  and its future development is dependent on its allocation with in a future 
Local Plan . This land is set out in Schedule S3.1(iii) and identified on the Policies Map.  
9. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site allocations are identif ied in Schedules 
S3.1(i) and S3.1(ii) below and identified on the Policies Map. Development of site 
allocations should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and 
approximate site provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Loc al Plan .  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 182

Bridgnorth’s character.  
The development of this site will be in accordance with a 
vision , design c ode and masterplan which will be prepared 
in consultation with the public and adopted as a 
Supplementary Planning Document by Shropshire Council . 
This will represent a significant material planning 
consideration  and must be completed  before any planning 
application  for development of the site . 
A construction management plan will be prepared to inform 
the development of the site.  
The quality, design, mix and layout of housing provided on 
the site will be informed by site constraints and 
opportunities, ident ified local needs , the need  for local 
employer and key worker  housing , and relevant policies of 
this Local Plan.  
Development should seek  to maximise the energy efficiency 
of all buildings, including through such measures as high 
levels of insulation; maxi mising airtightness; and harvesting 
the sun's energy through south -facing windows . It is also 
strongly encouraged to  include zero -carbon development  
and to offset carbon emissions through investment in carbon 
capture and storage . 
At least 10% of the energy  required within this development 
will be generated from on -site renewable and low carbon 
energy sources. Op portunities  to support community energy 
generation and integrate  district heating and cooling 
systems, especially where these utilise renewable energy , 
should be explored.  
Employment provision will represent an intrinsic element of 
the development, occurring alongside  and cross -subsidised 
by the provision of housing.  
Employment land will be  located in a gateway location  on 
the site and be of a high -quality design and layout. It 
provides an opportunity for freehold employment land  
targeted towards office and research and development uses .

Schedule S3.1(iii).  Potential Future Direction of Growth  
 
Location  Site Area  
Land west of Tasley Garden Village, Bridgnorth  41.5ha  
 
Explanation  
5.52.  Bridgnorth is an attractive historic market town located in the east of 
Shropshire  at the junction of the A458 and A442 . The town straddles the River 
Severn and comprises Low Town to the east and High Town to the west, 
perched on cliffs 100ft above. The West Midlands Green  Belt wraps around 
the town’s eastern development boundary.  
5.53.  As the second largest Principal Centre in Shropshire , Bridgnorth offers 
extensive services and facilities to both its residents and those living within i ts 
large rural hinterland. The nature and s cale of future development recognises :  
a. The strategic role that Bridgnorth play s in east Shropshire ;  
b. The importance of meeting the residential and employment needs of the 
town and its surrounding hinterland;  
c. The low levels of residential completions achieved within the town over a 
number of years which has exacerbated local need;  
d. The opportunity  to strengthen the towns economic role – providing sites for  
existing businesses to expand and to attract new businesses to the town ; 
e. The opportuni ty to help deliver a better balance between housing and 
employment in Bridgnorth, and  
f. The potential to provide additional local employment opportunities to 
reduce the need to commute out of the town for work.  
5.54.  To this end, a residential development guideli ne has been identified which 
recognises the urban focus which forms part of the strategic approach within 
this Local Plan and will allow for the needs of the residents of this town and its 
surrounding rural hinterland to be achieved.  
5.55.  Furthermore, sufficien t employment land has been provided to cater  for the 
employment needs of existing and new residents of the town and support the 
employment needs of communities in the town’s rural hinterland. Crucially, it Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 187 
  will also enable choice and competition within the  market and recognises the 
diverse needs of different employers  – those already within the town and its 
hinterland with aspirations for further expansion, those who may wish to start -
up in the area and those who may wish to relocate to the town.  
5.56.  As such , the Local Plan allocates a significant mixed -use sustainable urban 
extension to the south -west of the town  outside design ated Green Belt . The 
mix of uses on the site will include substantial housing and employment . To 
ensure the sustainability of this development it will include measures that 
recognise site specific factors such as physical, heritage and ecology 
constraints. It will also provide extensive and attractive pedestrian and cycle 
facilities to and through the site and importantly from the site into the existing 
built form of Bridgnorth. Opportunities to access public transport will also be 
integrated into the development and the potential to operate a dedicated park 
and ride service will be investigated in partnership with appropriate local 
community groups and bus operators. The site will also be supported by a 
new local centre with a range of retail and community uses, a new primary 
school  and, if required by the CCG , a new medical centre , together with 
extensive green infrastructure, including a new linear park, to provide for the 
needs of the residents and increase self -containment.  
5.57.  Development of this site will make a significant contribution to the housing and 
employment needs of the town and comply with the principles of a ‘garden 
village’. Importantly, t he development will be informed by a vision, design 
code and masterplan which will be adopted as a Supplementary Planning 
Document by Shropshire Council. Appendix 6 of the Local Plan provides 
information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan 
allocation s. 
5.58.  A cohesive and comprehensive development of the saved  SAMDev Plan 
allocations (BRID020a, BRID020b, ELR011/a, ELR011/b) , accessed by a new 
roundabout on the A458, will also  contribute to meeting the housing and 
employment needs within the town . Specifically :  
a. BRID020a and BRID020b will be developed for  a range of dwelling types , 
including retirement or supported housing , and a hotel. This will be 
supported by the provision of public open space and a new neighbourhood 
centre providing such facilities as  a petrol station with small convenience 
store, day care, h ealth & fitness facilities.  
b. The Livestock Market will be relocated to the saved SAMDev Plan 
employment allocation ELR011/b. This allocation is specifically for the 
relocation of this Livestock Market and will only be released for this and  its 
associated uses. Should the Livestock Market close permanently, the land 
will be reserved for future employment uses  only, in accordance with Policy 
SP13 .  
c. The development of the saved SAMDev Plan employment allocation 
ELR011/a for a business park comprising offices, industrial and 
warehousing uses.  
5.59.  It should be noted that  the allocations ELR011/a and ELR011/b , include a 
generous allowance (over 6ha) for landscaping and sustainable drainage, with 
a net developable area of 6.7ha and 6.6ha respectively. Landscaping and 
drainage will be detailed at planning application stage.  
5.60.  Stanmore Industrial Estate is located t o the east of Bridgnorth, inset within the 
Green Belt. Recognising the local importance and success of Stanmore 
Industrial Estate and the limited amount of land currently available for its Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 188 
  expansion , two extensions, totalling around 11. 5ha are allocated . These 
allocations are  specifically for employment uses to allow the expansion of 
Stanmore Industrial Estate.  This land was located within the Green Belt prior 
to their identification as employment allocations  within this Local Plan . 
5.61.  This employment provisio n will be supported by the protection of existing 
employment areas within and adjoining the town at Bridgnorth Aluminium, 
Faraday Drive, the remainder of Stanmore Industrial Estate and Stanley Lan e.   
5.62.  Due to the scale of development proposed, it  is essenti al that appropriate 
improvements to the highway network are undertaken in order to support this 
development and mitigate any impact. To inform these improvements a 
strategic assessment of the highway network will be undertaken. This will be 
supported by si te specific highway assessments for the site allocations.  
5.63.  Furthermore, it is important  that development takes account of other known 
critical infrastructure constraints and requirements, as identified within the 
Implementation Plan and Place Plan.  
5.64.  As such , development should be phased appropriately to take account of 
critical infrastructure delivery  and seek to positively contribute towards local 
infrastructure improvements, including the provision of community benefits.  
5.65.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provides information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery 
of Bridgnorth’s residential and employment deve lopment guideline s.  
  
S3.2.  Community Hubs: Bridgnorth Place Plan Area  
1. Within the Bridgnorth Place Plan Area, two Community Hub settlements have been 
identified. These settlements and their residential development guidelines are listed 
below:  
Community Hub Settlements  Residential Guideline  
Alveley  Around 130 dwellings

2. Within these Community Hub s, new residential development will be delivered through 
any identified s aved SAMDev residential allocations; identified Local Plan residential 
allocations; appropriate  small -scale windfall residential development within the 
settlements development boundary, as shown on the Policies Map, where it is 
consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant policies of this Local 
Plan; and appropriate exception development where it is consistent with Community 
Hub Policy SP8 and othe r relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
3. Within these  Community Hub s, new employment development will be delivered through 
appropriate small -scale windfall employment development within the settlements 
development boundary, as shown on the Policies Map, where it is consistent with 
Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant pol icies of this Local Plan.  
4. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations within these Community Hubs are listed in 
Appendix 2  of this document and identified on the Policies Map.  Local Plan site 
allocations within these Community Hubs are identified in Schedule S3.2(i) below and 
identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance 
with specified development guidelines and approximate site provisio n figures and all 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 189 
  5. Ditton Priors is  partly located within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB). Development proposals must recognise the importance of conserving 
and where possible enhan cing, the special qualities of the Shropshire Hills AONB as set 
out in the AONB Management Plan and should be in accordance with Poli cy DP24  and 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan. Particular care should be taken with the design 
and layout of development in accordance with Polic y SP5. 
6. Alveley is inset in Green Belt . Development proposals in the Green Belt and on 
safeguarded land must be in accordance with National Policy and  Policy SP11  of this 
Local Plan , which specify the development types and the circumstances when 
development may be acceptable.  They must also comply with all other relevant policies 
of this Local Plan.  
7. To provide long -term locations for growth in Alveley, an area of l and beyond the Al veley  
development boundary is safeguarded for Al veley ’s future development needs  beyond 
the current Local Plan period. This land is set out in Schedule S 3.2(ii) and identified on 
the Policies Map . Safeguarded land is not allocated  for development at the present time,  
but has been safeguarded as a location which could meet  future development need  
through allocation in a future Local Plan . 
8. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
within any relevant community -led plans and local needs.

S3.4.  Wider Rural Are a: Bridgnorth  Place Plan Area  
1. The Saved SAMDev  Plan mineral allocation within the wider rural area of the Bridgnorth 
Place Plan Area  is listed in Appendix 2  of this document and identified on the Policies 
Map. This allocation for the extension to the existing quarry at Morville  will help to 
maintain an adequate and steady supply of sand and gravel during the Plan period in 
accordance with  the established production requirements. Development of this site 
allocation should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and 
approximate site provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
 
 
Explanation  
Community Hubs  
5.66.  There are two Community  Hubs, Alveley and Ditton Priors, identified in the 
Bridgnorth Place Plan Area. The Local Plan provides for new allocations  in 
both settlements as  shown in Schedule S3.2(i) with the previous allocation in 
Ditton Priors  saved  from the SAMDev Plan shown in Appendix 2 of this Local 
Plan. 
5.67.  Alveley is a large village inset in the Green Belt with the Green Belt around it 
being defined by its development boundary. The village was inset in the 
Green Belt but not identified as a location for planned development in the 
SAMDev Plan . The village was identified as a Community Hub through this 
Plan’s settlement hierarchy assessment process  and considered as part of 
Green Belt review.  Following review, the Green  Belt boundary  has been 
amended as part of this Plan to provide for a housing site and a mixed -use 
site with housing and sports and recreation elements. An area of land, to the 
north of the village and adjoining the mixed -use allocation, has  also been 
identified as safeguarded lan d to meet potential development needs beyond 
the Plan period. It is expected that if safeguarded land is allocated for 
development within a future Local Plan, it will provide compensatory 
improvements to wider Green Belt.  Additionally , there is a separate area  to Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 193 
  the west of Alveley village, known as Alveley Industrial Estate , which is inset 
in the Green Belt.  
5.68.  Ditton Priors has continued to be identified as a Community Hub settlement 
which  is partly located within the Shropshire Hills AONB.  A new  housing 
allocation has been identified for the village outside  the AONB which provides  
scope  for improved access and parking for the adjoining primary school.  
5.69.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide s information on the levels of residential 
completions achi eved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of each 
Community Hubs residential development guideline.  Appendix 7 of the Local 
Plan provides information on the anticipated t imeframe for the delivery of the 
Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
 
Community Clusters  
5.70.  There is one  Community Cluster in the Bridgnorth Place Plan area , this is 
Neenton Community Cluster , reflecting local aspirations to maintain or 
enhance the su stainability of these identified settlements through modest 
levels of appropriate development. Development  within th is Community 
Clusters will be managed in accordance with Policy SP9 (Community 
Clusters).  New Community  Clusters may be brought forward by communities 
through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.71.  The villages of Claverley and Worfield which are within  the Bridgnort h Place 
Plan area have not been identified as either Community Hubs or Community 
Clusters but have historically been  inset within  the Green Belt and countryside 
policy therefore applies to the inset area.  
5.72.  The rest of the Place Plan Area remains as either Green Belt or as 
‘countryside’ for planning policy purposes, where new development is strictly 
controlled in accordance with Policy SP11  (where the location is Green Belt) 
and SP10  (Countryside ) and the  other relevant polic ies within this Local Plan 
and national policies.  
 
Saved SAMDev Minerals Allocation  
5.73.  Polic ies SP16 , DP30  and DP31  set out detailed policy regarding sites for sand 
and gravel working. The ext ension to Morville Quarry will support the 
comprehensive working of mineral resources at a well -established existing 
quarry with good access to local markets.

employment allocation;  any employment development allocated within the Broseley 
Neighbourhood Plan ; appropriate expansion of existing businesses, where they are well 
located and well suited to employment use and are consistent with relevant policies of 
this Local Plan and the Broseley Neighbourhood Plan ; and any other appropriate small -
scale employment windfall deve lopment where it  is consistent with relevant policies of 
this Local Plan and the Broseley Neighbourhood Plan.  
5. New retail development will be directed towards the town centre  in line with Policy DP9, 
where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town . 
6. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance 
with specified development guidelines and approximate site provision figures and all 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development prop osals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within the Broseley Neighbourhood Plan , any other relevant community -led 
plans and any masterplans that are adopted by Shropshire Council.  
 
Explanation  
5.74.  Broseley is located in the east of Shropshire, between the towns Bridgnorth 
and Telford and close to the Former Ironbridge Power Station strategic 
Settlement. The tow n extends along a broad ridge for about a mile on the 
southern side of the Ironbridge Gorge World Heri tage Site.  
5.75.  Broseley is an historic settlement containing a large Conservation Area and 
many listed buildings. It is also in proximity of other significant heritage and 
environmental assets, including the aforementioned Ironbridge Gorge World 
Heritage Site; Severn Gor ge Conservation Area; ancient woodland; and 
several designated wildlife sites.  
5.76.  The town was prominent in the early industrial revolution, which has resulted 
in a significant mining and smelting heritage, but also has implications for 
ground conditions. Th e unplanned growth, narrow lanes and streets formed 
during this period is an intrinsic part of its character.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 195 
  5.77.  The nature and scale of development within the Local Plan is designed to 
maintain and enhance Broseley’s role as a Key Centre and ensure that loca l 
housing need is achieved, whilst also respecting the location of the town and 
the constraints present.  
5.78.  A Neighbourhood Plan is at an advanced stage of preparation for the Broseley 
Town Council area, including the Key Centre of Broseley. When adopted (or 
‘made’) the Neighbourhood Plan will establish the long -term delivery strategy 
to achieve the housing and employment guidelines for the Key Centre of 
Broseley.  Should the Neighbourhood Plan propose site allocations and 
alterations to the development boundar y the Policies map will be amended to 
reflect these changes.  
5.79.  Appendix 5 and 6 of this Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Local 
Plan period and commitments available within Broseley, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment development 
guideline s. Appendix 7 of this Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations .   
5.80.  Broseley  has a number of employment sites, many of which are thriving and 
as such will be protected for employment purposes and appropriate their 
growth supported.  
5.81.  Development in Broseley will be expected to meet the policies and guidelines 
contained in the Brose ley Neighbourhood Plan  and any other future community -
led plan or masterplan that is adopted by Shropshire Council.  
5.82.  All development will also need to take account of known critical infrastructure 
constraints and requirements, as identified within the Implementation Plan, 
Broseley Place Plan and Broseley Neighbourhood Plan.  
 
S4.2.  Community Hubs: Broseley  Place Plan Area  
1. There are no Community Hubs within the Broseley Place Plan Area.  
 
S4.3.  Community Clusters: Broseley  Place Plan Area  
1. There are no Community Clusters within the Broseley  Place Plan Area.  
 
S4.4.  Wider Rural Area: Broseley Place Plan Area  
1. There are no saved SAMDev Plan site allocations or Local Plan site allocations within 
the wider rural area of the Broseley Place Plan Area.  
 
Explanation  
5.83.  No settlements within the Broseley Place Plan Area have been identified as 
Community Hubs. Furthermore, no settlements have opted -in as Community 
Clusters.  However, new Community  Clusters can be brought forward by 
communities through the Neighbourhood Plan process . 
5.84.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is therefore classified as ‘countryside’ for 
planning policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in 
accordance with Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Plan 
and national polic y. Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 196 
  S5. Church Stretton Plan Area  
 
S5.1.  Development Strategy: Church Stretton Key Centre  
1. Church Stretton is located within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB). Development proposals must recognise the importance of conserving 
and where possible enhancing, the special qualities of th e Shropshire Hills AONB as set 
out in the AONB Management Plan and should be in accordance with Polic y DP24  and 
other relevant policies of this Local Plan. Particular care should be taken with the design 
and layout of development in accordance with Polic ies SP1, SP5 and other relevant 
policies of this Local Plan . 
2. Chur ch Stretton will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth 
objectives in the south of the County , provi ding of around 2 00 dwellings and around 2 
hectares of employment development.  New housing and employment development will 
respond to local needs.  
3. New residential development will be delivered through the saved SAMDev residential 
allocation ; appropriate small -scale windfall residential development within the Church 
Stretton  development boundary  shown on the Policies Map; and a ppropriate cross -
subsidy and exception development where it is consistent with relevant policies of this 
Local Plan.  
4. New employment development will be delivered through  the saved SAMDev 
employment allocation; appropriate expansion of existing businesses, where they are 
well located and well suited to employment use and development proposals are 
consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan; and any other appropriate small -
scale employment windfall development within the Church Stretton development 
boundary  shown on the Policies Map,  where it  is consistent with relevant policies of this 
Local Plan.  
5. New retail development will be directed towards the town  centre , in line with Policy DP9, 
where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town . 
6. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance 
with specified development guidelines , approximate site provision figures and all other 
relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development proposa ls will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within relevant community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by 
Shropshire Council.  
 
Explanation  
5.85.  Church Stretton lies entirely within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty (AONB) as does much of the remainder of the Church Stretton 
Place Plan Area. To the west of the town, the Long Mynd is a Site of Special 
Scientific Interest and th e Town Council’s Coppice Leasowes Local Nature 
Reserve is situated to either side of the A49 just north of the town centre. 
There are Scheduled Monuments at Nover’s Hill to the north and Brockhurst 
to the south.  Good stands of a ncient woodland occur on the west slope of 
Helmeth  hill, the south slope of Ragleth hill , the east slope of the Long Mynd 
south of Rectory Wood and to the  north west of Brock hurst. Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 197 
  5.86.  The Old Rectory to the south west of the town centre is an historic designe d 
landscape of at least regional significance. Woodlands, some of which are 
ancient, and trees provide an important and attractive setting for the town and 
many are protected by individual and group Tree Preservation Orders.  
5.87.  The high -quality environment  contributes to the attractive character of the 
town and is valued by residents and v isitors. However, it does provide a 
significant constraint to development . Additionally , the valley floor is 
constrained by flood risk , there are groundwater protection zones  1, 2 and 3 in 
the vicinity of the schools and much of the town centre lies within  a 
Conservation Area. The separation of the two smaller settlements of All 
Stretton and Little Stretton from Church Stretton is greatly valued by the 
community.  
5.88.  However, it is important to note that Church Stretton  plays an important role in 
south Shropshire,  provid ing services and facilities for a wide rural hinterland 
and as such has been identified as a Key Centre .  
5.89.  The nature and scale of future development within the Local Plan is designed 
to maintain and enhance the settlement’s role as a Key Centre and provide for 
the needs of the community and that of its wider hinterland, whilst also 
recognising the towns location within a nationally designated landscape a nd 
the other natural and historic environment assets present.   
5.90.  The highest and most sensitive design standards will be sought for all forms of 
new development to minimise any adverse effects on the environment, 
landscape and recreational opportunities in l ine with Policies DP12 , DP14 , 
DP15 , DP16  and DP17 . Guidance on how new development can conserve 
and enhance the distinctive ch aracteristics of the town and its surroundings is 
provided in the AONB Management Plan, the Town Design Statement , the 
Conservation Area Design Guide  and other community led plans such as the 
Shop Front Design Guide.  
5.91.  To ensure that new development meets lo cal housing needs, the type, size 
and tenure of housing provided within new development should reflect local 
evidence in accordance with Policy DP1 (Residential M ix), DP3 (Affordable 
Housing  Provision ) and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5.92.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Church Stretton , which will 
contribute towards the delivery of the town’s residential  and employment 
development guideline s.

1. There are no saved SAMDev Plan site allocations or Local Plan site allocations within 
the wider rural area of the Church Stretton Place Plan Area.  
 
Explanation  
5.93.  No settlements within the Church Stretton Place Plan Area have been 
identified as Community Hubs. Furthermore, no settlements have opted -in as 
Community Clusters.  However, new Community  Clusters can be brought 
forward by communities through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.94.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is therefore classified as ‘countryside’ for

  S6. Cleobury Mortimer Plan Area  
 
S6.1.  Development Strategy: Cleo bury Mortimer  Key Centre  
1. Cleobury Mortimer will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth 
objectives in the south of the County , provi ding around 200 dwellings and around 2 
hectares of employment development  over the plan period . New housing and 
employment development will respond to local needs.  
2. A Neighbourhood Plan is being progressed for the Cleobury Mortimer  Parish area . The 
Neighbourhoo d Plan will include the strategy for achieving the housing and employment 
guidelines for the Key Centre of Cleobury Mortimer .  
3. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the saved SAMDev 
residential allocations and any residential deve lopment allocated within the Cleobury 
Mortimer Neighbourhood Plan. This will be complemented by appropriate small -scale 
windfall residential development within the Cleobury Mortimer development boundary 
shown on the Policies Map, where it is consistent wit h relevant policies of this Local

Explanation  
5.95.  Cleobury Mortimer Town Council are at an advanced stage of their 
Neighbourhood Plan preparation .  When adopted (or ‘made’) th e 
Neighbourhood Plan will establish  the long -term delivery strategy for the town.  
It is therefore only considered necessary for th e Shropshire Local Plan to 
provide the overall strat egy over the plan period by establishing the localised 
housing and employment guidelines  as well as establishing a development 
boundary  for the settlement .  Should the Neighbourhood Plan propose site 
allocations and alterations to the development boundary th e Policies map will 
be amended to reflect these changes.   
5.96.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provides information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of  the Plan 
period and commitments available within Cleobury Mortimer , which will 
contribute towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 200

  S7. Craven Arms Place Plan Area  
 
S7.1.  Development Strategy: Craven Arms Town  
1. Craven Arms is a Key Centre and primary growth point on the A49 trunk road through 
south Shropshire . The town is a principal gateway into the Shropshire Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and a focus for significant development.  
2. Craven Arms will contribute to the strategic growth objectives in the south of the County , 
deliver ing around 500 dwellings and making available around 15 hectares of 
employment land  to create choice and competition in the market . New housing and 
employment will make provis ion for the needs of the town and surrounding hinterland , 
allowing existing businesses to expand  and attract new businesses into the town . 
Development of saved allocations will be in accordance with the guidelines and the site 
provision figures and all rel evant policies of this Local Plan . 
3. Residential  development will be delivered through the saved allocation s compris ing 
greenfield and brownfield sites shown in Appendix 2 and on the Policies Map .  These  
sites will deliver  around 325 dwellings  along with current commitments .  The residential  
allocations comprise  two group s on Watling Street to the west of the town.  To the north  
are two sites located at Greenfield Road (CRAV003 and CRAV009).  To the south  are 
three sites extend ing from Watling Street to Cl un Road (CRAV004, CRAV010 and 
CRAV024). The saved allocations also include land at Newington Farmstead 
(CRAV030)  for key worker accommodation for the proposed new abattoir . 
4. This residential development will be complemented by appropriate small -scale windfall 
development within the development boundary shown on the Policies Map , where it is 
consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan . It will also be complemented by 
cross-subsidy and exception s development  consistent with relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
5. Employment development will be delivered principally through the saved employment 
allocations shown in Appendix 2 and on the Policies Map to deliver around 1 4ha of 
development. The relocation of the Euro Quality Lambs abattoir will create the proposed 
Newington Food Park  (8ha),  as the key employment proposal in the town. The provision 
of a strategic highway junction to this site will also trigger the release of  other saved 
employment allocations  (6ha) to provide a balance between new housing and local 
employment opportunities . Further employment development may be delivered through 
small -scale windfall development, consistent with Policy SP13  of this Local Plan.  
Existing employment areas will be protected in accordance with Policy SP13 . 
6. To support the role of Craven Arms as a key service centre, the current abattoir site on 
Corvedale Road will be the focus for a mixed -use regeneration of the Key Area of 
Change on the Policie s Map. This will focus on improving the retail offer in the town . 
7. Development proposals will address the strategic and local infrastructure requirements 
identified in the Implementation Plan , Craven Arms  Place Plan  and relevant policies of 
this Local Plan . 
8. Development proposals will respond positively to policies and guidelines in the Craven 
Arms Town Plan, community strategies and masterplans adopted by Shropshire 
Council.  
 
 
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 203 
  Explanation  
5.99.  Craven Arms will function as a Key Centre and contribute towards the 
strategic growth objectives in the south of the County. Craven Arms will 
continue to explore ways in which it can effectively implement the ambitious 
growth strategy , supported by the sav ed allocatio ns, in the SAMDev Plan . 
5.100.  A key proposal for the growth and regeneration of Craven Arms is the 
relocation of the Euro Quality Lambs (EQL) abattoir from its existing and 
physically constrained site on Corvedale Road  high street . It is also 
proposed that the high street will be regenerated as a Key Area of Change to 
improve the eastern gateway into the town and to better meet the needs of 
the community . 
5.101.  The relocation of EQL to its new site 8ha site , to be known as Newington 
Food Park Farm, is the key proposal for the growth and regeneration of 
Craven Arms and its local economy. Newington Food Park will provide a 
new strategic junction onto the A49 to accommodate the modern abattoir 
and processing complex with the subsequent addition of furthe r ‘value -
added’ processing operations to increase production and diversify the 
business enterprise. This  new abattoir will be located to the north of the town 
and developed over time , providing new cold storage warehousing, HGV 
delivery and distribution facilities, car parking and facilities for employees 
and visitors and appropriate bio -security measures.  
5.102.  The EQL relocation and the provision of the new strategic junction onto the 
A49 will consolidate employment opportunities around the existing and 
successful Craven Arms Business Park on Long Lane. The Business Park 
will soon reach full capacity and an opportunity to create a Phase 2 
development is available on a 3.5 hectare site to the north of Long Lane. The 
new strategic junction to Newing ton Food Park on the A49 will also trigger 
the release of a new employment site for 2.5 hectares on the west of the 
A49, adjoining the rail line and the Business Park.  
5.103.  The allocated site for Phase 2 of Craven Arms Business Park is separated 
from the A49 by  the Shrewsbury to Cardiff rail line and the Long Lane level 
crossing. This is the proposed location for an automated level crossing with 
longer closure times likely to affect the functioning of the A49 at its junction 
with Long Lane.  It is a  further objec tive of the strategy for Craven Arms, that 
that the strategic junction on the A49 should facilitate a new northern 
highway linking the A49 trunk road to the proposed developments on Long 
Lane (north) and  also to Watling Street (west) to improve communicati ons in 
the town.  
5.104.  The new northern highway must bridge the rail line to facilitate the closure of 
the Long Lane level crossing. This new northern highway would link the 
A49/Newington Food Park to the other two saved employment allocations 
and to saved housing allocations along Watling Street.  
5.105.  Housing sites to accommodate around 325 new dwellings will help to deliver 
the growth aspirations for Craven Arms. The  saved all ocations include a 
series of sites to the east of Watling Str eet with the potential to by -pass the 
Long Lane level crossing though the proposed northern highway. The sites 
will provide significant new market and affordable housing to meet local 
needs in the town and in the Craven Arms Place Plan area.  
5.106.  To assist the operation of the proposed Newington Food Park, it is proposed 
to allocate Newington Farmstead for a small residential conversion of the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 204 
  historical farm buildings for around 5 new dwellings to accommodate key 
workers employed at the Food Park. This will enable the demolition of 
unsympathetic modern outbuildings to reveal the historic character of the 
Farmstead .  The significant historic buildings will then be redeveloped to 
enhance their appearance and conserve their architectural interest.  
5.107.  In addition to the saved allocations, there are other opportunities for the 
development of windfall sites within the development boundary .  An 
allowance of around 90 dwellings has been made for this purpose. This 
allowance will ensure the delivery of aroun d 500 new dwellings in Craven 
Arms to 203 8. 
5.108.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Craven Arms which will c ontribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment development 
guideline s.  Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocat ions.

Explanation  
5.124.  Highley lies to the south -east of Shropshire, seven miles south of Bridgnorth 
and within commuting distance of Kidderminster. It is a linear settlement, 
spread over a mile along the B4555 on a ridge above the River Severn. The 
river lies to the east of the  town and separates it from the A442 and Alveley 
to the east, apart from a footbridge that provides pedestrian access.  The 
town has a mining heritage which has implications for ground stability and 
contamination in some locations.  
5.125.  The nature and scale of development within the Local Plan is designed to 
maintain and enhance Highley’s role as a Key Centre and ensure that local 
housing need is achieved, whilst also recognising the constraints that exist.  
5.126.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Highley  which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment development 
guideline s.  Append ix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocat ions.   
5.127.  It is important that development takes account of known critical infrastructure 
constraints and requirements, particularly highways which is a known local 
concern, as identified within the Implementation Plan and Highley Place Plan.  
 
S9.2.  Community Hubs: Highley Place Plan Area  
1. There are no Community Hubs within the Highley  Place Plan Area.

1. There are no Community Clusters within the Highley Place Plan Area.  
 
S9.4.  Wider Rural Area: Highley Place Plan Area  
1. There are no saved SAMDev Plan site allocations or Local Plan site allocations within 
the wider rural area of the Highley Place Plan Area.  
 
Explanation  
5.128.  No settlements within the Highley Place Plan Area have been identified as 
Community Hubs. Furthermore, no settlements have opted -in as Community 
Clusters.  However, new Community  Clusters can be brought forward by 
communities through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.129.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is therefore classified as ‘countryside’ for 
planning policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in

Explanation  
5.130.  Ludlow is a principal Market Town with a key role in the strategic growth 
objectives for south Shropshire . Ludlow Town Council established  their 
commit ment to these objectives in Ludlow Future (Community Plan 2017 –
2022), to deliver  sustainable development and satisfy  the needs of their 
residents . These objectives are supported by the detailed description of the 
characteristics and opportunities of Ludlow in the Market  Town Profile 
available at : https:/ /shropshire.gov.uk/information -intelligence -and-
insight/facts -and-figures/area -profiles/market -town -profiles/ . 
5.131.  Ludlow will explore ways to implement an ambitious growth strategy in the 
Local Plan . This is supported by the Ludlow Economic Growth Strategy 
published in draft at: www.shropshire.gov.uk/media/14576/ludlow -legs.pdf .  
Together they r ecognise that Ludlow is the third largest employment centre 
in Shropshire  and the main location for businesses and jobs in the south  of 
the County.  The strategy is ambitious in its approach to economic growth, to 
attract inward investment and sustain  Ludlow’s individuality, identity, sk ills 
and its important and significant  cultural and historic heritage.  
5.132.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Ludlow, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and emp loyment development 
guideline s.  Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocat ions.  
5.133.  The SAMDev  Plan established two allocations at Rocks Green and Sheet 
Road to develop  an eastern extension to Ludlow but located in the 
neighbouring Ludford  Parish , east of the A49 trunk roa d that by-pass es the 
town. The housing supply is also augmented by two large appeal  sites for 
housing at Bromfield Road (north) and Foldgate Lane (south) . 
5.134.  The housing requirement for Ludlow is a significant provision for 1,000 
dwellings. The scale of committed development  leaves only a nominal Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 218 
  requirement for new housing  in the Local Plan . This will be met  from two 
brownfield land releases with further windfall development. This 
development must  be designed to respect the historic character of Ludlow 
using good contemporary design that provide s an appropriate scale and 
form of landscaping, open space and car parking.  Any further expansion into 
Ludford Parish is  deferred to  focus on the delivery of housing in the town . 
5.135.  The rate of housing development in Ludlow has been lower than anticipated 
for some time despite the se significant commitments. The Council will 
require landowners and developers with  commit ted sites to bring  their land to 
development and provide housing to meet the needs of the town particularly 
‘entry level’ and family dwellings  with a choice of ‘age specif ic’ housing. 
5.136.  The employment needs of Ludlow will be met by extending the existing 
allocation south of Sheet Road from 3.5 hectares to around 8 hectares. 
These two inter -related sites will significantly improve  Ludlow’s  employment 
land offer and broaden the range of commercial premises  and business 
representation in the town. There is scope for flexibility in the employment 
uses delivered on the allocations , but any flexib ility must respect  the 
significance and setting of this historic town to ensure its history will continue 
to be recognise d and appreciated.  
5.137.  The newly combined employment allocation s will  create a critical mass for 
development in terms of the provision of infrastructure and the suitability for 
larger building footprints. Development must deliver good contemporary 
design with appropriate height, massing, layout, materials, and landscaping  
to respect the sensitivity of the landscape, ecology and heritage assets.  
Development  should also improve  the A49 / Sheet Road junction and deliver  
a suitable access that may also serve the farm operation to the east .  
5.138.  The continuing development of Ludlow a nd the limited intensification of the 
cluster of development around The Sheet will recognise and addre ss the 
infrastructure r equirements of the area identified in the Ludlow Place Plan 
published in draft at: https://shropshire.gov.uk/place -plans/view -the-place -
plans/ . 
5.139.  Key infrastructure issues in Ludlow com prise: Water treatment capacity; the 
need for additional primary school provisi on; further a ffordable housing ; local 
infrastructure investment including sport, recreation and leisure  and 
improvements to tourism infrastructure to promote Ludlow as an important 
tourist destination with international renown for quality , local food and d rink.  
 
S10.2.  Community Hubs: Ludlow Place Plan Area  
1. Within the Ludlow Place Plan Area, a number of Community Hub settlements have been 
identified. These settlements and their residential development guidelines are listed 
below:  
Community Hub Settlements  Residential Guideline  
Burford  Around 190 dwellings  
Clee Hill  Around 75 dwellings  
2. Within these Community Hubs, new residential development will be delivered through 
identified Local Plan residential allocations; appropriate small -scale windfall residential 
development within the settlements  development boundary, as shown on the Policies 
Map, where it is consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant policies 
of this Local Plan; and appropriate cross -subsidy  and exception development where it is Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 219 
  consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
3. Within these Community Hubs, n ew employment development will be delivered through 
appropriate small -scale windfall employment developmen t within  the settlements 
development boundary, as shown on the Policies Map, where it is consistent with 
Community Hub Policy SP8 and other relevant p olicies of this Local Plan.  
4. Clee Hill is located within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB). Development proposals within the AONB must recognise the importance of 
conserving and where possible enhancing, the special qualities o f the Shropshire Hills 
AONB as set out in the AONB Management Plan and should be in accordance with 
Policy DP24  and other relevant policies of this Local Plan. Particular care should be 
taken with the design and layout of development in accordance with Policies SP1, SP5 
and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5. Local Plan site allocations within these Community Hubs are identified in Schedule 
S10.2(i) below and identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations 
should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and approximate site 
provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
6. Development  proposals  will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
within any relevant community -led plans and local needs.

including op en space on south -east quadrant  possibly 
extending beyond the site boundary with an infiltration 
basin or other flood storage measures along the southern 
boundar y will help to manage the drainage of the site.  
The provision of Green Infrastructure and management of 
surface drainage  should  achieve a standard that 
recognises the proximity of the site to the River Teme 
SSSI. The development should link into the  surrounding 
footpath  network particularly the right of way eastwards 
from the proposed open space into the centre of Burford

Explanation  
Community Hubs  
5.140.  Burford is one of two Community Hubs in the Ludlow Place Plan Area and 
was designated as a Community Hub in the SAMDev Plan (2015). Burford is 
located to the  east of the A49 Trunk Road into Herefordshire, on the A456 to 
Kidderminster (Worcestershire) . The town sits at the junction of the A4112 at 
the Teme Bridge  crossing  of the River Teme (SSSI) , into Tenbury Wells  
(Worcestershire).  
5.141.  Burford is an important service centre for local communities in Shropshire 
and in the surrounding rural  areas of the  neighbouring  Counties. Burford 
functions as an extension of the larger town of Tenbury Wells and the ir 
combin ed services gives Burford the larges t range of services of any 
Community Hub s in Shropshire. The particular contribution s made by 
Burford are the availability of employment on the Upper / Lower Teme 
Business  Parks including the branded Kerry Foods factory and the hospital 
and fire station funded by Worcestershire authorities. Although the role and 
function of Burford, in combination wit h Tenbury Wells is significant, the town 
has yet to deliver a scale of development commensurate with its status . The 
SAMDev Plan only provided for infilling and conversion deve lopment and 
developers were reluctant to make available  any new allocated sites in the 
Local Plan.  
5.142.  Three housing allocations are now identified to meet  the range of needs and 
demands in the local and sub -regional housing markets . These sites will 
support the role of Burford and help to promote its function as a k ey 
employment and service centre. The housing guideline for Burford at around 
190 dwellings is ambitious but reflects the considerable potential for Burford 
to accommodate development. This also recognises the implications for Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 223 
  housing delivery in south Shr opshire  arising from  the extensive Shropshire 
Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , where development must comply 
with Policy DP24 . 
5.143.  Clee Hill is the other Community Hub in the Ludlow  Place Plan Area and was 
first identified as a Community Hub in the SAMDev Plan (2015). The village  
lies in the upland s of the Shropshire Hil ls Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty  (AONB) on the m oors below the heights of Titter stone Clee Hill  (533 
metres  / 1,749 feet ) where it provid es a key link south to  Worcestershire and 
Herefordshire . The highest and most sensitive design standards will be 
sought for all forms of new development in Clee Hill to minimise any adverse 
effects on the environment, landscape and recreational opportunities in the 
AONB in line with Policies DP12 , DP14 , DP15 , DP16  and DP17 . Guidance 
on how new development can conserve and enhance the distinctive 
characteristics of the town and its surroundings is provided in the AONB 
Management Plan.  
5.144.  Clee Hill is an important service centre for local communities on the 
moorlands of the A ONB. Clee Hill is located on the A 4117 between Lu dlow 
and Cleobury Mortimer at the junction of the A4214 to Burford on the 
Shropshire border with Tenbury Wells (Worcestershire). The strategy for 
Clee Hill  is to meet the needs of local communities for development and 
infrastructure and to support its community facilities whilst continuing to 
protect the landscape of the AONB, the significance of the historic quarrying 
protected as an SSSI on Titterstone Cle e Hill and the ecological importance 
of the wildlife sites  in the surrounding area .  
5.145.  In the AONB, major development requires evidence of exceptional 
circumstances and this necessitates the provision of planned development in 
the Local Plan, to meet the needs of these local communities . As an existing  
Community Hub, Clee Hill has committed development , and the Local Plan 
make s a further modest  provision for 20 dwellin gs on  a single housing 
allocation in the north -east of the village. There is also a small allowance for 
windfall development within Clee Hill t o support the sustainable growth of the 
village .   
5.146.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of 
Dudleston Heath’s residential d evelopment guideline.  Appendix 7 of the 
Local Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery 
of the Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
5.147.  The village of Onibury lies to the north of Ludlow close to a crossing of the 
Shrewsbur y to Cardiff rail line over the A49  trunk road . Onibury was form erly 
a Community Hub but no longer has this designation because it does not 
support a sufficient range of services. The Local Plan will  continue to  support 
the delivery of the saved housing allocation at Onibury Farm (SAMDev site 
ONBY003) along with cross subsidy and affordable housing scheme s 
around the village . The saved all ocation requires a sympathetic layout and 
design to respect the Conservation Area and a new access from Back L ane. 
Onibury is partly enclosed w ithin the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty (AONB) and any development in Onibury must have regard 
to potential  impact s on the landscape and scenic beauty of the AONB.

  Community Clusters   
5.148.  In the Ludlow Place Plan Area, no settlements opted -in as Community 
Clusters.  However, new Community  Clusters can be brought forward by 
communities through the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.149.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is therefore classified as ‘countryside’ fo r 
planning policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in 
accordance with Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Pla n 
and national policy.

  S11. Market Drayton Place Plan Area  
 
S11.1.  Development Strategy: Market Drayton Principal  Centre  
1. Market Drayton  will fulfil its role as a Principal Centre , acting as a focus for strategic 
growth objectives in the north -east of the County, delivering around 1, 200 dwellings and 
making available around 35ha of employment land  to provide choice and competition in 
the market . New housing and employment development will respond to local  needs , the 
needs of the surrounding hinterland, provide opportunities for existing businesses to 
expand  and opportunities associated with High Speed 2.  
2. New residential development will be delivered through the saved SAMDev residential 
allocations  and the  Local Plan  residential site allocations. These will be complemented 
by appropriate windfall residential development within the Market Drayton  development 
boundary , as shown on the Policies Map where it is consistent with relevant polici es of 
this Local Plan; and appropriate cross -subsidy and exception development where it is 
consistent with Polic ies DP4 and DP7 and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
3. The relocation of Market Drayton Sports facilities from its current site on Greenfields 
Lane to land at Longford Tu rning , identified on the Policies Map, to enabl e the delivery 
of new facilities  to at least equitable standard,  is a c entral objective of the Strategy . 
Housing  development  (MDR39 and MDR43)  has been identified specifically to support 
and enable the delivery  of the relocation  through the provision of an appropriate 
vehicular access into the site.   Should the relocation of the sports facilities  to land at  
Longford Turning prove to be unviable , appropriate  consideration will be given to  
alternative si tes on land adjoining the A53 to deliver  the proposed relocation , where this 
meets the  requirements of other relevant policies of the Local Plan , and would offer  a 
viable opportunity to support effective  pedestrian and cycling movements  with the rest of 
the town.   In this scenario the Council will positively consider the release of further  land 
for residential  development  outside the defined development boundary  where  this can 
be clearly shown to provid e cross -subsidy support for the proposed  relocation.    
4. Whilst land is not  specifically  allocated for this purpose, it is recognised there may be  
opportunities to deliver a marina and  related uses  on land at Victoria Farm .  Any future 
proposal for the development of a marina must be in line with the requirements of Policy 
DP10 . Further to Policy SP7, consideration will be given to the need for additional 
market residential  development outside the town’s  development boundary where this is 
clearly and demonstrably linked to the delivery of a marina  at Victoria Farm , and where 
it would be required to ensure  the deliver y of the marina  within an early phase of 
development .. In this instance, proposals will need to meet all other relevant Local Plan 
policies and in particular show how there is sufficient infrastructure capacity to 
accommodate the scheme.  Any proposal for a marina and related uses in this location 
must not ha ve a significant adverse impact on Market Drayton Town Centre .          
5. New employment development will be delivered through the saved SAMDev 
employment allocations . This will be complemented by any appropriate windfall 
employment development , where it  is consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan . 
6. New retail development will be directed towards the town centre, in line with Policy DP9, 
and will need to  contribute to the historic character of the town.  
7. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site allocations are identified in Schedule 
S11.1(i) below and ide ntified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 226 
  should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and approximate site 
provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
8. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within relevant community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by 
Shropshire Council.

Explanation  
5.150.  Market Drayton has been identified as a Principal Centre and will contribute 
to the strategic growth objectives in the north -east of the County. The Local 
Plan provides a balanced housing and employment growth within Market 
Drayton through the provision of  around 1,200 dwellings and 35 hectares of 
employment land between 2016 and 2 038. 
5.151.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Market Drayton, which will 
contribute towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment 
development guidelines.  Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information 
on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the  Local Plan allocations.  
5.152.  The strategy for Market Drayton has been informed by the opportunity 
presented by new residential  development to contribute positively to the 
delivery of local objectives.  Both the proposed relocation of the existing 
sports provis ion, currently located at Greenfields  Lane , and the opportunity 
to develop a new marina development have their origins in the draft Market 
Drayton Neighbourhood Plan.  Whilst this Neighbourhood Plan was 
unsuccessful at Examination and therefore did not pro gress to referendum or 
adoption, it is considered these central objectives of the Plan remain valid 
and worthwhile , and would improve the sustainability of the town.  In 
selecting the residential site allocations, consideration has therefore been 
given to the impact these would have on the ability to deliver these 
objectives , alongside other sustainability considerations .   Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 229 
  5.153.  With regard  to the relocation of the Market Drayton Sports Facility, it is 
considered land at Longford Turning identified on the Polici es Map is 
suitable in principle  for this purpose , having considere d a range of factors 
including  scale; availability; proxi mity to existing residential areas and 
opportunities to deliver cycle and pedestrian access.  It is also 
acknowledged that this  site was the preferred site for the proposed 
relocation  within the draft Market Drayton Neighbourhood Plan.  The 
inclusion of site allocations MDR039 and MDR043 has therefore considered 
the opportunity to improve the accessibility to the Longford Turning site f rom 
the town via a range of means, including vehicular. Proposals on these 
housing allocations will therefore need to demonstrate  how an appropriate 
level of access to the Longford Turning site can be achieved and ensure this 
is delivered as part of their delivery.  
5.154.  It is recognised however that the proposed relocation of the sports facilities 
is not guaranteed, with the viability of the proposal being a particular 
consideration. To suppo rt this, the strategy recognises  that there is a 
presumption in favour  of supporting additional residential windfall 
development at the existing Greenfields site given the sustainability 
credentials of this site and its proximity to other existing and planned 
residential developments.   Should the relocation to the Longford Turning site 
subsequently be considered not to be possible, the strategy allows positive 
consideration for alternative sites adjoining the A53 to be considered, but 
these must be able to provide at least the same lev el of connectivity 
presented by the Longford Turning site.  In doing this the strategy shows 
necessary flexibility in order to achieve the long -term aims of the town.                
5.155.  In seeking to utilise  the town’s proximity to the Shropshire Union Canal, the 
development of a marina is another key objective for the town, in recognition 
of the economic and social benefits this could bring.  Whilst the specific 
allocation of marina  development  in Local Plans are generally not supported 
by the Canals and River s Trust, it is considered that in principle land at 
Victoria Farm  is capable of delivering  such a use alongside related  uses.   In 
seeking to support a supportive approach to delivery, and in recognition that 
there may be a need for development to cross -subsidise such a 
development, Policy  S11.1 sets out the issues the Council will consider  
should a marina proposal become a reality.        
5.156.  In order to provide further certainty to housing delivery and to ensure the 
proposed local housing requirement is achieved by 2 038, the Local Plan  also 
proposes the inclusion land off Adderley Road shown on the Policies M ap for 
around 125 dwellings.  It is considered this site complements the delivery of 
the objectives of the  town and can be delivered r elatively early in the plan 
period.

guideline for the rural area.  
 
Explanation  
5.157.  Three Community Hubs have been identified within the Market Drayton 
Place Plan Area, these are Hinstock, Hodnet and Woore, Irelands Cross and 
Pipe Gate.  
5.158.  Hinstock is a moderately sized village with a range of services and facilities. 
It is situated to the south of Market Drayton off the A41. Development within 
the village will meet local needs and primarily occur on the saved SAMDev 
Plan residential allocations and the Local Plan allocation. However, this will 
be complemented by appropriate windfall development and appropriate 
cross -subsi dy and exception development in accordance with Policy SP8 
(Community Hubs) and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5.159.  Hodnet  is a moderately sized village with a range of services and facilities, 
situated to the south of Market Drayton off the A 53. Development within the 
village will meet local needs and primarily occur on the saved SAMDev Plan 
residential allocations and the Local Plan allocation. However, this will be 
complemented by appropriate windfall development and appropriate cross -
subsid y and exception development in accordance with Policy SP8 
(Community Hubs) and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5.160.  A Neighbourhood Plan has be en prepared for the Woore, Irelands Cross and 
Pipe Gate area. This Neighbourhood Plan establish es the long -term delivery 
strategy for the linked communities  with strategically important gaps between 
them, as defined by the development boundary.  
5.161.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of 
Dudleston Heath’s residential development guideline.  Appendix 7 of the 
Local Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery 
of the Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
5.162.  Three Community  Clusters have been identified within Market Drayton Place 
Plan Area, reflecting lo cal aspirations to maintain or enhance the 
sustainability of identified settlements through modest levels of appropriate 
development. Development  within these Community Clusters will be 
managed in accordance with Policy SP9 (Community Clusters). New 
Community  Clusters can also be brought forwa rd by communities through 
the Neighbourhood Plan process.  
5.163.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is classified as ‘countryside’ for planning 
policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in accordance 
with Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Plan and national 
policies.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 233

S12.1.  Development Strategy: Minsterley and Pontesbury Community 
Hubs  
1. Minsterley and Pontesbury will act as Community Hubs and will receive development to 
support their function as Community Hubs which provid e services and facilities to serve 
the needs of the broader Place Plan area.  Residential development will contribute 
towards achieving the housing guideline for the rural area of Shropshire. The residential 
development guidelines for Minsterley and Pontesbu ry Community Hubs are around 155 
and around  175 dwellings respectively . 
2. New residential development will be delivered through  the saved SAMDev residential 
and mixed -use allocations and the Local Plan residential site allocation s. These 
allocations will be complemented by appropriate small -scale windfall residential 
development within the development boundar ies for Minsterley and Pontesbury  shown 
on the Policies Map  where it is consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8  and other 
relevant p olicies of this Local Plan   and any Neighbourhood Plan which is adopted ; and  
appropriate cross -subsidy and exception development , where it is consistent with 
Community Hub Policy SP8 and other  relevant policies of this Local Plan  and any 
Neighbourhood  Plan which is adopted ;  
3. New employment development will be delivered through  SAMDev mixed -use allocation 
in Minsterley and appropriate  small -scale windfall employment development  within 
Minsterley and Pontesbury , where it is consistent with Community Hub Policy SP8 and 
other  relevant policies of this Local Plan  and any Neighbourhood Plan which is adopted .  
4. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations within these Community Hubs are listed in 
Appendix 2  of this document and identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site 
allocations within these Community Hubs are identified in Schedule S12.2(i) below and 
on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance with 
specified development guidelines , approx imate site provision figures and all other 
relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
5. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within relevant community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by  
Shropshire Council.  
6. Mitigation measures will be required to remove any adverse effect from increased 
recreational pressure arising from development in Minsterley and Pontesbury on the 
integrity of the Stiperstones and Hollies SAC in accordance with Polices DP12 , DP14  
and DP15 . Mitigation measures for recreational impacts are identified in the Plan 
Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) and supporting documents.

Minsterley Community Hub  
Land west of 
A488, 
Minsterley  
(MIN018 ) Appropriate access arrangements will be required. The 
30mph zone should be extended to reflect site extent, 
together with any necessary traffic calming. To improve 
accessibility to services and facilities a  footway should be 
provided along the site’s road frontage to form a 20 dwellings  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 234

west and a crossing facility provided to link to the 
footpath/cycleway on the opposite side of the A488.  
The site will incorporate appropriate sustainable 
drainage, informed by a su stainable drainage strategy. 
Any residual surface water flood risk will be managed by 
excluding development from the affected areas of the 
site, development will also be excluded from the 
elements of the site located in Flood Zones 2 and/or 3, 
these areas will form part of the Green Infrastructure 
network. Flood and water management measures must 
not displace water elsewhere.  
Design and layout should minimise noise impact from 
adjacent road.  
Mature trees on the site should be retained  and the 
environmental network to western boundary buffered . 
Relevant supporting studies should be undertaken 
particularly ecology, tree and hedgerow surveys, flood 
risk and drainage with their recommendations clearly 
reflected in the proposed development scheme.   
Pontesbury Community Hub  
Land at 
Minsterley 
Road, 
Pontesbury  
(PON008, 
PON017 and 
PON030 ) Appropriate shared access arrangements to serve the 
whole site will be required with consideration given to a 
new roundabout junction also serv ing Ashford Drive. A 
footway should be provided along the site’s road frontage 
to provide for a footway link on the north side of the A488 
Minsterley Road. This will provide  access to  local 
services , facilities , existing footpaths and recreational 
areas .  
The design, landscaping,  layout of and access to the 
development will need to take into account: elevated and 
rising topography; mature trees and hedgerows , 
including  local ancient woodland ; heritage and ecologi cal 
interest; potential contamination and all sources of flood 
risk as informed by a flood risk assessment.  Design and 
layout should also minimise noise impact from adjacent 
road.  Relevant supporting studies should be undertaken, 
and their recommendations  implemented.  
The site will incorporate appropriate sustainable 
drainage, informed by a sustainable drainage strategy. 
Any residual surface water flood risk will be managed by 
excluding  development from the affected areas  of the 
site, which will form part  of the Green Infrastructure  
network. Flood and water management  measures must 
not displace water elsewhere . 
Protected and mature  trees , hedgerows on the site and 
forming site boundaries should be protected and  retained 
and the environmental network at the western site 
boundary enhanced by planting where possible.   40 dwellings

  Explanatio n 
5.164.  Minsterley and Pontesbury Place Plan Area is unique in not having a key 
centre. Minsterley and Pontesbury were identified as a joint Key Centre in 
the Shropshire Core Strategy and SAMDev Plan. However, as a result of the 
hierarchy of settlements evidence p roduced by Shropshire  Council to 
support the Plan preparation, the settlements ha ve been reclassified as 
Community Hubs.   
5.165.  Minsterley is large village some 10 miles to the south -west of Shrewsbury, 
on the A488 Shrewsbury - Bishops Castle road  with an estima ted population 
(in 2016) of 1,558 people . The village has a range of local services and 
facilities including a primary school, community hall, petrol station and 
convenience store. Minsterley also plays a significant role as an employment 
centre with two l arge food producers, Rea Valley Foods and Muller 
Creamery, located within the village i n a protected employment area.  
5.166.  Pontesbury is a large village around 8 miles to the south -west of 
Shrewsbury, also on the A488 Shrewsbury - Bishops Castle road  with (in 
2016 ) an estimated population of 1,897 people.  Pontesbury has a good 
range of local services and facilities including primary and secondary 
schools, a variety of local shops, community hall, library and medical 
practice, dentist and chemist.  
5.167.  Minsterley has  saved  SAMDev allocations , at Callow Lane and Hall Farm,  
which will contribute to the delivery of housing for the Plan period . The 
delivery of a scheme at Hall Farm to enhance the appearance of the site, the 
setting of the adjoining listed building and to secure the future of heritage 
assets on the site, whilst delivering some housing and employment 
opportunities, remains desirabl e. 
5.168.  There is also a need to: recognise the requirements of existing employment; 
support new small -scale employment opportunities; and to deliver a range of 
house types to support the vitality of Minsterley . However, development 
opportunities, within and adj oining the village, are significantly constrained 
by appropriate land availability , the impacts of an extensive area of flood risk 
and the need to safeguard Minsterley Meadows SSSI.  
5.169.  The importance of existing employment in Minsterley village is recognised , 
and the previously defined area will continue to be designated as a protected 
employment area.  
5.170.  Since availability of land and  other constraints , particularly flood risk,  limit 
potential locations for future development  in Minsterley the scale of proposed  
development is relatively  modest with a site for  around 20 dwellings 
allocated . This will provide an opportunity to deliver a range of 
accommodation types to help meet local housing needs   
5.171.  In considering suitable, promoted land and thus available options for further 
housing in Minsterley  a site off the A488 at the eastern edge of the village 
has been identified.  This site is accessible off the A488 (with appropriate 
speed restrictions/traffi c calming measures) and relatively well located in 
relation to the existing built form of the village.  Flood constraints and surface 
water management would need to be taken into account in the design of any 
development and it is considered at this point t hat the site would therefore 
yield around 20 dwellings.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 236 
  5.172.  In Pontesbury there are two  saved SAMDev Plan allocations, land  at 
Minsterley Road , together with a larger mixed -use site  at Hall Bank .  The 
allocation  at Hall Bank provided for  the deliver y of 86 dw ellings as well as a 
convenience store, relocated nursery and community hub. This is a 
significant development in the context of Pontesbury delivering a number of 
community benefits , including affordable housing,  but will need some time to 
be assimilated i nto the fabric of the village. There is however a remaining 
identified need for affordable dwellings and the delivery of a range of house 
types to support the vitality of the village  
5.173.  Opportunities for development, within and adjoining Pontesbury  village, a re 
impacted by areas of high landscape value to the south and east, including 
the AONB and a restricted road network to the south of the A488. Some 
sites to the north -eastern side of the village also currently lack suitable 
access.  
5.174.  Further to considering s uitable, promoted land , constraints  and available 
options for further development in Pontesbury  land at the western end of the 
village off the A488  is allocated  to deliver  around 40 dwellings  to meet needs  
of the Plan period .  
5.175.  Shropshire Council is working proactively with Pontesbury Parish Council in 
the ongoing production of the Neighbourhood Plan which will support the 
development strategy for Pontesbury . 
5.176.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide s information on the levels of residential 
completions ac hieved in Minsterley and Pontesbury Community Hubs since 
the start of the Plan period and commitments available, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of their residential development guidelines.  Appendix 7 
of the Local Plan provides information on th e anticipated timeframe for the 
delivery of the Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
 
S12.2.  Community Clusters: Minsterley and Pontesbury Place Plan Area  
1. There are no Community Clusters within the Minsterley Pontesbury Place Plan Area.  
 
S12.3.  Wider Rural Area: Minsterley and Pontesbury Place Plan Area  
1. There is a saved  SAMDev Plan site allocation  HAN011/R  identified in Appendix 2 which  
provides for the growth of Hanwood village .  
 
Explanation  
5.177.  Whilst there are some small hamlets in the rural area beyond the villages of 
Minsterley and Pontesbury, no Community Cluster settlements have 
currently been identified. However, new Community  Clusters can be brought 
forward by communities through the Neigh bourhood Plan process.  
5.178.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is therefore classified as ‘countryside’ for 
planning policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in 
accordance with Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Plan 
and national policies.

  S13. Much Wenlock Place Plan Area  
 
S13.1.  Development Strategy: Much Wenlock Key Centre  
1. Much Wenlock  will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth 
objectives in the east of the County, delivering around 200 dwellings and around 2 
hectares of employment development. New housing and employment development will 
respond to local needs.  
2. A Neighbourhood Plan for Much Wenlock covering the period from 2013 -2026  was 
adopted in 2014 . The p olicies and proposals within th is Neighbourhood Plan which 
conform with the Local Plan continue to form part of the Development Plan for the area . 
3. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the residential site 
allocation . This will be complemented by appropriate small -scale windfall residential 
development within the Much Wenlock  development boundary shown on the Policies 
Map, w here it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local Plan  and the Much 
Wenlock Neighbourhood Plan . It will also be complemented by appropriate cross -
subsidy and exception development, where it is consistent with relevant policies of this 
Local Plan  and the Much Wenlock Neighbourhood Plan . 
4. New employment development will be delivered through  the employment allocation 
within the Much Wenlock Neighbourhood Plan . This will be complemented by any 
appropriate small -scale employment windfall development, whe re it is consistent with 
relevant policies of this Local Plan  and the Much Wenlock Neighbourhood Plan . 
5. New retail development will be directed towards the town  centre , in line with Policy DP9, 
where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town.  
6. Local Plan site allocations are identified in Schedule S13.1(i) below and identified on the 
Policies Map. Development of site allocations should be in accordance with specified 
development guidelines and approximate site provision figures and all other relevant 
policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development proposals will b e expected to positively respond to relevant policies and 
guidelines identified within the Much Wenlock  Neighbourhood Plan, any other relevant 
community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by Shropshire Council.

School and 
Hunters Gate, 
Much Wenlock  
(MUW012 VAR) Access into the site will be provided by a  new roundabout 
on the A458 to be funded by the development.  
The site will deliver a maximum of 120 dwellings.  
Development will be required to deliver substantial 
community benefits both on and off s ite by way of flood 
alleviation.  Specifically, development must demonstrate 
how properties currentl y at risk of flooding at Hunters Gate 
and Forester Avenue will be protected  for all storm events 
up to and including the 1% A nnual Exceedance Probability 
(AEP) event plus an appropriate allowance for climate 
change , as well as removing exceedance water from the 
existing surface water and foul sewer systems  serving 120 dwellings  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 238

Much Wenloc k. Where offsite attenuation features are 
proposed it must also demonstrate that the design  of these 
features will ensure there is no increase in flood risk to 
properties downs tream of Much Wenlock on the Farley 
Brook for all storm events up to an including the 1% AEP  
event plus an appropriate allowance for climate change.     
Given the importance of this issue, development proposal 
will be required to provide  sufficient detailed designs 
evidencing how these measures will be achieved in 
practice in order for planning permission to be granted.  
Any residual surface water flood ris k within the site will be 
managed by excluding development from the affected 
areas of the site, which will form part of the green 
Infrastructure / open space network. Flood and water 
management measures must not displace water 
elsewhere.  
Substantial and ef fective boundary treatments will be 
required in order to create a buffer around the site. This 
will include the reinstatement of a hedgerow along the 
sites southern boundary.  
Green infrastructure links will be provided through the site 
linking to the open  space provision  and the public right of 
way network beyond the site . High-quality trees and 
hedgerows will be retained.  
Acoustic design, layout, use of green infrastructure and 
appropriate building materials will be used to appropriately 
manage noise arising from the  A458.  
 
Explanation  
5.179.  The Town benefits from having an adopted Neighbourhood Plan covering 
the period 2013 -2026.  The policies of the Neighbourhood Plan reflect the 
unique character, circumstances and community aspiration in the town.  
Indeed, w here there is no conflict with this Local Plan, the Neighbourhood 
Plan continues to up -to-date for the purposes of decision taking.  However, it 
has also been necessary for the Shropshire Local Plan to indicate how it is 
to plan positively for the Town to 2038, whilst continuing to respect its 
character and nature and the broad aspirations of the Neighbourhood Plan.     
5.180.  Key plan ning issues for Much Wenlock include the fact the town catchment 
has been designated as a Flood Rapid Response Catchment in the highest 
category.  Surface water flooding can develop very quickly in this situation 
and the potential impact on flood risk is t herefore a very significant local 
consideration, including in the manner in which development sites are 
identified.  
5.181.  The Plan therefore identifies an appropriate growth level over the plan period 
of around 200 dwellings, along with 2 hectares of employment land provision 
in order to secure balanced growth.  Development is focussed into a single 
housing allocation at Hunters Gate, where it is considered a maximum of 
120 dwellings i s acceptable in order to secure  sufficient local housing  supply Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 239 
  and opportunity  in the long term, but at the  same time directly responding to 
and addressing the issue of flooding in and around the site, and with 
adjoining residential areas.  The d evelopment guidelines for the allocation  at 
Hunters Gate therefore are  clear in the leve l of community benefit required to 
be delivered as a direct result of the scheme  with regards to flood mitigation 
measures.  In addition , it is considered the allocation offers the opportunity 
for a well -designed scheme, integrating green infrastructure an d other open 
space features throughout.    
5.182.  Additional development in Much Wenlock will need to recognise the potential 
impacts on flood risk, heritage assets and the policies and objectives in the 
Neighbourhood Plan.  
5.183.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Much Wenlock, which will 
contribute towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment 
devel opment guidelines. Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information 
on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations .

the wider rural area of the Much Wenlock Place Plan Area.  
 
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 242 
  Explanation  
Community Hubs  
5.184.  Cressage is the only Community Hub in the Much Wenlock Place P lan Area 
and has changed  its status from being a ‘Countryside ’ settlement  since 
2015. Cressage has previously provided a small -scale  exception site for 
affordable housing  and this  marks an important characteristic of  the village 
as an ‘inclusive ’ community  that also accommodate s gypsy  and traveller 
needs.  Cressage , as a Community Hub, will now bring some much -needed 
investment in key infrastructure and services along with new housing to 
improve the sustainability of the community.  
5.185.  Cressage  is situated on an important local highway junction and a bridging 
point (north) for the B4380 over the River Severn . The  village  is an important 
local service centre for smaller rural communities on the A458 (south and 
west), B4380 (north) and Sheinton Road (east).  Cressage has an important 
but under -appreciated  historic core around a former Castle site on the B4380 
junction with Sheinton Road  and with adjacent and related historic assets on 
the A458 .  
5.186.  Cressage , as a Community Hub , offers the opportunity to explore and 
understand the history and significance  of the village and to improve the 
appearance , appreciation and function of this key service  centre . A principal 
focus for the settlement strategy will be the small but sign ificant historic  site 
of the former (The) Eagles public house  and car park  allocated as housing 
site CES006 . Redundant  for many  years , the pub’ building has a n historic 
core that has become a  designated heritage asset . The redevelopment of 
CES006 is expecte d to reveal much about the history  of Cressage and will 
increase its attraction as a place to live .  
5.187.  The A458 through Cressage is key to its continuing function but a lack of 
regard for the spee d restrictions and highway infrastructure to ensure the 
safety of all road users , has a significant , adverse impact on its residents . 
The settlement strategy seeks to  influence  driver behaviour and improve 
pedestrian safety by providing further highway and pedestrian infrastructure 
and by changing perceptions of the village. This will be supported by  
improv ing pedestrian links through  site CES006 and ensuring highway works 
at site CES005 adjoining the former Vicarage will provide a new residential 
area that meet s the needs of the community and encourage s through traffic 
to respect the amenity and safety  of the residents  of the village  
  
Community Clusters   
5.188.  The village of Buildwas is the only  Community Cluster settlement  in the 
Much Wenlock  Place Plan Area . Development in Buildwas is expected to 
comprise small scale, infill development within the existing built form of the 
settlement where these developments con form with Policy SP9. 
5.189.  The rest of the Place Plan Area is classified as ‘countryside’ for planning 
policy purposes, where new development is strictly controlled in accordance 
with Policy SP10 , other relevant policies within this Local Plan and national 
policies.

  S14. Oswestry Place Plan Area  
 
S14.1.  Development Strategy : Oswestry  Principal Centre  
1. Oswestry will act as a Principal Centre and contribute towards strategic growth 
objectives in the north -west of the County , delivering  around 1,900  dwellings and 
making available around 57 hectares of employment land to provide choice and 
competition in the market . New housing and employment will make provision for the 
needs of the town and surrounding hinterland, including attracting inward investment 
and allowing existing businesses to expand.   
2. New residential development will be delivered through a combination of the saved 
SAMDev residential allocations and the Local Plan residential allocations at Park Hall, 
which will reinforce the existing urban fabric of the former Park Hall Camp to form a 
mixed use ‘garden settlement’ as envisaged by the Oswestry Civic Society within their 
document, Oswestry 2050.  
3. These allocations will be complemented by appropriate windfall residential development 
within the Oswestry development boundary, as shown on the Policies Map; and 
appropriate cross -subsidy and exception development where it is consistent with DP7 
and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
4. Saved SAMDev employment allocations will help deliver a balance between new 
housing and local employment, whilst also recognising the important role that Oswestry 
plays in the north -west of the County and seeking to ensure a range and choice of 
economic de velopment opportunities. These sites will be supported by appropriate 
employment windfall development , where it is consistent with relevant policies of this 
Local Plan.  
5. To support Oswestry’s role as a Principal Centre, new retail development will be 
directed towards the town centre, in line with Policy DP9, where it will complement the 
existing offer.  
6. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site allocations are identified in Schedule 
S14.1(i) below and identified on the Policies Map. D evelopment of site allocations 
should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and approximate site 
provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within relevant community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by 
Shropshire Council.  
8. The emerging Oswestry Transit Corridor Study  will provide further guidance with regard 
to the relationship between Gobowen an d Oswestry. This document will indicate the 
type of infrastructure sought to increase the linkages between the two settlements, 
including the type of transport to be promoted and funded through a phased approach.

Explanation  
5.190.  Oswestry was identified as a Principle Centre in the Shropshire Core 
Strategy under CS15. The town will continue this status as part of the Local 
Plan Review, and will continue its role as the principle fo r employment, 
commercial and administrative centre in the north west of the County.  
 Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 245 
  5.191.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Oswestry, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and e mployment development 
guideline s.  Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations .   
5.192.   Due to the limitations surrounding Oswestry for development, no housing 
allocations have be en made in the town as part of this Local Plan Review. 
Oswestry’s housing requirement is therefore allocated in Park Hall to the 
north -east. It is acknowledged that Oswestry has a strong need for 
affordable and specialist dwelling types, and therefore suit able sites are 
encouraged for affordable exception and cross -subsidy schemes to help 
meet the unmet need, rather than assign very small housing allocations. 
Further growth of the town is therefore expected to come through 
appropriate windfall sites  in addi tion to previously adopted allocations.  
5.193.  Park Hall has been allocated six sites comprising a total of approximately 
240 potential dwellings. These sites are located to the north and will be 
expected to recognise the importance of linking with  the Derwen Col lege as 
well as the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, where key -
worker dwellings will be developed to ensure appropriate links are present 
with the housing development.  This will be through a combination of physical 
linkages (i.e. roads and p athways) as well as house types and tenures. 
Additional uses, such as ancillary commercial, will also be anticipated 
alongside the residential proposals.  
5.194.  The Indicative Masterplan and Transport and Movement Strategy for 
Oswestry town aims to ratify and develop the vision and ambitions identified 
through work undertaken to date and to develop an investable concept 
masterplan for the evolution of the town. The movement and access study 
should consider movement through the town and the connectivity between 
the town and surrounding key locations (RJAH Hospital, Gobowen Railway 
Station, Bus Station, Innovation Park, Industrial parks, leisure centre, 
colleges, planned and proposed developments, etc .).  
5.195.  The Oswestry SUE will continue to provide the majority of housing for the 
town. The revised figures confirm that around 800 houses will be delivered at 
this site, together with a new link road between Shrewsbury Road and 
Middleton Road, sustainable transpo rt improvements and land for 
community facilities, public open space and green infrastructure.  
5.196.  Oswestry’s role as a principal focus for employment is supported through the 
allocation of a total of 57 hectares of new employment land. The two major 
new area s are land at Mile End east and land to the south of Whittington 
Road, both to the east of the Oswestry Bypass, so the developments will 
need to address their impacts on the A5 junctions and ensure the provision 
of satisfactory linkages for pedestrians and  cyclists to/from the town.

  7. St Martins and Weston Rhyn  are within the setting of the Clwydian Range and Dee 
Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Planning Policy Wales 10 requires 
development  in the setting of  an AON B to take ac count of the special qualities of the 
designated are a. Proposals affecting the setting of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley  
AONB must have regard to its  identified special qualiti es in consultatio n with Natural

Explanation  
5.197.  A number of Community Hubs are identified within the Oswestry Place Plan 
area, reflecting the scale of the services and facilities they provide.  
5.198.  Development in the proposed Community Hubs responds to the scale and 
character of each area, as well as the availability of suitable development 
options.  Where it has been appropriate to allocate land to deliver the local 
housing guideline the development guidelines reflect this in Schedule S14.2.  
There are no allocations identified  for Kinnerley or Trefonen , and instead the 
development of  suitable infill developme nt along with  affordable exception 
and cross -subsidy sites in appropriate locations outside of the development 
boundary , will be supported where they help deliver housing which meets 
identified local needs.

S15.1.  Development Strategy: Shifnal Town  
1. Shifnal w ill fulfil its role as a Key Centre and the largest settlement in the north  of the 
Shropshire Green Belt.  Shifnal will be the focus for investment, employment, housing 
and development on the M54 /A5 Strategic Corridor through Shropshire with access to 
Junctions 4 and 3 with proximity to Wolverhampton and the i54 major investment site.  
2. A Neighbourhood Plan for Shifnal covering the period 2014 -2026 was adopted in 
2015.   Policies  and proposals within the Neighbourhood Plan which conform with the 
Local Plan will continue to apply  through the lifespan of the Neighbourhood Plan . 
3. Shifnal is inset into the Green Belt  and planned development will only occur within the 
development boundary  shown on the Policies Map. Development in the Green Belt 
which is ‘appropriate ’ or which may be permitted in ‘very special circumstances ’ will be 
considered in accordance with national and local Green Belt policies that  specify 
appropriate land uses a nd the acceptable circumstances for such development . 
4. Shifnal will have a key role in providing homes, jobs, services and facilities to the Place 
Plan area , other Green Belt communities and the M54/A5 Strategic Corridor . Over the 
Local Plan period, t he town will deliver around 1,5 00 dwellings and make available 
around 41 hectares of employment land to provide choice and competition in the 
market . New housing and employment will  provide  for the needs of the town and 
surrounding hinterland , including attracting inward investment , allowing existing 
businesses to expand  and encouraging new businesses to establish in Shifnal . 
5. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the saved SAMDev 
mixed use and residential allocations in Appendix 2 and Local Plan residential 
allocations in Schedule S15.1(i)  and shown on the Policies Map . Development of 
residential allocations will be in accordance with the development guidelines and site 
provision figures and the policies of this Plan . Residential development on appropriate 
windfall sites within the development boundary  will be permitted in accordance with the 
policies of this Plan  and rele vant policies of the Shifnal Neighbourhood Plan . New 
residential development may be delivered on appropriate cross -subsidy and exception 
sites, where opportunities exist within the development boundary , are consistent with 
national and local policies  or would be ‘appropriate’ development in the Green Belt . 
6. Shifnal will deliver a significant , new investment opportunit y on the employment 
allocation in Schedule S15.1(ii) and shown on the Policies Map. Development of this 
allocation will be in accordance with the development guidelines and site provision 
figures and the policies of this Plan  especiall y SP13 . Employment development on 
appropriate windfall sites within the development boundary  will be permitted in 
accordance with the policies of this Plan  and relevant policies of the Shifnal 
Neighbourhood Plan . The existing employment area at Shifnal Industrial Estate will be 
protected , primarily for ‘primary’ employment uses identified in policy SP13 as part of the 
range of employment development opportunities in the town.  
7. Land beyond the development boundary that is not part of the Green Belt  is 
safeguarded for Shifnal’s future development needs , beyond the Plan period  after 2038 . 
This extensive land release from the Green Belt is located to the east and to the south 
and west of the town as shown in Schedule S15.1(iii) and on the Policies Map.  
Development of this land during the Plan period will only be permitted in ‘very special 
circumstances’ to meet Shifnal’s development needs in accordance with national and 
local Green Belt policies . Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 255 
  8. To support Shifnal ’s role as a Key Centre and the importance of the town’s distinctive 
retail offer and the need to sustain a vital and viable town centre, the town centre 
identified on the Policies Map is the preferred location for new or enhanced retail 
development. There is a pr esumption against out of centre retail development subject to 
changes to the Use Classes Order 1987 (as amended) with the except ion of an earlier 
release of safeguarded land to the west and south of Shifnal in ‘very special 
circumstances’ to meet the devel opment needs of the town.  
9. In recognition of the historic character of the town and its environmental challenges, the 
development of the town will have regard to  the:  
a. promotion, conservation and enhancement of the town’s natural and historic 
features, heritage assets, green corridors and spaces ; and 
b. improvement of the environmental quality , including the protection and 
enhancement of the corridor  of the Wesley Brook and the effective drainage of river 
and surface water through the town  particu larly from the discharge of flood waters ; 
10. Shifnal will be a significant f ocus for the provision of infrastructure and services to meet 
the needs of the town and its wider catchment area, with current priorities set out in the 
Implementation Plan and Shifnal Place Plan.  Particular infrastructure opportunities th e 
development of  the town will have regard to are  the:  
a. localised improvements to Haughton Lane and Haughton Village;  
b. improvements to pedestrian and cycle infrastructure to support sustainable travel;  
c. improvements to the Town Centre including Bradford Street/Aston Street junction;  
d. further improvements required by the proposed growth of Shifnal including:  
i. priorities afforded to through traffic and residential parking on Innage Road;  
ii. capacity improvements to Five Ways roundabout;  
iii. improvements to upgrade k ey routes and junctions serving the town.  
11. Development proposals will demonstrate they have adequately assessed and mitigated 
their impacts with regard to co -ordinat ing infrastructure provision and the development 
of their proposals. Development proposals s hould address the infrastructure constraints 
and requirements identified in the Implementation Plan and Shifnal Place  Plan and any 
site or settlement infrastructure modelling and/or assessment s to positively contribute to 
local infrastructure improvements, including the provision of community benefits in 
accordance with Polic y DP25 . 
12. Development proposals will respond positively to policies  and guidelines in a revised 
Shifnal Neighbourhood Plan  or any community -led plans, community strategies or 
masterplans adopted by Shropshire Council  in conformity with this Local Plan for the

Site Allocation  Development Guidelines  Provision  
Land e ast of 
Shifnal 
Industrial 
Estate, Upton 
Lane, Shifnal  
(SHF018b & 
SHF018d)  The development of these two inter -related sites will 
significantly improve the employment land  offer, 
commercial premises, business representation and 
employment in Shifnal . 
The employment development should create a high quality, 
campus style development primarily for Class B uses but 
with appropriate secondary  employment uses and other  
ancillary service uses. Situated on the edge of town, the 
development will take full account of the need to enclose 
both the built form of the development and any off-site 
infrastructure works within a Green Infrastructure network , 
separati ng it from the Green Belt and  landscape to the east 
of Shifnal.  
The development of land west of Upton Lane should 
consider the functional relationship with Shifnal Industrial 
Estate and the opportunity to link the two employment 
areas  to: create a secondary access in to the new 
employment area ; and to alleviate the constraints imposed 
on Shifnal Industrial Estate through the existing intensity of 
the uses within this employment area . 
The development will address the need for strategic and 
service infrastructure particularly for utilities including the 
provision of an electricity upgrade to an appropriate MVA 
to serve the existing and proposed employment areas in 
the ea st of the town.  The development should also 
consider the possibility of using  renewable energy to meet  
the energy needs  of the business occupiers . 
The development of this site will be in accordance with a 
masterplan  and design code prepared in consultatio n with 
the public and  Shropshire Council. This will represent a 
significant material planning consideration for  any planning 
application for development of the site. A construction 39 hectare s 
(15.6ha net 
development)

management plan will be prepared to inform the 
development of the site.  
The layout, height of buildings, use of Green Infrastructure 
with strong native tree planting to provide appropriate and 
substantial buffering , effective building design and 
materials will be used to appropriately manage impacts 
from the development includ ing visual impacts, noise , dust, 
odour or other emissions  arising from the employment 
uses. Site design and layout will respond to any identified 
landscape and visual effects and include all appropriate 
mitigation.  
The sites should be serviced from the A41 /M54 Junction 3 
along Stanton Road with traffic restrictions on commercial 
vehicle movements to the site using the A464 / Aston 
Street through Shifnal via the town centre. The priority 
given to Stanton Road as the primary access will require 
improvements t o Stanton Road along its length.   
Strategic Transport Assessment and Transport evidence 
will be required to assess the effects of the development 
and the cumulative growth of Shifnal on the local and 
strategic road network, including M54 Junction 3 and the 
A41/Stanton Road junction , this will be informed by 
consultation with Highways England . All necessary 
improvements to the local and strategic road network will 
be undertaken.  
Sites SHF18b a nd SHF18d will share a principal access 
from Stanton Road to serve the employment area and 
Upton Lane to the viaduct bridge at the rail line will be 
improved and modified to form the primary distributor road 
serving the site.   Upton Lane forms an historic 
thoroughfare and the road route or its historical presence 
will need to be conserved in the development.  
Upton Lane forms a bridge viaduct over the rail line to the 
south of the site.  Beyond  the bridge viaduct , Upton Lane 
forms an inadequate local road an d development should 
close the viaduct to traffic until the southern section of 
Upton Lane is improved and to recognise the weight 
restrictions over the bridge viaduct.   It is desirable for the 
viaduct bridge to remain open to pedestrian and cyclist 
moveme nts to encourage active travel particularly via the 
Lamledge Lane junction with Upton Lane . 
Appropriate public transport links including bus services 
into Shifnal town should be provided link ing to parking 
facilities on the site to support wider use includ ing the 
possibility for electric vehicle charging points. The potential 
to operate a dedicated Park and Ride service should be 
investigated in partnership with appropriate local 
community groups and bus operators.  
Significant and effective pedestrian and c ycle links will be 
provided along Stanton Road , into and through the Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 262

development  to encourage safe and sustainable patterns 
of movement between the employment area and the town. 
A link with Shifnal Industrial Estate would provide an 
opportunity for a secondary vehicular, pedestrian and 
cycling access from the south.  
The allocation lie s over a Source Protection Zone with its 
core area over the pumping station on Stanton Road to the 
north -west.  A stand off for built development will protect 
the SPZ1 area and the site may be required to drain to the 
south and east onto land accessible to  the River Worfe 
catchment.  
The site will incorporate a multi -stage sustainable drainage 
system and water treatment facilities , informed by a 
sustainable drainage strategy. Water runoff will be 
restricted to the equivalent greenfield rate and water quality  
in the wider drainage network will be protected. Any 
residual surface water flood risk will be managed by 
excluding built development from the affected areas of the 
site. Flood and water management measures must not 
displace water elsewhere.  
These areas w ill form part of the Green Infrastructure 
network. The S uDS infrastructure t of the site will be 
designed and landscaped with a ‘parkland’ character as 
part of the Green Infrastructure providing public access as 
compensatory provision for releasing land fr om the Green 
Belt.  This will form a strong boundary to the Green Belt 
along with the adjoining woodland.  
Natural environment assets in proximity to the site and any 
priority habitats will be safeguarded and buffered.  
Site design and layout will respect an y local heritage 
assets and the potential for archaeological deposits which 
will be recorded. Green infrastructure will protect the 
settings for any identified heritage assets.  
Historic field patterns and hedgerows will be retained within 
the Green Infrast ructure network forming part of the grain 
of the development. Any removal of trees or hedgerows will 
be replaced as part of the structural planting for the 
employment area.  
Careful consideration must be given to the creation of an 
effective boundary to the  north, east and south of the 
development to strengthen the Green Belt boundary 
around the site.  The rail line to the south will provide the 
principal Green Belt boundary in this location.

Explanation  
5.201.  Shifnal will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards the strategic growth 
objectives in the east of the County. It is expected that the housing 
development market will continue to explore Shifnal as a preferred 
investment location in the M54 corridor an d the se demands will continue to 
subject the town  to significant growth pressures  due to its situation  between 
Junctions 3 and 4 on the M54 and between the urban centres of  
Wolverhampton and Telford . 
5.202.  Shifnal is a service and employment location but the employment offer in the 
town has been affected by the limited development opportunities and the 
poor quality of the employment land in the town, which is largely confined to 
the Shifnal Industrial Estate. The strategy for Shifnal from 2016 to 2038 is to 
change the business investment and employment offer in its scale, quality, 
range of uses and choice of premises. This will enable Shifnal to function as 
a sustainable investment location in the M54 corridor with the benefit of 
accessibility from Junction 3 a nd its close proximity to the i54 major 
investment site at Junction 2 a. 
5.203.  The strategy for Shifnal is to provide around 1,500 dwellings and at least 16 
hectares of employment development from 2016 to 203 8. Appendix 5 and 6 
of the Local Plan provide informati on on the levels of residential and 
employment completions achieved since the start of the Plan period and 
commitments available within Shifnal, which will contribute towards the 
delivery of the town’s residential and employment development guideline s. 
Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the anticipated 
timeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations . There is a 
requirement for the balance of housing development of around 90 dwellings 
to be provided on unidentified windfall housing  sites to achieve the housing 
guideline for Shifnal.  
5.204.  The development of housing in Shifnal has achieved high rates of delivery at 
around 200 dwellings per annum from 2016. If these rates of delivery are 
sustained over the early period of the Plan, then the  supply of housing land 
is likely to be delivered, in its entirety, well before the end of the current 
decade and possibly as early as 2025. The town would then have a lengthy 
period of respite from housing development before any of the safeguarded 
land is  released for development.  
5.205.  The demands placed on the town, and the response of the development 
industry may have the effect of seeking to foreshorten this period of respite Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 264 
  particularly to address shortfalls in land supply within the sub -regional area, 
and along the M54 corridor. These pressures will be resisted to provide the 
necessary time for the community to assimilate the significant and rapid 
growth of the town since 2016. This respite is important to also provide the 
opportunity for pipeline infrastr ucture investments to be implemented and for 
the investment works associated with the ‘lead in’ for the proposed new 
employment area to be undertaken.  It is expected that the capacity of the 
Wesley Brook in relation to its constrained channel and particul arly the 
effects of the flooding discharge load placed on the watercourse, may also 
be addressed during this time.  
5.206.  These pressures create some degree of conflict in relation to two significant 
considerations affecting the future growth of Shifnal. The stra tegic location, 
function, size (as the largest Key Centre in Shropshire) and accessibility of 
Shifnal have the effect of promoting the town as a growth point on the M54 
corridor and within this sub -regional area of the West Midlands. In contrast, 
the commu nity value the character, form and pace of life in Shifnal and wish 
it to retain its ‘village ’ character  in its size, appearance, function and feel.  
5.207.  This desire to remain as a ‘village’ community is also re -enforced by 
structural problems in the town. This is created by many factors including the 
constrained channel of the Wesley Brook, surface water flooding across the 
town, the functional capacity of  the highway network and limited capacity at 
key junctions, the lack of private car parking spaces for many homes and 
businesses and the need for significant investment in the strategic, physical, 
social and economic infrastructure of the town.  
5.208.  The Local P lan seeks to address some of these structural issues by securing 
a sustainable and balanced strategy for the growth of Shifnal. The primary 
concern is to secure a better balance between the currently committed and 
likely future scale of housing, the curren t deficit in employment land and the 
largely low quality employment opportunities in the town. The strategy seeks 
to address both the immediate need to provide for housing and employment 
development to 2038 and to also provide for the future growth of a to wn that 
is inset into the Green Belt and restricted by national policy. The intention is 
to hold apart these two planned phases of development to ensure that 
growth is planned effectively, and important infrastructure investments can 
be delivered.  
5.209.  The appr oach in the Local Plan is to seek new, additional housing 
allocations around the edge of Shifnal to complement new housing areas 
brought forward by the SAMDev Plan which extend the footprint of the urban 
area. The objective is now to ‘place shape’ these ne w neighbourhoods by 
completing the pattern of development, creating a permeable townscape, 
enclosing the urban form, creating a strong and legible boundary between 
the town and the Green Belt, largely using existing safeguarded land.  
5.210.  There is a single area  of safeguarded land remaining from the SAMDev Plan  
following the provision of new allocations in this Plan . This land can currently 
only be accessed from Lamledge Lane which is a narrow and inadequate 
rural lane accessed either from the narrow hump -back b ridge over the rail 
line (north) or from the equally inadequate southern leg of Upton Lane (east) 
which has a constrained and potentially unsafe junction to the A464. The 
release of this land is awaiting a more strategic development proposal 
possibly requi ring more land to be released from the Green Belt, or  requires 
an access solution involving a route past Revells Rough (south) as indicated Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 265 
  in the development guidelines for allocated site SHF023. The relative 
isolation of this land is reflected in: its ac cess constraints; and in the 
tranquillity of the area around Lamledge Lane and Upton Lane, south of the 
rail line.  This suggests the release of this safeguarded land should await a 
subsequent review of the Local Plan.  
5.211.  To deliver a level of employment grow th in balance with the anticipated level 
of new housing, it is proposed to deliver a large employment allocation that 
will deliver a ‘net’ built development capable of providing sufficient 
employment to balance the delivery of new housing to 2038. This lan d is to 
be released from the Green Belt and it is to be allocated for employment use 
in the Local Plan for the period to 2038. These Green Belt land releases are 
recognised as causing moderate -high harm to the Green Belt, but they will 
redress the signific ant deficit of employment land and business development 
opportunities in the town.  
5.212.  The release of the employment land in its entirety is to facilitate the 
comprehensive planning of the new employment area with the assurance 
that all this land is committed  for employment development. This defines the 
‘risk’ for the planning, development and delivery of this new employment 
area to give confidence to the market to invest in the economic future of 
Shifnal. This aspiration is based on two key assumptions about employment 
development in Shropshire that employment land is developed to finished 
floorspace at 40% of the total land area such that around 40 hectares of land 
will deliver 16 hectares of built development. Secondly, commercial 
‘production’  buildings are developed as single storey properties that here, 
are expected to largely provide Class es B2 and B8 uses serving the sub -
regional supply chains on the A5, M54 and M6 corridors  but that appropriate 
secondary employment uses may achieve two storeys or more subject to 
appropriate building height considerations reflecting the Green Belt location 
and the surrounding landscape .  
5.213.  Shropshire Council considers that a number of Green Belt sites, promoted 
through the Local Plan Review, may be used to provide strategic 
opportunities to meet the longer -term development needs of Shifnal. These 
land releases respond to the strategic direct ions for growth based on the 
preferences for housing development to the south and west of the town and 
employment development to the east of the town.  
5.214.  The land to be released for employment to the east is individually assessed 
as having a moderate -high ha rm, the land to be released for housing to the 
south and west of the town is individually assessed as having either 
moderate -high or moderate harm. It is considered that, there is sufficient 
evidence of ‘exceptional circumstances’ in Shifnal to justify the  release of 
this land from the Green Belt. To allocate the land for employment now for 
the period to 2038 and to safeguard the land for future housing development 
after 2038.  It should also be noted that, the proposed safeguarded land to 
the south of Shifn al includes land between the A464 and Park Lane which is 
part of an Opportunity Area where the effect of releasing the land from  the 
Green Belt will only have moderate harm.  
5.215.  At this time, it is expected the land releases to the south and west of the 
town w ill be safeguarded for a strategic housing extension capable of 
creating a new neighbourhood community to deliver:  
a. A new strategic highway from the A464 (south) to the B4169, leading to ; Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 266 
  b. Significant range and choice of new housing to meet local needs;  
c. Highway improvements at Five Ways and Innage Road, and  
d. A future opportunity to connect the A4169 and the A464 through the 
railway embankment creating a ‘safety valve’ for the capacity of the Five 
Ways junction;  
e. Improved access to community facilities and commercial services in the 
town with the potential to off er further services including:  
i. Capacity of core services including schools, GP surgery and other 
health care;  
ii. Extending the retail offer to provide a choice and deflect trade within 
Shifnal away from Telford and other alternative locations;  and 
iii. Providing v ehicle services for fuel or vehicle charging to deflect trade 
within Shifnal from the motorway services and other alternative 
locations . 
f. a significant net gain in Green Infrastructure and the management of 
flooding;  and 
g. improved access into the town, to recreational open space and to the 
countryside in the Green Belt to enhance its environmental quality and 
accessibility.  
5.216.  The provision of a strategic link between the A464 Wolverhampton Road and 
the A4169 Bridgnorth Road will effectively create a by -pass a round the town. 
This will enable though traffic to avoid the principal highway junction in the 
town centre where the A464 meets Bradford Street. Delivery of this growth 
will occur beyond the current Local Plan period to 2038.  
5.217.  It is considered that the stra tegic opportunities identified in Shifnal will, over 
time, address the structural constraints affecting the function and operation 
of the town and contribute to improving the strategic physical, social and 
economic infrastructure. To realise the potential of Shifnal , it is necessary to 
release significant land parcels from the Green Belt.  These land parcels will 
be safeguarded for future development except for the employment land 
releases which will be allocated for development as part of the current Local  
Plan strategy.

  S16. Shrewsbury Place Plan Area  
 
S16.1.  Development Strategy: Shrewsbury Strategic  Centre  
1. Shrewsbury is the Strategic Centre of Shropshire and the primary focus for new 
development  in the County . Recognising th is role, and building upon the priority 
established in the Big Town Plan to achieve balanced growth,  between 2016 and 
2038 around 8,625 dwellings will be delivered and around  100 hectares  of employment 
land will be  made available for development, to provide choice and competition in the 
market . New housing and employment will make provision for the needs of the town and 
surrounding hinterland, including attracting inward investment and allowing existing 
businesses to expand   
2. A comprehensive and co -ordinated approach will be pursued to the planning and 
development  of Shrewsbury , and to ensure that development is  consistent with the 
objectives of the  Big Town Plan ’ and its associated masterplan documents , which are 
material cons ideration s in decision making . The broad  principles of the Big Town Plan  
are captured within Policy SP1: The Shropshire Test  of this Local Plan.  
3. Within Shrewsbury, n ew residential development will primarily be delivered through a 
combination of the saved SAMDev residential and mixed -use allocations  and the Local 
Plan residential  and mixed -use allocations . This will be complemented by significant 
residential and mixed -use development opportunities within the Shrewsbury 
development boundary, and in par ticular the town centre,  where it is consistent with the 
relevant policies of this Local Plan.    
4. New allocations identified in Schedules 16.1(i) and 16.1(ii) and identified on the Policies 
Map, provide an appropriate distribution of  development  opportuni ties, but include a 
focus for growth to the West of the town  particularly north and south of Mytton Oak 
Road.  Development  in this area will be expected to explore  all opportun ities to deliver a 
coordinated approach to infrastructure provision,  including the provision of a coordinated 
network of green networks,  pedestrian and cycle links and vehicle access 
arrangements .  Development will support necessary improvements to both local and 
strategic highway infrastructure where this need is not bein g met by other means.        
5. New residential development will also be delivered on  appropriate cross -subsidy and 
exception development sites, where it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
6. To foster economic development an d reflect Shrew sbury ’s strategic role  as the main 
centre  for employment in the County , a significant supply of employment land has been 
identified. New employment development will primarily be delivered through a 
combination of the saved SAMDev  mixed -use and employment allocations and Local 
Plan mixed -use and employment allocations. Opportunities to enhance the  existing  high-
quality employment facilities within and on the edge of the town cen tre and business 
parks on the periphery of the town , including Battlefield Enterprise Park, Shrewsbury 
and Oxon Business Parks  will be  supported .  
7. The delivery of the North West Relief Road (NWRR) is supported in principle , and as 
such the proposed line of the road is identified on the Policies Map .  Development 
opportunities between the proposed  NWRR and the Development Boundary will  be 
guided by  Policy SP10 .  In this area it is recognised that  windfall employment proposals 
on appropriate sites adjoining the development boundary will be supported in principle 
where they meet the requirements of Policies SP13  and SP14  and where suitable 
vehicular  access can be provided .  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 269 
  8. The extent of the Town Centre and Primary Shopping Area  is defined on the Policies 
Map, and development in this area will be managed by Policy SP12 .  Consistent with the 
aspirations of the Big Town Plan, the defined Town Centre represents a particular 
opportunity for mixed -use development incorporating retail, leisure, residential and 
employment. Proposals which support the delivery of the objectives of the Big Town 
Plan, and which are in line with the other policies of the Local Plan, will be supported.  
This includes the creation of a corridor of opportunity  running from the West End, to  the 
Riverside, to the Northern Corridor to the Flaxmill Maltings. Such development will 
benefit from and contribute to the vibrancy and character of the area whilst also 
providing opportunities to diversify and extend the town centre offer.  
9. In recognis ing the  importance of the town’s distinctive  retail offer  as part of a wider mix 
of main town centre uses, and the need to retain a vital and via ble centre, the defined 
Primary Shopping Area  will be the preferred location for new retail development in the 
town , with proposal s being managed by Policy SP12 .  This offer will continue to  be 
complemented by the existing  facilities at Meole Brace and Sundorne Retail Parks, but 
the expansion of these areas will generally only be considered for non -high street uses 
and where it can be demonstrated to have no  significant adverse impacts  to the Town 
Centre. There is a presumption against any new  edge and  out of centre Retail Parks.    
10. Shrewsbury will be a major focus within Shropshire for the provision of infrastructure and 
services to meet the needs of the town and its wider catchment ar ea, with current 
priorities set out in the Implementation Plan and Shrewsbury Place Plan.   Opportunities 
for the following will be supported in principle:  
a. The reinforce ment  and enhanc ement of the local and strategic highway network  
though  the delivery of measures supporting the Shrewsbury Integrated Transport 
Strategy , the Big Town Plan Movement Strategy  and the Shropshire Local Transport  
Plan, as well as any other  highway and junction improvements required to support 
development and the propos ed Shrewsbury North West Relief Road;  
b. Improvements to regional and national connectivity associated with  the railway and 
the opportunities to create new and enhance existing  sustainable connections to this 
infrastructure;  
c. The m anagement and enhancement of the strategic corridors associated with the 
River Severn and its tributaries , especially where  this presents opportunities to 
alleviate flood risk ;  
d. Improvements to green and blue infrastructure, both through the delivery of allocated 
sites and other measures ; and 
e. Opportunities to enhance the high -quality education facilities offered within the town, 
including those assoc iated with th e University Centr e – Shrewsbury.  
11. Development proposals will be expected to demonstrate that they have adequately 
assessed and mitigated their impacts, having regard to the need for the co -ordination of 
infrastructure provision and improvements  across the town to address th e particular 
challenges faced by Shrewsbury . Development proposals should take account of 
infrastructure constraints and requirements, as identified within the Implementation Plan 
and Place  Plans  and any site and settlement infrastructure modelling and/or assessment 
and positively contribute towards local infrastructure improvements, including the 
provision of community benefits in accordance with Polic y DP25 .  
12. In recognition  of the special character of the town and its particular environmental 
challenges, the development of the town will have regard to:  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 270 
  a. The promotion, conservation and enhancem ent of the town’s natural and historic 
features, heritage assets, green corridors and spaces, and  
b. Environmental quality , including the corridors of the River Severn and its tributaries, 
the town centre and the registered battlefield.  
13. The development  of the saved SAMDev Plan Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUE’s) to 
the South and West  of Shrewsbury identified on the Policies Map will be supported, 
provided that  the development delivers the scale , type and mix  of development set out in 
the sav ed SAMDev Plan site guidelines , and has regard to t he requirements of the 
respective  Masterplan s, including the provision of identified infrastructure requirements  
and relevant financial contributions.  
14. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendix 2  of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site allocations are identified in Schedules 
S16.1(i) and S16.1(ii) below and identified on the Policies Map. Development of site 
allocations should be in accordance with specified development guidelines and 
approximate site provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
15. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within  relevant community -led plans and any masterplans that are adopted by 
Shropshire Council.

enhancements to public transport infrastructure . 
The site is capable of delivering a rage of employment 
uses , including B2 a nd B8, a lthough the strategic  nature 
of the site lends itself to the development of high quality 
uses capable of generating a significant number of jobs , in 
line with the Shropshire Economic Growth Strategy and 
Policies SP12  and SP13 .  
An appropriate vehicular access will be created from the 
A49 and all necessary improvements to the Local and 
Strategic Road Networks will be undertaken, informed by 
cons ultation with Highways England and an appropriate 
Transport Assessment (including consideration of 
cumulative impact).  
The potential to achieve enhanced connectivity to the rail 
network will be fully explored and any viable opportunities 
identified will be implemented.  
Development will create and enhance pedestrian and 
cycle links within and through the site and implement 
appropriate links from the site into the town . 
An odour assessment will be required to assess any 
impact from the Mon kmoor Waste Water Treatment Plant 
on the development (as evidenced in the Shropshire 
Water Cycle Study) and to suggest any mitigation 
measu res.  
A heritage assessment will be required to  inform  the site’s 
layout and massing , and the site must be read within the 
context of its se tting of Haughmond Hill  and Queen

Explanation  
5.220.  Shrewsbury will continue to act as the County’s Strategic Centre, and the 
ambitions for its growth ref lect this. However, this role is not purely about 
growth; it ’s about how the town creates and enhances its green spaces, 
transport infrastructure, environment  and community facilities amon gst other 
things. At the heart of this is the delivery of the objectives of the Big Town 
Plan; a visionary urban design document  which has established a compelling 
and challenging shared vision and development framework for the town.  
The adopted Big Town Plan is supported by a series of master -planning 
documents, focussing on specific locations  in and around the edge of the 
town ce ntre, as well as a strategic transport and movement framework.  The 
Big Town Plan and its associated documents are  a significant material factor 
in the proposed strategy for the town to 2038 , and will be considerations in 
decision making.   
5.221.  The strategy pr ovides a number of large -scale allocations to deliver a range 
of development. These allocations utilise opportunities on the periphery of 
the town presented by the natural boundary of the A5, but also seeks to 
balance th is with windfall  proposals within and on the edge of the town 
centre, in particular as part of town centre regeneration proposals  which 
seek to enable a successful transition from a ‘retail led ’ town centr e.  
5.222.  The creation of green infrastructure links is an important cons ideration for 
the town, but there is a lso a  need to maintain existing good quality open 
space and recreation provision , especially where this provision provides a 
‘green lung’ to an otherwise urban character .  In doing so the priority for the 
delivery of residential windfall development is on brownfield sites within and 
on the edge of the town centre, served by good quality pedestrian and cycle 
links.   
5.223.  Significant new development  is proposed both north and south of  Mytton 
Oak Road to the west of the town.  It is expected that these proposals,  whilst 
coming forward separately  in line with the guidelines proposed in Schedule 
S16.1(i) , will provide a  coordinated  approach to development , especially in 
supporting improvements to the town’s green infrastructure p rovision in 
association with Policy DP14 , and to ensure improvements to the local 
highway network take account of the cumulative impact of development.    
5.224.  A key feature of the development proposals is the requirement for the 
applican t to undertake to undertake further master -planning work to support 
their respective scheme s.  This reflects the strategic nature of many of the 
allocations  and the importance of ensuring a sustainable approach, which Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 278 
  captures amongst other things the impo rtance of land equalisation 
agreements (where required), good and consistent design, good quality 
open space, the relationship between different land uses and appropriate 
provision and financial contribution towards infrastructure.  The timely 
provision of  infrastructure is particularly important and masterplans will be 
required to establish an appropriate phasing plan showing delivery of 
necessary on -site services and facilities, as well as any other infrastructure 
provision, including where this will need  to be delivered by other parties.  In 
line with Policy DP25 , the priority of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
funds derived from individual s chemes will be to support the delivery of the 
scheme, which includes contributions to both local and strategic road 
improvements , where required.  Where it is considered the CIL is insufficient 
to fund all necessary improvements, additional developer contributions will 
be required          
5.225.  The strategy also reflects the potential development opportunities presented 
by the delivery o f the North West Relief Road (NWRR). The NWRR is 
proposed to deliver a new single carriageway road linking the northern and 
western parts of the  town between the Ellesmere Road and Churncote 
roundabouts. The NWRR will be subject to a planning application i n 202 1, 
and whilst the Local Plan does not pre -determine the outcome of these 
considerations, it is appropriate for  the NWRR to provide important context 
regarding the delivery of development given the extent of the plan period  to 
2038 . Of most direct cons equence , development allocated at Ellesmere 
Road (SHR173) will only commence when the NWRR is operational , in light 
of the direct traffic mitigation  the proposed NWRR is forecast to achieve  as a 
result of the reduction in cross town movements.   Policy S16  also identifies 
the potential for additional windfall commercial development between the 
development bou ndary and the NWRR once constructed , where an 
appropriate access c an be achieved.  In looking at commercial windfall 
opportunities in this area particul ar regard  will be had to the objectives of  
relevant  Whole Estate Plans where they have been endorsed by the Council 
as a material planning consideration in line with Policy SP15 . It is also 
recognised given the role of the town as a strategic  centre , there may be 
other commercial opportunities arising during the lifetime of the Plan on land 
not allocated for this purp ose.  In these circumstances the Plan supports 
commercial windfall development where this is in line with policies SP12  and 
SP13 .     
5.226.  Appendix 5 and 6 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of 
residential and employment completions achieved si nce the start of the Plan 
period and commitments available within Shrewsbury, which will contribute 
towards the delivery of the town’s residential and employment development 
guidelines. Appendix 7 of the Local Plan provides information on the 
anticipated t imeframe for the delivery of the Local Plan allocations.

Community Hubs  
5.227.  There are 1 0 Community Hubs identified in the Shrewsbury Place Plan Area. 
Of these  the Local  Plan provides for new allocations in Baschurch, Bayston 
Hill, Bicton, Bomere Heath  and Ford as shown in Schedule S16.2(i) . Saved 
SAMDev Plan allocations within  the Community Hubs of Baschurch, Bomere 
Heath, Dorrington, Hanwood and Nesscliffe  are shown in Appendix 2. 
5.228.  Appendix 5 of the  Local Plan provide information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period 
and commitments available, which will contribute towards the delivery of 
each Community Hubs  residential development guideline.  Appendix 7 of the  
Local Plan provides information on the anticipated timeframe for the delivery 
of the Local Plan allocations in Community Hubs.    
5.229.  Bayston Hill is a large urban village located to the south of Shrewsbury. Due 
to the proximity between  these settlements, consistent with Community Hub 
Policy SP8, the retention of the Green Gap to the north of Bayston Hill is a 
key priority. Two Loca l Plan residential allocations have been identified in 
Bayston Hill, one of which represents the redevelopment of a former school, 
the other is located to the south of the existing built form.  
5.230.  Baschurch is a large village to the north of Shrewsbury, which benefits from 
a good range of services and facilities.  Over recent years the villages has 
experienced relatively high levels of growth, partly through planned 
development, but also as a result of speculative applications granted 
approval in an effort to b oost housing supply. The local housing requirement 
and the allocations identified to deliver this, reflect this situation and the need 
to utilise  existing opportunities, but also to ensure a balance of development 
across the village.   
5.231.  Bicton is a modest s ized village to the north west of Shrewsbury on the 
B4380.  Whilst the village benefits from a range of services and facilities, the 
growth proposal for the area has taken account of its limited scale as well as 
levels of past housing delivery.  The retent ion of local village character and 
the maintenance of a clear distinction from the eastern edge of Shrewsbury 
are key local priorities and have been reflected in the allocation on land east 
of Villa Farm  
5.232.  Bomere Heath  is a large village located to the north of Shrewsbury. 
Development within the village will meet local needs and primarily be 
delivered through the saved SAMDev Plan allocation and the two Local Plan 
allocations. The Local Plan allocations will occur in tw o phases, which will 
see complementary development and integrated vehicular, cycle and 
pedestrian links.  
5.233.  Cross Houses is a modest sized settlement, formerly part of the Countryside 
to the south -east of Shrewsbury.  Despite its former status, Cross Houses 
continued to accommodate significant housing development due to past 
housing supply issues in the County. Cross Houses is a serviced village 
comprising a series of residential roads off the main A458 from Shrewsbury 
to Much Wenlock where there are opportuni ties for infilling and 
redevelopment within the existing built form of the settlement.  
5.234.  Dorrington is a large village to the south of Shrewsbury within the parish of 
Condover, where a Neighbourhood Plan is being developed.  Whilst policy Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 286 
  S16.2 identifies th e overall growth aspirations for the village in support of its 
role as a Community Hub, it is for the Neighbourhood Plan to propose a 
localised strategy to deliver this growth, including through any site 
allocations and the identification of a development boundary if considered 
locally appropriate.  Shropshire Council acting as a consultee.  Should the 
Neighbourhood Plan propose site allocations and alterations to the 
development boundary the Policies map will be amended to reflect these 
changes.   
5.235.  Ford is a modest sized settlement on the A458 Welshpool road, located 
immediately to the west of Shrewsbury. The village has a distinct and 
separate historic core to the north with different character areas to the south 
reflecting the progressive development and i nfilling of the village towards the 
A458. There are a range of services within the village, but its core retail and 
commercial services are directly on the A458, separated from the village, 
where these services benefit from their roadside prominence but re sidents 
require a better crossing over the A458 to access these service  uses. The 
village and its historic core adjoin a local brook, that is bridged within the 
village, but this watercourse is ‘main river’ that runs into the River Severn to 
the north of F ord and the watercourse is affected by the River Severn when 
in flood. As a result, this watercourse presents a significant flood risk to land 
along the western edge of Ford. The strategy for Ford is therefore to deliver 
a single allocation on the eastern side of the village to meet the needs of the 
community. The proposed allocation will infill and complete the pattern of 
development up to the A458 frontage and an allowance for windfall 
development will also permit small scale developments in the remainder  of 
the village.  
5.236.  Hanwood is a large linear village located on the A488, south -west of 
Shrewsbury. The village is located adjacent to the village of Hanwood Bank, 
however their communities consider that they have very separate identities. 
No sites are alloc ated for development within the village, in recognition of the 
capacity of existing commitments and the constraints present within the town 
including the adjacent railway line to the north and topography to the south, 
rather the development guideline will be achieved through appropriate 
windfall development, where it complies with Policy SP8 and other relevant 
policies of this Local Plan.  
5.237.  Longden is a small village south -west of Shrewsbury which benefits from a 
range of local services and facilities. Recognising the levels of development 
which has occurred within the village over recent years, this Local Plan does 
not allocate land for deve lopment, rather the development guideline will be 
achieved through appropriate windfall development, where it complies with 
Policy SP8 and other rele vant policies of this Local Plan.  
5.238.  Nesscliffe is located under the distinctive sandstone escarpment of ‘The 
Cliffe’ to the north -west of Shrewsbury  and is the smallest Community Hub in 
terms of the size of its population .  The village was designated in the 
SAMDev Plan and attract ed significant development intere st resulting in a 
pipeline supply of housing of over 100 dwellings that exceeds the existing 
dwelling stock (83 dwellings). The Parish Council and community support the

S17.1.  Development Strategy: Wem Key Centre  
1. Wem  will act as a Key Centre and contribute towards strategic growth objectives in the 
north -east of the County, delivering around 600 dwellings and around 6 hectares of 
employment development. New housing and employment development will respond to 
local needs.  
2. New residential development will primarily be delivered through the saved SAMDev 
residential allocation s and Local Plan residential allocations.  This will be complemented 
by appropriate small -scale windfall residential development within  the Wem  
development boundary shown on the Policies Map, where it is consistent with relevant 
policies of this Local Plan. It will also be complemented by appropriate cross -subsidy 
and exception development, where it is consistent with relevant policies of this Local 
Plan.  
3. New employment development will be delivered through  the saved SAMDev 
employment allocation and appropriate small -scale employment windfall development, 
where it  is consistent with relevant policies of this Local  Plan. To recognise existing 
infrastru cture capacity constraints, the strategic location of the employment allocation is 
intended to help limit additional cross -town traffic movements by commercial vehicles.  
4. New retail development will be directed towards the town centre , in line with Policy DP9, 
where it will benefit from and contribute to the historic character of the town.  
5. Mitigation measures will be required to remove any adverse  effect from increased 
recreational pressure arising  from development in Wem on the integrity of the Cole Mere 
Ramsar site and on the Fenns, Whixall, Bettisfield, Wem and Cadney Mosses 
SAC/Ramsar site in accordance with Polices DP12 , DP14  and DP15 . Mitigation 
measures for recreational impacts are  identified in the Plan Habitat  Regulations 
Assessment (HRA) and supporting documents.  
6. Saved SAMDev Plan site allocations are listed in Appendi x 2 of this document and 
identified on the Policies Map. Local Plan site allocations are identified in Schedule 
S17.1(i) below and identified on the Policies Map. Development of site allocations 
should be in accordance with specified development guidelines  and approximate site 
provision figures and all other relevant policies of this Local Plan .  
7. Development proposals will be expected to positively respond to policies and guidelines 
identified within the Wem Town Design Statement, any other relevant community -led 
plans and any masterplans that are adopted by Shropshire Council.

Explanation  
5.241.  Wem has been identified as a Key Centre and contributes towards the 
strategic growth objectives in the north -east of the County.  There remain  
undeveloped site allocations from the SAMDev Plan which are all ‘saved’ 
and have been taken into account in the s cale and location of additional land 
allocations to support growth 2038.  
5.242.  Wem benefits  from being on the main Crewe -Shrewsbury rail line, however 
this does result in the town being somewhat separated east / west.  This 
severance is emphasised by the level crossing situated at the confluence of 
Aston Road and Soulton Road, which has led to l ocal concerns over traffic 
congestion. The distribution of new allocated sites has therefore taken 
account of this issue, and in particular the constraint this places on site 
options on the east of the level crossing .   
5.243.  The strategy therefore proposes thre e additional site allocations for the town 
to supplement the saved SAMDev allocations. These reflect local concerns 
over the traffic impact of the level crossing, but also represent sustainable 
options in themselves, as well as offering a good range of opt ions to the 
market in terms of scale and location.    
5.244.  In total the new allocations provide capacity for an additional 210 dwellings 
to the end of the plan period.  There will also be opportunities for additional 
windfall development within the development boundary, and through the 
development of affordable and cross subsidy exception schemes.

Explanation  
5.254.  The strategy for Whitchurch acknowledges the impor tant role the town plays 
within Shropshire, acting as one of its five Principal Centres.  The 
importance of additional employment development to balance housing 
growth is a long -held objective for the town and to this end it is recognised 
that it is of importance to continue to seek delivery on the town’s two ‘saved’ 
employment allocations at Heath Road and Waym ills.   
5.255.  Both these employment sites were allocated through the SAMDev Plan but 
have not yet been delivered, partly due to challenging economic conditions 
but also because of concern over infrastructure capacity.  However, since 
2016 significant progress ha s been made  on both these sites to improve the 
conditions for their delivery, through a combination of committed local 
investment into upgrading foul drainage capacity, and through proposed 
improvements by SP Manweb to support electricity infrastructure ca pacity 
upgrades as part of their North Shropshire Reinforcement Project, which in 
2020 received a Development Consent Order by the Secretary of State and 
is due to be delivered by 2022.           
5.256.  The strategy therefore has a particular focus on the deliver y of these two 
‘saved’ employment allocations as well as the delivery of the significant 
‘saved’ residential scheme at Tilstock Road for around 500 dwellings and 
associated community uses. This site benefits from outline planning 
permission, and it is expe cted to begin delivery in the early part of the plan 
period.   
5.257.  Alongside the continued emphasis on the delivery of these significant ‘saved’ 
sites, the focus of the strategy is to provide a range  of additional good quality 
residential allocations to suppor t the growth aspirations for the town to 2038.  
The three new allocations are distributed across the town in order to spread 
any localised and short -term impact of construction, but also to seek to 
provide support to a number of localised improvements.  Th is includes 
further opportunities to improve access to Whitchurch Railway Station and 
enhancements to local junctions, in particular at the turning of Wrexham 
Road and Liverpool Road.

1. There are no saved SAMDev Plan site allocations or Local Plan site  allocations within the 
wider rural area of the Whitchurch  Place Plan Area.  
 
Explanation  
5.259.  Within the Whitchurch Place Plan Area Prees has been identified as a 
Community Hub. Prees is a large village with a good range of services and 
facilities located off the A41 south of Whitchurch. Development within the 
village will meet local needs and primarily occur  on the Local Plan allocation 
and saved SAMDev Plan allocations.  However, this will be complemented by 
appropriate windfall development and appropriate cross -subsidy and 
exception development in accordance with Policy SP8 (Community Hubs) 
and other relevant policies of this Local Plan.  
5.260.  Appendix 5 of the Local Plan provide information on the levels of residential 
completions achieved in Community Hubs since the start of the Plan period

redeveloped to form a new strategic settlement which will contribute towards strategic 
growth aspirations in the north -east of the County. This predominantly brownfield site is 
around 72ha and consists of numerous military and ancillary buildings, areas of 
hardstanding and extensive green infrastructure. The location and extent of the site are 
identified on the Policies Map . 
2. The new settlement will be formed through a comprehe nsive mixed -use redevelopment 
of the site to provide a range of local services and facilities, around 750 dwellings, 
around 6ha of employment land and extensive green infrastructure.  
3. To inform this redevelopment, a comprehensive masterplan will be prepare d for the site 
and then adopted by Shropshire Council. The masterplan and resultant redevelopment 
will comply with the following site guidelines:  
a. The quantity, quality, design, mix and layout of housing provided on the site will be 
informed by site constra ints and opportunities, identified local needs and relevant 
policies of this Local Plan.  
b. Employment provision will represent an intrinsic element of the site’s 
redevelopment, occurring alongside the provision of housing. Employment provision 
will be of an appropriate quantity and quality to contribute towards the objectives of 
the Shropshire Economic Growth Strategy.  
c. The local centre will comprise of an appropriate range of commercial uses (likely to 
include a family pub plus convenience store and a smal l number of modest retail 
units) to serve the new settlements community on land fronting the A41. The local 
centre will ensure future occupiers of the site benefit from access to local facilities, 
as such its timely provision is an important consideration and will be directly linked 
to provision of housing on the site.  
d. Green infrastructure provision will be of an appropriate quantity and quality. Its 
location will integrate  and enhance key green infrastructure corridors and  network s 
on and around the site.  
e. 1ha of land will be provided for a primary school. This will enable Buntingsdale 
School and Stoke on Tern Primary School to merge on the site and crucially serve 
the needs of the new development.  
f. Any necessary improvements will be undertaken in order to ac hieve appropriate 
access points into both the eastern and western portions of the site. Any necessary 
improvements to the local and strategic road network including the A41/A53 Tern 
Hill roundabout will also be undertaken , informed by consultation with Hig hways 
England and an appropriate Transport Assessment (including consideration of 
cumulative impact). Any necessary r ecommendations from an air quality 
assessment of the impact of increased vehicular movements from this development 
on Tern Hill roundabout  will be implemented.  
g. Appropriate pedestrian and cycle links will be provided to and through the site, 
particularly to the proposed primary school and local centre. This will include 
enhancement of an underpass of the A41, to ensure pedestrian and cycle 
connectivity between the north -eastern and south -western portions of the site.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 303 
  h. Acoustic design, layout and appropriate building materials (including where 
necessary appropriate glazing, ventilation and acoustic barriers) will be used to 
appropriately manage noise arising from the adjacent airfield and nearby roads.  
i. Site design and layout, dimensions of new structures and materials used will ensure 
development of the site does not impede on the operation of the airfield and 
associated tran smitter/receiver facilities at the adjacent Ministry of Defence site.  
j. Any contaminated land on the site will be appropriately managed.  
k. The nearby River Tern and RAF Tern Hill Local Wildlife Sites will be appropriately 
buffered. Ancient woodland and priorit y habitats on the site will be retained and an 
appropriately buffered. A sustainable juxtaposition will be created between built form 
and trees.  
l. Site design and layout will reflect and respect the sites heritage and heritage assets 
within the wider area.  
m. The site will incorporate appropriate sustainable drainage, informed by a sustainable 
drainage strategy. Any residual surface water flood risk will be managed by 
excluding development from the affected areas of the site, which will form part of the 
Green I nfrastructure network. Development will also be excluded from the small 
portions of the site located in Flood Zones 2 and/or 3. Flood and water management 
measures must not displace water elsewhere.  
 
Explanation  
6.2. Clive Barracks, Tern Hill is a 72ha military site located near Market Drayton. 
The site is currently home to the 1st (Regular) Battalion of the Royal Irish 
Regiment. However, in March 2016 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) 
announced plans to relocate the regiment and dispose of the Barracks for 
redevelopment.  
6.3. The Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire identifies an objective to 
prioritise investment in strategic locations and growth zones along strategic 
corridors utilising existing road and rail connections.  
6.4. Clive Barracks , Tern Hill is locate d on the A41, a strategic corridor within the 
Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire. As such appropriate 
redevelopment of the site following the relocation of the main occupiers and 
uses will contribute towards achieving the aspirations of the Economic G rowth 
Strategy. Importantly redevelopment of this site will also contribute towards 
achieving the housing and employment needs of Shropshire and a llow the 
effective re -use of a predominantly brownfield site.  
6.5. The mixed -use redevelopment of Clive Barracks, T ern Hill to form a new 
strategic settlement will contribute to growth aspirations in the north -east of 
the County by providing:  
a. Economic opportunities through the provision of local employment 
opportunities.  
b. Social and environmental opportunities resultin g from the provision of 
additional new homes, local services and facilities, extensive green 
infrastructure and provision of a modern purpose -built school to replace 
existing facilities.  
6.6. Any redevelopment of the site must positively respond to the constraints and 
opportunities that such a site represents, the identified guidelines alongside  
the other relevant Policies of this Local Plan  provide certainty that the Final 
Masterplan and resul tant redevelopment will do so.

Explanation  
6.7. The Former Ironbridge Power Station ceased operation in 2015. The partly 
brownfield site is around 140ha and comprises the former Power Stations, 
associated uses and agricultural land.  
6.8. The Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire identified the opportunity to 
capitalise on the significant  strategic opportunity arising from the 
redevelopment of the  Former Ironbridge Power Station site.  
6.9. As such, appropriate redevelopment of the site will contribute towards 
achieving the aspirations  of the Economic Growth Strategy. Importantly, it will 
also contribute towards meeting housing and employment needs in 
Shropshire and a llow the effective re -use of the brownfield elements of the 
site. 
6.10.  Specifically,  the mixed -use redevelopment of the Former Ironbridge Power 
Station to form a new strategic settlement will contribute to growth aspirations 
in the east of the Cou nty by providing:  
a. Economic opportunities through the provision of local employment 
opportunities.  
b. Social and environmental opportunities resulting from the provision of 
additional new homes, local services and facilities, extensive green 
infrastructure and provision of a new school.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 306 
  6.11.  Any redevelopment of the site must positively respond to the constrai nts and 
opportunities that such a site represents, the identified guidelines alongside

  7. Strategic S ite Policy 
7.1. This section of the Local Plan contains the polic y relating to the Strategic Site 
at RAF Cosford.  
S21. Strategic Site: RAF Cosford  
1. RAF Cosford will become a strategic site, complementing and enabling growth 
aspirations in the east of the County. Employment and training provision on this strategic 
site will facilitate the sustainable growth of the local economy and contribute to meeting 
the employment needs of nearby Albrighton.  
2. The strategic site consists of around 2 21ha of land, over half of which is previously 
developed. The site is inset in the Green Belt, in recognition of its existing and future 
operational areas and requirements. How ever, Green Belt is retained between Cosford 
and Albrighton to maintain a strategic gap, in recognition of their unique identities and 
characteristics and the operational requirements of the Strategic Site. The location and 
extent of the site is identified  on the Policies Map.  
3. The strategic site will build upon its existing role as a centre of excellence for both UK 
and International Defence Training, host a specialist aviation academy, support 
opportunities to co -locate other Ministry of Defence units and  activities, facilitate the 
intensification and expansion of the RAF Museum Cosford and allow the formation of a 
new headquarters for the Midland Air Ambulance Charity. These complementary uses 
will each benefit from their co -location and support the estab lishment of an 
internationally renowned facility.  
4. Development of the various elements of this site will be coordinated and  
complementary . This will be  informed by the preparation of detailed masterplans  for 
each elem ent of the site , informed by proactive engagement , including  with relevant 
landowners/occupiers of the wider Strategic Site ; and will subsequent ly be  adopt ed by 
Shropshire Council . These  masterplans and any resultant development will comply with 
the following site guidelines:  
a. Any new development required to support Ministry of Defence activities will through 
their design, layout and use of green infrastructure, complement the high -quality 
character of the ex isting site.  
b. The element of the site identified on Figure S21.1 for the Midlands Air Ambulance 
Charity headquarters and its ancillary uses will be used only for this purpose . 
Development and use of this element of the site  must not adversely impact on 
Ministry of Defence operations  at RAF Cosford. The northern boundary of this 
component of the site will be subject to substantial appropriate boundary 
landscaping in order to create a defensible Green Belt boundary. The headquarters 
building and ancillary uses  will be of high quality and sustainable design, creating a 
fitting home for this much valued charity.  
c. Any new development required to support the expansion of The RAF Museum 
Cosford will be of a high -quality design and layout which will complement existin g 
iconic museum buildings and the relationship with an operational airfield.  
d. Where development increases use of Cosford Railway Station, commensurate and 
viable improvements to the railway station , station cycle parking  and station car 
parking will be prov ided to support sustainable travel to and from the development 
and the wider strategic site.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 308 
  e. Appropriate improvements to existing access points will be undertaken and any 
additional access points and vehicular links within the site will be appropriately 
designed and constructed.  
f. Any necessary improvements to the local and strategic road network will be 
undertaken, informed by consultation with Highways England and an appropriate 
Transport Assessment (including consideration of cumulative impact).  
g. Appropriate pedestrian and cycle links will be provided through the site, taking into 
account that public access is restricted within parts of the site. This should include 
improvements to the existing links between the railway station, The RAF Museum 
Cosford and new Midlands Air Ambulance Charity headquarters.  Consideration 
should also be given to opportunities for improvements to pedestrian and cycle links 
into Albrighton . 
h. Existing open space , sports and recreational buildings and land , including playing 
fields,  will be maintained , unless an assessment concludes that it is clearly surplus 
to requirements  or equivalent /better provision is made, in terms of quantity and 
quality in a suitable location .  
i. Appropriate green infrastructure provision will be made,  including areas of public 
open space (taking into account that public access is restricted within parts of the 
site). Green infrastructure provision will incorporate and enhance the key green 
infrastructure corridors and ne twork s within and in proximity o f the site.  
j. Natural environment assets on and in proximity to the site, including m ature trees, 
hedgerows and priority habitats will be retained and appropriately buffered. 
Appropriate provision will also be made for protected species, where relevant.  
k. The high-quality design and layout of new development proposals will reflect and 
respect the site’s heritage, heritage assets on the site and any relationship with 
heritage assets within the wider area. Listed and locally important buildings on the 
site will b e sympathetically retained, enhanced/maintained and adaptively reused.  
l. Noise, odour and any contaminated land will be appropriately considered and if 
necessary mitigated.  
m. Any n ew development on t he site will incorporate appropriate sustainable drainage, 
informed by a sustainable drainage strategy. Any residual surface water flood risk 
will be managed by excluding new development from the affected areas . New 
development will also be excluded from t he very small portion of the site located in 
flood zones 2 and/or 3 . Flood and water management measures must not displace 
water elsewhere.  
n. Opportunities to reinforce Green Belt boundaries , reduce and mitigate impacts on 
the Green Belt  and enhance benefici al use of the Green Belt  will be included as part 
of any new development proposals as set out in Green Belt Policy  SP11 . 
Compensatory provision to the  Green Belt will include  appropriate additional 
planting to improve visual amenity and biodiversity  and creati on of linkages to green 
infrastructure networks and corridors  beyond the site.  
 
Explanation  
7.2. RAF Cosford is a military base and airfield located wholly in the Green Belt, to 
the north west of Albrighton. The site is also occupied by the Midlands Air 
Ambulance  Charity , West Midlands Police and the renowned  RAF Museum 
Cosford .  
7.3. RAF Cosford is currently a major part of the Defence College of T echnical 
Training (DCTT). It is at the centre of the RAF’s mission to deliver flexible, Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 309 
  affordable, modern and effective technical training that meets the needs of the 
UK’s Armed Forces now and into the future.  
7.4. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is undertaking a ‘Defence Optimisation 
Programme’ the aim of which is to create a smaller and significantly better 
estate that effectively supports our armed forces, and their role in protecting 
the security, independence and interests of the UK at home and abroad.  
7.5. Within this review, as a result of its strategic location, existing built estate, the 
important role the site plays in defence training and its future potential, RAF 
Cosford has been designated a ‘receiver site’ and will have an important role 
to play in the f uture optimisation of the MOD estate.  
7.6. Cosford has since been referenced within the ‘Better Defence Estate Strategy’ 
as centre of excellence for both UK and International Defence Training. The 
document also refers to the relocation of 4 School of Technical Training from 
MOD St Athan to RAF Cosford.  
7.7. Furthermore, as part of its future strategy, the DCTT is reviewing capacity at 
RAF Cosford, linked to their aspiration to exploit opportunities for technical 
training consolidation . Whilst this work is ongoing, es timates from DCTT high -
level strategic estate planning indicate that over the next 10+ years RAF 
Cosford would see in the region of an additional 1,500 people (staff and 
student population), although this could potentially increase further dependant 
on the  outcome of the ongoing work.  
7.8. Work is also being undertaken by the MOD to capture and consolidate 
information on the feasibility of other potential non -DCTT moves to RAF 
Cosford.  
7.9. To support these various activities, there will be a need to  intensify the use of 
existing facilities  and undertake new development to provide additional 
necessary facilities. This will likely include additional training facilities, 
technical accommodation and domestic accommodation.  
7.10.  Plans to form a specialist aviation academy, called the Whittle Engineering 
Academy, at RAF Cosford have recently been announced by the Aviation 
Skills Partnership in collaboration  with Midlands Engine, the RAF, Air Cadets 
and Telford College. This is a major initiative to address demand for trained 
entrants to the Aviation Industry across all jobs, roles and skills in accordance 
with the Government’s Green Paper Aviation 2050: The Future of UK Aviation. 
It also further elevates the importance of this location for UK aviation and 
potentially creates h undreds of new jobs at the site.  
7.11.  The RAF Museum Cosford is dedicated to the history of aviation and in 
particular the RAF. As such the museum provides an important record of our 
aviation and RAF history, whilst also representing a nationally significant 
visitor attraction. The RAF Museum Cosford  also hosts the ever popular 
Cosford Air Show. The RAF Museum Cosford have announced ambitious 
plans for a £40 million investment programme over 10 years to intensify and 
expand the museum site.  
7.12.  The Midlands  Air Amb ulance Charity (MAAC) currently operates and funds 
three air ambulances covering six Midlands counties including 
Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and 
the West Midlands. The area is home to around 6 million people an d since 
1991, the Charity have undertaken over 50,000 missions, making them one of 
the busiest ambulance services in the UK.  Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 310 
  7.13.  The charity responds to some of the most traumatic incidents including 
cardiac arrests, road traffic collisions and sports injuries . The aircraft reaches 
remote locations to attend to patients unreachable by land ambulance. The air 
ambulance is an essential and emergency public service.  
7.14.  The MAAC require a new headquarters in order to combine two of their The 
MAAC requires a new headquarters to future proof the region’s essential 
helicopter -led emergency services and accommodate the projected 4% 
annual increase in demand for the service. T he co -location of facilities at this 
new headquarters will enable the charity to optimise all aspects of its 
operations, including medical, training and charitable ancillary services.  
7.15.  The new MAAC headquarters will act as the hub for operations, supplemen ted 
by a series of regional sites across the  six Counties of Gloucestershire, 
Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, the West Midlands and 
Worcestershire . When combined, the service network will maximize the 
efficiency of the charity and increase capaci ty via extended operating 
schedules. Alongside providing enhanced service provision, the new MAAC 
headquarters will support the sustainability of the charity, for example by 
increasing potential for community engagement and events, whilst providing a 
high-quality modern training facility and permanent office accommodation.  
7.16.  The location identified for the new MAAC headquarters and associated 
facilities within the RAF Cosford Strategic Site is identified on Figure S21.1 
below. This area is defined by Neachley  Lane to the east, the railway line to 
the south , a wooded area to the west  and runs through an agricultural field to 
the north. The Strategic Site guidelines require the establishment of an 
appropriate northern boundary for this element of the site.

the Strategic Site within the RAF Cosford Strategic Site   
   
Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan                            Page 311 
  7.17.  This site is ideally located for the MAAC headquarters and associated facilities  
as: 
a. It is of sufficient size and free from overhead obstructions;  
b. It is outside of major residential areas;  
c. It is within appropriate flight times of the region covered by the facility;  
d. It benefits from good access to the major road network needed by  the 
critical care paramedic vehicle / rapid response vehicles;  
e. It has good access to public transport links for staff and visitors;  
f. The airspace / routes surrounding the site are sufficiently free to allow for 
the unfettered operation of the helicopters;  
g. It has a pre -existing controlled and understood air space through which the 
Charity is used to flying; and  
h. The site offers the benefits of co -location with other users of the R AF 
Cosford Strategic Site.  
7.18.  Identification  of RAF Cosford as a Strategic Site inset within the Green Belt 
enable s these numerous and complementary development opportunities. In 
turn, these development opportunities will complement and facilitate delivery 
of the Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire  and the objectives of this 
Local Plan . 
7.19.  Specifically, the Economic Growth Strategy for Shropshire seeks to prioritise 
investment in strategic locations and growth zones along strategic corridors. 
The M54 corridor  upon which RAF Cosford is located is one such strategic 
corridor.  Whilst t he intensification and further development of the RAF Cosford 
Strategic Site is for military and non -profit making uses, they will complement 
and facilitate investment on this strat egic corridor. For instance, the RAF 
Cosford Strategic Site will provide education opportunities, access to a skilled 
workforce, opportunities for the co -location of supply chain and opportunities 
for complementary employment offer. In this way, developmen t of the 
Strategic Site will also contribute towards meeting the objectives of the Local 
Plan, complementing and facilitating economic growth aspirations in the east 
of the County.  
7.20.  Identification of RAF Cosford as a Strategic Site and as such facilitating its 
further development , also increases the long -term sustainability of the site, 
ensuring its continued use as a MOD facility.

Regulation  19: Pre -Submission Draft of the Shropshire Local Plan          Page 352 Appendix 7:  Forecast of Delivery Timescales for Local Plan  Allocations  
A7.1.  Schedule A7 sets out indicative timescales for the development  of the Local Plan allocations . These forecasts  are considered to  
represent cautious  assumptions based on the best available information  currently available . However, it is acknowledged that  the 
delivery timescale s for many of these allocations will  change over the Local P lan period . 
A7.2.  The schedule is split into five -year time periods, with short -term representing the  five-year period from 2020/21 to 2024/25 , medium -
term representing the five -year period from 2025/26 -2029/30 and long -term rep resenting the remaining period of the Local Pl an from 
2030/31 -2037/38.  A category for beyond the Local Plan period is also included, where development of the site is expected to continue 
beyond the current Local Plan period.  
A7.3.  It is not considered necessary to seek to phase the delivery of these allocations , although development on the large r sites (and 
particularly those for a mix of uses) within the Strategic, Principal and Key Centres and the development of the Strategic Settlements 
will need to be undertaken in a coordinated manor to ensure that they deliver sustainable,  comprehensive , high-quality and  
complementary development  which meets local needs . On such sites  masterplanning exercises will be necessary to manage the ir 
development , where this is the case this is specifically identified within the development guidelines for the site allocation . 
A7.4.  The forecasts of delivery timescales for Local Plan  allocations directly informs the Residential and Employment  Trajector ies included 
within the Explanation to Policy SP2. These Trajectories illustrate how th e housing and employment requirement s are expected to be 
met over the Local P lan period, including forecast completions for each year. Th ese Trajector ies will be kept up to date and a revised 
version published each financial year within the Council’s A uthority  Monitoring Report (AMR).
