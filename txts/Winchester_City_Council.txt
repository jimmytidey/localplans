7.1 The Community Strategy recognises that the vitality of the District
comes from the people that live and work here, in that they are ableto live active and healthy lifestyles, in communities where there arelow levels of crime and people feel safe. Key links with this Local Planrelate to the provision of housing, including addressing affordablehousing needs, providing opportunities for everyone to become moreactive through the provision of sports facilities and access to theseand other forms of informal recreation via walking and cycling andthe need to improve access to services, in particular with regard tothe ageing population. 
7.2 The Council’s Housing Strategy
24, identifies a number of challenges
which are supported by the following priorities for this Local Plan:- 
Gto maximise the supply of high quality affordable housing inurban and rural areas to meet local needs;
Gto ensure an adequate housing supply to support the localeconomy and meet local needs, including enabling affordablehousing to be provided on rural exception sites.
7.3 The City Council is fully aware that its population is aging and has an
established Older People’s Partnership
25and subsequent action plan. The
action plan expresses a new strategic approach to the well-being of all peopleas they grow older and looks across the spectrum of older people’s well-beingissues. Many of these have links with spatial planning in terms of access tofacilities and services such as leisure, transport, housing, environment, healthand social care. This complements the Hampshire Primary Care Trust’s Strategy‘Healthy Horizons’ which identifies ‘dealing with the effects of an agingpopulation’ as a key action.
7.4 The South East Plan sets housing requirements for the District for the period
2006-2026. During the preparation of this Plan the Government announced itsintention to abolish regional strategies but this had not been implemented atthe time of submitting the Plan for examination. Accordingly, this Plan hasbeen developed so as to be in general conformity with the housingrequirements of the South East Plan for the period 2006-2026.
7.5 The City Council has taken the opportunity to develop a local housing target
and rolled-forward the Plan period to 2011-2031. It has undertaken an assessment of the population changes
26and housing
needs that will occur across the District during the Plan period and hasproduced and updated the Strategic Housing Market Assessment
27. These
documents and other evidence provide a detailed insight into the housingneeds of the District, both in terms of the amount and type of housingneeded. The locally-derived level of housing growth that is needed is12,500 dwellings in the period 2011-2031.
7.6 This amount of housing is required to ensure that communities
remain sustainable, that local aspirations in terms of housingmix and range of tenures are met and that the District canmaintain its economic vitality. Affordable housing needs areconsiderable and Policy CP3 seeks the maximum level ofaffordable housing provision that is viable, in conjunctionwith new development. However, this alone will not fullymeet affordable housing needs and other means ofimproving affordable housing provision will be sought,including making better use of the existing stock and

Active Communitiesdeveloping schemes which contain a higher proportion of affordable housing.
The policies of this Plan allow for local communities of all sizes to identify andmeet their housing needs, including through ‘exceptions sites’ where this isnot possible within existing settlements. The Council and the National ParkAuthority will monitor the delivery of these schemes and may allocate sites foraffordable housing provision where necessary to bring forward adequatehousing.
7.7 The spatial strategy for the District allocates the majority of the housing
provision to the most sustainable areas, namely Winchester Town and theSouth Hampshire Urban Areas. Three large-scale ‘strategic allocations’ aremade in these locations, which will deliver about 8,000 of the required 12,500dwellings. These allocations will take some time to plan and will deliverhousing over a long period of time. This will affect the rate of housingdelivery, which will not be even over the Plan period.
7.8 In addition to the strategic allocations at Winchester, West of Waterlooville
and North Whiteley, provision is made for development within the largersettlements in the District and to meet local housing needs (Policy CP1). 
7.9 A number of sources of provision will contribute to meeting the total housing
requirement as set out below. A trajectory showing the expected contributionof each type of site is included in Appendix F .
Total Housing Provision 
Source: WCC 
7.10 The Annual Monitoring Report will provide regular updates of housing land
supply, enabling site information to be updated on an annual basis. The latestinformation will be used to inform the preparation of Local Plan Part 2 whichwill review settlement boundaries and allocate any smaller sites necessary toensure that the housing requirement is met. In view of the length of the Planperiod it is appropriate to make an allowance for the emergence ofsmall/unidentified sites, based on previous and expected rates of developmentfor this type of site.
7.11 The housing requirements of the South Hampshire Urban Areas will be met
mainly by the strategic allocations at West of Waterlooville and North Whiteley.The North Winchester strategic allocation will meet a large part of WinchesterTown’s needs. For the rest of the Winchester Town requirement, and in theMarket Towns and Rural Area, a sequential approach will be adopted wherebysources of housing supply within existing settlement boundaries will bereassessed and updated before these boundaries are extended or sites outsideof them allocated (in accordance with Policies WT1, MTRA2 and MTRA3). Theexact scale of any releases which may be needed will be reviewed, and site-specific allocations made, through Local Plan Part 2 or Neighbourhood Plans.

Provision will be made within the District for the provision of
about 12,500 dwellings (net) in the period April 2011 to March2031, distributed between the three spatial areas as follows:
Winchester Town 4,000 dwellingsSouth Hampshire Urban Areas 6,000 dwellingsMarket Towns and Rural Area 2,500 dwellingsApproximately 8,000 of this total will be within major
developments at North Winchester (2,000), West of Waterlooville(2,500) and North Whiteley (3,500). The spatial strategy for theDistrict is set out in detail in Policies WT1, SH1 and MTRA1.
7.12 The strategic allocations, in particular, have a long lead-in time and it
is not the intention to use phasing policies to artificially delay thepermitting or implementation of these sites, provided they can ensureadequate and timely infrastructure provision. It is recognised thatthese sites need to be available for development at the earliest opportunity andwill be developed over a long period, with flexibility to meet a range of housingneeds and market situations.
Housing Priorities and Housing Mix
7.13 It is the objective of Government and the City Council that everyone should
have the opportunity to live in a high quality, well designed home, insustainable, inclusive and mixed communities that they want to live in andwhich they can afford.
7.14 The Council has assessed the housing needs and demands of the District
through, for instance, its Strategic Housing Market Assessment
28and this,
underpins its approach to housing provision. It is essential to plan to meet theneeds of all parts of the community, including families and older persons, andto support the local economy. Particular priority will be given to the provisionof affordable housing within the overall supply of new housing.
7.15 The Council’s key housing priorities are:
Gto maintain the supply of housing so that it meets a wide range of
community needs and to sustain the vibrancy of the local economy;
Gto maximise the provision of new affordable housing throughout theDistrict, including rural areas;
Gto increase the supply of family housing;
Gto support the delivery of community aspirations for appropriatedevelopment.
7.16 The Council’s aim is to create a flexible dwelling stock that helps to meet this
wide range of needs, including homes most able to meet the requirements ofa broad cross section of the population, most particularly 2 and 3 bedroomhouses. It is estimated that overall around 65% of new demand will be for 2and 3 bed homes, to cater for small families, newly forming households andpeople looking to downsize, while specifically in the affordable sector thelevels are estimated to be between 60 and 80%.
7.17 Adaptable accommodation such as Lifetime Homes, will help meet a range of
needs, including those of an ageing population. There is also a need forspecialist forms of accommodation such as extra care housing for older

Core Policies 
Active Communitiespersons, homes for people with disabilities and, in Winchester Town area,
student accommodation. The private rented sector also has an important roleto play in the local housing market.
7.18 It is important that the market is able to react to changes in economic
circumstances and patterns of demand. However it is also important to guardagainst any drift towards relative shortfalls or excesses of supply of particularkinds of dwelling that reflect the short-term aspirations of developers ratherthan longer-term community interests
Policy CP2 - Housing Provision and Mix
New residential development should meet a range of community
housing needs and deliver a wide choice of homes, with priority beinggiven to the provision of new affordable housing.
Development should provide a range of dwelling types, tenures and
sizes and, as appropriate to the site size, location and characteristics,this should include a mix of market homes for sale, affordable homesand homes attractive to the private rented sector, particularly on largersites. Specialist forms of accommodation such as extra care housing forolder persons and homes for those with disabilities and support needsshould be provided, where appropriate, taking into account localhousing needs.
A majority of homes should be in the form of 2 and 3 bed houses,
unless local circumstances indicate an alternative approach should betaken, including where there is an imbalance of housing types and sizesin particular parts of the District.
Affordable Housing Provision
7.19 It is a priority of this Plan to maximise the provision of affordable housing. The
need to provide additional affordable housing is one of the greatest challengesfacing the District. To meet existing (in 2012) and newly-arising need within 5years would require 519 new affordable dwellings a year in the period 2012-2017 (consisting of 371 Social or Affordable Rented and 148 Intermediate), butthis is unlikely to be achieved in the short term. Extending the time horizonwould reduce the annual requirement, but it is desirable to tackle housing needas soon as realistically possible. Consequently all new housing developmentshould make a contribution towards provision, irrespective of the site’s scale. Itis unlikely to be possible to achieve the level of provision needed solely throughquotas on market housing. Therefore, it is important that all reasonable stepsare taken to improve the supply by promoting other affordable housing tomeet specific local community needs. As a result of the financial freedomsintroduced by housing finance reforms the Council decided in June 2012 toembark on a programme of new Council house building.
7.20 Affordable housing includes Affordable and Social Rent, and Intermediate
Housing. Of all the affordable housing needs the greatest is for Social orAffordable Rented homes, and meeting these needs will be the priority
29. In
order to ensure a balanced supply and create sustainable, mixed and inclusivecommunities, while prioritising rented homes, approximately 70% of all newaffordable housing provided should be for rent. While Social Rented homes willremain the most affordable, the Council recognises the contribution thatAffordable Rented homes can make, although in some circumstances rents ofless than 80% of market value may be needed to meet priority needs
30. The
precise nature of provision will, therefore, be determined having regard topriority local needs, affordability and development economics. Intermediate

30Affordable
Rent - Cost,Affordabilityand implicationsfor Policy, DTZ2012Housing, such as shared ownership and intermediate rent, also has a
valuable role to play in meeting housing needs and will be encouraged. 
7.21 The Council has carried out a Viability Study31that analyses the
economic capacity of new development to provide affordablehousing, taking into account market conditions and the requirementsfor other planning contributions, including S106 contributions, theCommunity Infrastructure Levy, and development economics. TheViability Study concludes that the 40% target percentage included inthe policy should normally be achievable. On sites of less than 5 unitsthe Study recommends this should be by way of a financialcontribution in lieu of on-site provision.
7.22 The Council is mindful that the characteristics of individual sites and
local market conditions can impact on site viability. For instance, at lowpoints in the market cycle the target may be challenging in parts of theDistrict with lower property prices, such as some sites in the SouthHampshire Urban Areas (outside of the strategic allocation sites), andon sites with particularly high existing use values. Such areas are notexpected, overall, to contribute significant amounts of the housingneeded in the District, but where specific viability challenges areidentified, and evidenced by an applicant in relation to individual developmentproposals, this will be taken into account when considering that proposal andan open-book process should be adopted by applicants.
7.23 It is important that affordable homes are provided that meet a wide range of
community requirements and that a range of types and sizes are provided.However, the priority will be the provision of affordable family homes, mostparticularly 3 bedroom houses.
7.24 Affordable housing needs exist across the District, including the market towns
and rural areas
32, and within the National Park. New affordable housing will be
actively encouraged in rural areas to meet local housing needs and helpsustain rural communities and services. Community led initiatives will besupported where they are consistent with the policies contained in the MarketTown and Rural Areas section of this Plan.
7.25 In order to ensure affordable homes are suitable and available for those in
housing need, and are managed effectively, affordable housing should normallybe designed to at least the Homes and Community Agency’s minimumstandards, be provided by a Registered Provider that has local managementarrangements acceptable to the Council and that agrees to Council policies withrespect to household eligibility, lettings and sales of the properties
33.
7.26 Further guidance on implementation will be provided in the Affordable
Housing Supplementary Planning Document. Market conditions and housingneeds will be monitored to in order to assess viability implications,affordability and affordable housing requirements.
Policy CP3 - Affordable Housing Provision on Market Led 
Housing Sites
In order to help meet affordable housing needs, all development which
increases the supply of housing will be expected to provide 40% of thegross number of dwellings as affordable housing, unless this wouldrender the proposal economically unviable. Normally, 70% of theaffordable homes should be for rent (with rent levels being determinedhaving regard to local incomes of those living in priority housing need),with the balance being Intermediate Affordable Housing.

Core Policies 
Active CommunitiesAffordable housing should be provided on-site, indiscernible from and
well integrated with market housing, unless off-site provision wouldbetter meet priority housing needs and support the creation ofinclusive and mixed communities. On sites of less than 5 dwellings afinancial contribution in lieu of on-site provision will be accepted.
Affordable housing should remain available for as long as a need exists.
In considering housing proposals the aim will be to balance housingneeds, the economics of provision and local circumstances.
7.27 The process of consultation undertaken in order to develop this Plan revealed
considerable support for the provision of affordable housing, specifically to meetlocal needs. In order to maximise affordable housing provision, and to meetparticular local needs as quickly as possible, the Council and the National ParkAuthority will be prepared to permit further affordable housing development onland where planning permission would not normally be granted, on what will bereferred to as ‘exception sites’
34. The local needs to which this policy approach
relates will be those arising from the Parish or settlement to which a proposalrelates. 
7.28 It is expected that in most cases this will mean that sites are developed
exclusively for affordable housing that meets priority needs, normally housing forrent. Where for the reasons set out in Policy CP4 the need to generate additionalvalue through cross subsidy is accepted the Council may, exceptionally, beprepared to allow alternative forms of tenure. 
7.29 However, the aim of this policy is to deliver significant additional affordable
housing and it is only by achieving this policy objective that exceptions to normalpolicy can be justified. If the proportion of affordable housing falls below a certainpoint then the balance between the benefits of achieving affordable housingoutweigh the detrimental impact on the countryside. Therefore, no less than 70%of the homes proposed should meet priority local affordable housing needs.
7.30 The remaining element of housing should still take the form of affordable housing
to meet local needs, albeit those of a lesser priority. However, with justification,this could exceptionally include open market housing. Applicants should examinealternatives in a sequential way giving priority to providing affordable housingthat meets the greatest local housing need. Where it is claimed there are financialreasons for requiring alternative forms of housing this will need to be assessed aspart of an open-book process. The same approach will be taken to all sitesbrought forward under this policy, including windfall and allocated sites.
7.31 It is envisaged that most sites coming forward in the Market Towns and Rural
Area spatial area will relate to smaller settlements, where such development cannot only meet specific housing needs, but can also help sustain ruralcommunities and their services. However, the policy also allows appropriatedevelopment in relation to larger settlements where the provision of affordablehousing is the prime objective (although in such cases development should stillbe small in scale). In determining whether a site may be suitable as an ‘exceptionsite’ regard will be had to the suitability and availability of other sites that havethe potential to meet local housing needs. 
7.32 It is important that the need for affordable housing in an existing settlement (or
group of settlements) is well evidenced. This will normally be by reference to theCouncils’ Housing Register, in so far as it relates to the settlement or group ofsettlements. In some cases a local needs survey or data collection may berequired. Land may be allocated by the local planning authority in order to meetthe objectives of this policy or communities themselves may allocate suitable
land through a Neighbourhood Planning process or as part of CommunityRight to Build proposals or similar community led initiatives.

747.33 In response to community representation and because of the
exceptional nature of these sites, priority for the occupation ofaffordable homes provided under this policy will be given to localhouseholds. This means those households in housing need that havea local connection to the settlement or group of settlements to whichthe development relates.
7.34 Evidence of suitable community involvement, including the Parish
Council(s), and support for a scheme will be required if proposals areto be favourably considered. The Council is a partner in theHampshire Alliance for Rural Affordable Housing (HARAH) and is ableto offer support in researching local housing needs, generating andassessing options, community involvement and scheme delivery.
Policy CP4 - Affordable Housing on Exception Sites to Meet
Local Needs
In order to maximise affordable housing provision to meet
identified affordable housing needs the Local Planning Authoritywill exceptionally grant permission or allocate sites for theprovision of affordable housing to meet the specific local needs ofparticular settlements, on land where housing development would notnormally be permitted, and in addition to general housing provision inPolicy CP1. This will include meeting community aspirations identifiedthrough a Neighbourhood Plan to provide affordable housing where thisis consistent with other policies in this Local Plan.
Development will only be permitted where: 
Gthe proposal is suitable in terms of its location, size and tenure to
meet an identified local housing need that cannot be met within thepolicies applying to the settlement to which that need relates; 
Gthe scheme is of a design and character appropriate to its locationand avoids harm to the character of the area or to other planningobjectives, taking account of the policy objective to maximiseaffordable housing provision;
Gthe affordable housing is secured to meet long-term affordablehousing needs, and will remain available in perpetuity (subject toany legislative requirements);
Subject to the needs of the local community the affordable homes
should be for rent (with rent levels being determined by reference tolocal incomes of those in priority housing need). In exceptionalcircumstances a modest element of other tenures may be allowed onthe most suitable identified sites in order to enable a development toproceed, providing no less than 70% of the homes proposed meetpriority local affordable housing needs.
In these circumstances the applicant should demonstrate that the
proposal has community support and that alternative forms of housingare required due to the economics of provision. The quantity, tenureand type of that housing should be limited to that which allows theaffordable housing development to proceed.

Active CommunitiesGypsies and Travellers 
7.35 The Council has a responsibility as the housing authority to assess and meet
the needs of gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople, as well as otherhousing needs. Winchester District has a resident community of RomanyGypsies, Irish Travellers, New Travellers and Travelling Showpeople and is alsofrequently used by more transient groups. Each group has different culturesand site needs and some do not easily share sites.
7.36 The majority of gypsy and traveller sites and all travelling showpeople sites are
on private land with either full or temporary planning permission, or areunauthorised. There is one local authority gypsy and traveller site within theDistrict, at Tynefield (near Whiteley), and there are no transit sites. 
7.37 Winchester City Council has undertaken work
35to assess the needs of gypsies
and travellers36and the concerns of the settled community. This has provided
substantial information on the type of site needed by the different groups withinthe travelling community. Evidence from the gypsy, traveller and settledcommunities indicates preference for smaller sites, suited to family groups,dispersed around the District. This should avoid a disproportionate impact onexisting settlements and help encourage integration with the settled community. 
7.38 This work did not identify the number of pitches
37or transit sites required to
meet the needs of the local travelling community and previous work toestablish pitch requirements is now out of date or incomplete. Therefore, theCouncil and the South Downs National Park Authority are working with otherHampshire authorities to identify accommodation needs and bring forwardadditional sites as necessary through Local Plan Part 2 or the South DownsLocal Plan. In the meantime, planning applications will be assessed against thecriteria in Policy CP5. Accommodation needs will be quantified and sitesallocated in Local Plan Part 2.
7.39 To maintain a supply of land and associated accommodation, the City Council
considers it important to ensure that, within the District, existing permanentauthorised sites for gypsies and travellers are retained. Planning for additionalauthorised sites in the District will help meet legitimate needs, safeguard theamenities of the settled communities, ease potential conflicts between thetravelling and settled communities and address the Council’s statutoryobligations to meet the accommodation needs of all communities.
7.40 The following policy has been assessed against the Government’s Planning
Policy for Traveller Sites published in March 2012. It supports applications fornew gypsy, traveller and travelling showpeople sites where they meet all thepolicy criteria. Unauthorised encampments will also be judged against thesecriteria and, where found not suitable, enforcement action will be taken.Improved provision in locations well related to existing settlements can benefitsocial inclusion, sustainable patterns of living and the delivery of relevantservices, such as education and health care, to these minority groups.
Policy CP5 - Sites for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople
The Local Planning Authority will undertake needs assessments (in
Local Plan Part 2 or the South Downs Local Plan) to quantify theaccommodation requirements for gypsies, travellers and travellingshowpeople within the District. 
Sites will be allocated and planning permission will be granted for sites
to meet the objectively assessed accommodation needs of gypsies,travellers and travelling showpeople, providing they meet all of thefollowing criteria:-

37In this context
the term‘pitches’ is usedto describepitches forgypsies andtravellers asdescribed in theglossary andplots, or yards,for travellingshowpeople.
76Sites should be well related to existing communities to 
encourage social inclusion and sustainable patterns of living,while being located so as to minimise tension with the settledcommunity and:
Gavoid sites being over-concentrated in any one location ordisproportionate in size to nearby communities;
Gbe accessible to local services such as schools, health andcommunity services but avoid placing an unreasonable burden on local facilities and services;
Gavoid harmful impacts on nearby residential properties bynoise and light, vehicle movements and other activities.
Sites should be clearly defined by physical features, where
possible, and not unduly intrusive. Additional landscaping may be necessary to maintain visual amenity and provide privacy foroccupiers. This and any security measures should respect locallandscape character;
Sites should be capable of accommodating the proposed uses to
acceptable standards and provide facilities appropriate to the type andsize of the site, including:
Gwater supply, foul water drainage and recycling/wastemanagement;
Gprovision of play space for children;
Gsites for travelling showpeople should include space for storing andmaintaining equipment;
Gsafe vehicular access from the public highway and adequateprovision for parking, turning and safe manoeuvring of vehicleswithin the site (taking account of site size and impact); 
Gin rural locations, any permanent built structures should berestricted to essential facilities such as a small amenity block.
Proposals should be consistent with other policies such as on design,
flood risk, contamination, protection of the natural and builtenvironment or agricultural land quality and protect areas designatedfor their local, national or international importance, such as Gaps andthe South Downs National Park.
Existing permanent authorised gypsy, traveller and travelling
showpeople sites within the District which are needed to meet theidentified needs of particular groups will be retained for the use of thesegroups unless it has been established that they are no longer required.
Local Services and Facilities
7.41 Given the dispersed nature of the District, the provision and retention of local
services and facilities is important, especially those which provide opportunitiesfor communities to access them without having to travel excessive distances.Such local services and facilities fall into the following categories:-
Gcommunity centres and village halls;
Gindoor sports and recreation facilities, including allotments;
Geducational, health and care establishments (including nursing/carehomes);
Gpremises for the emergency services, public utilities and infrastructure;

77Core Policies 
Active CommunitiesGlocal pubs and shops;
Glibraries, cultural and arts facilities;
Gchurches, places of worship and cemeteries/burial grounds.
7.42 These can be critical in contributing to the overall sustainability of a
neighbourhood, settlement, or wider rural area, by providing local facilitieswhich help avoid unnecessary trips by car. Indeed, the settlement strategy forthe Market Towns and Rural Area attaches great importance to the retentionand improvement of facilities and services, especially in the larger villageswhich function as service centres for more remote communities.
7.43 Some of these facilities may be particularly critical in certain communities,
such as the local school, shop or pub, particularly where there are noalternatives for some distance. Neighbourhood Plans and other communityplanning tools provide an ideal forum to explore the opportunities for localservice provision, improvement and diversification, but this should be againsta policy background which requires that facilities normally be retained. 
7.44 It is therefore important to retain any existing provision at the same time as
encouraging new facilities and services. The following policy will thereforecontrol, through development, re-development or change of use, the loss of alocal service or facility. 
Policy CP6 - Local Services and Facilities
The Local Planning Authority will support proposals for the development
of new, extended or improved facilities and services in accordance withthe development strategies set out in Policies WT1, SH1 and MTRA1.
The Local Planning Authority wishes to retain and improve the facilities
and services available across the District. Development proposals shouldnot threaten or result in the loss of premises or sites used to provideservices and facilities unless it can be demonstrated that: 
Gthe site/premise is not required because the service or facility hasbeen satisfactorily relocated or is no longer needed to serve thelocality ; and 
Gthe site or building has no reasonable prospect of being used for analternative service or facility which would benefit the localcommunity.
When considering proposals, account will be taken of:
Gwhether the loss of the service or facility would cause harm for
those living within the neighbourhood, settlement, or ruralcatchment with a reasonable need to access such facilities in thefuture; and
Gwhether the loss of the facility would have a detrimental impactupon the overall vitality and viability of the settlement; and
Gwhether the loss is part of an agreed plan to provide improved localservices in equally accessible locations.
Open Space, Sport and Recreation 
7.45 Open space, sport and recreation play an important role in enabling local
communities to live active and healthy lifestyles. The Community Strategyidentifies the need to provide opportunities for everyone to become moreactive, to promote not only healthy lifestyles but also improve general well-being. Local communities place much emphasis on retaining existing open
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park AuthorityWinchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
278space and recreational provision and the need for adequate provision
associated with new development.
7.46 The ‘Open Space Standards’ set out in this Plan include public
landscaped areas, playing fields, parks and play areas, informalrecreation sites, and allotments (see Table 1 below) and also builtfacilities (see Table 2 below). The Council has produced locally-derivedstandards
38following extensive consultations, which are set out in
the following Policy CP7. The policy seeks local improvements wheredeficiencies have been identified in particular types of facility, whenmeasured against the new standards, with new facilities beingprovided to meet the needs of larger-scale development or thecumulative needs of smaller-scale development.
7.47 Given existing shortfalls in provision, and to achieve the required
improvements, it is important that all existing facilities are retained.Therefore all current open space areas and built sports facilities willbe protected against development for other uses, unlessimprovements can be achieved by relocating them.
7.48 Implementation of Policy CP7 will be through the Council’s existing
Open Space Strategy, until this is superseded by the Community InfrastructureLevy in 2014. The Open Space Strategy specifies the amount and type offacilities currently available, by Parish, together with an assessment of deficiencywhich will be updated and proposals made as necessary in Local Plan Part 2.
Policy CP7 - Open Space, Sport and Recreation
The Local Planning Authority will seek improvements in the open space
network and in built recreation facilities within the District, to achievethe type of provision, space required and levels of accessibility set outin the Council’s most up to date open space and built facilitiesstandards. This will be achieved by new and improved provision, or byimproving public access for all to existing facilities and educationalprovision.
New housing development should make provision for public open

8.1 Creating the framework for encouraging economic prosperity and
generating sustainable economic growth is one of the key challengesfacing the District over the next 20 years, and is identified as a keypriority for the District through the Community Strategy and itsEconomic Strategy. It is essential that the local economy remainscompetitive and provides employment opportunities across a widerange of skills and technologies. Coupled with this is the recognitionthat high levels of both in and out-commuting exist within theDistrict and that options need to be available to enable residents tolive and work locally.
8.2 The District now falls within two economic areas, the south of the
District is within the Solent Local Economic Partnership (LEP) area,and rest of the District is included in the Enterprise M3 LEP . TheSolent LEP largely covers the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire(PUSH) area with the addition of the Isle of Wight. PUSH will continueto provide strategic housing and spatial planning advice to the LEP ,and will be responsible for the development and implementation ofthe sub-regional economic strategy.
8.3 A major priority for the Government is sustainable economic growth, and
Government guidance places a great emphasis on planning for prosperity, byusing the planning system to build a strong responsive and competitiveeconomy and ensuring that sufficient land of the right type, and in the rightplaces, is available to allow growth and innovation. The Council has developedan evidence base which looks at both the quantitative and qualitativerequirements for all types of economic activity, over the plan period.
8.4 The Council has commissioned a number of economic studies to inform the
preparation of the Local Plan. The Winchester District Economic andEmployment Land Study
39pulled together different strands of economic data
and evidence available into a comprehensive evidence base and economicprofile of the Winchester District. The Study also included a review ofemployment land. The final report published in 2007 was prepared when thefull impact of the global recession had yet to be felt.
8.5 The Council adopted its Economic Strategy in 2010
40and this picked up on a
number of themes identified in the evidence studies, and identified a numberof key issues for the District to address. These included measures to promoteknowledge based and creative industries and addressing the significant levelsof in and out-commuting.
8.6 The Council’s Economic Strategy recognises that the District’s economy is
built on five key sectors :-
GPublic administration and business services 
GLand based industries 
GTourism and recreation
GKnowledge and creative industries
GRetail
8.7 Many of these fall within traditional ‘Business’ use classes,
which are covered by the evidence set out in theEconomic Studies. Retailing is covered by the Councils’Retail and Town Centre Uses study (updated in 2012
41),
which includes updated projections for the amount of

Prosperous Economy additional retail floorspace required in the District up to 2031 (in the region of
12,000 sq m), with existing stock having a role to play in accommodatingprojected growth. This report also covers commercial leisure development andacknowledges that the existing provision of leisure, entertainment and culturalfacilities reflects the size of the District and its catchment, with opportunitiesfor accommodating additional small-scale commercial leisure within towncentres if sites are available.
8.8 The rural economy is a key feature in the District, given its location, and there are
further opportunities now that part of the District lies within the South DownsNational Park. Many small rural projects have received support through ‘LEADER’(Liaison Entre Actions de Developement de l’Economie Rurale - integrated actionfor rural development) funding. This is run by the Fieldfare Local Action Group(LAG) which is a rural and farming network group. It is the only organisation thatdelivers LEADER grants in Winchester and East Hampshire, under the DEFRA/EURural Development Programme for England. The grants can be used for ruralprojects to develop and diversify the local economy. 
8.9 Tourism generates significant income for the District and supports a number of
other economic sectors such as retail, transport and the creative industries. 
8.10 Due to the uncertainties over the long term prospects for the local economy,
particularly in the light of the Government’s policy of rebalancing the economyaway from the public to the private sector, an updated economic study wascompleted in 2011, drawing on previous studies and the Council’s EconomicStrategy
42. This provides a review of employment prospects, employment land
and demographic projections. This Study anticipates that employment in theDistrict will grow by 9,270 jobs between 2009- 2031. This is less than previouslypredicted (10,770 jobs up to 2026) and acknowledges that the composition ofthe workforce will change over that period, with fewer workers employed inagriculture, manufacturing, and public administration.
8.11 The biggest growth sector for the local economy is expected to be in ‘business
services’, which is projected to provide around 39% of all new jobs created.This sector includes knowledge based and creative industries and the growthin these jobs is expected to be dispersed across the District.
8.12 Other sectors which should see growth include distribution and retail; hotels
and catering; health; and other services, which includes arts, entertainmentand recreation. During the same period employment in manufacturing andpublic administration is projected to decline, although the Study notes thatmanufacturing output has grown while at the same time employment in thissector has decreased.
8.13 The Study also highlights the importance of self employment, which currently
stands at around 14% of all employment and is a sector which has increasedover the past few years. This is above the Hampshire average of 9% selfemployed and suggests that the Winchester workforce is highlyentrepreneurial. This sector needs to be encouraged and sustained.
8.14 Because of the reduced prospects for employment growth, and also due to
the fact that modern business practices have increased worker floorspacedensities, which means employment floorspace is now used moreproductively, there is a reduction in the amount of new employmentfloorspace likely to be required across the District throughout the Plan period.About 20 hectares of new land will need to be found.
8.15 It should be stressed that these predictions are trend based and there could be a
strong qualitative argument for allocating more employment floorspace toensure that the District is in a strong position to respond to emergingopportunities and to ensure that the risks identified in the Study do not

2284materialise. In addition, the Study looked at the ‘indigenous’ needs of 
the District for additional employment land. However, part of the Districtis also within the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire (PUSH), wherethe promotion of economic development and growth is a priority.
8.16 The South East Plan set employment floorspace targets for the PUSH 
area, sub-divided into the eastern and western parts (with Winchesterfalling within the eastern PUSH area). PUSH adopted a Policy Frameworkfor Employment Floorspace in 2008, which apportions the requiredfloorspace between the various local authorities. For Winchester, thefloorspace requirements are substantial (totalling 199,500 sq m for all the ‘business’ use classes), but are based largely on existing commitments at Solent Business Park and Segensworth (Whiteley) and at West of Waterlooville. A small amount of additional warehousing anddistribution land was needed and it was expected that this could beprovided by varying the allocations at West of Waterlooville or byreallocating industrial land.
8.17 PUSH has since updated its economic strategy but continues to give
priority to enabling economic growth, including provision of adequateland. The PUSH spatial strategy is also being updated, but the employmentfloorspace requirements for Winchester District will continue to be based onimplementing land already allocated/committed for business development atWhiteley and West of Waterlooville. This Plan’s spatial policies for the SouthHampshire Urban Areas are consistent with this approach. 
8.18 Therefore, although there is no need to allocate any further strategic
employment sites in this Plan, the Council considers that it is important toretain existing employment sites and premises to ensure an adequate supplyof all types of employment floorspace. While the Council would not wish toprevent employment land and floorspace which is clearly surplus torequirements being put to more sustainable uses, it does wish to maintain arange of employment opportunities to encourage growth across all economicsectors. In considering whether to retain employment floorspace the Councilwill determine proposals against the criteria set out in policy CP9.
8.19 The following policies aim to provide a framework for the necessary expansion
and diversification of the economy across the District, in accordance with theEconomic Strategy adopted by the City Council, which is the means by which theeconomic vision and plans will be turned into practical outcomes for local peopleand businesses. 
Policy CP8 - Economic Growth and Diversification
The Local Planning Authority will support economic development and
diversification across Winchester District, in accordance with the spatialstrategies for the District, through the retention, regeneration andintensification of previously developed land and by allocating land asnecessary to support employment growth at sustainable locations. About20 hectares of new employment land will be provided for economicgrowth and future employment needs.
The Local Planning Authority will support development within the
District’s five key economic sectors of public administration and businessservices, land based industries, tourism and recreation, knowledge andcreative industries and retail. This will be achieved through the retentionof appropriate premises and, where feasible and consistent with thespatial strategy, new development to ensure that there is an adequate

85Core Policies 
Prosperous Economy supply of land and premises, suitable to maintain a diverse and
successful local economy.
The Local Planning Authority will support measures to promote self
employment and working from home, consistent with other policies ofthis Plan, including the development of live-work accommodation andensuring good access to modern communications technology. Appropriateopportunities to expand the economic base and foster innovation in theDistrict will also be encouraged, in particular the promotion of a lowcarbon economy and the emerging ‘green collar’ industries.
8.20 The Council will maintain an up to date employment land review, and reflect
Government advice that this should be aligned with strategic housing landavailability assessments and should include a reappraisal of the suitability ofpreviously allocated land. Employment uses may be relocated if they can be re-provided in a location which is at least as suitable and accessible and ifproposals for the re-use of vacated land and premises are also acceptable. TheCouncil will also encourage proposals for comprehensive mixed useredevelopment of sites to come forward. In determining whether a site inemployment use should be retained the following policy will be applied.
Policy CP9 - Retention of Employment Land and Premises
In order to retain a mix of employment land and premises in the
District, the Local Planning Authority will resist the loss of existing orallocated employment land and floorspace within Use Classes B1, B2 orB8. Losses will only be permitted where retaining a business use wouldnot be reasonable having regard to the following:
Gthe redevelopment potential for other employment uses or a mix ofuses including the scope for intensifying or providing an effectiveuse of the site or building, and the potential to improve and extendthe range of modern employment floorspace;
Gwhether the building or use meets or could meet a specific localrequirement, such as providing low cost start up accommodation;
Gthe environmental impact of business use on neighbouring uses;
Gthe access arrangements for the site/buildings, by road and publictransport;
Gstrength of local demand for the type of accommodation; 
Gthe benefits of the proposed use compared to the benefits ofretaining the existing use.
Transport
8.21 Transport provision varies considerably across the District, with relatively good
accessibility in Winchester Town, ranging to very poor accessibility in some ofthe more remote rural areas. The main transport issues relate to road safety,accessibility, congestion and pollution. The biggest challenges inaccommodating development will be in relation to ensuring the developmentgenerates as little new traffic movement as possible and providing thenecessary infrastructure to accommodate traffic and ensure access to services.
8.22 The Hampshire Local Transport Plan 2011-2031 sets out a long-term vision for
the transport requirements for Hampshire and specific areas, including theWinchester Town Access Plan, and provides the context for this Plan. 
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park AuthorityWinchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
2222868.23 The Local Transport Plan has 3 main priorities: 
Gto support economic growth by ensuring safety, soundness and
efficiency of the transport network;
Gto provide a safe, well maintained and more resilient roadnetwork as the basic transport infrastructure of the County onwhich all forms of transport directly and indirectly depend andthe key to continued casualty reduction;
Gto manage traffic to maximise efficiency of the existing networkcapacity, improving journey time reliability and reducing emissionsthereby supporting the efficient and sustainable movement ofpeople and goods.
and further policy objectives structured under 5 themes :-
Gsupporting the economy through resilient highways
Gmanagement of traffic
Gthe role of public transport 
Gquality of life and place
Gtransport and growth areas
8.24 This Plan promotes a development strategy which will accommodate much of
the development required in the District through large-scale extensions to theexisting urban areas of Winchester, Whiteley and Waterlooville. This will ensurethat development is of a sufficient scale to incorporate all the necessary facilitieswithin the site and through off-site improvements, and ensure that it is locatedin the most sustainable locations, helping to reduce the need to travel.
Policy CP10 - Transport 
The Local Planning Authority will seek to reduce demands on the
transport network, manage existing capacity efficiently and secureinvestment to make necessary improvements. Development should belocated and designed to reduce the need to travel. The use of non-carmodes particularly walking and cycling should be encouraged throughtravel plans, management and improvements to the existing network,and improvements to accommodate additional traffic should beundertaken (or funded) where necessary.
8.25 Implementation of this policy will be through the development management
process and the delivery of the strategy set out in this Plan.
8.26 Details of transport related schemes are set out in a number of plans and
strategies such as the Hampshire Sustainable Transport Towns Project and theCouncils’ Cycling Strategy. In addition, Hampshire County Council, inpartnership with the Local Planning Authorities, adopted in September 2012 aTransport Statement for the Winchester District, providing details of transportobjectives and delivery priorities. The list of schemes in the statement will beupdated annually and a ‘live’ version is available to view on Hampshire CountyCouncil’s website (www.hants.gov.uk).
8.27 Whilst this Plan does not include detailed parking standards these are set out
in the Councils Residential Parking Standards Supplementary PlanningDocument adopted in 2009. It may be necessary for these to be reviewed andupdated during the life of this Plan, and further details will be set out asrelevant in Local Plan Part 2.

9.1 The Community Strategy recognises that the District has a wealth of
resources that contribute to its distinctiveness and, under its HighQuality Environment Group, there are specific fora such as theClimate Change Programme Board, Natural Environment Forum andthe Transport Forum which are developing focused action plans. Anidentified project is to ensure that this Local Plan specifically includespolicies to address climate change, which has been achieved throughclose joint working between officers and stakeholders, who havebeen involved in developing this Plan’s policies and preparing‘Sustainable Buildings Guidance for Planning Applications’.
43
9.2 The following section therefore includes policies on climate change,
design and effective use of land, green infrastructure, biodiversity,flooding and the water environment, settlement gaps, heritage andlandscape and the South Downs National Park. 
Meeting the Challenge of Climate Change 
9.3 Mitigation of and adaptation to the future impacts of climate change
are key drivers for change in the District. Winchester District has one of thehighest per capita carbon footprints in the South East – 14.10 tonnes CO
2per
year compared to a South East average of 13.17 tonnes and the UK average of12.10 tonnes (2006 Resources Energy Analysis Programme figures).Environment Agency assessments show the District to be in an area that isseriously water-stressed.
9.4 Significant CO
2reductions are required to mitigate climate change and this
Plan’s polices should perform a key role in this mitigation. The high carbonfootprint of the District and the severity of water stress in the area, requireactions to address levels of CO
2emissions and water use in advance of the
national requirements for these issues. The Council’s climate change target44
aims for a 30% CO2emissions reduction (on 2004 levels) by 2015. Policy CP11
takes account of this and other evidence45to achieve energy and water
efficiency levels in advance of national requirements.
9.5 In planning new developments, it is recognised that the ideal solution is likely
to vary according to the type and scale of development and its location. Theremay be occasions where wider schemes will be more appropriate than on-sitemeasures, particularly with larger developments, or where off-siteprovision/contributions are the only practical option.
9.6 The City Council also recognises that there may be particular circumstances of
a development’s location where it may not be practical or viable, or in theinterests of conserving character in sensitive areas, to incorporate all themeasures required by Policy CP11. The City Council will take account ofall site-specific circumstances, including whether the site is located insensitive areas such as conservation areas, or affects the setting ofhistoric buildings or sensitive landscapes, or is within the SouthDowns National Park.
9.7 Proposals will be expected to provide evidence of the
measures that are being taken to achieve carbon reductionto the expected standards. A Standard AssessmentProcedure (SAP energy rating for dwellings) rating andwater calculator reading, or a BREEAM certificateprovided by an accredited assessor, should be provided asappropriate and would also assist in compliance withrelevant Building Regulations requirements.

High Quality Environment 9.8 If proposals include measures that do not accord with the suggested energy
hierarchy or ‘Allowable Solutions’, they should justify their approach andoutline appropriate compensatory measures. Examples of ‘Allowable Solutions’are the provision of on or off-site low-carbon energy generation measures or afinancial contribution to carbon reduction measures. These measures mayinclude the development of district heating systems or retro-fitting of existingbuildings, subject to any unacceptable adverse impacts on sensitiveenvironments.
Policy CP11 - Sustainable Low and Zero Carbon Built Development
Developments should achieve the lowest level of carbon emissions and
water consumption which is practical and viable. Specifically, the LocalPlanning Authority will expect:
Gnew residential developments to achieve Level 5 for the Energyaspect of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) and Level 4 for thewater aspect of the CSH from adoption of this Plan. If this is shownnot to be feasible or viable the Council will accept an on-site carbonreduction of not less than the relevant Carbon Compliance levelsstipulated by the Zero Carbon Homes policy, with the remainingreduction of regulated emissions
46to be provided by means of
Allowable Solutions;
Gnon-residential development that requires an Energy PerformanceCertificate to meet ‘BREEAM Excellent’ standard from adoption ofthis Plan and ‘BREEAM Outstanding’ standards from 2016.
In meeting these requirements developments should follow the
hierarchy below, except where it can be demonstrated that it would bemore practical and achieve greater carbon reductions, to utilisemeasures further down the hierarchy:
Gbe designed to maximise energy efficiency and design out the needfor energy use by means of the scheme layout and the orientationand design of individual buildings, making full use of passiveheating and cooling systems as far as is practical;
Gconnect to existing combined heat and power (CHP) and DistrictHeating/Cooling networks, or contribute to their futuredevelopment;
Guse renewable energy technologies to produce required energy on-site;
Gmake use of Allowable Solutions to deal with any remaining CO2
emissions up to the relevant Code for Sustainable Homes/ZeroCarbon Homes level.
9.9 Generation of renewable and decentralised energy will help to contribute tonational targets and the sub-regional objective for the PUSH area of theDistrict to increase the percentage of renewable energy generation. Suchmeasures will assist in moving towards a green economy and the Council’starget for CO
2emissions reduction. 
9.10 A Renewable Energy Study was undertaken for the Council47and forms part of
the evidence base of the Local Plan. That Study calculated a target potentialfor renewables equating to 17% of current energy demand. A large proportionof this potential is from large-scale wind. However, it is recognised that thereare landscape and other environmental constraints to large-scale winddevelopments. The Renewable Energy Study also identified that combinedheat and power (CHP) and district heating/cooling networks are the most cost-effective way to meet the higher Code for Sustainable Homes levels.

Policy CP12 - Renewable and Decentralised Energy
The Local Planning Authority is supportive of the generation of
renewable and decentralised energy in the District. It will supportthe creation of CHP/district heating/cooling systems and thedevelopment of larger-scale renewable energy developments,especially where there is a strong degree of community benefitand/or community ownership. When assessing proposals forlarge-scale renewable energy and decentralised energy schemes,account will be taken of:
Gimpact on areas designated for their local, national orinternational importance, such as Gaps and the SouthDowns National Park, conservation areas and heritage assets,including their setting;
Gcontribution to national, regional & sub-regional renewableenergy targets and CO

Gpotential to integrate with new or existing development, whilstavoiding harm to existing development and communities;
Gbenefits to host communities and opportunities for environmentalenhancement;
Gproximity to biomass plants, fuel sources and transport links;
Gconnection to the electricity network;
Geffect on the landscape and surrounding location.
Securing High Standards of Design
9.11The NPPF48places great importance on securing high standards of design in the
built environment. It states that good design is inseparable from good planning.One of the government’s prime objectives for the planning system is to promotegood design that ensures attractive, usable, and durable places. This is seen as akey element in securing sustainable development.
9.12 The built environment within the District is diverse and of a generally highquality. It includes the historic town of Winchester, the historic market towns andvillages, newer settlements within the District, and other development within thecountryside. The fundamental objective is therefore to ensure that newdevelopment, wherever it is located within the District, should be of the highestquality, which respects its context and enhances local character. 
9.13 Good design is an inseparable aspect of creating sustainable communities, and isan important part of ensuring that the District makes the most effective andefficient use of developable land. It is a key indicator in assessing a community’squality of life.
9.14 The District is facing significant growth over the next 20 years, and a number ofmajor developments are planned, especially around Winchester town and in thesouth of the District. These offer the opportunity to ensure that the higheststandards of sustainable design are achieved, and that quality places are created.
9.15 While an individual design response will be determined by the local context, it isessential that all new development should aspire to meet the highest standardsof sustainable design. In order to achieve this a coherent and coordinatedapproach is required to ensure that the following objectives are achieved:
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park Authority9Winchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
9348National
Planning PolicyFramework -DCLG, March2012.
Core Policies 
High Quality Environment Gnew development should create a sense of place with a distinctive
character, which clearly demonstrates how it has responded to its localcontext. Many communities have produced Village or NeighbourhoodDesign Statements which help to define the character of the locality andidentify important local features. Establishing local design standards couldform an integral part of future neighbourhood planning; 
Gnew development (which includes hard and soft landscaping) shouldconnect seamlessly to surrounding development in terms of layout, scale,form, enclosure, space and materials and, where appropriate, take theopportunity to enhance the public realm;
Gthe public realm should be designed to ensure that well connected, safeand attractive environments are created for the community, giving priorityto pedestrians and cyclists and not motor vehicles where appropriate;
Gthe built and natural environment should be properly integrated. Thedesign process should therefore be holistic to ensure a well-definedtransition from built-up to natural areas, particularly on the edges ofsettlements;
Gnew development should complement but not seek to mimic existingdevelopment and should be of its time. The Council will encourage acontemporary approach to new designs which respect and respondpositively to the context, local distinctiveness and sense of place in termsof layout, scale, form, space and materials; 
Gmeasures to minimise carbon emissions, promote renewable energy andmanage water effectively should be an integral part of the design solutions.
9.16 Developers and their agents should carry out contextual surveys and analysetheir findings in accordance with the urban design principles set out in the ‘ByDesign’ documents
49and other relevant guidance. The analysis should inform
the design concept and applicants should be able to demonstrate in theirdesign and access statements how the urban design principles above haveinformed the detailed design in terms of its character, continuity and enclosure,quality of the public realm, ease of movement, adaptability and diversity.
Policy CP13 - High Quality Design
New development will be expected to meet the highest standards of
design50. In order to achieve this all proposals for new development
(excluding small domestic applications and changes of use) shoulddemonstrate that: 
Gan analysis of the constraints and opportunities of the site and itssurroundings have informed the principles of design and how thedetailed design responds positively to its neighbours and the localcontext;
Gthe proposal makes a positive contribution to the local environmentand creates an individual place with a distinctive character; 
Gthe public realm has been designed to ensure that it is attractive,safe, accessible and well connected to its surroundings, includingwalking and cycling routes to and within the development, toencourage their use;
Gthe accompanying landscape framework has been developed toenhance both the natural and built environment and maximise thepotential to improve local biodiversity;

9.17 The Local Planning Authority will ensure that a site’s developmentpotential is maximised, and higher densities will be encouraged onsites which have good access to facilities, services and publictransport. High density development can also assist in reducingenergy usage and promoting centralised sources of renewableenergy. However, density is only one factor to be taken into accountand in maximising a site’s potential the density will need to bebalanced against the quality of the design and how well it respondsto the existing character of the site and wider contextual setting willbe a very important consideration. 
Policy CP14 – The Effective Use of Land
In order to ensure that scarce development land is used
effectively, the Local Planning Authority will support higherdensities on sites which have good access to facilities and publictransport, particularly within the urban areas. The development potentialof all sites should be maximised, and will be balanced against the need topromote high quality design. The primary determinant of theacceptability of a scheme will be how well the design responds to thegeneral character of the area
Green Infrastructure 
9.18 Green Infrastructure (GI) describes all of the natural and managed green spaces,features and water bodies that together make up a multifunctional network orgrid across rural and urban areas. The GI network includes five key elements:-spaces, links and features such as parks and gardens (on private or public land),and green links between spaces such as hedgerows and rights of way, greenroofs/walls and ‘blue corridors’ such as rivers and ponds.
9.19 Together these all provide environmental, economic and quality of life benefitswhich underpin the principles of sustainability.  GI has many benefits, fromencouraging people to walk or cycle along routes of local significance bringinglocal communities together, to increasing health and well being, enhancinglandscapes and protecting cultural heritage, providing ecosystem services andlinking spaces for biodiversity, managing natural resources sustainably andfacilitating adaptation to climate change.
9.20 Well designed GI can also add value to properties and attract investment in anarea by enhancing its character and local distinctiveness. 
9.21 Key green infrastructure assets and opportunities within the District include:- 
Griver corridors, tributaries and valleys of the Itchen, Meon, Hamble, Wallingtonand Dever which are of considerable biodiversity, landscape and recreationvalue;
Gdisused railway corridors (e.g. at Bishops Waltham, Meon Valley, Winchester);
Gimportant public rights of way such as the South Downs Way, ItchenNavigation Heritage Project, and Keats Walk, Winchester;
GThe South Downs National Park which covers a large part of the easternsection of the District;
Gnatural and semi-natural greenspaces such as chalk downlands e.g. at StCatherine’s Hill and Old Winchester Hill National Nature Reserve;

Ghistoric parks and landscape features such as park pales, veteran trees, andsunken lanes;
Gformal and informal recreation areas such as Farley Mount.
9.22 Some communities within the District currently do not have access to enoughquality natural green spaces
51across the District, particularly close to settlements
for casual walking and dog exercise. This is also hindered by gaps in the Rights ofWay network, for example to the west and north of Winchester, which preventeasy access to many areas. There is also a deficit in informal greenspaces withinthe District such as Local Nature Reserves, and there is some deficit in formalgreenspace provision, for example in the Kings Worthy, Waltham Chase andDenmead areas. The cumulative effect of development could also result in anadditional requirement for new open space and recreation areas.
9.23 Well-planned green infrastructure should be incorporated into developmentproposals, integrating and building upon the existing green network. It shouldcontribute to high quality development and economic prosperity by makingplaces attractive to residents and businesses and improving the health andwell-being of the local and wider community. It should respect and respond tolocal landscape character and integrate with sustainable transport and greentourism initiatives, expanding upon existing provision.
9.24 The City Council produced a Green Infrastructure Study in 2010 which,alongside the PUSH Green Infrastructure Strategy (2010)
52and
Implementation Framework (2012), makes recommendations for developing aGI network across the District and South Hampshire area, which will besupported by the following policy.
9.25 Policy CP15 supports provision of suitable and sufficient green infrastructureincorporating green spaces and features for recreation, amenity and biodiversityand provision of routes and pathways to link with the existing network, therebycontributing to sustainable transport provision. The aim is to deliver bothsufficient quality and quantity of green infrastructure, supported by thestandards set out in Policy CP7, in association with proposed development.
Policy CP15 - Green Infrastructure
The Local Planning Authority will support development proposals which:- 
Gmaintain, protect and enhance the function or the integrity of the
existing green infrastructure network identified at a District and subregional level, including strategic blue and green corridors andspaces, as illustrated on Map 9 particularly where the proposal allowsfor the enhancement of GI both on-site and in the immediate area;

Biodiversity
9.26 Winchester District has many areas which are noted for their naturalbeauty and biodiversity value. These areas also support a wide variety ofspecies and habitats, and form an important part of the network of biodiversitysites within the wider environment. They include the Itchen chalk river, the UpperHamble Estuary and Woods and coastal habitats of the Solent and SouthamptonWater. The importance of these areas is recognised by statutory protectionafforded through European Directives (Special Areas of Conservation (SAC),Special Protection Areas (SPA), and Ramsar wetland sites) and National legislation(Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)). Plans or projects proposing developmentthat is not directly connected with the management of European sites, but that islikely to have a significant effect on them, will require Habitats RegulationsAssessment (HRA) to ensure that effects are avoided or adequately mitigated. Ifadverse effects on site integrity cannot be avoided or mitigated then reasons ofoverriding public interest must be demonstrated and compensation measuresprovided.
9.27 Winchester is a predominantly rural district with around 40% of the area nowforming part of the South Downs National Park (SDNP). Wildlife sites andhabitats within this area and across the District that are of regional and localimportance include 17 SSSIs, almost 600 Sites of Nature Conservation (SINCs)and 9 Local Nature Reserves (LNRs). These sites support important naturalassets, such as ancient woodlands, grasslands and chalk rivers. These sites willbe protected, with opportunities for enhancement encouraged.
9.28 Sites that lie outside designated areas provide valuable corridors and networksfor habitats and species and can include irreplaceable habitats such as ancientwoodlands. These are key to the overall integrity of the District’s biodiversityinterest. Maintaining and enhancing the network of natural sites, and thelinkages between them, is integral to supporting the aims of the District’sBiodiversity Action Plan (BAP). The Winchester BAP identifies that 14% of thearea covered by the plan supports BAP priority habitats that includebroadleaved woodland, pasture woodland, wetlands and unimprovedcalcareous neutral grassland. The Biodiversity Opportunity Areas identify theareas with the greatest potential for enhancing biodiversity within Hampshire.
9.29 The Community Strategy identifies the protection and enhancement of theDistrict’s rich biodiversity and habitats as a strategic outcome for Winchester.The strategy aims to maintain, protect and enhance the biodiversity within theDistrict, working in partnership with neighbouring authorities and otherrelevant bodies. A specific study
53is in progress to identify the recreational
impacts of development on designated European sites around the Solent,

9.30 In addition, the Habitats Regulation Assessment and SustainabilityAppraisal advise that a strategic approach to air quality managementis required. This is to ensure the continued protection of sites ofinternational, European, and national importance, as well as localnature conservation sites, given the planned level of growth. Thelocation of air quality monitoring sites and the setting of thresholdsto trigger further investigation should be determined through lowerlevel assessments and, where appropriate, be applied as a conditionon planning permissions.
Policy CP16 - Biodiversity
The Local Planning Authority will support development which
maintains, protects and enhances biodiversity across theDistrict, delivering a net gain in biodiversity, and has regard tothe following: 
Gprotecting sites of international, European, and national importance,and local nature conservation sites, from inappropriate development. 
Gsupporting habitats that are important to maintain the integrity ofEuropean sites.
Gnew development will be required to show how biodiversity can beretained, protected and enhanced through its design andimplementation, for example by designing for wildlife, deliveringBAP targets and enhancing Biodiversity Opportunity Areas.
Gnew development will be required to avoid adverse impacts, or ifunavoidable ensure that impacts are appropriately mitigated, withcompensation measures used only as a last resort. Developmentproposals will only be supported if the benefits of the developmentclearly outweigh the harm to the habitat and/or species.
Gmaintaining a District wide network of local wildlife sites andcorridors to support the integrity of the biodiversity network,prevent fragmentation, and enable biodiversity to respond andadapt to the impacts of climate change. 
Gsupporting and contributing to the targets set out in the District’sBiodiversity Action Plan (BAP) for priority habitats and species. 
Planning proposals that have the potential to affect priority habitats
and/or species or sites of geological importance will be required to takeaccount of evidence and relevant assessments or surveys.
Flooding and the Water Environment
9.31 The water environment within Winchester District is hugely important as anatural resource and recreational facility, and plays a key part in shaping theDistrict’s historic and natural landscape. The geology of the District means thatthe area plays an essential role in supplying water for the District andneighbouring areas, not only for public use but also for many local economicsectors which rely heavily on the water environment. These include farming,watercress production, fisheries, tourism and water based recreation activities.The water environment is not only a key element of the wider eco-system of theDistrict, it is also a key part of the green infrastructure network providing links
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park Authority9Winchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
99Core Policies 
High Quality Environment and space for recreation and leisure (as well as other functions, as set out in
policy CP15).
9.32 Water for commercial uses and to supply domestic properties comes mainlyfrom the District’s underground aquifers, but also from surface waters such asthe Rivers Itchen and Test. These rivers and the Meon, which originate fromthe chalk ridges, are of high ecological importance, as are the upper reachesof the Hamble Estuary which flows through the District (as set out in policyCP16 biodiversity). The River Itchen and the Upper Hamble form part of theNatura 2000 network of sites designated under the Birds and HabitatsDirectives which are also covered by the Water Framework Directive (WFD),with the main objective of bringing all water bodies up to ‘good ecological(surface waters), quantitative (groundwater) and chemical (all) status’ throughthe sustainable use of water as a natural resource.
9.33 The most important groundwater resources in the District are currently at‘poor’ status under the WFD. Ground water resources in the District areamongst the most sensitive in the region and are highly vulnerable topollution. 80% of the District is underlain by principal aquifer and 46% of theDistrict is within Source Protection Zones (covering the abstraction points).These zones exist to protect public drinking water supplies and suitablepollution prevention measures are focused in these areas.
9.34 Policy CP17 seeks to ensure that development and changes in land use withinthe District will:- 
Gprotect and use opportunities to enhance the water environment; 
Gprotect the quality and quantity of drinking water; 
Gensure that development is permitted only where there is adequateinfrastructure to provide and treat water; and 
Gprotect people and properties from flood risk, 
recognising that development may also have an impact on the water
environment which reaches beyond district boundaries.
9.35 Like much of the South East and East of England, both Portsmouth Water andSouthern Water abstraction areas which cover Winchester District are “seriouslywater-stressed”
54. This Local Plan therefore seeks to ensure that there is adequate
water supply, surface water, foul drainage and sewerage treatment capacity toserve all new developments and encourages high standards of water efficiency,to reduce water use (policy CP11 Sustainable Development
55) to protect the
District’s role in supplying water within and to neighbouring Districts.
9.36 It is important that there is adequate capacity both on and off the site to servea development and that it would not lead to problems for existing users
56.
Where there is a capacity problem and no improvements are programmed bythe water company, the Council will require the developer to fund appropriateimprovements which must be completed prior to occupation of thedevelopment.
9.37 The District is affected by fluvial flooding from the many rivers and tributariesflowing through the District, groundwater flooding from natural springs andwinterbournes fed by the underground aquifers, and surface water floodingwhere water can not drain away quickly enough. The relevant Strategic FloodRisk Assessments (SFRA) and the updated fluvial and coastal flood risk mapsfrom the Environment Agency show the flood risk across the District fromthese sources. Hampshire County Council is the designated Lead Local FloodAuthority for Hampshire under the Flood and Water Management Act and,along with District Councils, must contribute to the achievement ofsustainable development when carrying out flood risk management functions.54This means
that the amountof wateravailable perperson is lowand the waterdemand perperson is a highproportion ofeffective rainfall-Areas of waterstress: finalclassification.EnvironmentAgency 2007.

22222100Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park AuthorityWinchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core StrategyTogether these local authorities are developing a Local Flood Risk
Management Strategy for Hampshire.
9.38 Policy CP17 therefore seeks to avoid flood risk to people and propertywhere possible, and manage any residual risk through location,layout and design, taking account of the impacts of climate changeon changing flood risk as identified in the SFRA. This includes makingspace for water by directing development to areas at lowest floodrisk first, protecting sites required for flood risk management and theuse of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) where appropriate. 
9.39 All planning applications, except those within Zone 1, on sites less than1 hectare and not in a critical drainage area
57will require a flood risk
assessment. Applications will be assessed using the sequential test innational policy which requires new development to be located in zonesof the lowest probability of flooding first (Zone 1)
58. Alternative sites
with higher probability of flooding (Zone 2 and then Zone 3) will onlybe considered where there are no reasonably available alternative sites.The vulnerability of the proposed land use to the flood risk will thenalso be taken into consideration by applying the ‘Exceptions Test’ ifrequired. This will consider proposals for vulnerable developmentinappropriate to the flood zone. These proposals will need to demonstrate: thatthere are no suitable alternative sites; that the development provides widersustainability benefits to the community that outweigh flood risk; and that thedevelopment will be safe for its lifetime, taking account of the vulnerability of itsusers without increasing flood risk elsewhere, where possible reducing flood riskoverall.
9.40 Within each Flood Zone, new development should be directed to areas oflowest probability of flooding first and then to areas suited to the vulnerabilityof the proposed use (the most vulnerable development must be located inareas of lowest flood risk unless there are overriding reasons to prefer adifferent location). Development within the functional floodplain
59must be
avoided to retain access for maintenance and a suitable buffer towatercourses and flood defence structures, as well as for transferring andstoring flood water. The SFRA considers the impact of climate change onflooding events and sets the criteria to be used to identify areas where floodrisk may increase. Within these areas, the future vulnerability of the proposeduse should be considered. 
Policy CP17 - Flooding, Flood Risk and the Water Environment
The Local Planning Authority will support development which meets all
the following criteria:- 
Gavoids flood risk to people and property by:-

Settlement Gaps 
9.41 Across the District there are a number of areas of undeveloped land which helpto define and retain the separate identity of settlements, an aspect highly valuedby many communities, and the concept of gaps is an established spatialplanning tool locally. It is also an important element sub-regionally and thePartnership for Urban South Hampshire (PUSH) has specifically producedguidance to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the sub-region interms of criteria for designation - ‘Policy Framework for Gaps’ PUSH, December2008 (www.push.gov.uk). 
9.42 In summary, the PUSH Framework advocates the following criteria for use bylocal planning authorities to select locations for the designation of gaps:-
Gthe open nature/sense of separation between settlements cannot beretained by other policy designations;
Gthe land to be included within the gap performs an important role indefining the settlement character of the area and separating settlements atrisk of coalescence;
Gin defining the extent of a gap, no more land than is necessary to preventthe coalescence of settlements should be included having regard tomaintaining their physical and visual separation. 
9.43 The Framework states that it will be individual LDFs that will identify thelocation of gaps and include policies to set out the types of developmentwhich will be permitted, based on the following principles :-
Git would not diminish the physical and/or visual separation of settlements;and 
Git would not individually or cumulatively with other existing or proposeddevelopment compromise the integrity of the gap.
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park AuthorityWinchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
2222221029.44 In addition to this specific guidance for the sub-region, there is
recognition that the scale of development proposed at the StrategicDevelopment Area at North Fareham requires the inclusion of a gapto prevent coalescence of the SDA with neighbouring settlements ofWickham, Funtley and Knowle. In order to protect the separateidentity of these individual settlements, the South East Plan requiresareas of open land to be identified and maintained between the SDAand adjoining settlements. 
9.45 The precise extent of this gap will be determined as part of thepreparation of an Area Action Plan (for land within FarehamBorough), and policy SH4 of this Plan establishes the extent of theopen land (within Winchester District) to be retained to the north ofthe Fareham SDA. 
9.46 Within the District, there are a number of Local Gaps already definedby the adopted Local Plan Review, in accordance with criteria similarto those above:-
GBishop’s Waltham – Swanmore – Waltham Chase – Shedfield – Shirrell Heath
GDenmead – Waterlooville
GKings Worthy –Abbots Worthy
GOtterbourne – Southdown
GWinchester – Compton Street
GWinchester – Kings Worthy/Headbourne Worthy
GWinchester – Littleton
9.47 The Local Plan Review 2006 also defines the ‘Meon Strategic Gap’ between
Whiteley and Fareham.
9.48 Gaps provide a key opportunity to provide green infrastructure around theDistrict, in addition to shaping and maintaining the settlement pattern. Theyare a valuable tool and the principle of maintaining gaps in these locations isretained. Any detailed review of the boundaries of these gaps will beundertaken in future Local Plan Part 2 or a Neighbourhood Plan, in accordancewith the principles contained in the PUSH Policy Framework for Gaps.
Policy CP18 - Settlement Gaps
The Local Planning Authority will retain the generally open and
undeveloped nature of the following defined settlement gaps:
GBishop’s Waltham – Swanmore – Waltham Chase – Shedfield – Shirrell Heath
GDenmead – Waterlooville
GKings Worthy – Abbots Worthy
GOtterbourne – Southdown
GWinchester – Compton Street
GWinchester – Kings Worthy/Headbourne Worthy
GWinchester – Littleton
GWhiteley – Fareham/Fareham Western Wards (the ‘Meon Gap’)
Within these areas only development that does not physically or
visually diminish the gap will be allowed.
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park Authority9Winchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
103Core Policies 
High Quality Environment To protect the individual character and identity of those settlements
adjoining the proposed SDA at North Fareham, an area of open land isidentified as a Gap to be maintained between the SDA and Knowle andWickham (see Policy SH4). Development which would threaten theopen and undeveloped character of this area will be resisted and theland should be managed to secure the long-term retention of its ruralcharacter.
The South Downs National Park
9.49 40.4% of the area of Winchester District now falls within the South DownsNational Park. Within this area the landscape is characterised by rollingdownland, notably large grass and arable fields, and small pockets ofwoodland. The chalk Rivers Itchen and Meon flow through the area adding tothe variety and form of the landscape. Within the District key chalk sites of theSouth Downs National Park were designated as a Nature Improvement Area in2012. ‘The South Downs Way Ahead’ will restore 1,000 hectares of chalkgrassland to encourage the return of butterflies and farmland birds.
9.50 The settlements within the area have developed in a way which follows thenatural forms of the landscape. The traditional vernacular buildings reflectlocal building styles and materials of the area. The National Park’s boundary isadjacent to a number of urban areas, most notably Winchester itself and thelarger settlements of New Alresford and Bishops Waltham. Development inthese areas has the potential to impact on the landscape and amenity of theNational Park and must be carefully managed and mitigated.
9.51 The two statutory purposes of the South Downs National Park are:
Gto conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritageof the area;
Gto promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of thespecial qualities of the National Park by the public.
9.52 In delivering the National Park’s purposes the National Park Authority has aduty to seek to foster the economic and social well-being of the localcommunities within the National Park.
Policy CP19 - South Downs National Park.
New development should be in keeping with the context and the
setting of the landscape and settlements of the South Downs NationalPark. The emphasis should be on small-scale proposals that are in asustainable location and well designed. Proposals which support theeconomic and social well being of the National Park and itscommunities will be encouraged, provided that they do not conflictwith the National Park’s purposes. 
Development within and adjoining the South Downs National Park
which would have a significant detrimental impact to the ruralcharacter and setting of settlements and the landscape should not bepermitted unless it can be demonstrated that the proposal is of over-riding national importance, or its impact can be mitigated.
Winchester City Council and South Downs National Park AuthorityWinchester District Local Plan Part 1 - Joint Core Strategy
22222104Heritage and Landscape Character 
9.53 The District has a diverse heritage which underpins its special
character, including over 100 ancient monuments, 2000 listedbuildings, 10 historic parks and gardens, more than 30 conservationareas and a historic battlefield which now lies within the SouthDowns National Park. Their retention and enhancement is essentialfor the conservation of the District’s unique sense of place and canbring wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits. 
9.54 In this regard, the Local Planning Authority has and will continue toundertake a proactive approach to the conservation andenhancement of the District's historic environment. This approach willinclude the production of a programme of conservation areaappraisals and management plans and any other necessary studiesand strategies to support the protection, maintenance andenhancement of the District’s heritage assets, including thepreparation and maintenance of a Heritage at Risk Register. The LocalPlanning Authority will actively seek to bring assets on the registerback into care.
9.55 In addition, the District’s distinctive landscape character, which derives from acombination of natural and man-made assets, contributes to its specialqualities. The importance of the landscape, both as a whole and locally-important features as identified in the Winchester District Landscape CharacterAssessment and the Winchester City and its Setting study, highlight thenecessity for these special qualities to be retained and respected in planningfor growth and change. 
9.56 Designated and protected features should not be seen as a constraint tochange, but as a catalyst for regeneration and diversification, bringingeconomic, cultural and educational benefits. In addition to the many formallydesignated sites and buildings within the District, it is often the additionalnumerous undesignated heritage assets and the setting of such areas thatmakes them special and even small changes can have an adverse impact. It iscritical that, when development proposals are considered, these assets aregiven due consideration at the design stage to ensure that any adverseimpacts are either avoided or can be fully mitigated. 
Policy CP20 - Heritage and Landscape Character
The Local Planning Authority will continue to conserve and enhance the
historic environment through the preparation of Conservation AreaAppraisals and Management Plans and/or other strategies, and willsupport new development which recognises, protects and enhances theDistrict’s distinctive landscape and heritage assets and their settings.These may be designated or undesignated and include natural and manmade assets associated with existing landscape and townscape character,conservation areas, scheduled ancient monuments, historic parks andgardens, listed buildings, historic attlefields and archaeology.
Particular emphasis should be given to conserving:
Grecognised built form and designed or natural landscapes that
include features and elements of natural beauty, cultural or historicimportance; 
Glocal distinctiveness, especially in terms of characteristic materials,trees, built form and layout, tranquillity, sense of place and setting.

10.1 As the District changes to accommodate additional development, newor improved infrastructure will be needed to ensure that thecommunities within it can function effectively. The CommunityStrategy recognises that sustainable communities can only be achievedwith the timely provision of the full range of infrastructure required. 
10.2 The types of infrastructure needed will cover a wide range of localfacilities and services, including ‘soft’ infrastructure and shouldinclude facilitation to ensure establishment of the following: 
GTransport, including public and community transport
GAffordable and specialist housing, including gypsy and travellersites
GEducation provision
GHealth facilities and social services
GGreen infrastructure, including recreation provision 
GPublic and utility services, including water supply, waste management andenergy provision (including renewables)

GOEmergency Services
GFlood defences
GCommunications infrastructure, including mail delivery infrastructure and
high speed internet connections 
GMeasures necessary to protect, avoid or mitigate harm to areas designatedfor their local, national, or international importance 
10.3 This Local Plan requires the delivery of three key strategic sites to deliver thebulk of the District’s housing requirement up to 2031. Large developmentssuch as these sites require a significant amount of early planning andpreparation through community consultation and technical studies to assessimpact and prepare mitigation measures. The City Council and its partners,where relevant, will work with the developers to ensure that the bestoutcomes for the District and local communities are achieved. The strategicsites, in particular, will necessitate the delivery of specific items ofinfrastructure as set out in Policies WT2, SH2 and SH3.
10.4 National policy places significant emphasis on the need for localplans to ensure that the necessary social, physical and greeninfrastructure is provided to deliver sustainable communities andsupport economic growth and regeneration. This Local Planalso needs to support the provision of infrastructure andnatural resources for economic development based on arobust assessment of need. A separate InfrastructureDelivery Plan has been produced which sets out theinfrastructure improvements required to support theproposed developments in the District, their anticipatedcosts, when they will be needed, and who will beresponsible for providing them.10 10

10.5 New development creates a need to provide new infrastructure and facilities, and
to mitigate the effect of the development on the surrounding area. Developersare therefore required to provide or fund infrastructure improvements associatedwith development for the types of infrastructure set out above.
10.6 On-site provision or, where this is not possible, financial contributions will besought from developers, to combine  with public funding to deliver the necessaryfacilities and infrastructure. The infrastructure requirements and contributionswill vary depending on the scale, nature and location of the development.References in this Plan to ‘developer contributions’ are intended to cover physicalprovision of infrastructure (on or off-site) or financial contributions. These maybe secured by planning obligations/agreements (known as S106 obligations) andthe Local Planning Authority plans to introduce the Community InfrastructureLevy (CIL) in due course. This will introduce a charge on new developmentsacross the District, the monies from which can be used to fund localinfrastructure projects where development occurs. Where it is possible to identifyspecific provision needed by a development, for example in larger developments,this should normally be achieved through physical provision on-site or adedicated financial contribution.
10.7 The City Council plans to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy by 2014.Until this point, the City Council will use both planning obligations and planningconditions to secure the required improvements or funding, using standardcharges or formulae, where appropriate. This approach will be informed by theInfrastructure Delivery Plan which draws on strategies and investment plans ofthe local authority and other organisations. Contribution levels will be based onthe overall costs of provision, but will take into account the availability of othersources of funding.
10.8 Any requirement to secure funding via developer contributions will be subject tothe necessary assessments and compliance mechanisms to ensure that thecontributions are appropriately calculated and legal. Infrastructure will need tobe provided at the right time to support development; this is not always inadvance of development and phasing and trigger mechanisms will be needed toensure that the right facilities come forward at the right time. The Council willalso work with the service and infrastructure providers to ensure that relevantinfrastructure is provided in a timely way, in conjunction with development.
10.9 There are particular infrastructure issues affecting the District and futuredevelopment proposals, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Theseinfrastructure needs will also require on-site delivery, or where not possible/suitable, financial contributions and requirements are set out in more detail inother Local Plan policies, including transport, water infrastructure, open spaceand green infrastructure.
10.10 The policy below seeks to ensure that appropriate and necessary infrastructure isprovided to support development proposals and that future developmentscontribute to resolving any pressures they may generate.
Policy CP21 - Infrastructure and Community Benefit
The Local Planning Authority will support development proposals which
provide or contribute towards the infrastructure and services needed tosupport them, which should be delivered using the following approach:-
Gtesting the capacity of existing infrastructure and where there isinsufficient capacity securing the timely provision of improvements oradditional provision;

Gwhere a contribution towards other infrastructureimprovements or provision is needed and viable this will beachieved through planning obligations, or the CommunityInfrastructure Levy when introduced.
Any on-site provision or financial contribution should:-
Gmeet the reasonable costs of provision to support the
development or offset its impact; and
Gbe related to the size and type of each development and thenature of the improvements required; and
Gtake account of the cumulative impact of requirements on theviability of development, especially where the development meets aparticular local need or provides particular benefits.
The Local Planning Authority will support the improvement or
development of locally and regionally important infrastructure whereneeded to serve existing or new development required through thisPlan, or to secure long term supply, provided that the need for suchfacilities is consistent with other policies within this Plan.
Implementation And Monitoring 
10.11 An essential element of ensuring the effectiveness of the policies and proposalsset out in this Plan is to measure how well they are being implemented. Thespatial strategy and policies will be implemented through the investment ofprivate and public resources, together with the City Council working inpartnership with a range of organisations. Much of the policy framework willbe implemented through planning applications and the developmentmanagement process.
10.12 This requires a monitoring framework that identifies indicators and targets forthe Plan to be measured against. This will be achieved through the Council’sAnnual Monitoring Report (AMR), which will allow the City Council to measurehow well the Plan is being implemented and whether the objectives identifiedare being achieved. This mechanism of ensuring that outcomes match anddeliver objectives provides a systematic and robust means of identifying ifcertain matters are failing to deliver and to take alternative action if required,including the need to initiate a review of the Plan. All policies and proposals inthis Plan are positively and flexibly expressed to ensure that changes incircumstances can be addressed.
10.13 At some point the Plan will need to be reviewed, either to roll it forwardbeyond its current end-date, to deal with any serious shortfalls or unintendedconsequences identified through monitoring, or if it becomes inconsistentwith national policy. It is expected that a roll-forward of the Plan will becommenced roughly mid-way through the Plan period, unless previouslytriggered by monitoring or other substantial external changes. Smaller-scaleallocations and adjustments to policy can be made through the preparationand production of Local Plan Part 2 or a Neighbourhood Plan.10

11411210.14 A Monitoring Framework is set out at Appendix D and has been derived using
a number of existing targets and indicators already monitored by the CityCouncil and its partners. Some targets and indicators may apply to more thanone policy and these are highlighted where relevant.
10.14 A housing ‘trajectory’ is included at Appendix F and sets out the expected rateof housing development from various sources over the Plan period. This willbe monitored to ensure both an adequate 5 year supply of housing landDistrict-wide and to check the situation in each of the spatial areas,particularly in relation to the strategic allocations. The Plan does not seek tophase housing provision or artificially hold back development, so if marketdemand is strong delivery may progress more quickly than expected in thetrajectory. Alternatively, if key sites are being delayed, the Council will assesthe reasons for this and investigate measures to overcome any constraints.However, it may be that other sources of supply will offset the delay andenable adequate housing provision to be maintained, or that there is expectedto be an adequate District-wide land supply despite delays on a particular site.If not, it may also be necessary to bring forward additional sites for housingpurposes in accordance with the development strategy established in this Plan,through the production of Local Plan Part 2 or subsequent reviews.
