National Planning PolicyFramework
1.25LocalPlansmustbeconsistent withGovernment policy.TheNational Planning Policy
Framework (NPPF)setsoutGovernment policyregarding planning matters. Paragraph 14
oftheNPPFisacriticalelement ofnational planning policyinrelationtoLocalPlans.It
statesthat:
“AttheheartoftheNational Planning PolicyFramework isapresumption infavourof
sustainable development, whichshouldbeseenasagoldenthreadrunningthrough
bothplan-making anddecision taking.
Forplan-making thismeansthat:
localplanning authorities shouldpositively seekopportunities tomeetthe
development needsoftheirarea:
LocalPlansshouldmeetobjectively assessed needs,withsufficientflexibility to
adapttorapidchange, unless
anyadverseimpactsofdoingsowouldsignificantly anddemonstrably outweigh
thebenefits, whenassessed againstthepoliciesinthisFramework takenas

1.26This"presumption infavourofsustainable development" makesitclearthatthe
DistrictCouncil shouldseektomeetidentified needsfordevelopment inStaffordshire
Moorlands intheLocalPlanunlessthereareveryclearandrobustreasons nottodoso.
1.27Another keyelement oftheNPPFarethe"testsofsoundness". Thesetestswere
appliedbythePlanning Inspector whentheLocalPlanwasunderexamination. TheLocal
Plan(asmodified) wasdeemed tohavemetallofthetestsinorderforittobeadopted. The
testsarethattheLocalPlanmustbe:
“Positively prepared –theplanshouldbeprepared basedonastrategy which
seekstomeetobjectively assessed development andinfrastructure requirements,
including unmetrequirements fromneighbouring authorities whichitisreasonable

Justified –theplanshouldbethemostappropriate strategy,whenconsidered

Effective –theplanshouldbedeliverable overitsperiodandbasedoneffective

Consistent withnational policy–theplanshouldenablethedelivery of

1.28Notethatforclarification thisLocalPlanhasbeenprepared andexamined underthe
transitional arrangements ofthe2012NPPF,consequently references madethroughout the

Pollution andWaterQuality
7.16Pollution notonlycannegatively impactonthequalityoflifeofpeople,butcanalso
contribute toclimatechange(impactonozoneetc)andadversely impactonbiodiversity

7.17According totheGovernment, poorairqualityisthelargestenvironmental riskto
publichealthintheUK:pollutants including Nitrogen Dioxide andparticulates arestill
responsible for40,000premature deathseachyearnationally (according toRoyalCollege

negatively impacts uponthehealthofprotected ecosystems, andagricultural productivity .
Inresponse tonitrogen limitssetintheEUAirQualityDirective, theGovernment issuedits
latest‘UKPlanforTacklingRoadside Nitrogen DioxideConcentrations’ in2017.
7.18TheNPPFdirectsCouncils toproactively provideneededeconomic development -
however decisions shouldensurethatnewdevelopment is“appropriate foritslocation” in
pollution/contamination terms;andmoregenerally development shouldcontribute tosecuring
goodstandards ofamenity andreducing pollution. OntheotherhandtheNPPFrecognises
thatindustrial expansions resulting in‘some’additional noiseshouldnotbeunfairlyrestricted.
Inaccordance withtheGovernment's noisepoliciesincluding theNoisePolicyStatement
forEngland (NPSE) theCouncil willapplytheprinciples inthefollowing Policytoany
development wherepollution orcontamination considerations mayarise.
7.19TheWaterFramework Directive (WFD)cameintoeffectin2003andestablished a
legalframework fortheprotection, improvement andsustainable useofwaterbodiesacross
Europe: itappliestoallsurfacewaterbodies(rivers,lakes,canalsetc)andgroundwater
resources. Itsobjectives includetoimprove (andpreventdeterioration) inqualityofwater
bodies,reducewaterpollution, conserve aqueous habitats, andpromoting sustainable use
ofwater.TheWFDsupports acatchment basedapproach tomanaging thewaterenvironment
