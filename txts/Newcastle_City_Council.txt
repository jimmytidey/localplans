This document represents a major step forward for our city and its people. It 
sets out the basis on which we can plan the development of a working city, with decent neighbourhoods for current and future generations. It addresses the unfairness and inequalities created by a housing market that currently denies opportunities for families seeking a home they can afford, within a sustainable community and with access to facilities and services. The green thread that runs through this document means we can manage development to reduce its environmental impact. Without it, the city could fall victim to unconstrained development, damaging communities and our environment. It therefore takes the long-term approach we need, to look beyond the challenges and uncertainties of today’s economy, and chart out a better future for a confident, growing city for future generations. By joining with our neighbours in Gateshead, we look across the Tyne to plan across the whole core city area, recognising the interaction between communities, and the role we play in a successful north east region.
Newcastle has a great economic future. A working city, with a vibrant city centre, 
new industries and new jobs in growing sectors, opportunities for our people to acquire new skills. A great student city which brings young people from across the world to study and contribute to our society. A cultural hub, with vibrant and active communities. An open and confident city that attracts and retains people to live and work here. The principal economic hub for a wider region, connected by a modern public transport system that can be the envy of Europe, and to the world through road and rail links, and a flourishing international airport which connects us to the global economy. A city willing to intervene to support the economy, with an ambitious investment plan, and active measures to support jobs and skills. A city large enough to sustain the facilities and services required by a modern economy and society; and yet small enough to be accessible and welcoming.
This Plan prepares the ground for that success. It supports the growth of 14,000 
additional jobs in Newcastle by 2030. By looking ahead and understanding the make-up of our economy we can see where those jobs will be created: in areas of new technology such as offshore engineering and life sciences, in the flourishing creative and digital economy, in the continued growth of business and financial services, and in a retail heart that continues to innovate and develop in the internet age. This Plan will create the room we need for business expansion, on new sites such as Science Central, East Pilgrim Street, the Central Station and Stephenson Quarter, on the banks of the Tyne, and at Newcastle International Airport.
Independent estimates suggest the combined population of Newcastle and 
Gateshead will continue to grow beyond half a million. We will need to plan for 21,000 new homes in Newcastle by 2030. We start from a situation in which young families are already struggling to find a home they can afford in a community they want to live. The UK’s dismal record on housebuilding is denying opportunities for our existing residents, and failing future generations. We have choices.Foreword by Councillor Nick Forbes, 
Leader of Newcastle City CouncilPlanning for the Future 10
We can either restrict further growth, push up prices further, and force people to 
leave the city in search of better opportunities. Or we can match our economic ambitions with a commitment to create stronger communities, with the homes that people need. If we fail to set out our own plans, the market will take over, and we will lose the opportunity to manage the consequences of growth for our communities, services and infrastructure.
Throughout the preparation of this Plan, our overriding priority has been to build 
new communities within our existing urban footprint, and on brownfield land connected to existing infrastructure. Responding to cuts in national government capital spending, and a sluggish private sector development market, we have set out an ambitious Local Investment Plan. Our Future Homes Fund will bring £25 million of new investment to re-invigorate our housing market over the next 3 years. We will continue to invest beyond that point, seeking opportunities to bring forward brownfield land for new housing wherever possible. We will plan for 15,000 of the 21,000 new homes to be within the current urban area, including 2,000 additional places for our growing student population. We will achieve this through investment in brownfield sites, and extensions of existing communities. We will support investment in the district centres that are so important in sustaining local communities.
Newcastle’s village communities are great places to live, with the benefits of 
access to the city, and to the beautiful environment which surrounds it. To sustain those communities, within a growing city, we need to invest in their future. Where growth can be managed effectively, we will plan for their controlled expansion, and avoid the risk of unsustainable or harmful development. By setting out plans for new homes in greenfield sites, including in communities already created from former greenfield land, we can secure the school places, shops, public transport and services that those growing communities will need, in a way that retains and secures the environment for future generations.
This Plan has been created through an active conversation with our communities. 
We have listened to the ideas and concerns, from those worried about the impact on their existing communities, and from those who are seeking new opportunities for places to live and work in Newcastle. We have taken into account the needs of future generations, as well as the people who currently live and work here. I am confident that this Plan will help us secure a strong future for our city, for the jobs we need for the future, and communities we can be proud of.
Planning for the Future 11
Anyone who has spent any time in Gateshead will know that this is a place with 
a clear vision for the future, one where ambition is embraced and where we are committed to both celebrating the past and building the future.
While iconic landmarks like the Angel of the North or Sage Gateshead are the 
obvious symbols for some of our guiding principles in terms of regeneration and quality of development, this Plan is central to continuing that success in communities right across Gateshead.
It’s an ambitious agenda for achieving economic prosperity, delivering healthy 
sustainable communities and tackling climate change. It will form the strong foundation on which we will deliver local aspirations. The Plan will guide economic growth, so that our area is the first choice for local, national and global business and investors. It is also a plan for our communities, helping to ensure sustainable jobs and homes that families want to live in.
This document will assist in guiding development in Gateshead to 2030 and 
beyond, ensuring provision to accommodate 8,000 new jobs and 11,000 new homes, to meet our needs. It provides an overarching spatial plan aimed at delivering sustainable development, with detailed proposals to ensure that the role of Gateshead, at the heart of the local and regional economy, is strengthened, and that our development needs are accommodated in the most appropriate locations.
Regeneration and new development will make our neighbourhoods and 
villages sustainable places. A new riverside community, Metrogreen, will help to regenerate a major area of brownfield land close to Dunston, Metrocentre and the River Derwent. It will provide thousands of new homes, supported by new business space, quality green spaces and improved pedestrian and cycle links, in addition to the high quality shopping and public transport facilities already at Metrocentre.
District and local centres across the area will be revitalised and strengthened so 
that they remain at the heart of their communities, with new retail development underway in Birtley, Blaydon, Felling and Ravensworth Road.
We’ll continue to work positively through the Gateshead Regeneration 
Partnership to regenerate and improve our existing housing areas. New housing will also be provided on sites in the rural area, to assist the Council in meeting our wider housing needs and helping to sustain our villages into the future, while at the same time ensuring that our attractive countryside and important heritage sites are protected and enhanced.Foreword by Councillor Mick Henry, 
Leader of Gateshead CouncilPlanning for the Future 12
We are working hard to bring new businesses to the area, particularly in the 
science, digital, creative and tourism sectors. Development will be focused at Gateshead Quays and Baltic Business Quarter, further enhancing Gateshead’s reputation for cultural regeneration and complementing existing cultural icons such as Gateshead Millennium Bridge, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art and Sage Gateshead. A new vibrancy will be supported by the reinvigorated shopping area in Gateshead, with Trinity Square providing a strong focal point and boosting the local economy. The Plan also proposes a new urban neighbourhood with strong links to the Town Centre, helping to provide hundreds of new family homes on brownfield land.
Sustainability is at the heart of the Plan. Both the causes and effects of climate 
change will be tackled through high standards of design and construction; and sustainable access will be reinforced to all parts of Gateshead, the North East and beyond. 
But it’s important to remember that it isn’t just the Council’s Plan, this is a plan 
that has been created by working very closely with the people of Gateshead. Even before we started to develop the Plan with Newcastle, in September 2009, we were undertaking consultation to establish what the residents of Gateshead wanted for their area. In developing this Plan we’ve listened closely to the views expressed by our communities and other stakeholders, and worked collaboratively with neighbouring authorities to ensure that our plans will complement each other’s, for the benefit of the whole region.
Together, this Plan provides a sustainable and positive future and improved 
health and wellbeing for all.

This section sets out how the Plan has been prepared, the local context and 
highlights the strategic challenges Gateshead and Newcastle face.
Chapter 1 Introduction to this Plan
Chapter 2 Preparing the Plan Chapter 3 Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait                     Section 1Section 1  IntroductionIntroduction  201.1  Gateshead and Newcastle Councils have been working tog ether since 
2009 to prepare a shared planning framework for Gateshead and 
Newcastle. The decision to prepare a joint Plan is in recognition of the economic advantage to both Local Authority areas. This includes expansion of employment areas, science and research, retail-led development, housing growth and improving infrastructure to support growth at the heart of the region.
1.2
  The ambitions of Gateshead and Newcastle are to grow and prosper
 
and be sustainable places of choice for living and working today and tomorrow. In order to achieve this it is essential that a positive and proactive approach is taken. Planning for the Future Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan for Gateshead and Newcastle upon Tyne (The Plan) sets out the spatial planning framework to deliver economic prosperity and create lifetime neighbourhoods. It is the central document in the Local Plans of Gateshead and Newcastle and will guide decisions on development until 2030. Each Local Authority has a statutory duty to prepare a Local Plan. Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s separate Local Plans will contain a series of documents as set out in Figure 1.1.1. Introduction to this Plan

The Plan
1.3 This Plan contains our overall joint spatial vision, objectives, strategy  
 and policies. The Plan began as two separate plans within Gateshead’s  
 and Newcastle’s respective Local Development F
rameworks (LDFs):  
 the One Core Strategy Development Plan and the Urban Cor
e Area  
 Action Plan. These were prepared under the Planning and Compulsory  
 Purchase Act 20041 and set within the context of the North East   
 Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS)2. However since the Consultation   
 Drafts were published in October 2011 there has been a number of  
 significant amendments to the national and regional planning policy  
 context including the Localism Act 20113, the National Planning Policy  
 Framework 2012 (NPPF)4 and the revocation of the RSS in 2013.
1.4 The Plan covers the whole of the area within Gateshead’s and   
 Newcastle’s administrative boundaries. For the purpose of the Plan,  
 this area has been divided into three spatial character areas: Urban Core
,  
 Neighbourhood Area, and Rural and Village Area (Figure 1.2).Introduction to this Plan            Section 1

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].1.5   The purpose of the Plan is to set out a clear framework for growth  
in Gateshead and Newcastle from 2010  to 2030. The strategy sets 
the quantity and location of new housing, employment provision, shops, facilities and other services together with transport and other infrastructure provision.
1.6
 Implementation of this Plan requires partnership working and   
 co-operation with a range of organisations, including dev
elopers,   
 businesses, residents, community groups, transport and service   
 providers and neighbouring authorities. Section 6 includes a table  
 setting out how the policies will be delivered (Figure 18.1), identifying  
 partners and processes. The Councils’ Infrastructure Deliv
ery Plan (IDP)  
 sets out the infrastructure required to deliver the Plan. This will be  
 updated on an ongoing basis.
 1.7
 It is important that individual policies contained within this Plan are  
 not considered in isolation. The relevant policies should be assessed  
 together within the context of the whole Plan, the Policies Maps and  
 subsequent Local Development Documents (LDD’s).
1.8 The Plan is structured as follows: 
   Section 1 sets out how the Plan has been prepared and sets the local context highlighting the strate
gic challenges Gateshead 
and Newcastle face.
          
   Section 2 establishes the spatial vision, strategic objectives 
and the spatial strategy for implementing the vision. The
 
Spatial Strategy for sustainable development and growth includes spatial strategies for each character area: Urban Core, Neighbourhood Area and Rural and Village Area.
          
   Section 3 includes strategic policies for the economy, housing, 
tr
ansport, people and place, and minerals and waste. These 
policies apply to the whole of Gateshead and Newcastle.
          
   Section 4 outlines the policies for the Urban Core recognising 
the r
ole of the area in delivering economic growth for Gateshead 
and Newcastle. 
          
   Section 5 is divided into three chapters; a common introduction 
to the Sub-Areas and Sites, follo
wed by two separate chapters 
for Gateshead and Newcastle which include policies for the Urban Core Sub-Areas, Metrogreen and allocated sites. 
          
   This section addresses the delivery of the Plan and considers 
ho
w new infrastructure needed for development will be funded. 
It also outlines how the Councils intend to monitor and manage the Plan in terms of the delivery of the spatial visions, strategic objectives and implementation of the strategy. 
          
   The Appendices to the Plan contain: a schedule of our evidence 
base, a glos
sary of terms, our monitoring framework and further 
details to support the waste policy. Section 1:

 Delivery and 
Monitoring232.1  The Plan has been prepared during a time of considerable change in the 
policy c
ontext and has been informed by:
  •  Consultation and engagement with communities, businesses and stakeholders
  •  National policy
  •  National and locally prepared evidence
  •  Joint working and the Duty to Co-operate     
   
Consultation and engagement with communities, business and stakeholders
2.2  We have been committed to engaging with local communities and 
interested parties to help shape and de
velop the Plan. Gateshead 
and Newcastle are legally obliged to comply with their Statement of Community Involvement (SCI)
5 which sets out how and when the Councils 
will consult when preparing an LDD. The preparation of the Plan has involved consultation with the local community and stakeholders. There have been six stages of consultation to date:
  •   Issues and Options - Prior to the commencement of joint working, each C
ouncil undertook - consultation on issues and options for 
their original separate Core Strategies; Newcastle Area Action Plan Key Issues and Development of Options Report (2006)
6; and, 
Gateshead Fit for a City Regeneration Delivery Strategy (2008)7.
  •  Decision to collaborate and align visions (2009) - Following the decision to work tog
ether in 2009, work was undertaken to assess 
previous consultation responses on issues and options and align Gateshead and Newcastle’s individual visions. Following a series of workshops and a joint Local Strategic Partnership event in October 2009, the Councils published the Bridging Document Developing Sustainable Cities NewcastleGateshead 2030
8 and Topic Papers 
which established a shared vision, objectives and initial evidence base.
  •  One Core Strategy Consultation Draft9 and Urban Core Preferred 
Options (January 2011)10 - Following agreement to work jointly 
on the Core Strategy it was also agreed that the Councils would collaborate on a joint plan for the Urban Core. The Councils published the One Core Strategy Consultation Draft and Urban Core Area Action Plan Preferred Option Report in January 2011.
  • One Core Strategy Draft Plan11 and Urban Core Draft Plan (October  
   2011)12 - The fourth stage was to consult on the revised Plans  
   following the completion of the Strategic Land Re
view (Part 1)28,  
   the receipt of comments from previous c
onsultation, and the  
   preparation of updated and new evidence.
  •  Proposed Major Changes Consultation (June 2012) - The fifth stage of consultation was on the Pr
oposed Major Changes Reports13.
  •  Proposed Submission Document (September 2013) - Statutory consultation was undertaken following the mer
ging of the Core 
Strategy and the Urban Core Area Action Plan into a single LDD.2. Preparing the Plan Preparing the Plan            Section 124National Policy
2.3  The Localism Act (2011)3 introduced a number of significant changes 
to the planning system allowing Councils greater local autonomy to 
plan for the needs of the area and provide local people with a greater opportunity to become involved in local planning. 
2.4
 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)4 published in March  
 2012 sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and  
 aims to promote sustainable development and growth. The NPPF   
 represents a fundamental reassessment of the ov
erall direction of the  
 planning system in England. It plays a key role in delivering the   
 government’s localism agenda establishing a framework f
or Local   
 Planning Authorities to plan positively to meet development needs.  
 The NPPF is the framework for the preparation of our local policies  
 and provides guidance on how plans must be written, tested and   
 examined. This is supported by the Town and Country Planning (Local  
 Planning) (England) Regulations 201214. The Planning Practice   
 Guidance (PPG) published in March (2014) is a web based resource to  
 assist the implementation of the NPPF. The Plan has taken into account  
 specific requirements.  
2.5 The Regional Strategy for the North East (Rev
ocation) Order came into  
 force on 15 April 2013. Consequently the RSS no longer forms part o
f  
 the statutory Development Plan.
National and locally prepared evidence
2.6  The Plan has been informed by various national and locally prepared 
plans, strategies, and e
vidence produced by the Government, the 
Councils and their partners including:
  •  national evidence and guidance including the NPPF and the Census.
  •  technical studies, local strategies and technical and background papers. The evidenc
e library is set out in Appendix 1. 
  • recommendations from appraisals and assessments including: 
     •     Sustainability Appraisal (SA)15 and Strategic 
Environmental Assessments (SEA) to ensure that the policies accord with the principles of sustainable development and consider the social, economic and environmental impacts. Where appropriate the policies have been amended to improve their performance against sustainability criteria.
     •      Habitat Regulations Assessments (HRA) to assess potential significant e
ffects the Plan could have on 
European sites designated for their nature conservation importance.
     •     Health Impact Assessments and Equalities Impact and Needs Assessments to examine the impact o
f policies 
associated with public health, equality and diversity.Preparing the Plan25Preparing the Plan            Section 1Joint working and the Duty to Co-operate 
2.7 The ‘Duty to Co-operate’ became a legal requirement under the   
 provisions of the Localism Act (2011)3. In essence it requires Local  
 Planning Authorities and other prescribed bodies to co-operate on  
 strategic matters. The Councils of Gateshead and Newcastle ha
ve a  
 strong and long established record of commitment to joint working  
 with each other, with neighbouring authorities and with other public  
 bodies. Specifically, Gateshead and Newcastle have worked to
gether on:
  •  Bridging Document Developing Sustainable Cities 
NewcastleGateshead 20308 - the shared sustainable community 
vision document which sets out our shared ambitions for the future of Gateshead and Newcastle together.
  •  City Deal16 - The City Deal settlement will provide funding to 
stimulate development of our Key Sites. Funding through our Accelerated Development Zone (ADZ) will unlock growth potential in the Urban Core. The Councils will be able to fund upfront infrastructure needs based on the projected increase in business rates in the defined ADZ area which can be retained under the terms of the City Deal for 25 years. 
  •  1Plan17 - a 20 year economic strategy that sets out economic 
growth sectors and priorities.
2.8  Since the demise of the North East Regional Assembly, Gateshead and Ne
wcastle Councils have worked proactively with Durham, 
North Tyneside, Northumberland, Sunderland and South Tyneside Councils to discuss and co-operate on a range of social, economic and environmental issues. We have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding and will continue to work together to address cross-boundary issues. This joint working is further strengthened by each of our commitments to the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and the Combined Authority.3.1  Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s communities are structured conc entrically, 
following the pattern of population growth since the 18th century. 
The well defined Urban Core at the centre grew up around the long- established bridging-point where the Tyne was crossed by the Great North Road. It is surrounded by older neighbourhoods such as Jesmond, Bensham and Elswick, which are in turn enclosed by outer areas such as Gosforth, Low Fell and Blaydon. Further out again, these are bounded by the more rural areas which include villages such as Dinnington, Ryton and Chopwell.
3.2
  Gateshead and Newcastle are set within a distinctive landscape, which has been extensiv
ely shaped and influenced by its’ rivers and by the 
development of industry over the last two centuries. Newcastle is predominantly urbanised, while Gateshead extends out over a rural hinterland, beyond a strong urban form along the River Tyne.
3.3
 Straddling the Tyne, the Urban Core is one of the most dramatic and  
 memorable of any major place in England and is at the heart of the  
 North East. On the north side of the river, historic streets wind down  
 the steep slopes through Grainger Town, linked by paths and steps to  
 Newcastle Quayside. The Swing Bridge and Gateshead Millennium  
 Bridge connect Newcastle to the south side’s cultural facilities - the Sag
e  
 Gateshead and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art - while the Tyne  
 Bridge, High Level Bridge, King Edwar
d VII Rail Bridge, Queen Elizabeth II  
 Metro Bridge and Redheugh Bridge unite the two centres.

3.4  The natural and built historic environment is of high quality. It includes 
fragments o
f development from the Roman era (most notably Hadrian’s 
Wall), the medieval Castle Keep and town walls, parish churches and the high-quality urbanisation of Georgian and Victorian times, including Grey Street, Grainger Town and Saltwell. There are 31 conservation areas, 7 historic parks and gardens (including the large 17th and 18th century landed estates such as Gibside, Ravensworth and Axwell), a battlefield and over 4,000 listed buildings
18.
Location and access
3.5  Gateshead and Newcastle are relatively remote from other major
 
conurbations (Figure 3). The nearest English Core City, Leeds, is 95 miles 
away, and it is 106 miles to Edinburgh. Rail and air connections are good. There is a fast and frequent rail service on the East Coast Main Line to London and Scotland, with regular cross-country services to most other major cities. Newcastle International Airport offers services to a range of national and international business centres as well as many holiday destinations. Passenger numbers doubled in the decade to 2007 and have now stabilised at around 4.3 million per annum

 west to Carlisle. Within the conurbation, capacity on the A1 continues to  
 be an issue. It is one of the most congested strategic r
outes in England. 
3.7  Our transport network experiences some of the highest usage lev
els 
outside London. However there are areas in the east and west including 
Chopwell, Crawcrook, Ryton, Throckley, Newburn, Lemington and parts of the outer west and east in Newcastle where accessibility is more limited.
People and homes
3.8
  The health of people across Gateshead and Newcastle is improving
, but 
is still much worse than the national average. It is also very polarised. 
2012 Health Profiles report that an average life expectancy for men living in our most deprived areas is 12.5 years
20 lower than for men 
living in the least deprived areas; for women the gap is nearly 10 years. Estimates for adult obesity of 31%
20 for both Gateshead and Newcastle 
are notably higher than the national average of 24%20. A measure for 
healthy-eating adults shows 20%20 for both Gateshead and Newcastle, 
compared with a national average of 29%20. By focusing on the wider 
determinants of health, this Plan will play an important part in delivering opportunities to improve the health of our residents.
3.9
  In planning for Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s future, it is essential
 
to understand the needs of the current and future population. The current population of 475,400 (2011 Census
21) is around 18,000 
more than in 2001. This is mainly the result of people living longer, and incoming international economic migrants. The latest population projections estimate our population will continue to grow, increasing by approximately 50,000 between 2010 and 2030
22.
28Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait
3.10   Around 15% of Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s population is aged 65 or 
over. With the proportion of older people is projected to rise b
y 19%21 
by 2030. Newcastle has a higher proportion of working-age population (20- 64
19), at around 62%, and a lower proportion of older people 
(around 14%) than the proportions for Tyne and Wear overall (around 60% and 17.5%
19 respectively), while Gateshead has the reverse (65% 
and 18% respectively). Around 18%21 of Newcastle’s population is 
from a black and/or minority ethnic group, up from 6.9% in 2001. The Gateshead figure is around 6%, up from 1.6%
21.
3.11   Both Gateshead and Newcastle are currently experiencing over
all 
population increases but Newcastle particularly continues to show patterns of out-migration to surrounding areas. The majority of out migrants are people of working age. We are losing families and employed people to other districts. The most significant flows are from Newcastle to North Tyneside.
3.12
  Gateshead and Newcastle currently have a total housing stock of appr
oximately 215,000 dwellings21. Both authorities have higher 
proportions of social housing overall, at 29.4%21, than the North East 
and nationally. There is a broad range of house types within Gateshead and Newcastle, including 30% flats
21 of which many are Victorian 
‘Tyneside flats’, paired in terraced housing.
29Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait            Section 1
3.13   The housing offer across Gateshead and Newcastle is varied, but the 
housing mark
et is quite polarised. There are strong markets in some 
inner areas, for example Jesmond, and low market demand and market decline in other inner areas, for example Bensham and Elswick. In some neighbourhoods vacancy and concentrations of low demand housing remain an issue, although there have been marked improvements since 2001, often due to interventions such as the Bridging NewcastleGateshead Housing Market Renewal Pathfinder. Despite some successful interventions, further investment and improvements are essential to address market imbalance and the continued failure to meet modern needs and aspirations. The quality of the housing offer is one of the key issues facing Gateshead and Newcastle. There is a need for a broader range of housing to reduce net out-migration to surrounding areas, and a corresponding need to increase build rates overall. We also need to improve the quality of our existing housing stock for existing residents, to help create mixed and affordable sustainable communities that people choose to live in. Affordability in its widest sense represents a key challenge and in many respects the housing offer needs to deliver greater value for money.
3.14
 In both Gateshead and Newcastle there are some excellent e
xamples  
 of housing design and layout, generally from the period up to and   
 including the inter-war years, but also including more recent schemes  
 like Staiths South Bank. However, other areas o
f housing lack townscape  
 interest or quality public spaces. Many could be improved to create  
 higher-quality residential environments, but this needs to be done with  
 care to avoid measures which could fragment communities.
The ec
onomy and jobs
3.15  Gateshead and Newcastle together is the key employment ar
ea in the  
 North East, and the main driver of city-region growth. Appro
ximately  
 299,00022 people work here, more than 44.9%22 of them live outside  
 Gateshead and Newcastle. Historically our economy was reliant on  
 traditional heavy industries, including shipbuilding and coal mining.  
 Over recent decades there has been a shift towards service sector
s,  
 but industrial areas, including Team Valley, Follingsby and W
alker   
 Riverside, remain important and contribute to economic diver
sity.   
 Over the past 10 years Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s economy has  
 performed strongly. The 2010 figure of approximately 299,000 jobs22  
 was an increase of approximately 25,000 on 10 years earlier.   
 Approximately 36%22 of jobs are in the public sector, 22%22 are in  
 business services and 28%22 are in retail and distribution. The latest  
 available data (2008) shows that there were 12,595 businesses in   
 Gateshead and Newcastle, 48%23 of the total in Tyne and Wear, an  
 increase of approximately 1,205 on 5 years pre
viously. There is evidence  
 to suggest relatively limited business formation and historically poor  
 business survival across Gateshead and Newcastle.
30Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait3.16  Worklessness remains an important issue, especially in some of the  
 deprived urban neighbourhoods. Levels of worklessness r
educed in  
 Gateshead and Newcastle, as well as in the wider North East, in the  
 decade to 2008, and narrowed the gap with national levels. Howe
ver,  
 between 2008 and 201123, there has been an increase of    
 approximately 4,800 unemployed people. Overall, the ec
onomy still  
 lags behind the national average, particularly in terms of employment,  
 skills and earnings.
3.17  The commercial property market is fairly diverse
, ranging from Grade  
 A office space in Newcastle City Centre and Gateshead’s Quays, to the  
 strong industrial base on the Team Valley Trading Estate and smaller  
 industrial estates. But there is evidence that the current stock is not  
 in equilibrium with market requirements. Some of our office stock is  
 obsolete and suffers from high vacancy rates, typically in 1960s/70s  
 office blocks. The provision of high-specification, serviced and flexible  
 office space, within a high-quality Urban Core, will be es
sential to   
 facilitate growth in knowledge-based sectors such as creativ
e, digital  
 and media industries. Linked to this, academia and research are a key  
 economic asset, as well as having an exceptional r
esearch reputation  
 that attracts people from all around the globe. Two colle
ges (Gateshead  
 and Newcastle) and two universities (Newcastle and Northumbria)  
 together host around 107,000 students. Other sectors such as   
 manufacturing, engineering industries and distribution and logistics  
 remain important and will continue to require large premises with g
ood  
 access to the Strategic Transport Netw
ork.
31Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait            Section 1
3.18  In the retail market there are two prime shopping destinations: Newcastle  
 City Centre and the Metrocentre, rank
ed nationally 11th and 36th   
 respectively24. A network of other centres, including Gateshead Centre,  
 provides the focus for communities through their pro
vision of shops,  
 services and employment opportunities. However, ther
e are currently  
 wide variations between centres in terms of quality and quantity of  
 shops and services provided. Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s Retail Health  
 Check Reports25 have identified that centres such as Gosforth High  
 Street and Low Fell are performing very well, while ther
e are others  
 such as Shields Road and Felling which are considered to be centres in  
 need of investment.
3.19  The unique character and identity of Tyneside, together with its livelines
s  
 and range of facilities attract approximately 4.4 million visits26 per   
 year. Even so, there remains consider
able potential for Gateshead and  
 Newcastle to expand leisure, culture and tourism attractions b
y   
 broadening the existing day and evening economy and improving the  
 business tourism offer.
The Urban Core
3.20   The Urban Core is the employment capital and the primary generator 
of ec
onomic growth for the North East of England. It benefits from 
high levels of accessibility and sustainability, and provides a focus for government, higher education, business, shopping, leisure and tourism. Without growth Gateshead and Newcastle will be unable to compete effectively. The success of the Urban Core is therefore fundamental to our long-term vision of achieving sustainable economic growth. Development that meets the needs for office space and retailing are particular priorities for the Urban Core.
3.21
  Compact and generally walkable, the Urban Core needs car
eful and 
targeted efforts to enhance pedestrian and cycle routes and to establish new links to shops, entertainment and commercial premises. New parking provision will be located on the edge so that walking and cycling become a more attractive alternative to travel by car. Another key issue connected with this is the high volume of vehicle trips which pass through it, often unnecessarily. The A184 dominates and divides the eastern and northern sides of Gateshead Centre, and Newcastle’s central motorway creates a barrier between the centre and the inner East End.
3.22
  The Urban Core is home to approximately 23,00021 people and has the 
potential to meet a range of housing needs and to attract more people. It already has a range of housing from historic town houses to terraced housing, flats above shops, riverside apartments and recent purpose- built student accommodation. This could be further diversified by new development, especially for families. 
32Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial PortraitThe environment 
3.23   This Plan is being written at a time of changing priorities. We can no 
longer rely on the exploitation of natur
al resources to meet our everyday 
needs or generate our wealth. There needs to be an integrated approach to planning for the future to provide a high quality of life at a lower environmental and ecological cost.
3.24
  The North East will need to address the effects of climate change.
 
Gateshead and Newcastle Councils have both signed up to the Covenant of Mayors. The Covenant of Mayors
27 is the mainstream European 
movement involving local and regional authorities in the fight against climate change. It is based on a voluntary commitment by signatories to meet and exceed the EU 20% CO2 reduction objective through increased energy efficiency and development of renewable energy sources.
3.25
  Gateshead and Newcastle and their partners rely on a well-developed
 
waste sector, including active landfill sites at Blaydon and Path Head in western Gateshead and a number of other commercial facilities, some clustered within Employment Areas and other facilities which are more dispersed, including composting facilities. Both authorities are involved in projects to deliver alternative facilities for the management and recovery of municipal waste, including the provision of household waste recycling and transfer centres.
33Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait            Section 1
3.26   Gateshead and Newcastle are well provided for in terms o f publicly 
accessible open space. There are significant areas of high landscape 
quality, particularly in and around the Derwent Valley, broad informal open spaces like the Town Moor and high-quality urban parks such as Leazes Park and Saltwell Park. The transformation of the River Tyne in recent years has resulted in the return of otters and salmon, and it supports the furthest inland breeding colony of kittiwakes in the world. Other important wildlife habitats include extensive ancient semi-natural woodlands and a wealth of protected sites and species. However, many green spaces in the area are currently isolated and poorly linked to the wider network of spaces and access to recreational open spaces is a problem in some areas.

  Both Gateshead and Newcastle have a long association with mineral e
xtraction, including coal, brick clay and sand and gravel. The industry 
has helped shape the topography and character of the area through a history of mining, shipbuilding and waggonways. The area remains underlain by shallow coal reserves, while parts of Gateshead also contain deposits of glacial and river sand, gravel and brick clay. Existing operations are focused at Brenkley in Newcastle (surface coal extraction) and at Gateshead Wharf (landing and processing of marine aggregates).
34Gateshead and Newcastle’s Spatial Portrait
35This section establishes Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s spatial vision, strategic 
objectives and the Spatial Strategy for implementing the vision. The Spatial Strategy for sustainable development and growth includes spatial strategies for each character area: Urban Core, Neighbourhood Area and Rural and Village Area.

businesses. Gateshead’s and Newcastle
’s Local Strategic Partnerships 
worked closely together to agree an overall shared vision and set of ambitions. This is expressed in our Bridging Document Developing Sustainable Cities NewcastleGateshead 2030. The shared vision states:
Vision 2030By 2030 Gateshead and Newcastle will be prosperous and sustainable cities that are unique and distinctive places - where people choose to live, work and visit because everyone can realise their full potential and enjoy a high quality lifestyle.
4.2
 To deliver this vision and address challenges we fac
e, the following  
 vision statement and strategic objectives set out our ambitions for the  
 three character areas and how collectively they will cr
eate a prosperous  
 and sustainable Gateshead and Newcastle.
Vision Statement 
Our vision is that by 2030 Gateshead and Newcastle will be a mor
e prosperous, 
attractive and sustainable place to live and work, with improved quality of life and thriving communities. Our population will increase to more than 500,000 and we will create approximately 30,000 new homes in sustainable locations.
The foundations for Gateshead and Newcastle’s transformation are its 
communities. All of our communities will be thriving and attractive places to live. More sustainable patterns of living will be achieved through the creation of balanced communities where there is a range of housing, good access to jobs and services to meet local needs.
Development will adhere to sustainability principles and deliver high standards 
of design, enhancing the quality and distinctiveness of Gateshead and Newcastle. Development will also be ecologically sustainable and designed to protect and where possible enhance biodiversity and the natural environment. This will ensure the delivery of a healthy natural environment benefiting both communities and wildlife and securing natural resources in the long term. There will be an emphasis on a low carbon economy and sustainable development. This will have been supported by a major increase in renewable and low-carbon energy capacity and new development will have been designed to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
The Urban Core will continue to be the economic hub of the North East, fulfilling 
its role as the leading retail, entertainment, employment and learning centre for Tyne and Wear. It will be a place where businesses choose to locate, with a wide array of investment opportunities and an emphasis on ensuring that everyone shares in the benefits of economic growth. To sustain growth, and fundamental to achieving economic prosperity, there will be an appropriate range, mix and quality of employment sites and housing opportunities. The Urban Core will be a place of choice for doing business, learning, entertainment and living.
364. Spatial VisionSpatial VisionOur Neighbourhood Area will comprise of places of choice with attractive 
communities and centres providing good access to jobs, shopping, health, recreation, open space and other facilities to meet day-to-day community needs. Areas including Benwell-Scotswood, Bensham, Birtley and Walker will have been transformed into distinctive areas where people aspire to live, offering a diverse range of high quality housing in an attractive and safe environment. Complemented by the establishment of new sustainable housing areas and communities, these areas will have helped to attract population back into the area, supported by local services and centres, and with access to local employment opportunities at Team Valley and Walker Riverside. The area also benefits from excellent access to opportunities in the Urban Core, Follingsby and Newcastle Airport.
Our Rural and Villages area will enjoy a renaissance. It will be a popular and 
sustainable place to live, work and visit, supported by new housing, improved facilities and services, and improved transport connections. The population of our villages will have stabilised, and in appropriate locations grown, underpinned by a larger and more diverse rural economy, all contributing to the place that is Gateshead and Newcastle. Our village and rural areas will be more than just dormitory settlements. Over the plan period this area will perform an increasingly important role, offering a range of leisure and visitor facilities set within an attractive countryside, in providing employment opportunities and in accommodating a range of homes that supplement and complement our Urban Core and Neighbourhoods.

that we g
et the right development in the right place at the right time. 
This development will meet the needs of people living and working in Gateshead and Newcastle, while protecting and enhancing the environment.
5.2
  Our economy and population are growing. We need to plan for 22,000
 
jobs and 30,000 homes (excluding purpose-built student dwellings) within the plan period. To plan for this future growth we are prioritising locations that are both sustainable and deliverable. We need to plan positively for new homes, lifetime neighbourhoods and a bigger and rebalanced economy which is linked to knowledge based sectors such as science, research and sustainable technologies. Policy CS1 sets out our spatial strategy for sustainable growth.
Policy CS1 Spatial Strategy for Sustainable GrowthTo create and sustain thriving communities and a more prosperous economy, development, including the provision for approximately 30,000 new homes, 22,000 jobs and a minimum of 150 hectares of employment land, will be directed to sustainable locations. This will be achieved by:
 1. A presumption in favour of sustainable development.
 2. Focusing the majority of development in the existing built up areas.
 3. Prioritising the Urban Core as the location for major office, retail, higher  
  and further education, leisure, culture and tourism development.
 4. Supporting economic development outside the Urban Core in Key  
  Employment Areas; Team Valley, Walk
er Riverside, Follingsby, Newcastle  
  International Airport.
 5. Enhancing neighbourhoods and re-balancing housing stock by   
  delivering homes supported by jobs and local services.
 6. Sustaining villages and the rural economy through a balance of housing  
  provision, employment and local services.
 7. Specific revisions to the boundary of the Green Belt to allocate land for  
  new development. The new Green Belt boundary is defined on the  
  Policies Maps.
8. All development being:
  i.   Fully inclusive, irrespective of cultural backgr
ound ethnicity and age,  
   to meet the diverse needs of all residents and communities.
  ii.  Well-connected and accessible by sustainable modes of tr
ansport. 
  iii. Well designed to promote community cohesion, wellbeing, and to  
   reflect and enhance the area’s character and natural en
vironment.
  iv. Designed to reduce carbon emissions and adapted to the effects of  
   climate change.

2. East Pilgrim Street3. Stephenson Quarter4. Gateshead Quays5. The Exemplar Neighbourhood5.4  Sustainable development is about meeting the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability f
or future generations to meet their 
own needs. The Plan promotes sustainable development as defined by the  NPPF  as “living within the planet’s environmental limits, ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; achieving a sustainable economy; promoting good governance; and using sound science responsibly”. The Councils have adopted a positive approach in seeking to meet their objectively assessed development needs.
5.5
 When considering development proposals, the Councils will take a  
 positive approach that reflects the presumption in fav
our of sustainable  
 development contained in the NPPF. We will work proactiv
ely with  
 applicants to find solutions, approve compliant applications without  
 delay, and where necessary use the guidance in the NPPF to determine  
 applications.
5.6  The Spatial Strategy positively seeks opportunities to meet the development needs of Gateshead and Ne
wcastle. The Urban Core (Policy 
CS2 and Section 4) will remain the strategic priority for development in Gateshead and Newcastle, to ensure it fulfils its potential in contributing to economic prosperity. The Neighbourhood Area (Policy CS3) and Rural and Village Area (Policy CS4) will continue to support vibrant and diverse communities. The Spatial Strategy identifies four Key Employment Areas outside the Urban Core, which provide a clustering for economic activity. Employment Areas across Gateshead and Newcastle will play an important role in accommodating the requirements of a range of sectors.
5.7
 We are aiming to utilise land efficiently through the use of previously  
 developed land, vacant properties and surplus industrial land, however
,  
 there is a shortage of deliverable sites. Gateshead and Newcastle attach  
 great importance to the Green Belt, however
, the boundary is drawn  
 tightly around the urban and village edges. It is considered that in order  
 to meet our objectively assessed needs for housing and employment,  
 there is an exceptional circumstance to alter the boundaries. 
5.8  Most housing growth will be located in the existing built up area, this will include approximately 21,600 ne 
w homes. An additional 8,400 homes will 
be allocated in Neighbourhood and Village Growth Areas. This will help us to meet our five year housing land supply as required by the NPPF, and ensure land is available to meet our needs over the whole plan period.  The need for an annual housing development rate of approximately 1,500 per annum (Policy CS10) means that development will be promoted simultaneously across the whole of the plan area in order to deliver the homes we need.
5.9
 There is also a shortage of land for employment to ensure sufficient   
 space of the right type is provided in the right location to allow for gro
wth.  
 The Councils’ Employment Land Reviews (ELRs)29 have identified a   
 locational need for employment land to cater for storage and distribution  
 at Follingsby, and greenfield employment sites next to the New
castle  
 International Airport.
43Spatial Strategy            Section 25.10  A full Green Belt review has not been undertaken but a Strategic Land  
 Review and Green Belt Assessment has. The Stage 1 r
eport30 appraised  
 all sites in the Green Belt, considering impact on Green Belt and broad  
 level of suitability. The report, including all sites above a thr
eshold,   
 was published in September 2011. Gateshead and Newcastle each   
 prepared Stage 231 reports which were published in July 2012. These  
 reports looked at the consultation responses from the Draft Plan and  
 also assessed the suitability, deliverability, and sustainable acc
essibility of  
 the sites identified in Stage 1. Stage 3 reports32 were published in   
 July 2013 and these set out the proposed revised Green Belt boundaries.  
 The Plan identifies sites that have been removed for the specific purpose  
 of development from  the Green  Belt. The Green Belt boundary has   
 been amended as illustrated on the Policies Maps in order to meet our  
 objectively assessed needs for employment and housing. In addition there  
 have been minor changes to the boundaries either arising from the   
 identification of sites, or to ensure land is included or excluded from the  
 Green Belt in accordance with national guidance on the purposes of   
 including land in the Green Belt and the use of suitable features to form  
 boundaries.
5.11   Both Councils are committed to the promotion of diversity
, equality and 
fairness, and expect all development to contribute to this in accordance 
with the latest equalities legislation.
5.12   It is important that development is located in the most sustainable locations, accessible by a choic
e of travel modes including public 
transport, walking and cycling (Policy CS13). This is to reduce the need for people to travel, minimise levels of congestion, improve road safety and meet climate change reduction targets.
5.13
  The Plan also seeks to improve the quality of life in Gateshead and New
castle for current and future generations. This will be achieved through 
well-designed development which protects and enhances the built and natural environment, which is supported by infrastructure and local facilities and which helps create healthy lifestyles and a sense of place for everyone. Developments must also address the key challenges of climate change (Policy CS16) and flood risk (Policy CS17), through their location, design and construction (Policy CS15). The need to reduce both energy consumption and the risk of flooding are key factors which underpin the Plans locational strategy, and which also need to be addressed in individual proposals.
44  Spatial Strategy6.1 As the cultural and economic heart of the area the Urban Core plays a  
 critical role in Gateshead and Newcastle’s prosperity and identity. This  
 chapter sets out the strategic approach to ensure that this role continues  
 to drive and focus growth in the most sustainable locations. Our vision  
 and strategy are dependent on the success of the Urban C
ore as it   
 provides the greatest opportunity to deliver major growth which is  
 regionally significant and promotes wider benefits. Major office, r
etail,  
 leisure, culture and tourism development will be located here. Chapter  
 14 sets out a range of specific policies for the Urban Core area and  
 Chapters 16 and 17 set out policies for the seven Sub-Areas and their  
 allocated Key Sites.
6.2  The Urban Core includes Newcastle City Centre and Gateshead Centr
e 
and extends from Exhibition Park in the north to the Southern Gateway 
site in the south and from Forth Yards in the west to the Ouseburn in the east.
Policy CS2 Spatial Strategy for the Urban CoreThe Urban Core is the priority location for development which will maintain and enhance its vibrancy. This will be achieved by:
 1. Expanding its role as an office location through the provision of at least  
  380,000 square metres of new office space
.
 2. Enhancing its retail function through improving the quality, quantity  
  and range of comparison and convenienc
e shops and increasing   
  provision of comparison retail provision in Ne
wcastle Retail Centre by at  
  least 50,000 square metres additional gross retail floorspace
. 
 3. Promoting clustering of knowledge-based industries, universities,   
  colleges and hospitals.
 4. Supporting developments which enhance and diversify culture, leisur
e  
  and tourism facilities.
 5. Securing a mix of housing, including at least 3,750 new homes and  
  prioritising the Exemplar Neighbourhood.
 6. Promoting sustainable modes of transport and access for all, managing  
  traffic to minimise the impacts of development and improving the local  
  environment.
 7. Securing high-quality design that promotes local distinctiveness and  
  sustains and enhances the historic environment.
 8. Allocating Key Sites, East Pilgrim Street (NC2), Exemplar Neighbourhood  
  (SG2), Gateshead Quays (QB2), Science Central (C2) and Stephenson  
  Quarter (D2) for growth. These sites will be brought forward in   
  accordance with approved masterplans to demonstr
ate a comprehensive  
  and coordinated approach to site development and infrastructure   
  provision.

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].6.4  There has been a steady growth in offices in the Urban Core pr oviding 
a range of high quality accommodation for professional, business and 
financial services, the knowledge economy and creative industries. Policies will promote further growth and the location of approximately 75% of office requirements within the Urban Core. It is a highly attractive location close to services, being easily accessible at the heart of the regional transport network. A range of sites have been identified to cater for the needs of different sectors and approximately 80% will be located within Newcastle and 20% within Gateshead. Major sites include Stephenson Quarter and Baltic Business Quarter and Policy UC1 sets out full details of all our priority office sites.
6.5
  Newcastle is the regional retail and leisure centr
e and opportunities to 
improve and expand the range of retail must be continuously explored to meet identified needs and ensure Newcastle retains its position in the retail hierarchy, competing effectively with other centres. New retail development will be a catalyst for growth in other sectors such as leisure. Newcastle has consistently been identified for growth and the latest retail study has identified capacity for at least 50,000 square metres additional gross retail floorspace which will be located at East Pilgrim Street and within the Primary Shopping Area as outlined in Policies UC2 and NC2.
6.6
  The universities, colleges, hospital and Centre f
or Life drive the 
knowledge economy and have raised our skills base leading to higher levels of productivity. These centres of excellence have seen significant growth over the last decade. The benefits of the transfer of knowledge and skills between education, research and industry are particularly important and will continue to be promoted. Attracting investment from the private sector to complement these sectors will be key to growing the knowledge economy. The Science Central Key Site provides a large site for expansion of the knowledge economy in an ideal location, as outlined in Policy C2.
6.7
  Cultural-led regeneration projects ha
ve transformed areas such as 
the Quayside, Quays and Grainger Town. This has led to rapid growth in tourism and Gateshead and Newcastle becoming very popular destinations. Leisure, culture and tourism have been one of the fastest growing industries and have helped raise the area’s profile and image internationally. We wish to diversify the range of attractions and expand facilities to support business tourism, to continue the development of hotels and promote activity during the day into the evening.
6.8
  There is potential to significantly increase the residential population by providing a br
oader range of housing including conversion of upper 
floors in the Urban Core to meet market demands. In Gateshead the Exemplar Neighbourhood will be a major new residential area providing family homes. In Newcastle we will support housing as part of mixed- use schemes. Science Central should provide a mix of housing and apartments.
47Urban Core Spatial Strategy            Section 26.9 Movement into, through and around the Urban Core will be impr oved  
 by promoting travel by sustainable modes and minimising through  
 traffic. Policies will direct traffic which does not need to travel into  
 the Urban Core onto major routes around the edge of the Urban Cor
e.  
 This will provide opportunities to improve the environment particularly  
 for pedestrians and cyclists. In Newcastle this will allow further   
 pedestrian priority areas, new cycling routes and to re-focus bus   
 movements within the Central Sub Area.
6.10  The Key Sites will be major areas of change delivering our vision and  
 together they will stimulate development of the surrounding ar
ea. Each  
 Key Site will make a major contribution to regener
ation, providing jobs,  
 homes and improving the environment.
6.11   Gateshead and Newcastle are distinctive places with a strong identity.
 
The bridges and iconic buildings of the Quayside and Quays are 
instantly recognisable and the defining topographical feature is the Tyne Gorge and the River Tyne that runs through it. Steep streets connect the waterfront to the Centres with street patterns which reflect the long history of the two places. Over the past 20 years, schemes have regenerated large areas and we will promote distinctive high quality development befitting of a regional capital which sustains and enhances our assets.
6.12
  The Urban Core is divided into seven Sub-Areas  Their boundaries are de
fined by a combination of factors including the built form, heritage, 
roads, railway uses and by the way in which they are expected to develop. Section 5 of this Plan sets out specific policies for these areas.
48Urban Core Spatial Strategy
7.1  The Neighbourhood Area forms the majority of the built up area of 
Gateshead and New
castle and this is where most of our residents live. 
This area extends as far as Gosforth and Fawdon to the north, Westerhope, Lemington and Blaydon to the west and Whickham and Harlow Green to the south. Birtley further to the south is detached, but is included in this area. The Neighbourhood Area boundary (as defined in Figure 1.2) includes the Neighbourhood Growth Areas, which were previously in the Green Belt. The Neighbourhood Area benefits from two Key Employment Areas, Team Valley and Walker Riverside, as well as other Employment Areas, and is supported by a range of District and Local Centres, as defined in Policy CS7.
7.2
  A key spatial priority of the Plan is concentrating new housing
 
development in our Neighbourhood Area. The majority of new housing development will be accommodated here, both within the existing built up area and in the new Neighbourhood Growth Areas. We will ensure that our Neighbourhoods Areas are places of choice for living, supported by sustainable access to job opportunities and a range of other services and facilities to meet the day to day needs of residents. Our Neighbourhood Area will provide housing choice for people, regardless of age and income to underpin the areas’ economic competitiveness and support our working population.
7.3
  Policy CS3 identifies locations where growth and development will be supported.
P
olicy CS3 Spatial Strategy for Neighbourhood Area 
In the Neighbourhood Area sustainable communities will be promoted and maintained, meeting housing needs and supporting jobs by:

 locations to offer choice across Gateshead and Newcastle
. We have  
 identified our priorities for investing in neighbourhoods including  new  
 major brownfield sites and any new greenfield land for future housing  
 development.
Neighbourhood Opportunity Areas
7.6  An essential requirement of any strong and stable community is that 
r
esidents have access to decent and secure homes. Major interventions 
through housing market renewal and regeneration programmes have aimed to address housing problems through a comprehensive programme of selective demolition, redevelopment and refurbishment and the provision of new housing. Poor housing has an adverse effect on an individual’s physical and mental health. A balanced supply of good quality housing is therefore a key component of any sustainable community and is essential for economic prosperity.
7.7
  The focus for housing market activity will be in eight Neighbourhood Opportunity Areas (Figure 7.2). Compr
ehensive interventions including 
improving the quality and range of housing in these areas is required to ensure that in the future they are attractive and safe locations of choice.

Figure 7.2: Neighbourhood Opportunity AreasAreas of Change
7.8 We have prioritised housing development on brownfield sites and  
 have identified Metrogreen and Newburn as Areas o
f Change. These  
 sites are embedded in the existing Neighbourhood Area and offer   
 the opportunity for major new housing development close to   
 established Employment Areas. Policies AOC1 and AOC2 set out our  
 requirements in respect of their future development.
Neighbourhood Gr
owth Areas
7.9  We have considered the allocation of Neighbourhood Gro
wth Areas 
carefully and have sought to allocate only the land we need to meet our 
objectively assessed needs, which cannot be met in the existing built up area. The Neighbourhood Growth Areas identified are those that have been assessed to be the most sustainable. They can be linked to existing or extended public transport routes can be serviced by existing facilities and services or are of a scale that means they can support new facilities and services, can be delivered without adverse impacts on significant high quality habitat areas and are not at significant risk from fluvial flooding. Neighbourhood Growth Areas have been allocated in a range of locations to provide a reasonable level of choice and to enable a number of sites to be developed simultaneously. This will sustain the rate of development needed.
7.10
 Given that the new development will generate the need f
or new   
 infrastructure it is important that the individual sites (as defined   
 in Policy CS3) in each of the Neighbourhood Growth Areas are   
 masterplanned together, regardless o
f ownership. Phasing plans will  
 be required which set out the triggers for the provision o
f required  
 infrastructure and legal agreements will need to be put in place to  
 deliver that infrastructure. Masterplans will be prepared by the   
 landowner/developer(s) in consultation with the Councils and must  
 be approved as part of the planning application process. The   
 masterplanning and the development requirements of these sites are  
 set out in policies in the Sub Areas and Site Specific policies in Section 5  
 of the Plan.
52Neighbourhood Area Spatial Strategy
Key Employment Areas
7.11   It is important to protect and enhance our established Key Employment 
Areas (T
eam Valley and Walker Riverside). In the Neighbourhood 
Area these are major locations that provide an essential alternative business location to the Urban Core specifically for large floor plate employment uses. While the Urban Core is our priority, these sites are major contributors to our economic prosperity and we will support employment uses in these locations. Further detailed policies for these sites will be set out in subsequent LDD’s.
7.12
  Strategically it is important to protect and enhance Team Valley T
rading 
Estate given its importance in the region as the premier industrial estate. It continues to be a major economic driver in the region providing a wide range of marketable office and industrial premises, in a well laid out and attractive environment that benefits from direct access to the A1.
7.13
 Walker Riverside is an area of economic gr
owth benefiting from   
 Enterprise Zone status. Walker Riverside is well placed to tak
e   
 advantage of significant inward investment opportunities around   
 advanced engineering, manufacturing associated with the marine   
 offshore related industries and renewable energy lo
w carbon   
 manufacturing industries. There is a thriving marine and offshore   
 technology cluster of companies on the River Tyne employing thousands  
 of people and the area has good prospects for growth. Ne
wcastle City  
 Council is investing in infrastructure here including river
side cranes.  
 The Neptune Energy Park Enterprise Zone has the potential to provide  
 onshore infrastructure, manufacture and support services to the marine  
 and renewable energy sector following the Crown Estates decision to  
 identify Dogger Bank as a preferred location for the de
velopment of one  
 of the world’s largest offshore wind f
arms.
53Neighbourhood Area Spatial Strategy            Section 2
8.1 Our Rural and Villages Area is extensive, co vering a large part of our  
 combined area, including two thirds of the whole of Gateshead. It   
 stretches from the urban edge of our neighbourhoods to the   
 boundary with Northumberland in the north and west, with County  
 Durham to the south and to the outlying parts of North Tyneside, South  
 Tyneside and Sunderland in the east. It has a multi-dimensional role  
 which brings challenges and opportunities; as a cluster of existing  
 settlements and communities in their own right.
8.2  A successful and popular Rural and Village Area, with a high-quality 
en
vironment, is important to the wider attractiveness and success of 
Gateshead and Newcastle. However, in considering some villages as settlements, there is an issue in terms of sustainability in that they are unable to support key local services and facilities. There is also significant variation in the quality, affordability and type of homes available within some parts of this area.
8.3
  The approach is to support an appropriate level of growth which
 
reflects the function and character of our villages, sustaining them into the future, and maintaining and enhancing their attractiveness as predominantly residential areas. Policy CS4 identifies those settlements which have been identified as having the potential to accommodate development and sustainable growth.
Policy CS4 Spatial Strategy for Rural and Village Area In the Rural and Village Area the long term sustainability of jobs and villages will be secured by:
 1. Development of approximately 4,350 new homes.
 2. Allocating Village Growth Areas for housing development at: Chop
well  
  (GV1), Crawcrook (GV2), Dinnington (NV1), Hazlerigg and Wideopen  
  (NV2), Highfield (GV3), High Spen (GV4), Kibblesworth (GV5), Ryton  
  (GV6), Sunniside (GV7) and Throckley (NV3). Development will be carried  
  out in accordance with:
  i. approved masterplans to demonstrate a comprehensive
, phased  
   and coordinated approach to site development, setting out how  
   necessary infrastructure, and the strategic infr
astructure identified for  
   the site in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be delivered on a  
   phased basis.
  ii. approved development phasing plans setting out build rates and  
   triggers for infrastructure, and demonstrating ho
w each phase of the  
   development is sustainable and deliverable.
 3. Focusing and protecting employment uses, and allocating additional  
  land, in the two Key Employment Areas of Follingsb
y (KEA2) (distribution  
  and logistics) and Newcastle Airport (KEA1) (airport related and general  
  employment (B1, B2, B8).

of locations to offer choice across Gateshead and Newcastle. Whilst the 
majority of housing will be located in the Neighbourhood Area it will not be possible to accommodate all of the growth there, or in the Urban Core, and therefore other locations have been allocated.
8.6
  Allowing limited new housing development in the Rural and Village Ar
ea will help to address imbalances in the mix and affordability of 
housing available, provide more choice for families and older residents, increase population levels to support local services and businesses and complement the wider housing offer.
8.7
  The villages in Gateshead and Newcastle vary in terms of their character, siz
e and the range of local facilities. A population of fewer than 3,000 can 
sustain some local services, whereas higher populations will increase the viability of service provision in terms of transport, community facilities and shops. As average household sizes continue to fall, additional housing will be required, just to keep rural settlements at their current population levels.
8.8
  The character of the Rural and Village Area is a key part o
f its 
attractiveness and the scale and density of housing development will need to respect this. Within the Rural and Village Area the majority of housing will be delivered in Village Growth Area sites and on sites within existing villages. Elsewhere, and in accordance with national policy, housing may also come forward within the Green Belt through the conversion of existing buildings, the reuse of previously developed sites or through limited infilling within villages, where the openness of the Green Belt is maintained.
Village Growth Areas 8.9
 We have considered the allocation of Village Gr
owth Areas carefully and  
 have sought to allocate only the land we need to meet our objectively  
 assessed needs and to support the sustainability of the villages   
 themselves in terms of facilities and services.
8.10   This will help to sustain the rate of development needed across the wider Gateshead and Ne
wcastle area. Given the potential impact 
that the new development will have on the existing villages in terms of their infrastructure, facilities and services it is important that it is masterplanned. Village Growth Area sites, as defined in Section 5 of the Plan are required to be masterplanned together where they adjoin each other regardless of ownership. Phasing plans will be required which set out the triggers for the provision of necessary infrastructure and legal agreements will need to be put in place to secure delivery. Masterplans will be prepared by the landowner/developer(s) in consultation with each Council and must be approved as part of the planning application process. The masterplanning and the development requirements of these sites are set out in policies in the Sub Areas and Site Specific policies in Section 5 of the Plan.
56Rural And Village Area Spatial StrategyKey Employment Areas
8.11   It is important to protect and enhance our established Key Employment 
Areas and in or
der to address gaps in our employment land portfolio 
allocate new sites for future development. In the Rural and Village Area there are major locations that provide an essential alternative business location to the Urban Core specifically for large floor plate employment uses. These sites are major contributors to our economic prosperity and we will support employment uses in these locations. Further detailed policies for these sites are set out in Section 5.
8.12
 Follingsby (Policy KEA2) is a distribution park of regional importance that  
 is well located to serve the Tyne and Wear urban area with exc
ellent  
 access to the Strategic Road Network. F
ollingsby has a number of high-  
 profile distribution/logistics occupiers and is considered to be an   
 important employment location, which, although it has potential for  
 growth, is likely to reach capacity in the medium term. The Key   
 Employment Area consists of the already allocated industrial park and  
 an additional 22 hectares of net employment land south of Follingsby,  
 which is allocated in the Plan to provide capacity for the growth of  
 distribution and logistics sectors to 2030 within Gateshead.
8.13   Newcastle International Airport (Policy KEA1) is a regionally important gateway to busines
s markets by air. It is an economic growth driver as 
well as having the potential to be an important employment location in its own right. It is well connected by public transport (Metro) and to the road network. The evidence identifies the importance of allocating such a site to attract new inward investment that would not be attracted to the Urban Core. The Key Employment Area consists of Newcastle International Airport for airport related uses and 3 sites for general employment (B1, B2, B8). 
57Rural and Village Area Spatial Strategy            Section 2
This section includes the strategic policies for economic prosperity, homes, 
transport, people and place and waste and minerals. These policies apply to the whole of Gateshead and Newcastle.
Chapter 9 Economic Prosperity 
Chapter 10 Homes Chapter 11 Transport and AccessibilityChapter 12 People and PlaceChapter 13 Waste and Minerals Section 3  Strategic PoliciesStrategic Policies9.1  The economic priorities for Gateshead and Newcastle are:
 •  To increase levels of growth, in
vestment and productivity,
 •  To improve skills and provide businesses with the right support,
 
 •   To expand the role of the Urban Core as a focus f
or business, leisure 
and tourism, and as the regional retail centre, and
 •   To promote a strong network of district and local centres to meet the
 
needs of all communities. 
9.2 In order to achieve this, Gateshead and Newcastle must promote the  
 growth of key sectors including globally competitiv
e universities, a  
 cluster of hospitals, a thriving knowledge economy driven through  
 research and innovation, a strong financial and profes
sional services  
 sector, good road and public transport accessibility and ac
cess to a  
 skilled labour force. The economic succes
s of Gateshead and Newcastle  
 is vital not just to our residents, but to the region as a whole.
9.3  Within this chapter are four policies to achieve economic prosperity: 
P
olicy CS5 Employment and Economic Growth Priorities, Policy CS6 
Employment Land, Policy CS7 Retail and Centres and Policy CS8 Leisure, Culture and Tourism, which aim to provide a framework for the expansion and diversification of the economy.
Employment
9.4
  Looking forward, economic growth is expected to be slow in the early
 
part of the plan period following the recession. The medium to longer 
term economic outlook however is more positive, with growth expected to return. Bespoke population and household  growth scenarios by St. Chad’s College at Durham University have informed the Plan. These are aligned with economic growth forecasts from Cambridge Econometrics that indicate an overall increase of around 22,000 jobs in Gateshead and Newcastle (around 8,000 in Gateshead, and 14,000 in Newcastle) from 2010-2030
22. These forecasts have informed future requirements 
for employment land reflected in our Employment Land Reviews (ELRs
29) and Office Needs Study33. The 1PLAN17, which is the adopted 
Economic Masterplan for Gateshead and Newcastle Councils, sets out the expansion sectors and locations seen as critical to the conurbation’s economic future.
599. Economic ProsperityEconomic Prosperity            Section 39.5 Employment patterns are expected to change over time. In 2010,   
 of the 299,00022 people who worked in Gateshead and Newcastle,  
 around 45% (134,000)22 commuted from the rest of Tyne and Wear,  
 and beyond. Our strategies to 2030 plan for an increase in Gateshead’s  
 and Newcastle’s population, and in the size of the resident work
force  
 compared with 2010 levels. The growth in employment is e
xpected  
 to be approximately 22,000 new jobs22. We will continue to rely on  
 some in-commuting for a proportion of our skilled labour force
, however,  
 our housing policies will encourage more economically active   
 households to live and work in Gateshead and Newcastle. It is   
 anticipated that there will be a slight increase in commuting, although  
 the proportion of jobs filled by in-commuters will decrease. It r
emains  
 essential to grow employment opportunities in sustainable locations,  
 supported by sustainable modes of transport.
Policy CS5 Employment and Economic Gr
owth Priorities
Gateshead and Newcastle will play a major role in the economic growth of the 
North East. They will continue to develop a diverse economy with accessible employment and deliver significant increases in the number of businesses and jobs. This will be achieved by: 
 1.  Ensuring a range of high quality economic development locations are
 
available and attractive to the market.
 2.  Strengthening and clustering economic assets and promoting growth sector
s including: 
  i. Financial, business and professional services in the Urban Cor
e; 
  ii. Retail, leisure, health and tourism in the Urban Core;
  iii.  The knowledge based economy at Science Central, univer
sities and 
further education institutes in the Urban Core;
  iv.  Marine and offshore engineering including renewables at Walker
 
Riverside;
  v. Advanced manufacturing and engineering at Team Valley;
  vi.  Creative media and digital at Ouseburn, Gateshead Quays and Baltic Business Quarter; and
  vii. Distribution and logistics at Follingsby.
 3.  Supporting Newcastle International Airport as a key economic growth
 
driver for the knowledge based economy and principal international gateway and focus of regional transport, 
 4. Significantly enhancing digital infrastructure,
 5.  Supporting entrepreneurship through the supply of a range and choic
e 
of premises,
 6.  Diversifying and expanding the rural economy by supporting local busines
ses and growth in leisure, culture and tourism, and
 7.  Attracting and supporting a skilled labour force and improving skills and ac
cess for local people to job opportunities including through targeted 
recruitment and training.
60Economic Prosperity9.6  Gateshead and Newcastle have undergone significant economic  
restructuring over the last 30 years. While some manufacturing sectors 
have declined over this period, between 1981 and 2010 employment in both Newcastle and Gateshead grew at a faster rate than the rest of the North East, supported by the growing service sectors. The economic potential combines both existing business sectors and new growth sectors including digital and creative, financial and business, biotechnology, engineering and environmental technologies.
9.7
  Our universities and colleges support growth and pr
ovide centres for 
learning, research and business, as well as links to a global knowledge network. The planned growth of our further/higher educational institutions (including Newcastle University, Northumbria University, Newcastle College and Gateshead College) is encouraged and supported by both Councils. To remain competitive it will be essential that we utilise our research advantage, particularly in world-class sciences, to provide a catalyst for value-added enterprises focused on innovation and commercialisation. This will provide high-skilled and high-value employment, rooted in the local economy, which is less vulnerable to economic downturn.
9.8
  Gateshead and Newcastle also accommodates clusters of engineering and en
vironmental technologies at Team Valley and Walker Riverside, 
professional and financial services, creative industries and media in the Urban Core, and health care linked with our hospitals, Centre for Life and universities. These key sectors benefit from locating in close proximity to similar companies, suppliers and specialised service providers and research centres, promoting innovation through social interaction and economic specialisation.
9.9
  The Plan also recognises the importance of transport and other infr
astructure which supports economic activity. Newcastle International 
Airport is a major asset and provides easy access to surrounding areas. It will be important to maintain the attractiveness of our Employment Areas to businesses, through improvements to the road network, enhancement of green infrastructure improvements to public transport provision and the pedestrian and cycle networks, the refurbishment of existing premises, and, provision of complementary uses that meet local needs. To remain competitive in a changing economy and to support our growing knowledge and creative industries, access to high-speed broadband and digital infrastructure will be essential. This also plays an increasingly vital role in enhancing the provision and delivery of local community facilities and services.
61Economic Prosperity            Section 39.10   A diverse range of accommodation and sites ar e available across 
Gateshead and Newcastle, from business start-up accommodation to 
headquarters for international companies. Small units and expansion sites are available within our established Employment Areas that can support existing local businesses. Sub-regional companies will be attracted from outside the local area for high quality premises and for accessible skilled labour, particularly in the Urban Core and Key Employment Areas. Large scale prestigious sites and premises are available for inward investment for national and international businesses, for instance around the airport. Local entrepreneurship will be supported by maintaining a stock of premises such as managed office workspace, suitable for business start-ups and small/medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The range of retail activity, tourism and leisure provision and cultural activity is wide, reflecting the role of the area as the regional centre, and some sectors will benefit from expansion.
9.11
  The rural economy has seen reduced reliance on mining and intensive
 
agriculture, and is now supported by a greater diversity of businesses such as forestry, leisure and tourism. To maintain a prosperous rural economy it will be important to enable a range of rural businesses to grow and promote the diversification of agricultural businesses, for instance through the conversion of farm buildings into small office premises and provision of accommodation in rural Employment Areas.
9.12
  The benefits of a successful and growing ec
onomy must be shared. 
We need to improve access to employment, training and skills for communities experiencing high levels of deprivation. Poor skills can be a barrier to accessing employment, and so targeted recruitment, training agreements and partnership working with developers, for both the construction and occupation of developments, will help to maximise opportunities for local communities and businesses. Improving the portfolio of employment land and premises.
Improving the Portfolio of Employment Land and Premises
9.13
  Providing a supply of land for business and industry is essential for
 
achieving our vision of a flourishing economy. Our portfolio of economic 
land needs to provide a range and quantity of sites flexible enough to accommodate changing economic circumstances and respond to market demands, while supporting emerging sectors and entrepreneurship within sustainable locations.
62Economic ProsperityPolicy CS6 Employment Land 
Employment land will be managed to meet our needs. This will be achieved by:
 1.  Ensuring a sufficient supply, range and choice of employment land is maintained f
or class B1, B2 and B8 uses. A minimum of 150 hectares 
of net developable employment land will be identified and allocated to meet the gross employment land requirements (including office floorspace).
 2.  Providing a minimum of 512,000 square metres (gross internal ar
ea) of 
office floor space including: 
  i.  The Urban Core as the focus for the majority of office de
velopment, 
  ii.   A limited amount of office development at Team Valle
y, Newcastle 
International Airport and Metrogreen, and
 3.   Requiring proposals over 200 square metres (net internal area) f
or office 
development in locations outside 2i and 2ii to undertake an impact and sequential assessment.
9.14
  Gateshead and Newcastle will plan for sufficient employment land to meet the future needs of the ec
onomy and accommodate potential 
jobs growth in key economic sectors. The ELRs29 for both Gateshead 
and Newcastle identified the amount of office floorspace and industrial and warehousing land required over the plan period, to cater for the projected jobs growth. For employment uses, the studies identified the need to ensure provision to 2030 of a minimum of 150 hectares of developable land (70 hectares in Gateshead and 80 hectares in Newcastle) based on forecasted growth to meet the gross employment land requirements.  
9.15
  The ELRs29 identified a number of Employment Areas which should 
be retained and protected for employment use. These, in addition to the Key Employment Areas identified in Policies CS3 and CS4, are appropriate locations to develop and provide suitable accommodation for existing and new businesses. The Key Employment Areas, along with the Urban Core, are the focus of Gateshead and Newcastle’s industrial, distribution and office activities. 
9.16
  New office space requirements wer
e assessed within the Office Needs 
Study33. This identified the need for a minimum of 512,000 square 
metres of office space to 2030. It is anticipated that 20% of the new office supply will be accommodated within Gateshead and 80% will be accommodated within Newcastle. Overall, Gateshead and Newcastle have an extensive supply of potential office sites which exceeds the projected demand for the plan period. However, this will ensure a choice of sites to meet a range of business needs/office segments and provide the flexibility for the plan to respond to changing economic circumstances.
9.17  The Urban Core is the priority location for new office floorspac e and  
 will accommodate around 75% of Gateshead and Newcastle’s o
ffice  
 growth and support the continued evolution of this re
gionally significant  
 office location. It provides a strategic and sustainable location of high-  
 density employment, supporting vitality and the growth of ancillary  
 services and facilities. By acting as an economic driver for the wider  
 region and adding to the vibrancy of the Urban Core, these activities  
 provide a desirable place for other businesses to locate, particularly  
 knowledge-based sectors.
63Economic Prosperity            Section 39.18   The Urban Core can cater for a range of business needs and o ffice market 
segments from Grade A city centre space, to SME accommodation as 
well as some business park provision suitable for a large single use and inward investment. The Urban Core policies in Chapter 14 provide further detail on priority locations for office development. 
9.19
  Around 25% of office sites outside of the Urban Core will be tak
en 
forward in defined centres and at Metrogreen, Team Valley and Newcastle International Airport. These sites will accommodate business needs and office specifications that cannot be accommodated within the Urban Core, ensuring economic growth is not compromised by limited site availability. Outside these locations, proposals for office development of 200 square metres (NIA), or more must be accompanied by a sequential and impact assessment. This will need to demonstrate that investment is not being diverted from the Urban Core, the operational reasons for locating outside, specifying why it is not a suitable location and that the type of accommodation being proposed is appropriate to that location.
9.20
  The Plan provides the necessary strategic and spatial policy direction f
or 
the future location of employment development, the implementation of which will be gauged through annual monitoring. More detailed policies and criteria, and specific allocations for employment and mixed-use development are set out in detailed Urban Core policies and will also be included in subsequent LDD’s. Proposals for non-employment uses which arise within the allocated Employment Areas will be considered against these relevant policies, together with the ELRs
29.
Retail and Centres
9.21   Centres in Gateshead and Newcastle perform an important role in the 
day to day liv
es of its residents and the local economy. They provide 
shopping and services, are places of employment and leisure, are a focus for community activity and provide character and identity to local areas. Policy CS7 supports a network of accessible centres, to act as the key focus for retail and leisure investment and seeks to promote their vitality and viability.
64Economic Prosperity
Policy CS7 Retail and Centres 
The vitality and viability of centres in the retail hierarchy will be maintained and enhanced. These centres will form the focal point for uses, services and facilities serving the surrounding population. In addition to meeting local needs, the role of the retail sector in attracting visitors and contributing to the economy will be supported. This will be achieved by:
 1.  Protecting the vitality and viability of centres by encouraging a
 
balance of retail and supporting uses which are appropriate in scale to the relative position of each centre in the retail hierarchy. The retail hierarchy is designated as:
  i.  Newcastle Retail Centre - is the regional r

Figure 9.1b Gateshead Hierarchy of Retail Centres 
© Crown Copyright and database right [2015]. Ordnance Survey [100019569].
© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].9.22   Gateshead and Newcastle benefits from a diverse network o f City, 
Town, District and Local Centres with different characters and roles, 
which change over time. Many of these centres are performing strongly, however, certain centres are vulnerable, and need support to sustain them into the future.
9.23
  The retail hierarchy has been defined, with centres being distributed acr
oss Gateshead and Newcastle. This recognises the roles that different 
centres play. In accordance with Policy CS1, the centres are identified as the most accessible locations in Gateshead and Newcastle, and therefore are well placed to be the focus for a range of developments. Policy CS8 complements Policy CS7 in that it encourages leisure, culture and tourist attractions to be focused within our centres proportionate to their scale. The boundaries of Gateshead and Newcastle’s Primary Shopping Areas in the Urban Core including the approach to primary frontage, are set out in Policies UC2, NC1 and GC1. The approach to other centres in the hierarchy, including those where there is a priority for improvement, will be set out in subsequent LDD’s.
9.24
  In accordance with Policy CS2, major retail inv
estment will be focused 
within our Urban Core to strengthen the role of Newcastle as the regional retail centre, and to underpin Gateshead’s regeneration objectives.
9.25
  Newcastle is the regional destination for major retail and related uses
 
including leisure, and there is significant potential for growth in these sectors. Newcastle’s Retail Centre is the priority for strategic retail and is defined as the Primary Shopping Area and the northern area of the East Pilgrim Street Key Site (Policy NC2) which once developed, will form part of an extended Primary Shopping Area. Newcastle has consistently been identified as the most sustainable location for retail growth and is the sequentially preferable area for major retail development.
9.26
  The challenge for Gateshead Centre is to create a succes
sful 
and sustainable centre which has a distinctive retail offer, which complements Newcastle Retail Centre and the Metrocentre. The centre is highly accessible and is the main administrative and service centre in Gateshead. However, it is less well positioned in retail terms, predominantly providing for local shopping needs, but with a low proportion of national multiples and a higher than average level of vacancy. There is capacity and a need for improvement within the Primary Shopping Area during the plan period. This includes the redeveloped Trinity Square, which provides a focus for retail provision, including new retail units and a new food store. There is capacity for additional development to come forward elsewhere in the Primary Shopping Area by 2030.
68Economic Prosperity9.27   The success of our centres is strongly influenc ed by the variety and 
choice of shops, services and other uses within them. In addition to 
Class A1 retail uses, a range of non-retail services within Classes A2, A3, A4 and A5 (e.g. banks, estate agents, bars, cafes and restaurants) will be considered provided these other uses would not harm the centres overall vitality and viability. These centres also provide the natural focus for community and leisure uses, including libraries, community centres, meeting places, crèches and nurseries, medical and health centres and leisure centres. The way these centres function and their vitality and viability will be managed by ensuring an appropriate mix of uses are retained, and by ensuring that new development does not harm these centres.
9.28
  District Centres each perform a role and function which reflects the particular needs and char
acter of their local community. The main role 
of District Centres is to allow access to a wide range of retail and related services, while Local Centres contain a smaller range of shops and services which support the daily needs of a smaller catchment area.
9.29
  The need to identify and plan for further retail provision within the retail hierar
chy is fundamental in delivering the Plan’s priorities for 
sustainable growth. In addition to the proposed designation of new centres at Great Park and Dinnington, and the proposed elevation to District Centre status of West Road, the capacity and need for further retail investment in some centres has been identified. By 2015 there will be a need for additional convenience goods floorspace in Gateshead in the form of a new supermarket in Birtley and another in Felling to provide new ‘anchor’ stores for these two centres.
9.30
  Figure 9.2 identifies those District and Local Centres where there is a need for impr
ovement in the shopping provision and the shopping 
centre environment.

Figure 9.2: District and Local Centres Requiring Improvement9.31   While the overall approach is to focus as many services as possible  
within a centre, there are circumstances whereby some communities are 
reliant on isolated facilities which are important in meeting their day- to-day needs. These include small parades (including facilities which no longer meet the definition of a centre), corner shops and community facilities. Community facilities can include community centres, childcare facilities, cultural venues, village halls, religious meeting places, learning and training establishments, health and social care facilities, recreation, civic and administrative facilities. It may also include uses whose primary function is commercial but perform a social or community role, such as a café. The importance of retaining such facilities where these meet the day-to-day needs of the community is recognised in national policy. In the case where a change of use is proposed which would result in the loss of the only remaining facility in an area, a justification will be required including evidence of marketing for a similar use. This approach will be set out in more detail in subsequent LDD’s.
9.32
  The vitality and viability of our centres is important and, in line with the NPPF, retail proposals outside e
xisting centres in the retail hierarchy 
(see Policy CS7) will be required to submit sequential and impact assessments. For other main town centre uses, proposals outside the Urban Core, District and Local centres will also be required to submit sequential and impact assessments in line with the NPPF. Consideration of impacts for proposals which are below the NPPF threshold of 2,500 square metres may be required,  as set out in the Validation of Planning Applications in Tyne and Wear checklist. This will be necessary where development could undermine the vitality and viability of a centre, or existing, committed and planned public and private investment in a centre or centres. The level of detail that applicants will be required to submit will be expected to be proportionate to the scale of the proposal concerned, and will be assessed in accordance with the impact criteria in the Planning Practice Guidance. In future, local thresholds for impact assessments will be established in LDD’s to reflect the scale and nature of centres in Gateshead and Newcastle respectively.
9.33
  The Metrocentre complex in Gateshead also contributes to the str
ategic comparison and leisure provision within the region, attracting 
approximately 23 million visitors34 annually. As it is not allocated 
a place within the retail hierarchy, any proposals will be subject to an assessment in accordance with national policy. However, the contribution that development proposals could make to the economy and regeneration of the area will be given full consideration, alongside impact and sequential site assessments, when determining planning applications. In general terms there is a need to improve the external environment of the Metrocentre, including on-site pedestrian routes.
9.34
  Retail provision elsewhere is focused on out-o
f-centre retail parks, 
including, for example, Retail World at Team Valley and Newcastle Shopping Park at Byker. Although such facilities perform a significant role in terms of comparison shopping, in retail policy terms they  are not identified as centres and are therefore excluded from the retail hierarchy. Therefore, as with the Metrocentre, any proposals for additional provision will need to be assessed in accordance with national planning policy.
71Economic Prosperity            Section 3Leisure, Culture and Tourism 
9.35   Gateshead and Newcastle are recognised as leisure
, culture and tourist 
destinations boasting a variety of visitor attractions and a year-round 
events programme. The Newcastle Gateshead Initiative (NGI) is our joint leisure, culture and tourism marketing company, which has raised the national and international profile of Gateshead and Newcastle and the wider North East.
9.36
  For the purposes of Policy CS8, leisure, culture and tourism uses are
 
taken to include use classes C1 (e.g. hotels and guest houses), D1 (e.g. museums and art galleries), D2 (e.g. cinemas, music and concert halls, and gyms) and other Sui Generis uses including theatres and nightclubs. 
9.37
  Our leisure, culture and tourism attractions are spread acros
s our 3 
spatial character areas.
  •  People visit the Urban Core for shopping, for football at St James’
 
Park, for our city library, museums and galleries - including the recently refurbished Great North Museum, the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, the Centre for Life, and Seven Stories the national centre for children’s books; for live music at the Sage Gateshead, Metro Radio Arena, O2 Academy and smaller venues such as the Cluny and Central Hotel; for the theatre - the Theatre Royal, Northern Stage, Journal Tyne Theatre, City Hall and Live Theatre; for films at the Gate and Tyneside Cinema.
  •  People visit our Neighbourhood Area for shopping; for eating and commercial leisur
e at the MetroCentre (including an IMAX cinema), 
in our retail parks and District Centres, for sport at Gateshead International Stadium, Kingston Park for rugby, and to golf at our many courses, and, to eat and drink particularly at Osborne Road, Jesmond and Low Fell.
  •  People visit our Rural and Village Area for individual attractions - including the Ang
el of the North, the Tanfield Railway and Gibside 
National Trust Estate, for sport at Newcastle Racecourse/High Gosforth Park, at Newburn for rowing and for cycling and golf at our many facilities.
9.38
 As well as enjoying our specific attractions visitors come to Gateshead  
 and Newcastle for business, our built heritage and for our ev
ening offer.  
 Business tourism is vital to the economy. Events such as conferenc
e  
 meetings and exhibitions bring tourists to Gateshead and Newcastle all  
 year round, generating £421 million for business ev
ents tourism in the  
 North East region. In addition to this we are growing as a short break  
 destination, supported by an expansion in hotel provision. Other   
 significant events include The Great North Run an iconic feature of   
 Gateshead and Newcastle’s cultural and sporting programme attr
acting  
 tens of thousands of runners each year.
9.39  Leisure, culture and tourism are important to Gateshead and Newcastle’s  
 economy and Policy CS8 aims to support our existing facilities and sets  
 out our approach for future development. Howe
ver, it should be read  
 alongside other policies that address provision for more informal   
 outdoor recreation and sports activities, including country parks, river-  
 based sport and cycle routes for example. These include Policy CS18  
 Green Infrastructure and the Natural Environment and Policy CS13  
 Transport and Accessibility.
72Economic Prosperity9.40   If Gateshead and Newcastle are to remain competitive as a 
tourist destination, the
y need to continue to develop a range of 
accommodation, unique visitor attractions and experiences. The Councils recognise the importance of the culture, leisure and tourism economy and will continue to work with partners to support its growth. This includes our major sporting facilities which attract significant numbers of visitors to Gateshead and Newcastle, contributing to our economic prosperity.
Policy CS8 Leisure, Culture and TourismDevelopment which improves the range and quality of leisure, culture, and tourism facilities, including major sports venues and events, will be encouraged by:
 1.  Focusing leisure, cultural and tourist attractions in the Urban Core and at
 
accessible locations.
 2.  Supporting visitor attractions and accommodation in the Rural and Village Area which ar
e in accessible locations and do not undermine the 
character of the area.
9.41   Major new commercial facilities, including those connected with business tourism, will be dir
ected to the Urban Core to strengthen its 
role and offer. It is important that our existing facilities including heritage assets such as Grainger Town are protected and enhanced. Provision elsewhere will be encouraged in accessible locations, including our District and Local Centres. These centres provide a good range of leisure and cultural facilities in sustainable locations which should continue to be supported and grow, providing that proposed facilities are of a suitable scale for the function of the centre in the retail hierarchy (CS7). This approach will ensure that a balance is provided between having local facilities to meet community needs, and directing major schemes to the most accessible locations. Outside the defined retail hierarchy, leisure provision at the Metrocentre also performs an important role.
9.42
  There is a need to broaden the existing evening economy, incr
easing 
the range of facilities so that it is more socially inclusive, making our communities feel safe and welcoming. New facilities, as part of mixed- use schemes will help to attract visitors throughout the day and, where appropriate, support the evening economy.
9.43
 There is potential to attract additional facilities and accommodation in  
 the Rural and Village Area. This can help to facilitate rural diversification,  
 sustain 
centres, and provide additional employment opportunities which  
 contribute to the rural economy. Prefer
ence will be given to proposals  
 which are appropriately located so as not to undermine the   
 attractiveness of the area and which are acc
essible by sustainable   
 modes of transport. The Derwent Valley in particular is identified as  
 offering potential for additional accommodation and facilities, linked  
 to existing attractions and wider infrastructure networks, including the  
 national cycle routes which cross the area.
73Economic Prosperity            Section 310.1   At the heart of the spatial strategy is the promotion of sustainable 
neighbourhoods, supporting Gateshead and New
castle’s diverse 
population. Everyone should have the opportunity to live in a high quality, well designed home in sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities. To deliver a wide choice of homes, increase opportunities for home ownership, support job growth, minimise commuting and promote sustainable inclusive neighbourhoods, the Plan needs to provide sufficient homes. Policy CS1 sets out the need to provide 30,000 new homes by 2030.
10.2
  While it is important to provide more homes within Gateshead and Newcastle, ther
e is a need to consider housing quality and choice in 
terms of new and existing communities. This chapter sets out policies which seek to ensure that everyone has opportunity to access a decent home in a quality environment and which by:
  •  Contribute to making existing communities safe and sustainable places to live (CS9).
  • Deliver new housing in Gateshead and Newcastle across the plan  
   period (CS10).
  •  Provide an appropriate mix, type and tenure of housing in a range
 
of locations and meet the needs of specific groups (CS11).
  •  Meet the needs of gypsies, travellers and trav
elling showpeople 
(CS12).
Existing Communities 
10.3   In Gateshead and Newcastle there are a mix of neighbourhoods 
performing diff
erent roles and functions within the housing market. 
Many of these areas are successful and offer a good range of housing options, but some areas experience problems relating to poor quality housing and living environments. Our existing communities need to be sustained and improved to provide quality areas to live and work.
10.4
  We already have some attractive areas o
f choice benefitting from good 
schools, good transport connections, quality green spaces, facilities and services and a range of housing types. However, this does not mean they cannot be improved. In other areas it is recognised that a holistic approach to regeneration is sometimes required which tackles any physical, social and/or environmental concerns to ensure their long term sustainability. The focus for investment will be on those areas which are characterised by an over dominance of particular housing types and a lack of tenure choice where residents have poor access to essential services and facilities. Within these areas there are many strengths including a strong sense of community and existing infrastructure. New development must complement strengths, retain existing residents and attract new ones.
7410. HomesHomes10.5   This policy seeks to ensure that existing communities are sustainable for 
the future
.
Policy CS9 Existing CommunitiesExisting communities will be sustainable places of quality and choice. This will be achieved by: 
 1.  Maintaining a range of housing types and sizes throughout the plan area,
 2.  Maintaining and improving facilities, services and the local environment,
 3.  Bringing empty properties back into use, demolition of housing which is no longer viable or in demand, supporting progr
ammes of improvement 
and renewal and the replacement of housing,
 4.  Preventing the loss of family homes, through sub-division, chang
e of use 
or redevelopment, and
 5. Preventing an over concentr
ation of shared accommodation.
10.6   For communities to be attractive and sustainable, they must off
er a 
variety of good quality homes in terms of types, sizes and tenures. They should also cater for a mix of different households, such as families with children, single person households, disabled and older people. A good quality environment, including adequate green infrastructure and access to facilities and services, is vital for sustainable communities. It is important to invest in existing homes and neighbourhoods to ensure they remain desirable areas. The Council will work with partners to ensure the environment of existing neighbourhoods is improved by addressing problems of poor housing, education, employment, transport, and public services. 
10.7
 In Gateshead and Newcastle approximately 4% of homes are empty. Our  
 target is to reduce this to 3%. This is largely conc
entrated in the   
 private sector stock and although housing vacancy rates have   
 improved (notably in the social sector) this still remains an issue,   
 particularly in our Opportunity Areas (Policy CS3). Gateshead and   
 Newcastle are committed to working with partners including private  
 landlords to bring empty properties back into use and ensure that they  
 do not have a detrimental effect on otherwise sustainable, safe   
 and pleasant communities. This will be achieved via a mixed approach  
 of enforcement, engagement and encouraging ne
w development and  
 investment in homes for which there is demand, while replacing   
 obsolete or poor quality housing.
10.8    Demolishing unpopular existing stock, replacing it with new homes to better address housing needs and aspirations, as identified in the
 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)35, will further enhance and 
sustain communities. The demolition and replacement of low-demand poor quality housing will be supported as part of the wider regeneration programmes across Gateshead and Newcastle. The number of losses through demolition and change of use is expected to be approximately 4,500 losses during the plan period.
75Homes            Section 310.9   Both councils are working in partnership with key delivery ag encies 
including the Gateshead Housing Company, Your Homes Newcastle, 
registered housing providers and private landlords to improve homes across all tenures. Selective landlord licensing will be used where appropriate to manage and secure improvements to the private rented sector in areas with low demand and related social problems.
10.10
  The Plan aims to retain and attract families to support economic growth. T
o achieve this, we need to ensure we prevent the loss of existing family 
homes which are attractive and popular. Therefore we will seek to resist conversions, sub-divisions, demolition and change of use proposals, where they would result in the loss of a family home.
10.11
  Shared accommodation (including houses in multiple occupation) forms a very significant and valuable part o
f the private rented sector. 
It provides market housing to meet the needs of a variety of people whom, for one reason or another, either do not wish to or are unable to live in mainstream housing, in either the owner occupied or the social rented sector. However, high concentrations of shared accommodation can create problems in terms of environmental quality and residential amenity. Where this is the case Permitted Development Rights will be removed and policy introduced to assess proposals for further shared accommodation. Both councils are working closely with specialist providers and partners including the universities to meet demand for purpose built accommodation and ensure there is a choice of accommodation for all our residents.
Housing Delivery
10.12
  On the basis of the projected population increase and changes in 
household size in Gateshead and New
castle, there is a need to plan 
for approximately 30,000 new homes excluding purpose built student accommodation. It is expected that at least 2,000 units of purposed built student accommodation will also be built in the short term.
10.13
  The Spatial Strategy (Policies CS1, 2, 3 and 4) set out how we will acc
ommodate growth. Our strategy is to prioritise where possible new 
homes on brownfield land to support ongoing regeneration programmes and make efficient use of land and infrastructure. Locations for housing growth are illustrated in Figure 10.1. These sites along with smaller sites identified in our (SHLAAs)
28 are expected to deliver an average of 1,500 
new homes per annum.

Provision of approximately 30,000 new homes (excluding purpose built student accommodation) will be built over the period April 2010 to March 2030 (on average 1,500 per annum); this equates to approximately 25,550 net additions to the housing stock. The broad distribution of new homes will be:
10.14
 Due to the present state of the economy, the limited availability of  
 housing finance, the necessity for demolition and a lack of deliver
able  
 housing sites until the Plan is adopted, it will take some time for   
 development to reach the level required to ac
commodate needs. A five  
 year land supply cannot be achieved without the development of   
 Neighbourhood and Village Growth Areas. The allocation takes account  
 of  the requirement of the NPPF paragraph 47 to pro
vide for an   
 additional buffer of 20%  if there is a record of per
sistent    
 underperformance. Policy CS10 and Figure 10.2 reflect a r
ealistic build  
 profile, with the net build rate increasing from an av
erage of 550 in  
 2013/14 to an average of 1,500 per annum by 2015 and being   
 maintained at around this level over the remainder of the plan period.T

Figure 10.2 Delivering New HomesProviding a Range and Choice of Housing
10.15   The Councils have assessed the housing need and demand for 
Gateshead and Ne
wcastle. Our evidence base highlights that a better 
range and choice of quality housing is needed to improve the housing offer. It is essential to plan to meet the needs of all parts of the community and to enable economic growth - the right homes in the right locations with the right facilities and services are important for attracting and retaining businesses. These needs include affordability for first time buyers or those who wish to move, for families and for our growing ageing population. We need to consider the design and layout of all new homes and the future needs of those groups who need specialist housing such as extra care homes. This Plan seeks to ensure that the right type of housing continues to be built and there is a variety of good quality homes in terms of type, size and tenure to cater for a mix of different households including families with children, single person households, older people and those with specific needs.
Policy CS11 Providing a Range and Choice of Housing Promoting lifetime neighbourhoods with a good range and choice of accommodation, services and facilities to meet varied and changing needs, will be achieved by:
 1.  Requiring 60% of new private housing across the plan area being suitable f
or and attractive to families, with a minimum target of 16,000 
new homes to have three or more bedrooms. 
 2.  Encouraging provision of Lifetime Homes and Wheelchair-Ac
cessible 
Homes.
 3.  Increasing the choice of suitable accommodation for the elderly population and those with special needs including bungalo
ws, sheltered 
accommodation and extra care accommodation.
 4.  Providing adequate space inside and outside of the home to meet the needs of residents.
 5.  Providing 15% affordable homes on all developments of 15 or mor
e 
dwellings subject to development viability.
 6.  Focusing the provision of purpose built student accommodation within the Urban C
ore.
10.16  In order to rebalance the housing stock and retain and attract families in  
 Gateshead and Newcastle, the Plan is requiring that 60% of new   
 private homes are family homes (3-4 bedrooms). While there is   
 projected to be a major increase in smaller households, for a variety  
 of reasons, many of these households choose to occupy larger
, more  
 flexible properties. The supply in Gateshead and Newcastle is howev
er  
 limited by an historic housing stock which is distorted towards smaller  
 property types and a low level of turnover o
f larger homes. Building new  
 homes of the general mix outlined in Figure 10.3, will contribute to  
 increasing the overall supply of larger homes and r
ebalance the housing  
 stock.
79Homes            Section 310.17   The SHMA35 identified that our current housing stock lacks larger family 
dwellings (particularly detached houses) and that more would need to 
be provided to support in-migration and reduce out-migration of family households. An issue of under-occupation of existing family housing stock (in the private and social sectors) was also identified with one trend being the tendency of elderly residents to remain in the family home after their children have left home. As recommended by the SHMA, the provision of more smaller properties for single people, couples and specialist accommodation for the elderly to offer real choice for those who would like to “downsize”. This, combined with the majority of new private homes (60%) being of 3 or more bedrooms, will help to meet the identified need for family homes across Gateshead and Newcastle. The delivery of new social sector housing should also be closely linked to the needs of older tenants and smaller households. Indeed making the best use of the housing stock is a key government objective.
10.18
  The SHMA35 identifies a significant level of under-occupation in the 
social rented sector which contains over 9,000 three and four bedroom properties in Gateshead and Newcastle. It also identifies significant levels of under-occupation in the owner occupied and private rented stock. Many households remain in their properties even after their household size has reduced. The provision of good quality smaller accommodation in the social and market sector, particularly for the older population, will release existing larger homes and also help to reduce the affordable housing shortfall. We will work with partners and others on initiatives to help ‘free up’ the under-occupied stock.

10.19    Lifetime neighbourhoods provide all residents with the best possible chanc 
e of health, wellbeing and social inclusion regardless of age. 
They are sustainable communities that offer a good quality of life to all generations. 
10.20
   The creation of lifetime neighbourhoods (whether through retro- fitting in e
xisting neighbourhoods or the development of new 
neighbourhoods) supports community cohesion by encouraging a diverse mix of accommodation helping residents to remain within their communities as their circumstances change. Wherever practicable, new housing will be encouraged to adopt principles of lifetime homes so as to be easily adaptable for everyone from young families to older people and people with disabilities. This will reduce the need for adaptations or for people to move home as their circumstances change.
80Homes10.21   Concerns have been raised that some new homes, and indeed some 
existing homes, do not have enough space for the modern family
. For 
new development we are looking to ensure that the homes that are built are attractive to a wide range of residents by providing the right amount of both indoor and outdoor space, including storage, for their targeted market.
10.22
  The Gateshead and Newcastle SHMA35 identifies a need for 
approximately 242 affordable housing units per year until 2018 (when a reassessment will be required) over and above the units that become available through stock turnover. Of these, it recommended that 65% should be for subsidised rent and 35% for subsidised home ownership.  In view of the scale of need, provision of affordable units will be sought from all suitable developments of 15 or more homes but, not necessarily on-site. Each site will need to be assessed individually, with affordable housing provision being subject to wider planning economic viability, regeneration and sustainability considerations. This will require a flexible approach to specific site negotiation and looking at innovative ways to accelerate delivery. The total need for affordable housing is not expected to be met solely by new delivery through the planning system. A range of initiatives to make best use of the existing private rented and social stock will be pursued - tackling under-occupation by bringing vacant properties back into use, bringing social sector stock up to a modern standard and through the conversions of existing buildings. Further detail on a site by site basis will be provided in subsequent LDD’s.
81Homes            Section 3
10.23   Gateshead and Newcastle are home to four major further education 
establishments. The two univer
sities alone currently have around 40,000 
full-time students, an increase of 15,000 since 2000/0136. By comparison, 
only around 2,650 bedrooms in purpose-built student accommodation were built over the period 2001-09 and so this has resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of students occupying homes in the private rented sector in areas such as Jesmond and Sandyford. Since 2007, in response to strong demand for student accommodation there has been a significant increase in the provision of new purpose-built student accommodation, and approximately 3,100 new bedrooms were delivered by 2013.
10.24
  The universities envisage continued growth in student number
s (albeit 
at a slower rate) over the plan period but it is difficult to predict what the level of growth is likely to be or how this may translate into demand for student accommodation. However, there is a sizeable, flexible supply of land available within the Urban Core to accommodate different scenarios of future demand for purpose-built student housing. It is expected that a further 2,000 bedrooms will be constructed in the short term.
10.25
  For the purposes of establishing the housing requirement in the Plan and the availability of housing land thr
ough the SHLAAs28 purpose-built 
student housing is specifically excluded from the demand and supply equation. This approach recognises that student housing is a niche market, with future growth rates uncertain, and accommodation can take many forms. This accommodation ranges from self-contained studio apartments and small to larger cluster flats and new halls of residence. The latter two do not constitute mainstream housing (which is defined as falling within Use Classes C3 and C4). Inclusion of student housing would alter housing outputs and land supply and detract from the key focus of intervention to facilitate increased delivery of conventional houses in order to stem net out-migration and in-commuting to surrounding districts. Demand for and supply of purpose-built student housing will be regularly reviewed in order to ascertain whether there is a need to consider policy intervention. 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople
10.26
  Both Councils have a responsibility to assess and meet the needs of gypsies,
 
travellers and travelling showpeople.  Government policy emphasises the 
importance of assessing the accommodation needs of gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople whilst taking a strategic approach to meeting needs that are identified. The updated Gateshead/Newcastle Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Study estimates that between 2013 and 2018 there would be no need for provision in Newcastle and no need for additional pitches in Gateshead.  Therefore, the existing site provided by Gateshead Council at Baltic Road has a capacity that meets the identified needs for the plan area.
10.27
  The following policy has been assessed against the Government’s Planning P
olicy for Travellers Sites38 published in March 2012. It supports 
applications for new gypsy, traveller and travelling showpeople sites where they meet all the policy criteria. Improved provision in locations well related to existing settlements can benefit social inclusion, sustainable patterns of living and the delivery of relevant service, such as education and health care.
82HomesPolicy CS12 Provision for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
The existing site for travelling groups will be retained. Where additional need is identified sites should be:
 1.  Well related and close to existing communities to encourage social
 
inclusion and sustainable patterns of living and:
   i.  Avoid sites being over-concentrated in any one location or
 
disproportionate in size to nearby communities,
   ii.  Be accessible to local services such as schools, health and community services,
 
   iii.  Avoid harmful impacts on nearby properties by noise and light, vehicle mo
vements and other activities, and
  iv. Avoid areas at high risk of flooding. 
 2.  Safe, secure and be able to maintain visual amenity for occupiers. Additional landscaping may be nec
essary to maintain visual amenity and 
provide privacy for occupiers. 
 3.  Capable of accommodating the proposed uses to acceptable standar
ds 
and provide facilities appropriate to the type and size of the site. Sites should include:
  i. Water supply, foul water drainage and recycling/waste manag
ement,
  ii. Provision of play space for children, 
   iii.  Safe vehicular access from the public highway and adequate pr
ovision 
for parking, turning and safe manoeuvring of vehicles within the site (taking account of site size and impact), and
  iv. Areas of storage for show equipment for tr
avelling showpeople.
 4.  Free from ground contamination.
83Homes            Section 311.1   Transport and accessibility are fundamental to the delivery of the Plan’s 
spatial strategy. It is important that new development is located in the
 
most sustainable locations and accessible by a choice of travel modes, including walking, cycling and public transport. This will help reduce the need for people to travel, minimise congestion, improve road safety and meet climate change reduction targets. This also links with the need to improve people’s health by creating more opportunities for people to walk or cycle rather than use the car.
11.2
 Accessibility is the key relationship between tr
ansport and different land  
 uses such as housing, employment and services. It defines how easily  
 people can move between where they live and the places the
y need to  
 get to in their daily lives.  
11.3   Gateshead and Newcastle currently benefit from high levels o
f 
accessibility by all transport modes and in particular public transport. Traffic congestion is limited to a small number of key locations including the A1 and some of the main approaches to the Urban Core. It is important that development which generates growth is managed to ensure accessibility remains high and congestion low.
11.4
  Newcastle is one of the UK’s most sustainable cities and has accolades to this eff
ect., This is due in part to its excellent sustainable transport 
infrastructure and policies to encourage active travel.
11.5    This chapter deals with transport in and through Gateshead and Newcastle. 
11.6
 The Plan’s transport policies have been developed to:
  • make Gateshead and Newcastle accessible to all,
  •  achieve a shift to more sustainable modes of travel including
 
promoting alternative travel choices particularly along congested travel corridors,
  • reduce carbon emissions from transport,
  •  enhance and protect the transport network to facilitate economic gr
owth, 
  •  improve the efficiency of our transport networks to manag
e 
demand, address capacity issues and get more from our existing infrastructure, and
  •  set out expectations in terms of development and how it will plan for the tr
ansport needs generated.
11.7   To improve the future for Gateshead and New
castle local transport 
networks and wider strategic connections to the rest of the North East and beyond must remain fit for purpose and be improved where possible. The needs of all our communities in Gateshead and Newcastle need to be catered for and people must not be excluded from appropriate travel choices.
8411. Transport and AccessibilityTransport and Accessibility 11.8   By working closely with partners Gateshead and Newcastle have a 
g
ood track record of justifying investment and securing funding to 
deliver large-scale transport infrastructure. However, the focus is also on managing existing infrastructure better. Improving and promoting accessibility by sustainable modes of transport is a means of achieving this and will also help to address climate change and reduce social exclusion, as well as helping to create a desirable place to live, work and visit.
11.9
  Frequent use of sustainable modes of transport enhances the quality o
f life for residents. It can enable residents to access work and key 
services, contribute to addressing health and obesity issues, and reduce the negative impacts of local traffic. A sustainable, balanced transport system which promotes walking and cycling, while still acknowledging the need to cater for the private car, will help to reduce levels of traffic, congestion and pollution.
11.10
 The continued development of sustainable transport networks will  
 support the planned additional housing and will promote economic  
 growth. It is likely that higher population density will lead to increased  
 public transport capacity, as new demand is created for these services.  
 This will particularly be the case if development is focused around  
 locations with high levels of public transport accessibility
.
85Transport and Accessibility            Section 3

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].11.11    Figure 11 illustrates the transport improvements in the Plan that are  
supported by the Local Transport Plan for Tyne and Wear 2011-202139 
and the emerging work of the North East Combined Authority. 
11.12   The aim of the Plan is to create sustainable communities, centres and 
new de
velopments where priority is given to sustainable modes of 
transport. The hierarchy of sustainable modes of transport is:
  • Walking
  • Cycling
  •  Public Transport (including taxis)
  • Freight
  • Car Traffic
11.13   There is a fundamental relationship between the location of development and ho
w people choose to move around. It is a key part of 
the Plan’s transport strategy that the developments which generate the most trips should be located at the most accessible locations possible in terms of walking, cycling and public transport, and where they are not, that they provide improvements to the transport network to mitigate the impact of the trips generated.
 
11.14   Walking is a component of most journeys, and is an important form of tr
ansport in its own right. Routes that are well designed and safe 
encourage walking. This is central to other themes to enhance and create places that are people-friendly. Places that encourage public participation in leisure and recreation are those that are attractive and have strong economies. Walking and cycling contribute to improved health outcomes, through increasing personal exercise, improving wellbeing and happiness through interaction with the physical environment and other people. As walking and cycling become more prevalent carbon emissions will reduce.
 
11.15   The Councils will work with partners to create a strategic cycle netw
ork 
across the plan area that provides sustainable access to jobs and services. This network will be formed from a mixture of on-road lanes (sometimes mixed with other modes), shared-use paths, off-road routes and recommended routes through traffic-free areas. We will seek to further enhance a major north-south route across Gateshead and Newcastle and into Durham and Northumberland (the Great North Cycleway). This route will link all the major national and regional cycle routes in the area to the heart of Tyneside. We will also provide better links from our local network to the National Cycle Network and provide a new cross-river cycle and pedestrian link between Newburn and Blaydon. More cycle parking will be provided at key destinations. 
 
11.16   The Councils have a statutory duty to manage the rights of way network and to publish a Rights o
f Way Improvement Plan39 (part of the Local 
Transport Plan). As well as fulfilling this duty, we will seek to ensure that development accommodates the network, or if this is not possible, to provide suitable replacement links.
88Transport and Accessibility 11.17   Excessive vehicle speeds are a deterrent to walking and cycling. Both 
Gateshead and Newcastle will continue to promote road safety and to
 
introduce 20 mile per hour limits in residential streets and local centres. In addition, new developments will be encourage to be designed to homezone principles. Limiting vehicle speeds will be a key element of promoting sustainable travel choices.
11.18
  Gateshead and Newcastle already has an extensive public transport netw
ork (Metro, bus, rail and taxi) that provides high levels of 
accessibility to services and opportunities across most of the area. However, there are some locations, notably towards the east and west (for example Walker, Crawcrook, Chopwell, Throckley, Newburn, Lemington) where accessibility is more limited. Working with partners the Councils will seek to address these inequalities, improve reliability, reduce journey times and enhance the journey quality for all passengers. 
 
11.19   Buses play a significant role in improving accessibility and reducing the
 
impact of car traffic. However, for bus services to be efficient, they need to be assigned greater priority so they are a viable alternative to car use. They also need to be better promoted and marketed so that more people are encouraged to use them. Both Gateshead and Newcastle have a good record of providing bus priority measures, and will further build on this by developing and implementing a programme of bus corridor improvements over the plan period. This will include:
  •  A692 Corridor
  •  Durham Road 
  •  Felling Bypass 
  •  Great North Road, Gosforth High Street
  •  West Road 
11.20   We will also explore the ‘red route’ approach which includes parking
 
restrictions and enforcement on our main bus corridors to improve bus efficiency. The Bus Strategy Delivery Project  is being undertaken to examine delivery of key transport objectives which include maintaining and improving bus use, increasing network accessibility and delivering better value for money.
11.21
  The emergence of new vehicles using alternative fuels will be a major
 
feature of transport over the plan period and will contribute to tackling climate change. Gateshead and Newcastle are at the forefront of delivering investment in sustainable new technologies. Investment has been made in electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure across  Gateshead and Newcastle. Local bus operators are currently investing in hybrid buses. The Councils will continue to support growth in this sector.
11.22
  Given economic constraints, it is not feasible to pro
vide bus services 
for all destinations, or at all times. Therefore, the Councils will work closely with taxi (hackney carriage and private hire vehicle) operators, and community transport groups, to ensure that the more flexible the services they provide are, the better they will be integrated into transport planning and information provision.
89Transport and Accessibility            Section 311.23   Park and Ride facilities will play a role in reducing congestion. Facilities 
need to have convenient car acc
ess and be located on high- frequency 
transport corridors. Bus-based Park and Ride will be pursued primarily at the following locations:
  •  Eighton Lodge
  •  Follingsby
  •  Lobley Hill 
11.24    Metro travel is greatly valued by passeng
ers and plays a large part in 
the existing high levels of public transport accessibility in the area. The Tyne and Wear Metro is currently undergoing a significant programme of re-invigoration and this is expected to be the main focus of the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive’s (Nexus) investments over at least the early years of the plan period. It is important that Metro stations are considered safe, high quality places, and that they encourage seamless interchange with other modes of transport, including walking and cycling. However, the Metro system only serves a proportion of Gateshead and Newcastle and as the re- invigoration programme progresses the councils will work with Nexus to explore the potential extension of the network.
11.25
  The councils will also support the North East Combined Authority, Nexus and bus operators in making public tr
ansport travel easier. For example, 
the introduction of smart ticketing on public transport will provide seamless integrated travel across the area. 
11.26
  Gateshead and Newcastle will develop a joint car parking strategy to manag
e demand. The strategy will seek to reduce long-stay commuter 
parking in centres. Short-stay parking for shoppers and visitors will be promoted. The introduction of car parking charges at retail centres will be sought where this can be achieved without threatening the vitality and viability of the centre. This will complement improvement of conditions for sustainable modes, including the expansion of Park and Ride.
11.27
  A key theme of the plans transport policy is to improve the oper
ation 
of existing air, rail and road transport networks that can help link the area nationally and internationally. Developing these networks to meet local demands and to strengthen strategic connections will be crucial to sustainable development in the plan area.
11.28
  Strategic international, national  and regional connections are very
 
important in the way that Gateshead and Newcastle are seen by the rest of the world. Perceived isolation has an impact on the image of Gateshead and Newcastle as a place to live and to do business. Improvements on this scale will predominantly be delivered in partnership with outside agencies such as the Highways Agency or Network Rail as part of national programmes.
90Transport and Accessibility 11.29   The range of destinations served, and the facilities provided, b y our main 
gateways at Newcastle International Airport, Newcastle Central Station and 
the Port of Tyne are crucial in developing perceptions of Gateshead and Newcastle as a place to live and to do business. These issues will largely fall outside the scope of this Plan, but Gateshead and Newcastle will continue to support and facilitate expansion as appropriate.
11.30
  Connection of the North East to the proposed national High Speed Rail Network remains a priority in the long term. Gateshead and New
castle as 
part of the North East Combined Authority will continue to promote the importance of any High Speed Rail Network being introduced in parallel on both the eastern and western sides of the country so as not to create economic disparity between regions. The councils and their partners will continue to lobby for and monitor the development of High Speed Rail through the plan period, defining and safeguarding potential routes and station locations as appropriate to ensure the network can be extended to the North East and on to Scotland.
11.31
  Newcastle Central Station provides acc
ess to national, regional and local 
rail services. The councils and their partners will continue to improve access to these services by further developing interchange facilities, implementing public realm improvements, introducing better crossing facilities and developing a southern access route. Policy NC1 sets out specific proposals for the Central Gateway projects, which will improve Central Station and the surrounding area. The Councils and their partners will also work with regional partners, East Coast and Network Rail, to support improvements to the East Coast Main Line. The importance of continued investment in the existing rail network in the short to medium term is recognised, to ensure forecast growth on this important strategic connection is addressed. Similarly we will press for improvements to the local rail network by supporting the re-instatement of the Leamside Line, and the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line as sustainable connections to and from the Urban Core.
11.32
  The Strategic Road Network serving the area (A1, A69, A194(M) and A696) is essential f
or connectivity which will help secure economic growth and 
prosperity for Gateshead and Newcastle. The councils will work with the Highways Agency to facilitate enhancements to these strategic corridors, giving better access to other major towns and cities and to international gateways. 
11.33
  While supporting improvements across the Strategic R
oad Network is 
important, tackling congestion on the A1 is our priority. As part of the Newcastle City Deal (July 2012)
16, it was agreed that the Department of 
Transport, the Highways Agency, the councils and other local partners would develop an investment programme to reduce congestion on the A1 Western Bypass, and finalise a business case for an improvement scheme at Lobley Hill.  The funding for this scheme is now in place to allow completion by 2017. The Highways Agency has also now published its wider route based strategy for this section of the A1 which sets out a number of possible further interventions, including schemes to provide additional capacity, reduce speed limits and introduce traffic signal controlled access to the route. Further work by the Highways Agency has suggested that the A1 is likely to require an additional lane of capacity in both directions along much of this route.  These additional  lanes are likely to be needed from Seaton Burn to the Scotswood Road north-facing slip-roads, and then from the southern extent of the Lobley Hill Major Scheme to the A1/A194(M) bifurcation at Birtley.
91Transport and Accessibility            Section 311.34   The promotion of sustainable modes of transport and the delivery of 
infr
astructure improvements will be supported by further development 
of the area’s intelligent transport system - Urban Traffic Management Control (UTMC). The introduction of UTMC will make best use of the existing road network for all modes of transport and provide valuable information to those who seek to move around the Urban Core. The system will manage traffic flows, car parking and priority for sustainable modes of transport giving valuable information to the travelling public, enabling them to make more informed travel choices.
 
11.35   Movement of goods is fundamental to an effective ec
onomy. While 
the councils  will seek to promote and facilitate the expansion of rail and sea freight, it must also be recognised that the majority of freight movements will remain on-road and that safe and efficient movement for goods vehicles must be provided. Both Gateshead and Newcastle are members of the Tyne and Wear Freight Quality Partnership and will continue to fully support its work in improving freight mapping, signage, driver information, freight exchange programmes and environmental fleet recognition.
11.36
  The strength of Gateshead and Newcastle as the main centres of
 
employment within the regional economy means that there is already an influx of commuters from neighbouring authorities.  The balanced approach to managing and developing networks, including intelligent transport systems and the bus corridor and Park and Ride proposals will help to accommodate movements and minimise their impact. Neighbouring authorities will be expected to contribute to this approach, where appropriate.
11.37
  Assessment of the traffic impacts of our growth aspir
ations highlighted 
a number of potential concerns where more detailed investigation may be required including Main Radial Corridors, Wrekenton, Team Valley, Lamesley, Whickham, Blue House Roundabout, Cowgate and Haddricks Mill. A number of potential mitigation schemes have been identified and are included in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP).
11.38
  Some strategic infrastructure may not continue to serve the network as
 
it currently does and alternative infrastructure may need to be provided during the plan period. One example of this is the High Level Bridge which currently carries public transport south out of Newcastle into Gateshead. It is possible that the councils will need to provide additional crossing capacity on the river during the lifetime of the Plan to mitigate against reductions in capacity and to support our growth aspirations. Gateshead and Newcastle will examine new crossings to the east and the west. Where these are found to be beneficial the councils will prepare funding bids and seek other sources of funding to provide them and work with the Combined Authority to prioritise future investment in these infrastructure projects as they develop.
92Transport and Accessibility 11.39   The Urban Core chapter sets out how to manage transport networks to 
and thr
ough the Urban Core. It also sets out how to improve the local 
environment, public realm and accessibility and reduce non-essential traffic. 
11.40
  Traffic that passes through the Urban Core contributes significantly to
 
congestion but little to its vitality. While working towards the reduction of this traffic, we must also recognise that although some of the main traffic routes through the Urban Core act as barriers to other forms of travel, particularly walking, some traffic is also necessary to bring vitality and growth. We will seek to manage routes by reducing traffic speeds, improving crossings and improving the public realm.
11.41
  All developments have an impact on the transport network. In order to
 
manage the network effectively, take account of road safety and support sustainable travel development must ensure that it minimises car trips, supports sustainable travel alternatives, facilitates all modes and mitigates its impacts on the highway network. The need for new routes through the Green Belt will be assessed as part of the masterplanning process for housing and employment sites.
11.42
  The potential impacts of development will be evaluated through Tr
ansport Assessments or Statements primarily. The councils will 
implement best practice guidance to mitigate any adverse impacts. In addressing potential impacts, car parking at developments will be managed, and robust and measurable travel plans will be required to minimise the number of car trips attracted and generated.
 
11.43   As part of the planning application process, developers will be e
xpected 
to address any identifiable impacts on, or barriers to, sustainable travel. This will be done by improving linkages to development from surrounding areas (particularly for pedestrians and cyclists), improving connections between homes and jobs, and by incorporating best practice to decrease the mode share of the private car.
11.44
  Developers will be required to complement the Councils’ intr
oduction of 
charging points for electric vehicles by incorporating them as a minimum in major developments, and by the introduction of 20 miles per hour zones in all residential areas as well as encouraging the adoption of homezone principles.
11.45
  Pedestrian and cycle access to and through new de
velopments must be 
safe, direct and usable. Layouts of new developments are expected to facilitate an increase in cycling, together with an emphasis on creating walkable neighbourhoods, where facilities and services can easily be accessed on foot.
93Transport and Accessibility            Section 312.1   People and place is a cross cutting theme in the Plan covering important 
aspects of Gateshead and Newcastle. Attractive en
vironments and 
a high quality of place contributes to the wellbeing of residents. In accommodating growth and new development, it is important that this quality is not compromised. The key aspects addressed in the people and place chapter are enhancing the integrity of our natural environment, heritage assets and green infrastructure, together with a sustainable approach to tackling health, flood risk and climate change issues. 
12.2
  The following chapter therefore includes policies on wellbeing and
 
health (Policy CS14), place-making (Policy CS15), climate change (Policy CS16), flood risk and water management (Policy CS17), green infrastructure and natural environment (Policy CS18) and Green Belt (Policy CS19).
Wellbeing and health 
12.3
  Across Gateshead and Newcastle there are marked diff
erences in 
physical and mental health and life expectancy between the most 
deprived and most affluent neighbourhoods. Evidence shows that health inequalities are linked to social and economic issues and that action is required across the wider social determinants of health. The wider determinants of health are closely linked to the quality of life enjoyed by residents. This includes having the opportunity to earn a reasonable wage, live an active lifestyle and have access to local employment opportunities,  healthy housing, open space, cultural and community facilities, healthy food and care and health facilities. Development has the ability to positively influence wellbeing and health, and spatial planning aims to consider and positively influence the determinants of health.
CS14 Wellbeing and HealthThe wellbeing and health of communities will be maintained and improved by:
 1.  Requiring development to contribute to creating an age friendly, healthy
 
and equitable living environment through:
  i. Creating an inclusive built and natural environment,
  ii. Promoting and facilitating active and healthy lifestyles,
   iii.  Preventing negative impacts on residential amenity and wider public saf
ety from noise, ground instability, ground and water 
contamination, vibration and air quality,
  iv.  Providing good access for all to health and social car
e facilities, and
  v.  Promoting access for all to green spaces, sports f
acilities, play and 
recreation opportunities.
 2.  Promoting allotments and gardens for exercise, r
ecreation and for 
healthy locally produced food.
 3. Controlling the location of, and access to
, unhealthy eating outlets.
9412. People and PlacePeople and Place 12.4   Wellbeing, health and equality are cross-cutting themes, and Policy CS14 
should therefore be read alongside other policies that addres
s the wider 
determinants of health, wellbeing and equity. These include access to community facilities, encouraging walking and cycling, providing employment opportunities, creating sustainable communities, ensuring access to green and open space and placemaking. More detailed policies and standards relating to these themes will be set out in subsequent LDD’s.
12.5
  With the increasing proportions of older people and greater diversity in our c
ommunities there will also be challenges ahead to make sure 
that the needs of all are met in a fair and inclusive way. The built environment can contribute to this through a considered approach to the location, design and accessibility of development. This will ensure that residents have equal access to opportunities in employment, housing and health, and that opportunities for social interaction in a safe environment are provided.
12.6
  By ensuring an equitable distribution of services and amenities, the Plan can help reduce health inequalities and encourag
e healthy 
lifestyle choices. The location of development can help to sustain neighbourhoods by encouraging physical activity and the provision of accessible facilities to meet the needs of our diverse communities. Until more detailed requirements are set out in subsequent LDD’s major developments will need to demonstrate how this has been achieved in their Design and Access Statement.
12.7
  Locations for development will be assessed, in terms of compatibility
 
and amenity, taking into account the potential risks from non-compatible neighbouring uses and environmental constraints, including potential contamination, ground instability and poor air quality. Public safety and stability issues associated with mining legacy will also need to be addressed.
12.8
  The Councils will continue to work with partners, including health provider
s, to deliver and protect an integrated network of appropriate 
health facilities in sustainable, accessible locations, responsive to the diverse needs of residents.
12.9
  The provision of open space, sport and recreation f
acilities is an 
important factor in the health and wellbeing of communities. Areas of open space that are valued by residents provide an important community function, and can make a significant contribution to quality of life. The accessibility, quality and quantity of open space, sport and recreation facilities will be addressed and monitored through the Local Plan. 
95People and Place            Section 312.10   A network of allotments and private gardens, in addition to providing 
green spac
e in an area, also provide opportunities for outdoor 
recreation, contributing to physical and mental wellbeing. Allotments provide a place for people to interact, and to produce healthy locally grown food, which can help to improve the diet of residents. An important contributing factor to poor diet and health in certain parts of Gateshead and Newcastle is the distribution and access to unhealthy eating outlets. In certain locations there is an issue where such uses cluster together, reinforcing the ease of access to unhealthy foods. Consideration will therefore be given to controlling the proliferation of and therefore access to, such uses. This will be considered further in subsequent LDD’s and/or Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs).
Place-making
12.11
  The quality of our lives is determined, in large part, by the surrounding 
en
vironment. Quality of place has an important role in attracting 
and retaining residents, visitors and businesses into Gateshead and Newcastle and contributing to the overall quality of life. Development should add to what is locally distinctive or create a new sense of place where this is needed.
12.12
  The Plan seeks to provide a sustainable and high quality environment for future g
enerations, providing places that people are attracted to and 
wish to stay in. The design and condition of the built environment also has a major influence on levels of crime, health, inclusion, community cohesion and wellbeing.
12.13
  Development needs to renew and improve the public r
ealm, its built 
form, its environmental performance and the mitigation of climate change. The right development in the right location, moving away from standard solutions can be used to enhance heritage assets, townscape characteristics and local distinctiveness. The historic and natural environment, the townscape that we have inherited, and the enhancement of these, should be a starting point for consideration of any development.
12.14
  The following policy plays a key part in achieving good place-making
 
by setting out the approach to conserving and enhancing valued places and heritage, and by ensuring that development is of a high standard, improving and reflecting its local area.
96People and Place Policy CS15 Place-Making 
Development will contribute to good place-making through the delivery of high quality and sustainable design, and the conservation and enhancement of the historic environment. This will be achieved by:
 1. Development being required to:
  i.  Respond positively to local distinctiveness and character,
  ii.  Create safe and inclusive environments,
  iii.  Ensure connectivity, accessibility and legibility
,
  iv.   Respect and enhance significant views and the setting of heritage assets,
   v.   Respond to the unique character and importance of the River Tyne, its
 
tributaries and its setting,
  vi.  Respond positively to opportunities to introduce public art, and
  vii. Respond to local design and conservation guidance.
 2.  Taking a proactive approach to sustaining the historic environment in a manner appr
opriate to the significance of the relevant heritage asset and 
requiring development to support and safeguard the historic environment by:
  i.   Promoting the use, enjoyment and understanding of the historic envir
onment,
   ii.   Positively responding to those heritage assets which are at risk, and not lea
ving heritage assets at risk, or vulnerable to risk, and
   iii.   Where appropriate positively adapting heritage assets to ensure the   
 continued contribution to quality of place.
12.15   High quality design is a key element of good place-making and in enhancing the positive f
eatures of Gateshead and Newcastle. The 
two Councils have detailed development guidance available for applicants, which expand on these general principles. In addition, policies in chapters 16 and 17 set out more detailed design intentions and expectations for Sub-Areas and sites. Specific policies will also be included in subsequent LDD’s.
12.16
  Successful place-making requires an understanding and r
espect for 
an area’s unique built, natural, cultural and socio-economic context. The distinctive character and sense of place of many areas within Gateshead and Newcastle are the result of their setting, development and the underlying land form. The Tyne river crossings, the various river valleys, the dramatic topography, natural landscape and the close proximity of rural and urban landscapes provide some of the most defining characteristics of Gateshead and Newcastle. The relationship of development to the topography and landscape is very important, and can significantly influence the outcome of development and add to the quality of place. Views across and within the plan area can be a significant and distinctive feature of the whole conurbation. They need to be respected and maintained and it is therefore essential that development proposals take into consideration, and respond positively to existing views.
97People and Place            Section 312.17   Public art, imaginatively and sensitively used, can help to enhance 
and celebrate the sense of plac
e, as well as add distinctiveness and 
encourage civic pride. It can also make way finding easier.
12.18   Gateshead and Newcastle have a high concentration o
f heritage assets. 
There are 30 Scheduled Ancient Monuments including Hadrian’s Wall (also a World Heritage Site), the Castle Keep and Dunston Staithes. Over 4,000 buildings are listed
18, and it is notable that the number 
of Grade I listed buildings in the Newcastle Central Conservation Area is substantially higher than the national average. There are 34 Conservation Areas, 10 Registered Parks and Gardens, and a Registered Battlefield, at Newburn Ford. Both Councils have adopted Local Lists of protection, totalling over 500 buildings, monuments, parks and gardens. These are key assets which the authorities will seek to protect for the future and which provide further opportunities for enhancement. The manner in which the area has developed historically underpins the unique characteristics, qualities and identity of Gateshead and Newcastle. This is a positive foundation on which to build quality, ensuring distinctiveness and providing a strong sense of place for local people. The quality of development is generally improved when it is informed by local characteristics, including the historic environment.
98People and Place 
12.19   The rich historic environment in Gateshead and Newcastle has relatively 
f
ew heritage assets ‘at risk’, when considered as a percentage of the 
total. However, pressures for development, lack of investment and inconsiderate development could result in additional assets becoming at risk. There is a need to ensure that groups or types of heritage assets most at risk are targeted in planning or regeneration proposals. The underlying principle is to reconcile the need for growth and the viability of development with the need to conserve the historic environment and protect local character.
12.20
  The re-use of heritage assets can positively assist with the delivery
 
of the wider vision set out in this strategy. Encouraging access and promoting the understanding of the historic environment will ensure that people can get the most out of Gateshead and Newcastle’s heritage and that its tourism potential is enhanced.
Climate change 
12.21
  Climate change represents a major challenge to our way of life, and
 
alongside the need for development to meet today’s needs comes a 
responsibility to future generations. The Plan promotes sustainable development, including urban patterns that use resources and land more efficiently, underpinned by a more sustainable economy. Buildings will need to use resources more efficiently and reduce their energy consumption. This approach will reduce our ecological footprint and improve the long-term social, economic and environmental health of Gateshead and Newcastle.
12.22
  The Climate Change Act 200840 requires that the UK reduces its 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050. Both Gateshead and Newcastle have signed up to the Covenant of Mayors
27 commitments on sustainable energy. This is a commitment to 
go beyond a 20% reduction by 2020.
12.23   Gateshead and Newcastle recognise they hav
e a role to play in 
mitigating and adapting to climate change. Both Councils have ambitious targets in their Climate Change Strategies to achieve reduced CO2 emissions from existing houses. This policy seeks to encourage the development of low carbon and renewable energy solutions appropriate to the scale and circumstance of the development.
99People and Place            Section 3Policy CS16 Climate Change
Development will be sustainable, able to function effectively in a changing climate and address impacts on climate change emissions. Development will be required to:
 1.  Use a good standard of building fabric, passive design, and landscaping measur
es to minimise energy demand,
 2. Be flexible from the outset to allow adaptation to alternative uses,
 3.  Deliver a good level of sustainability required b
y relevant government 
schemes/guidance, 
 4.  Minimise its contributions and provide resilience to the ongoing and pr
edicted impacts of climate change,
 5. Reduce its whole-life CO2 equivalent emissions impact, and
 6.  Optimise the use of local renewable or low carbon energy in accor
dance 
with the following hierarchy:
   i.  Connection to an existing, or make provision for futur
e connection, to 
a committed wider decentralised energy scheme within a specified timeframe,
  ii.  Development of a decentralised energy scheme for the whole or
 
significant portion of a development from the outset, including joint schemes with significant adjacent external energy loads,
   iii. Incorporation of other renewable energy solutions,
   iv. Incorporation of other low carbon energy solutions in accor
dance with   
   current government guidelines.
12.24   The two main policy responses to climate change are mitigation and adaptation. Both are needed. Mitigation seeks to reduc
e the causes 
of climate change, such as lessening greenhouse gas emissions from development. Adaptation seeks to reduce the risks resulting from climatic changes, for example, through the provision of flood defences. Development will be expected to address both mitigation and adaptation through appropriate location, design, landscaping, energy use minimisation and the choice of energy supply.
12.25
  A Sustainability Statement is required to support a planning application. This needs to provide detail on the measures proposed to meet the
 
appropriate level of sustainability required by relevant government schemes/guidance and provide a calculation of the predicted annual energy loads and consumption of the development, as well as the predicted CO2 emissions.
12.26
  Both Councils are actively working on the implementation of decentr
alised energy networks. These will improve Gateshead’s 
and Newcastle’s attractiveness by providing a cost efficient way for developers to meet required carbon emissions targets.
100People and Place 12.27   Connection to an existing or committed decentralised energy system 
will need to be in compliance with technical specifications that are available for any r
elevant scheme. Payment of associated costs or 
contributions will also be required at that time. Where no decentralised energy scheme exists, strategic and other large-scale developments must evaluate the feasibility of providing a decentralised energy system and, where feasible, implement such schemes. In addition to these requirements, developments must also manage flood risk, taking into account the impact of climate change as outlined in Policy CS17.
12.28
  The onus is on the developer to demonstrate why certain requirements o
f this policy are not feasible, either technically or financially, if 
exemptions from certain provisions are sought.
12.29   This Plan supports the development of appropriate, commercial-scale
 
energy schemes. In accordance with national planning policy, weight will be given to the wider environmental, social and economic benefits of renewable and low carbon energy generation in considering proposals.
Flooding and water 
12.30
  Increased levels of water consumption mean that the availability of this
 
resource is under pressure. Our growing population and an increase in 
hard surfaces also means there is more foul water and surface water to be dealt with. These issues are predicted to become more important as a result of climate change reducing the amount of water available, and wetter winters putting additional pressure on the public sewerage system.
12.31
  In recent years floods, storms and droughts have sho
wn how vulnerable 
the UK is to extremes of weather, resulting in significant economic, social and environmental cost. Climate change means that extreme weather events will become more frequent and destructive. Effective flood risk management is one of the most important ways of adapting to the increased number of intensive rainfall events. New development should be planned to avoid vulnerability to increased flood risk caused by climate change. When new development is brought forward in areas which are vulnerable, care should be taken to ensure that risk can be managed through suitable adaptation measures reflected in Policies CS17 and CS18. While the North East is not an area of water resource stress and sufficient water resources are available, water efficiency measures will also be encouraged through achievement of the relevant national standards.
12.32
  The Councils’ respective Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRA), and
 
the Environment Agency’s flood zone maps, identify areas at risk of flooding from all sources. Policy CS17 seeks to avoid flood risk to people and property where possible and manage flood risk through location, layout and design, taking into consideration the impacts of climate change as identified in the SFRA.
101People and Place            Section 3Policy CS17 Flood Risk and Water Management
Development will avoid and manage flood risk from all sources, taking into account the impact of climate change over its lifetime. Development will:
 1. Avoid and manage flood risk to people and property by:
  i.  Locating new development in areas with the lowest risk where    
    appropriate by applying the Sequential Test,
   ii.  Managing flood risk from development to ensure that the risk is not   
  increased on site and/or elsewhere, where appropriate b
y applying   
  the Exception Test,
  iii. Ensuring opportunities for development to contribute to the     
    mitigation of flooding elsewhere are taken,
  iv. Prioritise the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), given the  
    multifunctional benefits to water quality, green space and habitat   
    enhancement,
  v.  Ensuring development is in accordance with the Council’s Str
ategic   
    Flood Risk Assessment, and
  vi. Requiring a Flood Risk Assessment for sites over 0.5ha in Critical    
    Drainage Areas as identified in the Council’s Strategic Flood Risk    
    Assessments.
 2.  Ensure water supply and foul and surface water infrastructure are pr
ovided 
with adequate capacity. 
 3.  Not adversely affect water quality and where possible seek to improv
e 
water quality.
 4.  Separate, minimise and control surface water runoff
, discharging in order 
of priority to:
  i.  Infiltration based Sustainable Drainage Systems,
  ii.  A watercourse,
  iii. A surface water sewer, and
  iv. A combined sewer.
12.33   The risk of flooding has informed the Spatial Strategy, with the intention to locate dev
elopment predominantly in areas with the lowest 
probability of flooding, as per the sequential test. 
12.34   To assist in delivering Policy CS17, the Councils have pr
epared a Flood 
Risk and Water Management Guidance Note, which sets out the local context and evidence base relating to flood risk and water management. The note will be subject to regular updating to ensure it remains current, as evidence on risk becomes more refined and in line with national requirements introduced through the Flood and Water Management Act 2010
42.
102People and Place 12.35   The NPPF and Planning Practice Guidance requires that inappropriate 
de
velopment in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided by directing 
development away from areas at highest risk, applying the Sequential Test and if necessary applying the Exception Test. Where development is necessary the NPPF and technical guidance recognises that there may be exceptions for certain at-risk sites where there are no suitable and reasonably available lower risk sites. In exceptional circumstances, where development is necessary in areas of risk and an alternative site at lower risk cannot be found, appropriate mitigation measures will be required to make it safe. These must not increase or displace flood risk elsewhere. 
12.36
  Howdon Sewage Treatment Works (STW) serv
es parts of the Local 
Authority areas of Newcastle, Gateshead, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Northumberland. To ensure there is capacity to support growth, existing surface water from the public sewerage system will need to be removed. In addition to ensure that growth can be sustainably accommodated by the water infrastructure, CS17 sets the requirement that in all locations surface water should be controlled and minimised. This should be at source wherever feasible, with development proposals having regard to the Surface Water Management Plan where appropriate. 
12.37
  Policy CS17 sets the priority for the incorporation of Sustainable Drainag
e Systems (SuDS) into new developments to manage and 
minimise surface water. SuDS generally are landscaped facilities such as wetlands, retention ponds, soakaways, swales and/or permeable surfaces, the primary function being to reduce the volume and peak rates of water run-off from new development, but they should also fulfil their potential to provide new wildlife habitats and amenity spaces. SuDS can also improve water quality by increasing the filtration of pollutants, and thereby support the objectives of the Water Framework Directive
41. 
12.38   There is further opportunity to combine flood alleviation, biodiversity and landscape enhancements at Shibdon Meado
w, the Upper Team 
valley and the upper reaches of the Ouseburn which will contribute to the protection and enhancement of the functional floodplain.
103People and Place            Section 3
Green infrastructure and the natural environment 
12.39   Green infrastructure in Gateshead and Newcastle comprises a rang
e 
of multifunctional green spaces (whether stand-alone or forming part 
of the network) and inter-connecting links. It is important in meeting the environmental, social and economic needs of communities and in supporting natural and ecological processes. It contributes to the quality of the natural and built environment and is integral to the health and quality of life of communities. Green infrastructure includes wildlife sites, parks and gardens, areas of countryside, woodland and street trees, allotments and agricultural land, outdoor sport and recreation provision, local green spaces, footpaths, cycle and bridleways, ponds, lakes and watercourses.
12.40
  Open space, sport and recreation facilities are ke
y elements of green 
infrastructure, and appropriate provision of such assets makes a fundamental contribution to the health and wellbeing of communities. Areas of open space which are valued by residents provide an important community function, and can make a significant contribution to the aesthetic quality of an area. Safeguarding open space is vital in ensuring that there is sufficient quantity to meet the needs of local people. The NPPF presumes against the loss of these areas to built development unless:
  •  An assessment has been undertaken which shows the open space is surplus to requir
ements, or
  •  The loss resulting from the proposed development will be r
eplaced by equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity and 
quality in a suitable location, or
  •  The development is for an alternative sports and recreation pr
ovision, the needs for which clearly outweigh the loss.
12.41   Policy CS18 intends to protect and enhance our Green Infrastructure Netw
ork and natural environment. This includes the provision of 
adequate open space, sport and recreational facilities, the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity and geodiversity, and safeguarding landscape character. Building design can also incorporate features that make an important contribution to conserving and enhancing biodiversity.
104People and Place 
Policy CS18 Green Infrastructure and the Natural Environment
A high quality and comprehensive framework of interconnected green infrastructure that offers ease of movement and an appealing natural environment for people and wildlife will be achieved by:
 1.  Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the integrity, connectivity, multifunctionality and ac
cessibility of the Strategic Green Infrastructure 
Network.
 2.  Protection, enhancement and management of green infrastructure as
sets 
which include:
  i.  Biodiversity and geodiversity assets, including designated sites, designated wildlif
e corridors and priority habitats and species,
  ii.  Distinctive landscape character, recognising the particular importance o
f 
our rivers and topography, and
  iii. Trees, woodland and hedgerows.
 3.  Addressing gaps in the network and making improvements in Opportunity Ar
eas.
 4.  Improving and extending linkages to and within the Strategic Gr
een 
Infrastructure Network.
 5.  Protecting and enhancing open spaces, sport and recreational facilities in acc
ordance with agreed standards in line with National Policy.
 6.  Improving access to, along and onto the River T
yne and tributaries, without 
adversely impacting on the local ecology or damaging the river banks.
12.42   The components of green infrastructure and the natural envir
onment, 
including designated sites for biodiversity and standards for open space, sport and recreation, will be considered in more detail in subsequent LDD’s
12.43
  Our evidence base has assessed existing and potential green infrastructur
e 
assets, and identified thirteen strategic corridors which make up our Strategic Green Infrastructure Network. In addition to this network, a number of Opportunity Areas have been identified where there is potential to improve the provision or function of green infrastructure assets. Figure 12 sets out our Strategic Green Infrastructure Network and Opportunity Areas. The delivery mechanisms will be set out in our Green Infrastructure Delivery Plans.
12.44
  As reflected in the policy, a number of strategic elements combine to
 
make up green infrastructure in Gateshead and Newcastle. While it is acknowledged that there is overlap between green infrastructure functions, there is a broad categorisation of the components.
12.45
  Green infrastructure is multifunctional and can play a major role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Flood alle
viation and water 
management, enhancements to biodiversity, landscape design and opportunities for recreation can be effectively combined in schemes, as has been done for example at Lamesley Pastures and Newcastle Great Park. In urban areas green roofs, green walls and elements of shading and cooling can also be included. It also provides essential community facilities and can contribute to improving the wellbeing and health of our residents.

Plans43, with targets for the protection of locally and regionally important 
species and habitats. Some species and habitats contained within 
the current UK Biodiversity Action Plan are also relevant. In order to conserve the quality and range of biodiversity, it is important that it is not treated in isolation, but rather is recognised as a key component of green infrastructure, contributing to wider benefits.
12.47
  Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are the most important ecolo
gical sites in Gateshead and Newcastle. There are a total of 13 
SSSIs in the area, including Gosforth Park, Prestwick Carr, Shibdon Pond and Thornley Wood. SSSIs are afforded statutory protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981). Local Nature Reserves (LNRs), which are another important part of local biodiversity can be used as a valuable educational resource, are given statutory protection under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (1949)
44. LNRs are  
designated by local authorities under the Act.
12.48   Local Wildlife Sites (formerly Sites of Nature Conservation Importance) ar
e a key part of our green infrastructure and because of the number 
of sites and the range of habitats they represent, they are important to biodiversity in Gateshead and Newcastle.  Major sites include the Derwent Walk Country Park, Blaydon Burn and Milkwellburn Wood, Big Waters, Newburn Riverside Country Park and Havannah Nature Reserve. The Local Wildlife Site designation is non-statutory, and protection through the planning system is essential for the future survival of these sites.
12.49
  Wildlife Corridors, including Wildlife Enhancement Corridors, allo
w 
the movement of species between areas of habitat, linking wildlife sites and reducing the risk of small, isolated populations becoming unsustainable and dying out. The Wildlife Corridor Network overlaps with, but is distinct from, the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network, as it is designated purely to benefit wildlife, by providing ecological connectivity.
12.50
  A positive approach to the conservation of the landscape, reco
gnising 
various levels of sensitivity, will be an important element in considering proposals for development which could affect it. Local landscape character assessments provide specific information about the identity and character of an area and will be used to guide new development in a sustainable and appropriate way. 
12.51
  Woodlands, trees and hedgerows, including street trees and listed tr
ees 
in urban areas, are important for the attractiveness of our area as well as being a key component of ecosystems. They contribute to cooling and shading in urban areas and to linkages in the Green Infrastructure Network. Tree Preservation Orders and Conservation Area designations protect many of the most important assets. There will be a presumption in favour of the retention, protection, and enhancement of woodlands, trees and hedgerows, as well as, where appropriate, additional provisions by new developments.
107People and Place            Section 312.52   Open space, sport and recreation facilities include a range o f green 
infrastructure assets that are accessible to the public, such as parks 
and amenity green spaces, outdoor sports facilities, allotments and community gardens. These spaces support a variety of green infrastructure functions, providing opportunities for outdoor recreation and community events, and can contribute to aesthetic quality and ecological value in urban and rural areas.
12.53
  The River Tyne, its banks and tributaries which between them contain significant areas o
f mud flats and small remnants of saltmarsh are 
within our Green Infrastructure Network, but also provide an important recreation resource. They therefore pose a particular challenge because of the need to maximise their recreational and regeneration potential, without compromising their ecological value and landscape quality. New development will be required to balance these conflicting functions in proposals to improve public access and enjoyment, without damaging the environmental quality of these resources. Potential to improve access has for example been identified at Newburn Haugh, Dunston Staithes, Walker Riverside and Felling Shore. Access improvements need to be undertaken sensitively, particularly on the sections of the river with extensive mud flats.
108People and Place 
Protecting the Green Belt
12.54   Most of the undeveloped area of Gateshead and Newcastle is
 
designated as Green Belt. First established in Gateshead and Newcastle 
in the 1960s and extended and altered several times since, the Green Belt around Tyne and Wear covers an area of approximately 730 square kilometres
45. In Gateshead and Newcastle the Green Belt extends to 
approximately 130 square kilometres, slightly more than half of the administrative area and corresponding almost exactly with our rural area. The Green Belt includes the strategically important open land between the urban areas and key gaps between urban areas and rural settlements. 
Policy CS19 Green BeltThe Tyne and Wear Green Belt forms a wide band of protected land around Gateshead and Newcastle. The Green Belt as shown on the Policies Maps will be protected in accordance with national policy to:
 1.  Prevent the merging of settlements, particularly: Gateshead with Hebburn, Washington, Birtle
y or Whickham; Newcastle with Ponteland, 
or Cramlington; the main built-up area with nearby villages; and villages with each other,
 2. Safeguard the countryside from encroachment,
 3. Check unrestricted urban sprawl, and
 4.  Assist in urban regeneration in the city-region b
y encouraging the 
recycling of derelict and other urban land. 
12.55   Nationally, the government attaches great importance to the Green Belt
 
which has a range of important functions, including helping to check the unrestricted sprawl of built-up areas, preventing individual settlements from merging, safeguarding the countryside from encroachment, and encouraging the recycling of previously developed land within the urban area. The most important attributes of Green Belts are their ‘openness’ and ‘permanence’, and their general extent should only be altered in exceptional circumstances.
12.56
  The NPPF sets out the policy approach to the protection of the Green Belt. Green Belt boundaries should only be altered in e
xceptional 
circumstances and when a Local Plan is being prepared or reviewed. The Plan sets out a revised Green Belt boundary for Gateshead and Newcastle, which is shown broadly on the Key Diagram (Figure 5) and in detail on the Policies Maps.
109People and Place            Section 313.1   The minerals and waste sector plays an important role in the local 
economy and in supporting our growth aspirations. R
esources need 
to be managed in an efficient and sustainable manner, where waste is minimised and resources are safeguarded to meet future needs. It is essential that sufficient waste management capacity and an adequate supply of minerals are made available to meet our needs to 2030. The following chapter includes policies on minerals (Policy CS20) and waste (Policy CS21).
Minerals 
13.2
  Gateshead and Newcastle, like most of the North East, have a str
ong 
history of mineral extraction, notably the coal industry, and parts of its 
topography reflects this history of pits, spoil heaps and waggonways. Substantial reserves remain and in addition to our current operational facilities, including Gateshead Wharf (landing of sand and gravel) and Brenkley in Newcastle (surface coal and fireclay extraction), the evidence base for minerals includes geological data showing the location of inferred mineral resources.
13.3
  Our priority is to ensure the sustainable supply and management of our mineral resourc
es to support development needs and the wider 
economy, while reducing wastage and protecting the environment and quality of life for residents.
11013. Minerals and WasteMinerals and WastePolicy CS20 Minerals
Mineral resources and related infrastructure will be managed and safeguarded to meet current and future needs. A contribution to the region’s supply needs will be made to ensure an adequate and steady supply of minerals in a way that supports the Councils’ social, environmental and economic objectives. This will be achieved by:
 1.  The whole of the plan area being identified as a Mineral Safeguarding Ar
ea.
 2.  Areas of Search being defined in subsequent LDD’s.
 3.  Proposals for non-energy mineral extraction being asses
sed individually 
and cumulatively, in terms of their contribution to national and regional guidelines, and the social, environmental and economic impacts arising.
 4. Proposals for energy mineral developments being determined in   
  accordance with national policy.
 5. All minerals of economic importance being safeguarded and pr
otected  
  from unnecessary sterilisation by non-mineral development.
 6. Where non-mineral development is proposed within the Mineral   
  Safeguarding Area, consideration being given to the f
easibility of prior  
  extraction of the mineral resource fr
om the site or its immediate   
  surroundings, unless the site is less than 1 hectare, or there is evidenc
e  
  that:
  i. The mineral resource is not present, has already been extr
acted or is  
   of insufficient extent to be of any economic value, or
  ii. Extraction of the mineral would have an unacc
eptable impact on the  
   environment, local communities and other neighbouring uses, or
  iii. There is an exceptional overriding need for the de
velopment, which  
   outweighs the value of the mineral resource.
 7.  Worked land being subject to high standards of restoration and aftercar
e  
  to ensure it is returned to the most appropriate and beneficial after  
  use at the earliest opportunity taking into account airport safety, and  
  securing biodiversity, woodland and recreational enhancement.
13.4   The whole of the plan area has been identified as a Mineral Safeguarding Ar
ea (MSA), based on the extent of shallow coal and associated clays, 
whilst the extent of sand and gravel and known brick clay resources are also safeguarded. These various resources are shown broadly in Figure 13.1 along with the location of our existing facilities.

MSA will be safeguarded, to ensure the steady supply of sand and gra
vel 
for aggregate uses within Gateshead and Newcastle and the wider area. Gateshead Wharf located in East Gateshead will be safeguarded for the landing of marine aggregates.
13.6
  There is no presumption that resources within the MSA will be worked
 
at any time. Any proposals for mineral extraction would need to comply with environmental and amenity policies set out in both Councils’ Local Plans. The MSA does not necessarily preclude other forms of development, but ensures that avoiding sterilisation of resources through prior extraction, and addressing mining legacy, are taken into account in any planning decisions.
13.7
  Gateshead and Newcastle are underlain by shallow coal deposits and ther
efore is a potential location for surface coal extraction. The Brenkley 
Lane site in Newcastle has permission for the extraction of 2.4 million tonnes of coal and 200,000 tonnes of fireclay by opencast methods. The extraction, which commenced in 2011, is scheduled to occur in 5 phases over a period of 11.5 years.
13.8
  There may also be scope for the working and extraction of fuel and
 
other materials from former colliery/coke waste tips and disused railway embankments, which can assist in delivering environmental improvements. Proposals for energy mineral developments will be determined in accordance with local requirements and national policy. The NPPF stresses that planning permission should not be granted for the extraction of coal unless the proposal is environmentally acceptable, or can be made so by planning conditions or obligations, or if not, it provides national, local or community benefits which clearly outweigh the likely impacts to justify the grant of planning permission.
13.9
  There may be potential in the longer term for the extraction of shale and other under
ground gas through hydraulic fracturing (fracking) a 
process which is becoming more technically viable. This involves a combination of water and chemicals being pumped at high pressure into the shale rock to create narrow fractures releasing the shale gas. The acceptability of such proposals will depend on a range of environmental considerations and controls, and the content of related national guidance.
13.10
  The continued supply of aggregates and other material, including recycled and sec
ondary materials is required to meet current and future 
needs of the development and construction industry. Promoting the use of recycled and secondary materials will help to minimise both primary extraction and waste.
13.11
  Based on national and sub-national guidelines for the provision of aggregates, the North East Aggr
egates Working Party identified that the 
Tyne and Wear sub-region, including Gateshead and Newcastle, will need to make provision for 3.1 million tonnes
46 of sand and gravel and 3 
million tonnes of crushed rock over the period 2005 to 2020.
113Minerals and Waste            Section 313.12   In addition, the NPPF requires a landbank (supply of sites with 
permission) of at least 7 year
s for sand and gravel, 10 years for crushed 
rock and 25 years for brick clay, based on the extent of permitted reserves set against the annual rate of extraction. Local authorities are required to prepare a Local Aggregate Assessment (LAA) to assess the capacity and outputs from existing sources, and to assess future supply options. The LAA has been prepared collaboratively by the authorities of County Durham, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear in order to address cross boundary mineral planning issues. The report identifies that the requirement from Tyne and Wear for the period 2013-2030 is approximately 4.6 million tonnes of sand and gravel and 5.3 million tonnes of crushed rock
47. 
13.13   Until recently Gateshead had two operational sand and gravel e
xtraction 
sites, located at Blaydon and Crawcrook in the west of the borough. Blaydon Quarry has exhausted all remaining viable reserves, while the site at Crawcrook is non-operational, and there is uncertainty regarding the extent and quality of remaining reserves. Two dormant sites identified as a result of the review of mineral sites under the now defunct Minerals Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 are located in Gateshead at Bog Wood and west of Barlow Lane (satellite sites of Blaydon Quarry). However, the prospect of extraction taking place at either of these is uncertain, and would require the submission and approval of new working conditions. A number of other safeguarded sand and gravel sites located in Gateshead will be taken forward in subsequent LDD’s.
13.14
  Within Tyne and Wear the level of permitted reserves at e
xisting mineral 
sites is sufficient to meet our needs and the sub-regional apportionment to a date beyond 2030 for both sand and gravel and crushed rock. Notwithstanding this the NPPF stipulates that large landbanks bound up in a limited number of sites should not stifle competition. The LAA recommends that Tyne and Wear should continue both to safeguard economically important reserves and make a contribution to meet local and regional needs. This includes consideration of additional sand and gravel sites to maintain a sufficient landbank of reserves throughout the plan period, and to minimise the import of material to Tyne and Wear.
13.15
  Given the limited information on the quality and quantity of reserves within saf
eguarded sites, the inconclusive response on future 
commercial needs to the Tyne and Wear survey of mineral operators,  and the conclusions of the Local Aggregate Assessment, it is proposed to identify Areas of Search for sand and gravel extraction in subsequent LDD’s, based on the extent of resources in the plan area as shown on Figure 13.1. Proposals for extraction will be assessed in accordance with the Local Plan, evidence on the quality and quantity of reserves present at the site, and the wider need for further extraction.
114Minerals and Waste13.16   In terms of the supply of brick clay, Throckley Brick Works in New castle 
is supplied with clays from Red Barns Quarry in South Tyneside, while 
glacial lake clay is currently worked at Birtley Quarry in County Durham, supplying the adjacent Union Brickworks located in Gateshead. The Birtley Quarry permission runs to 2020, although this could be extended to approximately 2029 based on permitted reserves and rates of extraction. Extending or deepening the site could also allow additional extraction to take place. Either extending the current site, or extraction from an alternative source elsewhere in Gateshead or Durham will be required to ensure continuity of supply and a 25 year landbank of permitted reserves. The only potentially workable deposit of brick clay is located at Lamesley in Gateshead and is safeguarded.
13.17
  An agreed restoration and aftercare management plan that will also ensur
e that landscapes are restored and where necessary improved 
will be a prerequisite for any approvals for mineral extraction. This process can also bring about opportunities to deliver improvements for biodiversity and recreation. However, any end scheme will need to comply with airport safety requirements, which could restrict the subsequent use of the site. The capacity of existing sites and future proposals will be monitored by the local authorities and the North East Aggregate Working Party to ensure maintenance of a sufficient landbank for aggregates. The annual Local Aggregate Assessment will be prepared to monitor aggregate supplies and reserves within the area. Subject to further evaluation, more detailed criteria and Areas of Search will be included within subsequent LDD’s.
Waste
13.18
  Gateshead and Newcastle are aiming to achieve the efficient use of
 
non-renewable resources, including the sustainable management of 
waste. We will seek to contribute to climate change mitigation and the reduction of carbon emissions by applying the waste hierarchy of prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery and safe disposal. Waste will be addressed as a resource to be recycled or reused where possible, and disposed of as the last resort. Figure 13.2 indicates the distribution of existing waste management sites in Gateshead and Newcastle, comprising a range of recycling, transfer, treatment and composting facilities. There is also significant existing landfill capacity associated with the restoration of current and former mineral extraction sites at Path Head, Blaydon and Crawcrook Quarries in Gateshead.

national and other guidance, and based on our evidence on current and lik
ely future waste arisings set against the capacity of existing facilities 
across and in close proximity to Gateshead and Newcastle.
Policy CS21 WasteSolutions and proposals which allow waste to be managed sustainably and which encourage the waste hierarchy of prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery and only then safe disposal will be encouraged. This will be achieved by:
 1.  Proposals for waste management facilities being assessed in re
gard to 
the achievement of the following locational criteria:
  i. On-site management of waste;
  ii. Expansion of existing waste management facilities;
  iii. Co-location of waste facilities;
  iv. Provision within appropriate Employment Areas; and
  v. The re-use of previously-developed land.
 2.  Development associated with waste not having an adverse impact on the en
vironment and human health.
 3.  Development that would result in the loss of waste management
 
facilities being supported only where it is demonstrated that there no longer is a need for the facility or where the capacity can be met elsewhere.
13.20
  Gateshead and Newcastle, along with other waste planning authorities in the region, commis
sioned a study on waste to inform the preparation of 
Local Plans (Model of Waste Arisings and Management Capacity Report, 2012
48). The report includes a forecast of waste arisings to 2030, taking 
into account economic conditions, respective growth strategies and targets for recycling, recovery and diversion of waste. It also includes an assessment of the capacity of existing and planned waste facilities, from which any resulting shortfall in provision during the plan period can be identified and planned for. The report’s main conclusions are set out in Appendix 4, which include forecasted arisings and capacity to 2030.
13.21
  In order to establish the adequacy of local capacity for the plan period the study considered four sc
enarios:
   Scenario 1:     Local Authority Contract Waste Recycling Tar
gets 47% recycling by 2015, 50% by 
2020
   Scenario 2:     As Scenario 1, plus commercial and industrial recycling 60% by 2025
   Scenario 3:     As Scenario 1, plus commercial and industrial recycling 70% by 2025
   Scenario 4:     As Scenario 1, plus commercial and industrial landfill diversion at 75% by 2020
117Minerals and Waste            Section 313.22   The study confirms that there is sufficient capacity to 2030 across both 
the region and Gateshead and Ne
wcastle, to manage and treat the 
residual waste arising. This takes into account targets for population and economic growth and is based on the assumption that diversion from landfill rates will continue to increase. While Appendix 4 highlights a shortfall in landfill capacity by 2030, the capacities in other forms of treatment facility are sufficient to fill the gap. In addition, new technologies are likely to arise and additional facilities provided during the plan period as a result of policy and legislative changes. Any shortfall in residual waste capacity is therefore only likely to occur post 2030.
13.23
  Landfill activity will continue at both the Blaydon and Path Head landfill sites in Gateshead until their completion within the plan period. The Path Head site has a pr
ojected completion date of 2017, after which 
waste disposal is likely to shift to the Ellington Road site in Ashington, Northumberland, which has a planning permission end date of 2039.
13.24
  Should additional landfill capacity be required within the plan period the priority will be Crawcrook Quarry in the w
estern part of Gateshead, 
where mineral extraction and landfill have taken place over a number of years, and where there is significant remaining unpermitted capacity. There is a need for this site to be restored, to ensure it is returned to the most appropriate and beneficial after use, and these requirements, along with the status of the site, will be addressed in subsequent LDD’s.
 13.25
  Municipal waste is waste collected by the local authority and consists primarily of household, bulky and some commercial waste
. Local 
authorities have a statutory responsibility to manage the collection and disposal of this waste within EU and national regulations. As part of this obligation, both Gateshead and Newcastle are committed to reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill and to managing waste more sustainably through their Municipal Waste Management Strategies.
13.26
  Gateshead, as part of the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partner
ship49, is aiming to increase recycling and composting of 
household waste to 45% by 2015 and 50% by 2020, and to achieve a minimum 75% recovery rate for residual waste by 2020. The Partnership has secured a contract covering the period 2014-2038 for its residual municipal waste to be managed by SITA, primarily through a new Energy from Waste Facility in Teesside.
13.27
  This regional facility is capable of exporting 18.84MW electricity to the national grid and configur
ed to enable the future delivery of 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP). For Gateshead, the facility will treat approximately 57,000 tonnes per annum of residual waste during the plan period, including food waste. This is supported by Gateshead’s waste transfer facility, which includes a Visitor and Education Centre, at Campground near Springwell, and the household waste and recycling centres at Cowen Road in Blaydon. The operation of these facilities will ensure that most waste capable of being recycled is separated out.
118Minerals and Waste13.28   In parallel, Newcastle City Council has set out targets for the r ecycling 
and composting 55% of household waste by 2020, and for at least 75% 
recovery of municipal waste by 2020. Collected recyclables (blue bins) are being processed by a private contractor at their Wallsend facility under a joint contractual agreement with North Tyneside. For municipal waste, the Council has secured a contract covering the period from 2013 - 2024 for the management of its Byker plant and the residual waste. Fuel from waste will be disposed of by the contractor, SITA, either processed at their Energy from Waste facility in Teesside or sold-on. The contract ensures that up to 80% of the expected 158,000 tonnes of municipal waste arisings will be diverted from landfill.
13.29
  Based on our evidence and given the current arrangements, it is anticipated that no additional sites to manag
e municipal waste will be 
required during the plan period, subject to, for Newcastle, the successful negotiation of a contract to ensure appropriate waste management post 2024. 
13.30
  Commercial and industrial waste arises from a number of sectors, including retail, administr
ation, manufacturing and transport, for 
example. The 2012 arisings and capacity report utilises data from a national survey of businesses in 2009, supplemented by a commission from the North East Sustainable Resources Board to increase the sample rate in the North East region and to allow for more robust estimates and forecasts of waste arisings to 2030. The report shows that in 2011 commercial and industrial waste arisings for the region and for Gateshead and Newcastle were 2.15 and 0.45 million tonnes respectively, dropping to 1.96 and 0.44 million tonnes by 2030
48. This 
fall is explained in part by changing economic conditions, including a forecast decline in employment in the industrial sector. As explained above, there should be sufficient capacity to manage this waste assuming a continuing increase in landfill diversion and recycling and recovery rates.
13.31
  Hazardous waste is a sub-category of other waste streams, and can include clinical waste
. The identified capacity of hazardous waste landfill 
and treatment facilities of 40,000 tonnes per year48, together with a 
significant waste transfer capacity, ensures that the estimates of arisings within Gateshead and Newcastle of 22,000 tonnes
48 per annum can 
be managed. The report further identifies that the region as a whole has considerable capacity for the treatment and disposal of hazardous waste, totalling 892,000 tonnes
48, set against regional arisings of 
approximately 157,000 tonnes.
13.32   Construction and demolition waste is difficult to measure as significant quantities are recycled on-site, do not enter the monitor
ed waste 
streams or are processed at exempt facilities. This waste stream includes inert materials such as soils and rubble.
119Minerals and Waste            Section 313.33   A small proportion of low level radioactive waste is g enerated 
comprising largely paper, plastics and scrap metal items that have been 
used in hospitals and research establishments, for example. The draft report on the Production and Disposal of Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLW and VLLW) in the North East of England (2013)
59 confirms the 
sources and management routes for such wastes, which are currently exported to facilities in other regions which are likely to have capacity until at least 2029. Proposals for dedicated facilities to manage this waste stream will be assessed in accordance with Local Plan policies.
13.34
  In relation to organic waste, which includes vegetation and food waste
, 
the report identifies sufficient capacity overall, including 100,000 tonnes of windrow composting capacity in Gateshead and Newcastle
47. 
While there is a potential shortfall in anaerobic digestion capacity to process and treat food waste, there is surplus capacity in County Durham. The municipal element of food waste will be treated through the Council’s own contracts.
13.35
  Proposals for waste management facilities will be encouraged in
 
accordance with the criteria set out in national policy, including Green Belt, policy CS21 above, and other Local Plan policies. Our evidence gathering included a search for potentially suitable sites and areas to host strategic waste management facilities. This was carried out through the municipal waste project in Gateshead and an Interim Waste Site Appraisal in Newcastle. Existing waste management facilities at Blaydon, Benwell, Byker and Felling will continue to be the preferred locations for this type of activity.
13.36
  The development of waste management facilities within the rural area
 
may also be appropriate, including for example composting facilities, the reclamation of former mineral sites through landfill, or other provision which allows waste to be dealt with locally. There exists capacity elsewhere in Tyneside and the wider region that could assist with catering for Newcastle and Gateshead’s commercial and industrial and municipal solid waste (MSW) arisings. Strategic scale known waste management facilities include the existing facility at Monument Park in Sunderland, which has capacity to treat 280,000 tonnes
47 of MSW per 
annum.
13.37   It is essential that sufficient waste management capacity is retained throughout the plan period. Policy CS21 includes a pro
vision to 
safeguard waste facilities, including our key municipal facilities referred to above. Proposals for alternative uses on these sites will not be supported, unless justification can be provided that the proposal will not result in a deficiency in provision for the plan period.
13.38
  The monitoring of waste management capacity and the achievement of related tar
gets will be carried out regularly through both authorities’ 
respective Annual Monitoring Reports. This is to ensure that the plan area has access to adequate waste management facilities to cater for waste arisings throughout the plan period. Where appropriate specific designations and allocations for waste, and more detailed policy criteria for assessing proposals, will be included in subsequent LDD’s.

This Section outlines the policies for the Urban Core, recognising the role of the 
area for delivering economic growth for Gateshead and Newcastle.
Chapter 14 Urban Core            Section 4Section 4  Urban Core PoliciesUrban Core Policies        14.1   This section of the Plan is concerned specifically with the Urban 
Core (Figure 14.1). The Urban C
ore is the focal point of the Tyneside 
conurbation. It stretches approximately 3.6km from the north to the south, extending from Newcastle’s Town Moor to Gateshead’s Durham Road, and from 4km from west to east, extending from the edge of Elswick in Newcastle, and the Redheugh Bridge on the Gateshead side, to Ouseburn and Gateshead Quays. The total area covered by the Urban Core is over 6 square kilometres.
14.2
  Policies CS1 and CS2 set out that the Urban Core will be the priority location for major development. The ar
ea is the regional focus and the 
most sustainable location in the wider North East area. Full advantage needs to be taken of this not only to grow the local economy, but also to stimulate growth of the wider regional economy.

we have established a good reputation for cultural-led regeneration. 
There is still significant growth potential in the Urban Core and the Plan sets the framework within which we want to see this realised. Major development here will reinforce its continued success by bringing new businesses, particularly in science, retail, digital, creative and tourism sectors to the area.
14.4
  We are planning for significant change by 2030, including the extension o
f Newcastle’s Primary Shopping Area into the East Pilgrim Street area, 
a new and revitalised centre for Gateshead, science and research led development at Science Central, major office development at Baltic Business Quarter and a new residential area in Gateshead at the Southern Gateway.
14.5
  Given its importance as a driver for our economic gro
wth, this section of 
the Plan contains a number of policies specific to the Urban Core which by their very nature are more detailed than those presented earlier in the Plan. These policies are important for delivering our vision for the Urban Core to be a prosperous and sustainable place. This section of the Plan sets out Urban Core specific policies for:
  •  offices and business development, new retail (A1), leisur
e, culture 
and tourism 
  • homes
  •  pedestrian routes, cycling, public transport, freight and servicing, g
eneral traffic, car parking, gateways and arrival points
   •  urban design, views, heritage, urban green infrastructure, public
 
realm and public art
14.6   These are further supported by Chapters 16 and 17 which contain the Sub-Area specific policies and land allocations policies including those
 
for Gateshead’s and Newcastle’s Key Sites.
14.7   The Newcastle Central Sub-Area is the regional f
ocus for retail, 
commercial and leisure uses. The historic cityscape reflects development over the past centuries: from remnants of the city walls and the Black Gate, to Blackfriars, to churches and cathedrals and Victorian rail infrastructure. There is also a high density of Georgian buildings within Grainger Town, 20th century additions when ambitions were for a Brasilia of the North and most recently new modern architecture such as the City Library. In this Sub-Area the main focus of development activity will be on the expansion of the Primary Shopping Area through the development of a major new retail scheme in the north of the East Pilgrim Street Key Site. The rest of the East Pilgrim Street area will be developed predominantly for a mix of commercial and residential uses. New bus facilities are proposed to serve buses travelling to the east and south of the City reducing through traffic. The improvement of the arrival experience at Central Station, together with wayfinding and public realm initiatives, are important in this Sub-Area. Primary and Secondary Pedestrian Routes will be enhanced making the area more accessible and connecting Central Station to the surrounding area.
123Urban Core            Section 414.8   The Civic Sub-Area wraps around the northern edge of the Urban Core  
and contains major institutions which are vital to the region’s prosperity. 
The Sub-Area includes two universities, the Royal Victoria Infirmary and the Science Central Key Site. Science Central is the focus for future development in this Sub-Area and will be predominantly developed for knowledge based industries associated with the universities, learning and research together with a range of supporting uses. These uses include new University science and research facilities, businesses and homes for students and families. Within this Sub-Area there are historic townscapes which provide distinctive, high quality housing areas and there will be opportunities to further improve these areas.
14.9
  The Discovery Sub-Area is characterised by major dev
elopment sites 
which provide opportunity for western expansion of the Urban Core. The Discovery Sub-Area is a transition area between the City Centre and the residential areas of the west end. The major driver for change in this area is to the south of Central Station which contains the Stephenson Quarter Key Site. The site has south facing slopes, Tyne views, industrial heritage, is next to Central Station and has the potential for office led mixed-use. In this Sub-Area the Forth Yards Development Opportunity site in the west will be unlocked by improving access across major highways and rail infrastructure, integrating the area into the Urban Core. Work has already started on both the transformation of the area around Central Station and the first phase of Stephenson Quarter. The continued development of Newcastle College’s campus will be supported and the important gateway to the Urban Core improved through future development of the Forth Yards area. The Summerhill area is one of our high-quality historic residential areas and the environment will be maintained and improved.
14.10
  The Quayside and Ouseburn Sub-Area contains distinctive vibrant areas defined b
y their historic legacies, topography and riverside location. 
The Quayside is one of the most recognisable locations in the UK and is a major attractor for culture, living and as a business location. Over the last decade the Ouseburn has been transformed into a creative, cultural urban village which now also has major attractions such as Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children’s Books and creative business clusters. Both are popular leisure and tourism destinations which attract a wide range of visitors and we will promote the Quayside and Ouseburn as places to live, work and visit.
14.11
  The Gateshead Central Sub-Area extends from Reg
ent Street/Charles 
Street north to Askew Road and from Prince Consort Road east to the railway line. It will be the focus of considerable change. The redeveloped Trinity Square shopping centre provides new shops, student accommodation, cinema and health care facilities as well as new streets and a public square. This area forms a new heart for Gateshead Central and provides the catalyst for further retail and leisure led regeneration in the immediate area. A network of high quality green and pedestrian friendly spaces and streets will complement the new retail offer. Improved connections from Gateshead Interchange, a major arrival point; through to Trinity Square and adjacent Sub-Areas including the Quays will be vital to attracting visitors to the Centre. The new retail and leisure offer and environmental improvements will attract new and existing residents to the Centre and will draw visitors from neighbouring Sub-Areas.
124Urban Core14.12   The Southern Gateway Sub-Area, the most southerly edge of the 
Urban Core
, wraps round Gateshead Centre to the west and south, 
extending east to the A184. It marks the transition from the residential neighbourhoods of Gateshead into its shopping and commercial centre. This area provides a major opportunity to provide a wider housing offer for the Urban Core. A new residential neighbourhood, the Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site will provide homes that are attractive to families. We will remove the elevated highway and create a tree lined boulevard that reconnects this area to Gateshead’s Centre and its office and leisure area at the Quayside and Quays. A green infrastructure network will be created throughout the Sub-Area, providing safe, usable and accessible green spaces and routes, connecting this area to the surrounding areas and River Tyne.
14.13
  The Quays and Baltic Sub-Area is at the heart of Urban Core and offers
 
a great opportunity for large-scale redevelopment. At the Quays we will continue to expand the commercial and cultural quarter. We have ambitions for a conference venue to complement the space already available at the Sage Gateshead and the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art which will be the catalyst for further redevelopment of the area. Development of the site will also provide the opportunity to create essential links between Gateshead Centre and the river-front through improved pedestrian, cycle and vehicle connectivity via a network of public spaces and routes. To the south east of the Quays, the Baltic Business Quarter is Gateshead’s premier office location and development is already underway. The site will be prioritised for office accommodation with hotel and ancillary retail uses although it could support a range of complementary leisure, education, tourism and sport uses. Improved links from the Baltic to the Exemplar Neighbourhood will provide people with the opportunity to live and work in the Urban Core.
Policies for the economy in the Urban Core
14.14
  This section of the Plan contains policies for activities which are the 
main drivers o
f our economy: offices and business, retail, and leisure, 
culture and tourism. The Urban Core is highlighted as the main focus for such activity and there are major benefits in promoting a critical mass of such uses here. The Urban Core is the most accessible place for business, shopping and entertainment.
14.15
  The majority of office development will be promoted in the Urban Cor
e 
and it is anticipated that approximately 75% of office needs will be met within the area.
125Urban Core            Section 4Policy UC1 Offices and Business Development 
Office and business development (B1a and b of the Use Classes Order) will be promoted. This will be achieved by: 
 1. Provision of at least 380,000 square metres (gross internal ar
ea) of new  
  office space.
 2.  Prioritising large scale office development in the follo
wing allocated 
mixed-use sites:
  i. East Pilgrim Street 
  ii. Gateshead Quays 
  iii. Baltic Business Quarter 
  iv. Stephenson Quarter

Central and Stephenson Quarter ar
e identified (Figure 14.2) as the main 
focus for offices and business development. These locations provide the greatest opportunity to enhance the portfolio of employment premises by providing a range of employment and economic development opportunities.
14.17
   East Pilgrim Street and Gateshead Quays will be mixed-use areas with a strong office c
omponent. East Pilgrim Street will have a retail focus while 
Gateshead Quays could support a new conference venue.
14.18   Baltic Business Quarter and Stephenson Quarter will be office led mixed-use areas. Baltic Business Quarter has potential to bec
ome a 
high quality office park that can quickly respond to changing economic circumstances, capable of providing large office floorplates, small office suites for SMEs or provide for a large single user. The focus for Stephenson Quarter is very much high density Grade A city centre office accommodation.
 14.19
  Science Central is prioritised for science and research led uses including
 
offices supported by a mix of uses including residential and higher education.
14.20
  The five priority locations offer the greatest opportunity for large
 
scale mixed-use schemes and together with some smaller sites will provide at least 380,000 square metres (GIA) of office space. Ancillary complimentary mixed-use development (A1, A2, A3, A4, C1, C2, C4, D1 and D2 of the Use Classes Order) will also be encouraged to provide active and vibrant frontages as well as a suitable proportion of housing (C2 and C3 of the Use Classes Order). These are large sites and will take time to complete but they are our priorities which may be developed, if necessary, beyond the plan period.
14.21
  A clear co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to the planning o
f development on these sites is required to ensure that these 
largely mixed-use schemes deliver high quality offices and business developments in attractive environments. These sites will all need to be supported by a mix of facilities and services.
14.22
  Funding from our ADZ is targeted to the delivery of these dev
elopment 
areas and will help provide infrastructure and stimulate early delivery of office accommodation on some of our Key Sites. While it should be noted that these five identified sites are the focus and priority for office and business development, other sites will be considered on their individual merits.
14.23
  The support of entrepreneurship and business start ups is an important component o
f securing sustainable economic growth. We will continue 
to promote SMEs through the provision of managed workspace and small office units, including business incubators and move-on accommodation across the Urban Core.
14.24
  There is potential for major growth to improve the r
ange of retail space 
in Newcastle’s Retail Centre and also for enhancement of Gateshead’s Primary Shopping Area.
127Urban Core            Section 4Policy UC2 New Retail (A1) in Newcastle and Gateshead 
Major new retail (Class A1) development will be in the designated Primary Shopping Areas and at East Pilgrim Street northern area (Figure 14.3) and will improve the quality, quantity and range of comparison and convenience shops. This will be achieved by:
 1.  Maintaining and enhancing Newcastle Retail Centre’s position as the r
egional retail centre through the protection of the Primary Shopping 
Area and through future development in the East Pilgrim Street northern area. Retail development in the Primary Shopping Area and at East Pilgrim Street will provide at least 50,000 square metres additional gross  retail (A1) floorspace. For East Pilgrim Street this is subject to proposals having no significant adverse impact on the Primary Shopping Area. 
 2.  Redefining and revitalising Gateshead’s Primary Shopping Area through r
etail-led mixed-use development, focused on Trinity Square, including 
the provision of further floorspace.

Primary Shopping Area
Northern Area of East Pilgrim Street
14.25   There are approximately 37 million visits to intu Eldon Square every  
year50.  The retail core is compact and performance is strong but when 
compared with other UK regional centres there is scope to improve.  
Newcastle Retail Centre is defined as the Primary Shopping Area and the northern area of East Pilgrim Street (see figure 14.3 and Policy NC2).  The northern area of East Pilgrim Street Key Site (Policy NC2), once developed for primary retail uses, will form part of an extended Primary Shopping Area through a review of the Plan. The retail function of Newcastle’s Retail Centre will be protected and enhanced as the sequentially preferable location for not only retail uses but leisure and other uses as retail development takes place.  For proposals at East Pilgrim Street northern area, assessment of impact will be required which is proportionate to the scale and type of retail development proposed, in order to consider the impacts of the scheme proposal(s) at the time of submission on the Primary Shopping Area.
14.26
  Newcastle is one of eight Core Cities in England. Five of the eight ar
e 
in the top ten of shopping venues as determined by Venuescore24. 
Newcastle was ranked 11th in 2013 maintaining its position from 2011 but down from 10th in 2009. Recent schemes at Eldon Square and Monument Mall have attracted new retailers and the performance of the centre has improved but further retail growth is needed to strengthen the role of the centre and diversify the range of shops.
14.27
  Newcastle has consistently been identified for future growth and the
 
latest 2012 Strategic Comparison Goods Retail Capacity Study has identified capacity for at least 50,000 square metres additional gross retail floorspace by 2018/19 with further capacity being identified by 2030. This study was completed in an economic recession. Further studies will be carried out over the plan period and it is likely that additional capacity will be identified as market conditions improve. 
14.28
  Gateshead Centre serves the surrounding residential areas and has r
ecently benefitted from a major redevelopment at Trinity Square. 
Gateshead Primary Shopping Area still has scope for significant improvement. This includes the need for investment in the range and quality of retail accommodation, refocusing the retail area and improvement of the wider shopping environment. The delivery of these improvements will attract additional retailers to the centre, and will better cater for the needs of workers, visitors and residents during the day and into the evening. 
14.29
  Trinity Square is the focus for redevelopment in the short
-term (Policy 
GC1). The redefined Primary Shopping Area is shown in Figure 14.3. In addition to the redeveloped Trinity Square which provides new retail units and a new foodstore, a requirement for additional retail floorspace by 2030 is currently forecast. For Gateshead, High Street (South) is prioritised in terms of a sequential approach to accommodate a large floor area, which cannot be accommodated within the identified Primary Shopping Area. This area benefits from a high level of accessibility and strong links with the Primary Shopping Area.
129Urban Core            Section 414.30   In addition to the Primary Shopping Areas and at East Pilgrim Street, 
there are a number of opportunities for small-scale r
etail on our 
Key Sites and Development Opportunity Areas. Retail will need to be complementary to uses and could include niche retailing and convenience outlets as a component of mixed-use sites or to meet people’s everyday need for food provision within walking distance of their homes.
14.31
  In recent years the range of leisur
e, culture and tourism uses has 
expanded drawing more visitors to the area. Major attractions such as the Sage Gateshead, Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, the Centre for Life, the Great North Museum and St. James’ Park have played a vital role in increasing our attractiveness. Pedestrian routes along the River Tyne have been extended and the river banks are an important attraction. Events at the riverside have grown in importance and are major attractions including the City Games and the Evolution Music Festival which have brought and continue to bring thousands of visitors to the Urban Core.
Policy UC3 Leisure, Culture and Tourism Development which enhances and diversifies leisure, culture and tourism will be achieved by:
 1.  Extending the offer across the daytime and night time to a broader range
 
of visitors through: 
  i. Business visitor uses and conference facilities,
  ii. Family-friendly visitor attractions, and
  iii. The provision of a range of hotels.
 2.  Supporting proposals to improve the appearance, use and ac
cessibility 
of attractions including:
  i.  Creating a riverside leisure route along the River Tyne fr
om the Swing 
Bridge to the Gateshead Millennium Bridge,
  ii.  Relocating Keelman’s Way to follow the river’s edg
e, providing 
pedestrian access to Gateshead Quays between the Swing Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.
14.32
  Visitors are attracted to the Urban Core from the re
gion, UK and beyond. 
We have a diverse range of attractions including modern museums, theatres, historic areas, music and nightlife venues and sporting facilities. Our historic assets are particularly attractive and we have a rich historic and cultural legacy including the iconic riverfront area and a wealth of historic buildings, streets and spaces together with archaeological remains. Heritage led and cultural led regeneration and investment within Gateshead and Newcastle has made a huge contribution to the area. 
14.33
  Heritage led regeneration in Grainger T
own has already extended our 
variety of leisure, culture and tourism uses and we will seek to maintain the momentum of regeneration and promote a range of uses here. Further diversification of these uses will be promoted to increase the number of visitors into the Urban Core providing they do not have an adverse impact on surrounding uses.
130Urban Core14.34   There are key sectors which will be the focus for our futur e expansion. 
At Newcastle Quayside and the Ouseburn we will be promoting family 
friendly uses, diversifying facilities and promoting the use of the river. In the Ouseburn a vibrant daytime and evening economy has developed and we will seek to promote further similar attractions. At Gateshead Quays business tourism uses including conference facilities will be promoted, complemented by a range of family-friendly uses. Hotels will also be promoted to increase the choice and range of provision.
14.35
  The Quayside and Quays are iconic waterfronts which contain many tourist attractions and the completion o
f a riverside loop walking circuit 
and improved pedestrian access along the river has potential to improve the visitor experience. Building on the success of Newcastle’s Quayside, the route will extend public access along Gateshead Quays and activity on and along the riverside will help animate the area.
Policies for homes in the Urban Core
14.36
  The Urban Core is already home to approximately 23,000 people21 , and 
has the potential to grow over the plan period by providing a range of 
housing choices to meet market demands. The Urban Core provides a range of homes in a variety of forms including apartments above shops in Grainger Town and in converted buildings, together with student housing and a large amount of social housing (there are also some neighbourhoods, such as Summerhill and Windmill Hills). There are many sites and vacant properties which have great potential for a variety of residential development over the plan period.
Policy UC4 Homes A range of size, types and tenure of housing will be promoted to diversify the housing offer through:
 1. Development of approximately 3750 new homes. 
 2.  Allocating the Exemplar Neighbourhood in the Southern Gateway Sub-Area for approximately 1000 new homes pr
edominantly for families.
 3.  Allocating mixed-use sites which will include homes in the following Sub-Areas:
  i. Newcastle Central,
  ii. Civic,
  iii. Discovery,
  iv. Gateshead Central,
  v. Quays and Baltic, and
  vi. Southern Gateway.
 4.  Promoting residential development as part of mixed-use schemes in the Quayside and Ouseburn Sub-Ar
ea.
 5.  Supporting conversions and redevelopment o
f upper floors for homes.
131Urban Core            Section 414.37   Housing has an important role in ensuring activity and vibrancy and 
in stimulating and supporting the evening and weekend ec
onomies. 
Housing in the Urban Core benefits from its proximity to leisure, shopping and employment opportunities.
14.38
  Policy CS2 identifies the Urban Core as a key area for gr
owth and 
provision of approximately 3,750 new homes in the Urban Core by 2030. These will support sustainable economic growth ambitions, accommodate increases in population, and attract and retain economically active residents.
14.39
  In addition to promoting apartments, we will diversify housing in the Urban Core b
y developing family housing, predominantly in the 
Southern Gateway Sub-Area. The Exemplar Neighbourhood will be developed with at least 60% of properties being 3 and 4 bedroom family homes. Science Central will also provide a range of housing alongside science-led mixed uses.
14.40
  In many areas new housing development will be part of a mix of uses. In the K
ey Sites and large mixed-use sites residential use will be promoted 
in order to meet our Urban Core housing needs.  
14.41   The re-use of properties for housing throughout the Urban Core
 
including upper floors in historic buildings will be promoted, bringing empty floorspace back into use. In Grainger Town there are many successful housing schemes which provide a range of both social and private housing and further conversions will bring much needed activity to upper floors.
14.42
  The large student population makes a vital contribution to the local economy and vibrancy o
f the Urban Core and many students also live in 
the area. We will continue to support purpose built student housing in suitable and accessible locations supported by access to local services and in line with Policies CS9 and CS11.
Policies for transport in the Urban Core 
14.43
  The Plan provides for significant changes in order to improv
e movement 
into and around the Urban Core. While many of these changes will 
be the responsibility of the Local Authorities and their partners, new development will also be expected to contribute to these improvements.
14.44
  This section of the Plan sets out what changes we propose to make to the Urban Cor
e to improve the environment and increase the priority 
given to pedestrians and cyclists and manage vehicular movements to, within and around the Urban Core.
14.45
  The Urban Core is compact, which makes walking and cycling attractive
. 
We have excellent public transport links and facilities are used by large numbers of people every day travelling into the Urban Core. The challenge is to develop and manage streets and places to cater for growth while creating a vibrant modern centre with an attractive environment.
132Urban Core14.46   The policies reflect the needs and characteristics of the dense, busy 
heart of the c
onurbation. Policies will
  • Promote an age friendly place ensuring accessibility for all,
  •  Focus on conditions for pedestrians and cyclists making the environment mor
e attractive and safer, with clearly defined routes 
to provide easy interchange between modes,
  •  Support and in some cases re-organise priorities so that buses bring people into and distribute them around the Urban Core mor
e efficiently,
  •  Manage vehicular traffic to minimise its impacts while maintaining the vibrancy of the Urban Cor
e, and
  •  Make arrival points and gateways more attractive and better connected.
14.47
   Walking as the most sustainable mode of travel will be encourag
ed 
and developed through increased pedestrian priority, improved public spaces, seating, accessible pedestrian crossings, footways, legibility and signage: all making the Urban Core easy to get around, adding vitality, and encouraging visitors to spend more time in the area.
14.48
   The streets in the Urban Core vary in character and the pedestrian environment must r
eflect its surroundings and be relevant to its use. 
Assessment of movement patterns has led to the identification of Primary Pedestrian Routes and Secondary Pedestrian Routes.
133Urban Core            Section 4
Policy UC5 Primary and Secondary Pedestrian Routes 
Sustainable modes of travel will be promoted by giving priority where 
appropriate to pedestrian links and facilities to ensure an attractive, safe and better linked area. The routes identified below will be the focus for improvement over the plan period. 
 1. The Primary Pedestrian Routes (Figure 14.4) are designated as:
   i. Barras Bridge to Central Station, 
   ii. The Monument to the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, 
   iii. Pilgrim Street to Gallowgate, 
   iv. Gateshead Primary Shopping Area to Gateshead Quays, 
   v. Gateshead Interchange to Gateshead College, 
   vi. Through East Pilgrim Street Key Site, 
   vii. Newcastle Central Station to the Science Central K

   viii. Central Station to High Level Bridge, 
   ix. Central Station to Stephenson Quarter Key Site, 
   x. Central Station to Newcastle College

   xi. The Bigg Market to Gateshead Centre, 
   xii.  Linking Gateshead Primary Shopping Area and the Exemplar Neighbourhood,
   xiii. Linking Gateshead College to the Exemplar Neighbourhood,
   xiv. Northumberland Road, and
   xv. Along the River Tyne in Gateshead.
 2. The Secondary Pedestrian Routes (Figure 14.4) are designated as:
   i.  Science Central to Newcastle University and the RVI via Str
awberry

by providing direct routes to and through the f
ollowing sites and links to 
surrounding areas:
   i. The Science Central Key Site, 
   ii. The East Pilgrim Street Key Site,
   iii. The Gateshead Quays Key Site,
   iv. The Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site, and 
   v. The Baltic Business Quarter. 136Urban Core14.49   The Primary Pedestrian Routes link the main transport hubs, the 
Key Sites and major attractor
s. The character of the network differs 
between Newcastle and Gateshead. In Newcastle the majority of the network follows established routes whereas in Gateshead many of the pedestrian routes will be established when new developments come forward. In Newcastle they typically support pedestrian flows over 1,000 pedestrians per hour
52 at peak times and at the Haymarket there are 
over 2,000 pedestrians per hour at peak times. In Gateshead, pedestrian flows are lower.
14.50
  The Primary Pedestrian Routes will be a focal point for public realm inv
estment. Over the plan period we will seek to upgrade the network 
of routes to a minimum footway width of 3 metres where possible. New development will be expected to contribute to this.
14.51
  Secondary Pedestrian Routes experience lower pedestrian mo
vements 
than the Primary Pedestrian Routes but provide key connections and permeability through the Urban Core. Opportunities to improve the Secondary Routes will be considered as development sites come forward. Over the plan period we will seek to upgrade Secondary Routes to a minimum footway width of 2 metres where possible.
14.52
  Development of the Key Sites and the Baltic Business Quarter will be e
xpected to provide pedestrian routes through the site and link into the 
existing routes.
 14.53
  Over 170039 people cycle into the Urban Core each day and this Plan 
seeks to increase the number of trips by creating a network of cycling routes across the Urban Core. This is reflected by the policies and targets of both Councils’ cycling strategies and recent investment. Improvements will support existing coverage, such as Hadrian’s Cycleway which forms part of the National Cycle Network, creating safe, clearly signed routes that are supported by accessible cycle parking and facilities.
Policy UC6 Cycling Sustainable modes of travel will be promoted giving priority where appropriate to cycling. Cycle infrastructure will be developed by promoting cycle improvements and links to the surrounding area. This will be achieved by:
 1. Completion of the Great North Cycleway,
 2. Improving links to the Newcastle Strategic Network,
 3.  The improvement of cycle routes and cycling priority inside the Urban
 
Core Distributor Route (UCDR), and
 4.  Development at Science Central, East Pilgrim Street, Forth Y
ards and The 
Quays connecting to the surrounding cycle network.137Urban Core            Section 4

Gateshead over the past few years, and in Newcastle there will be 
schemes which continue to enhance cycling infrastructure. There are further proposals for route improvements (Figure 14.5) and the policy promotes cycling in accordance with both Councils’ Cycling Strategies.
14.55
  It is expected that there will be a considerable increase in cycling ov
er 
the next few years and many routes will be in place. The Councils will improve conditions for cyclists through alterations to general traffic movement as outlined in Policy UC9. Vehicle speeds will be reduced and the volume of traffic minimised within the area bounded by the Urban Core Distributor Route (UCDR). This will encourage cycling as there will be greater priority and a more attractive environment for cyclists.
14.56
  The Great North Cycleway (GNC) is a nationally designated cycle route which will e
ventually run from Darlington to Blyth through Durham, 
Gateshead and Newcastle via the Tyne Bridge, Pilgrim Street and John Dobson Street to the Civic Centre and then further north. The route will bring visitors into Gateshead and Newcastle and link the new student accommodation in Gateshead to the universities. Improvements will be carried out in conjunction with wider schemes including a cycle lane on John Dobson Street, crossings at the bottom end of Pilgrim Street and at the junction of St Mary’s Place and John Dobson Street.

  The Newcastle Cycling Strategy includes a Strate
gic Cycle Network. This 
includes Strategic Cycle Routes to connect the surrounding areas to the Urban Core. They will be direct links to the Urban Core providing greater cycling priority. Although the majority of the Strategic Cycle Routes are outside the Urban Core all of the routes lead there and many more will be completed over the next ten years. Both routes to the Strategic Cycle Network and the Strategic Cycle Network itself will be developed. Cycle interchanges will be provided at Metro Stations and a central cycle hub is proposed to support network development.
14.58
  In Newcastle improvements inside the UCDR will be made to a number of r
outes that link to main attractors such as the universities and leisure 
facilities or to transport interchanges such as Central Station. New investment in Newcastle, particularly inside the UCDR to improve cycling conditions will be considered, including junction improvements and contraflow arrangements, allowing cyclists to use one-way streets in both directions. In Gateshead a small number of route improvements are identified and the policy focuses on key infrastructure improvements to complement the existing network.
14.59
  Major development will be expected to provide links to the cycle routes
 
including at Science Central, East Pilgrim Street, Stephenson Quarter and Forth Yards.
14.60
  Public transport is a vital element of a modern vibrant city. Approximately 80,000
39 people travel into the Urban Core and over 
24,00039  commute by public transport each day. There are strong links 
to, around and through the Urban Core, and accessibility from across Gateshead and Newcastle is high.139Urban Core            Section 4Policy UC7 Public Transport  
Sustainable modes of travel will be promoted and public transport infrastructur
e 
will be enhanced by:
 1.  Improving stops, facilities, increasing bus priority and creating bus-only 
links including:
  i. Bus facilities at the Bigg Market, and
  ii. Improved bus facilities at Haymarket.
 2.  Providing new bus facilities as part of the comprehensiv
e development 
at:
  i. East Pilgrim Street, and
  ii. Baltic Business Quarter.
 3.  Designating a Bus Loop (Figure 14.6) on Market Street, Durant Road, John Dobson Street, St Mary’s Plac
e, Percy Street, Newgate Street and 
Grainger Street. 
 4.  Development proposals allowing for and contributing to the implementation o
f improved bus infrastructure.
 5. Supporting proposals to deliver Metro re-invigoration.

14.61   Maintaining public transport accessibility will be key in supporting 
the le
vels of development proposed. The challenge will be to improve 
accessibility while managing bus movements to reduce visual impact, manage congestion and improve air quality. This will require a refocusing of bus movements within Newcastle City Centre over time.141Urban Core            Section 414.62   Access to the Urban Core by bus for commuters, shoppers and tourists will 
help reduce car based trips and as a result improve the o
verall experience 
for people in the area. Additional on-street priority will be provided in some locations through the extension of bus lanes and the creation of bus only links. The enforcement of bus lanes and minimising general traffic will contribute to the overall enhancement of bus services. Red Routes will be introduced on major bus routes providing bus priority to improve bus reliability. New bus facilities at Central Station and new bus facilities/interchanges at East Pilgrim Street, Bigg Market and the Baltic Business Quarter will support services by reducing at-stop dwell times and delays.  This will bring benefits for the local environment, users and non-users. The Haymarket facilities will be improved as part of Barras Bridge and Percy Street improvements. This is further explored in the Civic Sub-Area.
14.63
  In Newcastle the intention is to move towards rede
fining bus movements 
within the Urban Core. In the long term, we will refocus routes so that they provide good service around and to the edge of the retail area with less reliance on the routes that cut across. This will be achieved by the formation of a bus loop. This loop will provide single direction working for the majority of its length, although some sections will require two way running to facilitate service loops for terminating services (Figure 14.6).
14.64
  The bus loop must be delivered in conjunction with operators and minimise impacts on journey times f
or established cross city routes. It will 
need to be delivered as part of a package of works and improvements. Development of major schemes will be expected to include elements of the new bus network and/or contributions to its implementation.
14.65
  The Councils will work towards the introduction of Low Emis
sion Routes 
for public transport. Potential routes include John Dobson Street, Blackett Street, Grey Street, Quayside (From Copenhagen House to Horatio Street), South Shore Road and Mill Road. Vehicles within the low emission route will comply with the latest emission standards for transit vehicles.
14.66
  The Quaylink bus service provides a flagship service linking Gateshead Central, Gateshead Quays, Ne
wcastle Quayside and Newcastle City Centre 
and by the end of the plan period we expect to have extended emission restrictions to sections of this route. The intention of this is to improve air quality and maintain the high quality of the vehicles that operate the service.
14.67
  The Metro plays a key role bringing people into the area. Monument is the busiest Metro station in T
yne and Wear with approximately 4 million 
people53 using it per year, followed by Haymarket, Central Station and 
Gateshead Interchange. Proposals for improvement of the network to enhance its operation and make it more attractive to users will be promoted.
14.68
  All premises within the Urban Core require acces
s for deliveries. Freight 
movements add to levels of traffic and congestion within the heart of the conurbation, and space is required within developments or on the highway for loading and unloading. The Councils will manage servicing traffic to limit its impacts upon the environment, promoting more attractive conditions for pedestrians and cyclists and the smooth flow of public transport.142Urban CorePolicy UC8 Freight and Servicing 
To promote sustainable freight movement and minimise the impact on the 
environment and quality of place, major new development in the designated Freight Management Area (Figure 14.7) will be required to provide a Delivery Service Plan. 
Freight Management Area

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].143Urban Core            Section 414.69   The impact of servicing will be minimised through Delivery Service 
Plans. They will be requir
ed for major new developments within the 
Freight Management Area (Figure 14.7) and they will be used to control servicing through measures such as restricting hours for deliveries and requiring the use of more environmentally-friendly delivery vehicles. Together with extension of bus lanes and driver awareness campaigns the impact of freight will be managed moving towards use of low emissions vehicles and electric vehicles. Management of freight will help to meet our objectives by reducing congestion and improving air quality within the Urban Core.
14.70
  Major growth is proposed and will inevitably create trav
el demand. 
However, even with considerable success in pursuing a shift to more sustainable modes, there will still be some traffic travelling to and through the Urban Core. This Plan seeks to balance those traffic demands whilst creating a more efficient and attractive Urban Core environment.
Policy UC9 General Traffic Traffic access in and around the Urban Core will be managed to minimise through traffic and improve the local environment by:
 1.  Focusing traffic onto the designated Urban Core Distributor Route
  (UCDR) (Figure 14.8). This comprises parts of: A189, A167, A184 (Askew
  Road) that links the A189, and the A167, Skinnerburn Road along the
  Close /Quayside, Prince Consort Road, Charles Street, A167 Gateshead
  Highway to Askew Road.
144Urban Core
14.71   Traffic will be managed by focusing the main traffic movements within 
the Urban Core onto defined routes, re-defining the use o
f some streets 
and by minimising traffic flows and speeds. This will significantly enhance the pedestrian and cycling environment within the UCDR.Urban Core Distributor Route
Figure 14.8 General Traffic

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].145Urban Core            Section 414.72   The destination for much of the traffic currently travelling thr ough the 
area is not the Urban Core itself but areas beyond its boundary. Often 
such trips use central streets and contribute to high traffic levels. By directing traffic onto the UCDR (Figure 14.8) there will be a reduction in traffic travelling straight through the heart of the Urban Core. Motorists will be signposted from the UDCR and certain areas of the Urban Core will be accessed from a designated point only, reducing the need for trips through the central areas. We will use the UTMC to reduce traffic speeds and minimise the volume of vehicles. UTMC is an electronic system designed to manage the flow of traffic by making the most effective use of our existing highway network. This will significantly reduce congestion, particularly at peak times.
14.73
  Within and around the area formed by the UCDR we will seek to minimise the volume o
f vehicles. This will be achieved by firstly reducing 
speeds making routes through the Urban Core (as opposed to around it) less attractive. Currently average vehicle speeds across the Urban Core are lower than 30 miles per hour and stretches of the core are advisory 20 miles per hour zones. In order to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists we will seek to reduce speeds to improve safety and encourage modal shift to more sustainable modes for journeys within the Urban Core. Secondly, we will restrict the capacity of some junctions within the Urban Core in favour of sustainable modes. This will be achieved using a combination of public realm improvements and use of UTMC.
14.74
  Fostering behaviour change such as travelling outside peak times, car sharing
, parking on the edge of the Urban Core and switching to modes 
other than the single occupancy car has an important role in reducing through traffic, limiting congestion and improving the environment. In developing solutions for the major redevelopment areas, traffic restraint has been a key element of recent masterplanning.
14.75
  In Newcastle, additional capacity for east/west movements north
 
of the Tyne will be achieved by enhancements to the route along Skinnerburn Road, the Close and the Quayside. This will link the A695 Scotswood Road with the A186 City Road. This route has the potential to accommodate traffic and provide direct connections at the east and west of the UCDR. This will be managed and controlled by our UTMC system. As part of this we expect to enhance traffic signals from Skinnerburn Road, through the Quayside to City Road. Improvements to Skinnerburn Road and traffic light enhancements along the corridor will be carried out in the short term.
14.76
  In Gateshead in the medium term, we will extend the boulevard approach proposed f
or the Gateshead Highway (see Central Gateshead 
Sub-Area) to the section of Askew Road between the High Level and Tyne Bridges. This will retain most of the capacity of the existing link but will also provide a step-change in the local environment and public realm on both sides of the road and re-develop the railway arches on the north side of the road. It is a long term aspiration to reduce the capacity of this section of Askew Road and we will explore options for this over the early part of the plan period. A number of factors will guide options including the potential closure of High Level Bridge to road traffic and the opportunities provided by the potential for additional cross-river capacity to the east and west of the Urban Core. A wider review of traffic movement in the Tyne Bridgeheads area (including the Oakwellgate junction) will be undertaken as part of this process.146Urban Core14.77   In the long term a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) for all transport modes will 
be introduc
ed in Newcastle. This includes the area inside the UCDR. The 
intention of the Zone is to enhance the environmental quality of the area, discourage travel across the Urban Core and unnecessary journeys within the UCDR. This will be supported by Low Emission Routes restricting emissions in Newcastle.
14.78
  A balance will be maintained between an appropriate supply of car parking while encouraging tr
avel by sustainable modes.
Policy UC10 Car ParkingThe location and supply of safe, secure car parking will be managed by:
 1.  Minimising car parking for development reflecting the highly acces
sible 
nature of the location,
 2. Siting car parks close to the UCDR or on the edge of the Urban Core,
 3.  Managing the pricing of new car parks to promote short stay car parking over long stay car parking, and
 4. Restricting the development of temporary car parks. 
14.79   In order to meet accessibility and sustainability objectives and allow ec
onomic growth the location of new commercial car parks will be 
carefully managed. For new development the needs for car parking will be assessed and the minimum for operational needs will be permitted, while promoting shared facilities where appropriate.
14.80
  Any new car parks will be focused in locations either close to UCDR with easy, direct acces
s or on the edge of the Urban Core. Over time surface 
car parks and on street car parking will be more restricted.
14.81   In general, short stay parking will be promoted for shopping and leisure through the manag
ement of pricing in new car parks and longer stay 
parking will be encouraged on the edge of the area. The “Alive After 5” initiative has been a great success in promoting use of car parks outside of peak times and further opportunities will be explored.
14.82
  In the Urban Core there are sites that will not be fully developed in the short term. W
e will resist proposals for temporary car parks on these 
sites unless they are short term and would not prejudice regeneration or development of the sites themselves or the surrounding area. In assessing the suitability of such proposals we will also consider the impact on our ambitions for greater access to the Urban Core via sustainable modes of travel, the impact on pedestrians and cyclists, the quality of place and the local environment.
14.83
  A joint car parking strategy will ensure that all parking policies, strategies and action plans will be dev
eloped on a partnership basis between 
Newcastle and Gateshead and that there is a common approach to car parking provision.147Urban Core            Section 414.84    Gateways are the points where changes in the environment create a  
sense of moving from one distinct area to another. They are transition 
areas where there is a clear change of use and function. There are various indications that the traveller is moving through a gateway including a change in scale, the character of the built form, a change in traffic speed as well as of the environment itself. Arrival points are where there is a change in transport mode, for example changing from Metro to foot. The defined gateways and arrival points are illustrated by Figure 14.9.
Policy UC11 Gateways and Arrival Points To ensure a strong, distinctive entrance and sense of arrival, development will be required to:
 1. Improve and enhance the area in and around the follo
wing gateways:
  i.  Forth Yards, 
  ii.  Westmorland Road, 
  iii. Westgate Road, 
  iv. Barrack Road,

Urban C
ore and development within and around these areas offers great 
opportunity for enhancement. This can be achieved by creating strong urban frontages and providing new high quality landmark buildings for example. Emphasising our gateways and arrival points is important for adding to the sense of arrival to the Urban Core and presenting positive first impressions. The ability to find your way from your arrival point is critical. It should be intuitive and it should be a pleasant and safe experience. In Newcastle the Legible City Project has secured major improvements working closely with the Business Improvement District (NE1) and the universities. Further schemes will be promoted. 
14.86
  Through development opportunities, wayfinding initiatives and public realm impro
vements, the area will become easy to navigate and a safe 
and pleasant place.
Policies for people and place in the Urban Core
14.87   The diverse architecture and landform together with the historic
 
environment contribute to the Urban Core’s distinctive quality of place. 
Development proposals must consider their setting looking beyond boundaries to the wider context. The Urban Core has a strong identity, and is one of the most instantly recognisable places in the country. We will seek to:
  • Maintain local distinctiveness,
  • Increase the range of activities and uses,
  • Improve the design of the built form and public realm,
  • Protect and enhance the historic and natural environments, and
  • Improve the quality of public spaces and routes.
 
14.88   Policies for the improvement of quality of plac
e within the Gateshead 
and Newcastle Urban Core are: Urban Design (Policy UC12), Respecting and Managing Views (Policy UC13), Heritage (Policy UC14), Green Infrastructure (Policy UC15), Public Realm (Policy UC16) and Public Art (Policy UC17).
14.89
  It is important that as the Urban Core continues to develop, buildings, r
outes and spaces work together to support a vibrant social and 
economic centre, delivering high quality design appropriate to its context.
Policy UC12 Urban Design To deliver higher quality locally distinctive places in terms of architecture and public realm, development will:
 1.  Be designed to respect and enhance the positive characteristics and context,
 
 2.  Provide a co-ordinated approach that reinfor
ces and creates linkages to its 
surroundings,
 3.  Provide strong urban frontages and an appropriate urban grain r
einforcing 
continuity and enclosure at a walkable urban block scale,
 4.  Ensure active frontages along Primary and Secondary Pedestrian Routes,
 
and
 5.  Incorporate high quality, durable and sustainable materials appropriate to the character o
f the area and the use envisaged for the site. 150Urban Core14.90    It is important that development proposals respect the positive 
elements of their c
ontext, working with the unique topography and 
landscape, architecture and public realm to create distinctive quality buildings befitting their setting comparable with other major European cities.
14.91
  All development must look holistically at the site, promote high levels of
 
design quality, enhance character, and create as appropriate new urban form. By taking a co-ordinated approach to development there will be opportunities to create strong, continuous frontages, have shared access, shared spaces and provide communal benefits. Buildings and spaces in the Urban Core must contribute to social inclusion and sustainable environments and we expect them to be designed and managed to take into account all users and their accessibility needs.
14.92
  Strong urban frontages together with active uses will contribute to
wards 
lively and diverse urban streets. They should present clearly defined ‘fronts’ and ‘backs’. For example, good shop front design should be visually stimulating and well proportioned in relation to the building and the street.
14.93
  Development will be expected to plan for existing and proposed pedestrian flo
ws around the site and support and enhance these 
through the proposed scale of development. Smaller block sizes and strong visual connections will be sought in areas of high pedestrian flows. Achieving these will deliver a safer and more attractive walkable Urban Core.
14.94
  The legibility of the Urban Core needs to be obvious and instinctive.
 
The network of routes between key destinations must be clear. The Sub-Areas sections set out proposals for how this will be achieved in different areas.
14.95
  To ensure high quality design standards befitting the Urban Core are
 
achieved, residential development will apply the latest national design standards. Residential density, whether it is a wholly residential proposal or part of a mix of uses, will be at a level appropriate to its Urban Core location. High quality materials will be required which reflect the positive features of the surrounding area and reinforce character.
Policy UC13 Respecting and Managing Views Within, From and Into the Urban Core To respect important public views there will be a presumption against development proposals that would cause significant harm. Views that will be respected include those:
 1. From or across or into the Tyne Gorge
,
 2. From defined major movement corridors/
routeways, and
 3.  Of designated heritage assets, other distinctive landmark buildings and structures.151Urban Core            Section 4Movement Corridor / Routeways
Distinctive Landmark Buildings and Structures
Figure 14.10 Respecting and Managing Views within from and into the Urban Core 
© Crown Copyright and database right [2015]. Ordnance Survey [100019569].
© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].152Urban Core14.96   In the Urban Core, important, memorable views form a major part of the  
positive visual experience. In particular, views along the Tyne Gorge, 
from major movement corridors and of major landmark structures (Figure 14.10) and buildings are unique to the Urban Core. These views must be carefully managed to protect the visual experience.
14.97
  Impact on important views into, out of and within the Urban Core must be consider
ed. New development will change views but these changes 
must not cause significant harm. Development will be evaluated to determine the nature and extent of impact and attention will also be given to views that affect designated heritage assets and distinctive landmark structures. Views from or across the Tyne are defined in the Urban Landscape Study of the Tyne Gorge which provides detailed guidance on views which must be protected.
14.98
  The Urban Core has historically been the focus of the most intensive periods of Gateshead and Ne
wcastle’s development. The legacy is 
extensive including buildings and features from Roman, Medieval, 16th and 17th century, Georgian, Victorian and 20th and 21st century periods. The layers of all of these periods can be read clearly over the top of each other. For example the monumental railway bridges which sit literally over the top of the earlier development of the merchants’ houses in Sandhill on the Quayside, and the railway arches which dominate the Bridges Conservation Area, or the route of Hadrian’s Wall which is believed to sit beneath the Norman Castle Keep.
Policy UC14 Heritage To respect the historical legacy, varied character and appearance of the historic environment development will:
 1.  Maximise opportunities to sustain and enhance the significance of heritage assets and their setting,
 
 2.  Deliver high quality in the design of new buildings and conversions
 
reflecting the rich historic fabric, and 
 3.  Include opportunities for the contemporary interpretation of heritage as
sets including Hadrian’s Wall and associated features. 
14.99   The historic environment makes a major contribution to the economic, cultural and visual vibr
ancy of the Urban Core. There are a rich variety 
of assets including: seven Conservation Areas (Newcastle Central, Summerhill, Framlington Place, Leazes, Lower Ouseburn, Bridges and Walker Terrace/Regent Street) numerous listed buildings which are vital to the character of the area and Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site. Development within and adjoining these areas will need to be especially sensitive to their context. 153Urban Core            Section 414.100   Development needs to carefully consider and respond to heritage  
assets, spaces and streets and be of a high standard befitting the 
regional centre. Regeneration within the Urban Core is critical to the delivery of the wider area plan objectives. It should build upon the legacy of successful, award winning schemes such as the Grainger Town Project, the Ouseburn and the Bridges Conservation Area Townscape Heritage Initiative scheme. Integrating historic buildings into urban regeneration is proven to create successful, popular urban quarters with character, where people enjoy living, working and visiting. Contemporary interpretation of heritage assets is important allowing people to understand the history of the area acknowledging and providing links with the past.
14.101
  As sites in the Urban Core are developed, it is important that briefs and
 
masterplans are based upon a sound understanding of the history of the sites and that an early approach is taken to establish any archaeological potential. The re-use of historic buildings will ensure that the quality of the historic environment is maintained and enhanced while preventing buildings from becoming ‘at risk’. 
14.102
  We have identified an Urban Green Infrastructure Network and P
olicy 
UC15 seeks to enhance provision within the area and links to the wider Strategic Green Infrastructure Network.
Policy UC15 Urban Green InfrastructureDevelopment will protect and enhance the Urban Green Infrastructure Network, address gaps and improve linkages to the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network at:
 1. Ouseburn,
 2. Jesmond to Quays,

Infrastructure Network for Gateshead and Newcastle. Although, the 
majority of this falls outside the Urban Core boundary, Leazes Park, Exhibition Park, the Ouseburn and the River Tyne all form part of the network. The Urban Green Infrastructure Network is the fine grained and locally significant element of green infrastructure within the urban area, including existing and proposed links to the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network as shown on Figure 14.11.
14.104
  We will address the gaps in the network which exist due to the densely dev
eloped nature of the Urban Core. The Urban Core contains large 
areas of formal green space including Exhibition Park, Leazes Park, Windmill Hills Park and more informal green spaces in the Ouseburn Valley and Riverside Park. These are supported by smaller green spaces throughout the Urban Core. Together with the Ouseburn Valley and the River Tyne corridor, this provides the base on which to further develop this network.
14.105
  A range of measures will be supported, including  climate change mitigation or adaption measures to addr
ess the gaps in our Green 
Infrastructure Network and to enhance, protect and increase the multifunctionality and biodiversity of green infrastructure in the Urban Core. These include:
  • The creation of new green spaces,
  •  The temporary greening of vacant medium/long term development sites,
  •  Creating or improving connections between green spaces and to
 
the wider Strategic Green Infrastructure Network,
  • Surface water storage and sustainable drainage systems, and
  • Street trees and planting, living roofs and walls.
14.106   In Gateshead there is greater opportunity to provide significant new green infr
astructure. This will be achieved through redevelopment 
proposals and development of a green and sustainable urban landscape which is a fundamental element of the vision for the regeneration of central Gateshead. Green spaces in key locations connected by green routes, alongside the incorporation of green design measures in new development will distinguish central Gateshead from other urban areas, and provide an attractive sustainable and adaptable environment for residents, businesses and visitors.
14.107
  In Newcastle the value of green infrastructure is also highly re
garded, 
although the more limited scope for new green infrastructure provision means that solutions will be smaller in scale and more urban in nature.
14.108
  Further details of projects that will improve the quality of existing spac
es 
and opportunities for the provision of new green infrastructure can be found in the Sub-Areas sections.156Urban Core14.109   An important element of the quality of place in the Urban Core derives 
fr
om the network of linked public open spaces and the routes that 
connect them. The Plan promotes the Urban Core as an area in which walking and cycling are both safe and enjoyable recognising that attractive and economically thriving cities are those that encourage public life and recreation.
Policy UC16 Public Realm The network of public open spaces and routes will be enhanced by:
 1.  Development improving the existing public spaces and creating ne
w 
spaces, 
 2.  The provision of spaces which are flexible and adaptable to a rang
e of 
uses,
 3.  Incorporating high quality, durable and sustainable materials appropriate to the character o
f the area and the use envisaged for the site, and 
 4. The provision for temporary spaces and for ev
ents.

the local environment. (Figure 14.12).
14.111   The identification of new spaces in Key Sites and Development
 
Opportunity Sites will complement the existing network providing much needed space within development sites. The provision of spaces that allow for a diverse range of uses and events will maximise opportunities for social engagement and increase public activity.
14.112
  Materials and streetscape products proposed for public open spaces and routes should be o
f high quality befitting of the Urban Core, 
sustainably sourced, durable, and easily maintained. They should be of an appropriate design to enhance the character and distinctiveness of the Urban Core. High quality materials can make a major positive contribution to the perception of areas and materials will be chosen which reflect the character of the area. Materials in Performance Square outside the Baltic and in Grainger Town have greatly improved these areas and helped to attract events and visitors. 
14.113
  The opportunity for temporary public realm such as the successful Quayside Beach and P
ocket Parks will continue to be promoted. The 
provision of spaces that allow for a diverse range of uses and events will maximise opportunities for social engagement and increase public activity.
14.114
  Public art has successfully created a strong sense of place within parts
 
of the Urban Core. We will explore opportunities for further public art as it adds value and brings distinctiveness to the area. It can raise public awareness, boost a place’s identity and image, engender civic pride and attract inward investment.
Policy UC17 Public ArtTo enhance character and local distinctiveness, development of Key Sites and Development Opportunity Sites will include public art.
14.115
  Public art can be integrated into the architectural fabric, street 
floor
scape or street furniture, and it can take a variety of forms including 
physical pieces, creative lighting, performances, creative consultation and processes, and temporary installations. In its physical form public art can aid way-finding (legibility) across the Urban Core and add to the enjoyment of this experience.
14.116
  The process of introducing public art should also provide the
 
opportunity for individuals and organisations to collaborate, working creatively to maximise the use of resources and bring individuality to a scheme at a variety of stages.
Section 5 is divided into three chapters. A common introduction to the Sub-Areas

Plan rather than subsequent LDD’s. Metrogreen is not allocated but is identified as a str
ategic location for development and will be brought 
forward through a subsequent Area Action Plan.
15.3   Allocating sites is part of a strategic approach to guiding and managing development in Gateshead and Ne
wcastle. This approach allows more 
effective planning of infrastructure to support growth, and provides a degree of certainty to landowners, developers and the public about the Councils’ position and requirements for individual sites. The sites are allocated and masterplans will be required as set out in Policies CS2, CS3 and CS4. This will enable local communities to have further opportunities to help shape the detailed proposals.
15.4
  The policies in this section must be read in conjunction with other Local Plan policies and guidance. For each site, the policy sets out what
 
we expect to be delivered and the essential requirements to ensure development can be delivered in a sustainable way.Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5

Newcastle’s Urban Core Sub Areas and Site Specific Policies
Newcastle Central Sub-Area16.2
  The Newcastle Central Sub-Area extends northwar
ds from Central 
Station to the Haymarket and from St. James Boulevard eastward to the 
Central Motorway. The Sub-Area is the most accessible location by public transport of all the Tyne and Wear centres. It contains Newcastle’s major transport hubs and interchanges including Central Station, Haymarket and Eldon Square bus stations, and four Metro stations.
16.3
  This Sub-Area contains the regional retail centre
, surrounded by 
commercial and leisure uses. The Primary Shopping Area is compact and very busy. Northumberland Street and Eldon Square Shopping Centre experience the highest levels of footfall in the Urban Core. The Sub-Area is a key evening destination, providing a range of leisure activities including bars and nightclubs, music venues, cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafés.
16.4
  The Central Sub-Area contains a high concentration o
f heritage 
assets, including Listed Buildings, Scheduled Ancient Monuments and archaeology. Most of the Sub-Area is included within the Central Conservation Area. The archaeology, buildings and streets reflect the city’s many periods of development. There are examples of Roman military infrastructure, Medieval streets and buildings, Georgian town houses, Victorian and Edwardian remains of industry, commerce and culture as well as the legacy of twentieth century development. 
 The diverse character and appearance of the Centr
al Sub-Area creates  
 a strong sense of place. The significance and value of the historic   
 environment is fully recognised by the Council and a number o
f   
 heritage-led regeneration schemes have been deliv
ered. The most  
 prominent and successful of these schemes was the Grainger T
own  
 Project (1997-2003).
16216. Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site-Specific PoliciesNewcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies16.5   This Sub-Area will extend retail and commercial activity, principally by  
redeveloping under used areas immediately adjoining the shopping 
area. We will support growth by:
  •  Accommodating a major expansion of our Primary Shopping Area including new c
omparison retailing at East Pilgrim Street 
to provide a focus for our regional retail, commercial and leisure offer, reinforcing our role as the regional retail centre;
  •  Expanding commercial and leisure activity and residential use with an emphasis on the extension of the Sub-Ar
ea’s use beyond 9-to-
5 and 8-to-late to broaden the appeal of the area;
  •  Improving the pedestrian and cycling environment and minimising through tr
affic;
  •  Enhancing gateways and arrival points including the national, regional and local arrival point at Central Station; 
  •  Creating more pleasant, direct pedestrian routes; 
  •  Sustaining and enhancing our heritage assets not just for their intrinsic heritage value, but as part of a vibr
ant, varied and 
fascinating City Centre which attracts visitors and promotes distinctive urban living.
163
Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy NC1 Newcastle Central Sub-Area
Promoting the continued success of the Central Sub-Area will be achieved through:
 1.  Protecting the retail centre and enhancing the role of New
castle as the 
regional centre by:
  i.  Only permitting A1 and A3 within the Primary Retail Frontages (as designated in Figure 16.1) at ground floor le
vel. Change of use from 
A1/A3 will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated that the proposed use would make a significant contribution towards the vitality and viability of the retail centre, and
  ii.  Permitting A1, A2, A3 and other supporting uses within the Secondary Retail Frontages (as designated in Figur
e 16.1) at ground floor level 
which make a demonstrable contribution towards the vitality and viability of the centre.
 2. Improving the environment and accessibility b
y:
  i.  Increasing pedestrian and cyclist priority on Blackett Street by upgr
ading the public realm and reducing bus movements,
  ii.  Upgrading the public realm on Northumberland Street and reducing servicing vehicles,
 
  iii.  Upgrading the public realm on Northumberland Road and improving pedestrian links acr
oss College Street and John Dobson Street, 
  iv. Providing and improving at-grade cros
sings at Swan House   
   Roundabout, and
  v.  Narrowing John Dobson Street and providing a cycle route as part o
f 
the Great North Cycle Way. 
 3. Continuing the regeneration of Graing
er Town through:
  i.  The re-use and conversion of the vacant or underused upper floors
 
principally for residential uses, and
  ii.  Safe, secure and sensitively designed ground floor entrances to upper
 
floors which respect the historic buildings. 
 4. Refurbishing Central Gateway by:
  i.  Increasing pedestrian space and pedestrian priority including undertaking improvements to Neville Str
eet, 
  ii.  Enhancing links to the Primary Shopping Area via Grainger Street, Newcastle C
ollege via Westmorland Road, Science Central via Pink 
Lane and Bath Lane and also links to the Stephenson Quarter Key Site and Gateshead, and
  iii. Removing traffic from the Central Station portico
.
 5. Regenerating the Old Newcastle area b
y:
  i. Refurbishing and reusing the Black Gate, and
  ii.  Improving, access into the Castle K
eep, signage, interpretation and 
the surrounding public realm.
 6.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and network of public open spac
es by undertaking improvements at the Bigg Market.

© Crown Copyright and database right [2015]. Ordnance Survey [100019569].
© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.6   Newcastle is the most significant retail and leisure destination in the 
region. W
e will protect the compactness of the retail area and avoid 
dilution of retail activity in the heart of the shopping area by protecting Primary Shopping Frontages and Secondary Shopping Frontages (Figure 16.1). When defining the Primary and Secondary Shopping Frontages, consideration has been given to vitality and viability indicators, the location and quality of retailers, together with rental levels, pedestrian footfall and the quality of the retailer environment.
16.7
  It is important to retain retailing on the main shopping streets and to protect the Primary Shopping Frontag
es on the ground floor ensuring a 
high quality, lively and accessible shopping environment. Therefore, uses in the area will be restricted to A1 and A3 and changes of use from these uses will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that there is an exceptional circumstance, and the use would make a significant contribution to the vitality and viability of the centre. Proposals must include a transparent shopfront, demonstrate that an alternative use would bring a similar level of activity to the area and that it would attract high levels of footfall comparable to surrounding retail uses. Other factors that will be considered include the existing number, proximity and distribution of uses, the location and length of proposed frontage and prominence of the proposal in the Primary Shopping Area.
16.8
  Secondary Shopping Frontages have been identified to help maintain a balanc
e between the need to retain the vibrancy and character of 
the shopping street while encouraging a mix of uses that positively contribute to the overall vitality of the centre during the day and into the evening. Within the Secondary Shopping Frontages we will maintain the dominance of the shopping function supporting proposals at ground floor which reinforce and complement the retail function of the centre. Supporting uses which may be acceptable are leisure (D2) and business (B1) uses.
16.9
  Transport improvements are vital to delivering the vision f
or this Sub- 
Area and will link our retail, leisure and commercial areas enhancing connections and legibility. Managing the varying needs of transport modes in the Central Sub Area is important in maintaining a vibrant Urban Core to support Gateshead and Newcastle’s role as the heart of the region. The pedestrian and cyclist experience will be improved to create high quality streets and spaces and through traffic in the area will be minimised. The Bus Loop and the potential for a Low Emission Zone in the future, together with transport and movement schemes set out in Chapters 11 and 14, will help to create an attractive centre, promote tourism, attract shoppers and support business and residential growth.
16.10
  Blackett Street is located at the centre of the Primary Shopping Area and f
orms a significant part of the Primary Pedestrian Network connecting 
Old Eldon Square and the Monument. It is also a major bus interchange with over 100 cross city buses per hour
54 using Blackett Street at peak 
times. The combination of high pedestrian footfall and bus flows creates conflict between these modes and cyclists. The pedestrian and cyclist environment will be improved by enhancing the quality of the surface treatment and by reducing the number of bus services using Blackett Street. We will further restrict vehicles travelling through the area in the medium term and work towards the removal of buses from Blackett Street in the long term.
166Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies16.11   Northumberland Street is the busiest shopping street in Newcastle. 
There is gr
eat potential to transform Northumberland Street to make the 
shopping experience more attractive through a high quality public realm scheme and reducing the number and size of service vehicles.
16.12
  Northumberland Road is closed to through traffic and major improvements ha
ve already been completed along much of the street. 
Public realm improvements outside the City Hall will complete this high quality route between Northumbria University and Northumberland Street and the ‘front door’ to the campus.
16.13
  The Swan House area is dominated by the roundabout and roads. The replacement o
f underpasses with at-grade crossings for pedestrians and 
cyclists will enhance links from the East Pilgrim Street Key Site to the Quayside.
16.14
  Improvements will be undertaken on John Dobson Street for pedestrians, cy
clists and public transport. They will be achieved by 
reducing road widths and undertaking cycling improvements as part of implementing the Great North Cycle Way. Bus facilities on John Dobson Street north of Saville Place will be implemented as part of the proposed Bus Loop, and we will remove buses from John Dobson Street south of Saville Place in the long term.
16.15
  Grainger Town (Figure 16.2) contains classical str
eets of national 
architectural and historic significance, one of the highest densities of listed buildings in the Country. In the early 1990s vacancies in the area increased as the focus of the retail and commercial centre moved away from Grainger Town, the area declined and many properties fell into disrepair. Approximately 90,000 square metres
55 of floor space was 
unoccupied (mainly upper floors) and the area’s residential population was falling. The Grainger Town Project was established to address this decline.
16.16
   Through regeneration, public realm schemes and various marketing
 
and cultural programmes the area was transformed. Substantial public and private sector investment was attracted to the area between 1997 and 2003 including offices, retail, housing and leisure uses as part of a comprehensive heritage-led approach to regeneration. The area is now internationally recognised as an outstanding example of successful heritage-led regeneration. While the area is still performing well in general, there is still vacant floor space, particularly on upper floors. The refurbishment and re-use of buildings in Grainger Town will be actively promoted particularly for residential use to continue the regeneration and revitalisation of this historic area. The feasibility and viability will be investigated and appropriate strategies developed. Re-use of upper floors for residential and other uses will require the sensitive conversion of listed buildings and alterations to ground floors to provide new entrances. Ground floor access points will need to be developed to maintain a predominance of retail uses.

and a f
ocus for regional transport. This listed building is both a major 
arrival point and gateway. Approximately 7.5 million people56 pass 
through the station every year and its immediate environs are the first impression of the City for many. It provides a link not only to the Primary Shopping Area but also to surrounding commercial areas. Directly to the south is the Stephenson Quarter Key Site and to the west is the International Centre for Life and Newcastle College. Central Station is close to the Primary Shopping Area and commercial areas, but routes and the public realm need to be enhanced. The completion of the City Centre Wayfinding Project provides a coordinated network of signs which has helped to improve legibility to and from Central Station. The Central Gateway project will make the area a more attractive location for investment and will further strengthen the tourism and visitor experience. It will improve access and legibility for all users, while also helping to accelerate development of surrounding development sites.
16.18
  The Old Newcastle area includes the area south of Mosley Street
 
extending to the Castle Garth, from Dean Street in the east to St Nicholas Street in the west. It is a very significant area in the history and development of the City. The Old Newcastle project will regenerate the area through investment in the principal heritage assets of the Black Gate, Castle Keep and Cathedral Church of St Nicholas. The project will create an accessible, heritage-led education and interpretation centre in the Black Gate, transforming the area into a centre of heritage activity that tells the story of the remarkable history of the City.
16.19
  The Bigg Market is located on the Primary Pedestrian Route and is a lively space during the ev
ening but it is currently underused during the 
day. It is one of a few large spaces in this area and there is potential for improvement making it a more attractive focal space.
16.20
  Policy NC2 is specifically related to the allocation of the East Pilgrim Street Key Site
. In this Sub-Area, the East Pilgrim Street Key Site is 
our priority and it’s development will be supported by Accelerated Development Zone status.
169
Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy NC2 East Pilgrim Street Key Site 
 1. East Pilgrim Street Key Site (Figure 16.3) is allocated for: 
  i.  Retail-led (A1) mixed-use in The Northern Area (north of Market 
Street), and
 
  ii.  Mixed-use Offices (B1), Residential (C3) Student Accommodation (C4) and Leisure (D2) (as principal uses) in the C
entral and Southern area 
(south of Market Street).
 2.  Development will be comprehensively planned, phased and must ensure it pr
ovides:
  i.  New retail streets in an open plan format linked into the existing retail
 
circuit,
  ii. Improved pedestrian accessibility and cycling priority thr
ough:
   a)  An east/west route forming part of the Primary Pedestrian Route c
onnecting New Bridge Street West to Manors,
   b) Enhanced links to Manors Metro and rail station,
   c)  Enhanced links from Pilgrim Street across Swan House roundabout,
   d) Removal of footbridges and underpasses where pos
sible,
   e) Restriction of general traffic through the site, and
   f) New cycle routes which link to the cycle network.
  iii.  A new bus facility on the eastern edge of the site reorganising bus mo
vements to and through the site as part of the comprehensive 
redevelopment scheme.
  iv.  Appropriate levels of car parking on the edge of the site to serve the
 
comprehensive development.
  v.  Refurbishment of Listed Buildings and Scheduled Ancient Monuments which are integr
ated into the redevelopment.
  vi.  Archaeological assessment, fieldwork, recor
ding and preservation 
where appropriate.
16.21   East Pilgrim Street represents one of the most strategically important City C
entre regeneration areas in the north of England and provides the 
space for the retail, leisure and commercial core to expand. Newcastle has consistently been identified as a location for major retail growth and the most recent comparison good retail study has identified capacity for at least 50,000 square metres
52 additional gross retail floorspace 
by 2018/19. The majority of this will be located in the northern area of East Pilgrim Street as there is insufficient capacity within the Primary Shopping Area to accommodate the additional floorspace. A sequential test has identified the land at East Pilgrim Street as the most appropriate location for retail development next to the existing Primary Shopping Area, though an impact assessment is required by policy UC2. Once developed this area will be incorporated into the Primary Shopping Area through a review of the Plan, and a review of frontage policy will also take place.

Pilgrim Street (Figure 16.3) will provide a new retail destination. It will
 
complement our existing retail area meeting deficiencies in retail choice together with unmet demand from retailers who wish to be represented in Newcastle. It is likely that there will be further capacity later in the plan period or as economic conditions improve and further retail studies will be carried out to assess the potential. Development of the northern area of East Pilgrim Street will be supported by a range of other uses in the central and southern areas including offices, residential and leisure. 
16.23
  There will be alterations to transport infrastructure in the area to impr
ove pedestrian and cycle priority. These alterations will further 
integrate East Pilgrim Street into the shopping area and improve links to the Quayside and Manors. Pedestrian and cycle routes will be improved through the area, linking to the wider networks, while underpasses and overhead walkways will be removed and replaced with at-grade crossings wherever possible. An increase in pedestrian priority will be supported by restricting general traffic on various streets and rationalising bus movements. A new bus facility will be located on the eastern edge of the East Pilgrim Street area which will form a key part of our public transport strategy, particularly when the Bus Loop is introduced (see Policy UC7). Appropriate levels of car parking will be provided in locations on the edge of the area.
16.24
  Built heritage is an important element within the East Pilgrim Street area. Buildings and streets which date from the medieval period thr
ough to 
the 20th century survive and many make a strong contribution to the rich and diverse historic character of the area. Sustaining and enhancing buildings, archaeology and important historic street patterns will be vital in contributing to the creation of a distinctive high quality environment. 
16.25
  Development of retail in open streets which are permeable tog
ether 
with new and improved public spaces will enhance the environment providing much needed space in a busy area. Open spaces will play an important role in creating a sense of place, animating the area, enhancing the setting of listed buildings and promoting leisure uses alongside retail. Spaces will also help provide coherent legible links through the area.
16.26
  It is expected that development will be phased, however ther
e will 
need to be co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to development. A masterplan will need to demonstrate that proposals would not compromise either the delivery of a major retail scheme, the regeneration of the wider East Pilgrim Street area, or result in piecemeal development. Interim Planning Guidance was prepared in 2009 for East Pilgrim Street which sets out principles to guide the masterplanning process.
172Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesCivic Sub-Area 
16.27   The Civic Sub-Area forms the northern edge of the Urban Core. In the
 
north and east it is defined by Newcastle’s two Universities, the Royal 
Victoria Infirmary (RVI), the Civic Centre and Exhibition Park. In the west it extends to St James’ Park and the former brewery site (known as Science Central). This area contains important arrival points into the city including one mainline station, two metro stations and two bus stations.
16.28
  Activity in the Civic Sub-Area is predominantly related to the major institutions which make a vital contribution to the economy and the
 
vibrancy of City and the wider region. There are also important cultural attractions including the Great North Museum and the Northern Stage Theatre.
16.29
  The Civic Sub-Area contains some notable landmark buildings and heritage assets including many listed buildings and structures, two
 
conservation areas (Framlington Place and Leazes) and two registered Historic Parks (Leazes and Exhibition). Framlington Place Conservation Area is characterised by a mix of 19th century terraced houses and large, detached dwellings. Leazes Conservation Area includes a Victorian Park surrounded by late Georgian residential development.
16.30
  This Sub-Area has a special contribution to make to the economic and cultural gro
wth of Gateshead and Newcastle through science and 
educational development. We will support growth by:
  •  Focussing on Science Central as a key site f
or growth in the 
knowledge economy including science, research and residential uses;
  •  Promoting further development in education and learning and the transfer of kno
wledge from education to research, stimulating 
growth in research-focussed businesses linked to the assets of the universities and the Royal Victoria Infirmary;
  •  Improving east/west links to ensure greater integration betw
een 
the immediately adjoining residential neighbourhoods to the west with the Urban Core;
  •  Enhancing gateways and arrival points particularly creating clear and direct links for pedestrians and cyclists.
173Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy C1 Civic Sub-Area
Promoting growth of the knowledge economy and enhancing accessibility to and through the Civic Sub-Area will be achieved by:
 1.  Supporting the expansion of the Universities and RVI Hospital to meet their needs for new and impr
oved accommodation. 
 2.  Managing traffic, public transport and improving the network of routes f
or 
pedestrians and cyclists at:
  i. Claremont Road and Barras Bridge,
  ii. Gallowgate,
  iii. St Marys Place,
  iv. Queen Victoria Road and
  v. Sandyford Road.
 3.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and network of public open spac
es by undertaking improvements at:
  i. Strawberry Place,
  ii. St James Metro,
  iii. Percy Street West, and
  iv. Kings Manor Business Park.
16.31    We are committed to the future expansion of the Univer
sities and RVI 
Hospital as they provide education, knowledge based jobs and they are central to our future economic growth.
16.32
   The Civic Centre, Newcastle University and Northumbria Univ
ersity are 
all located on busy routes leading to the retail core and the Metro and bus stations. Together all these uses create a considerable demand for pedestrian and vehicular movement within and through the Barras Bridge and Haymarket area. Pedestrian footfall levels here are some of the highest in the Urban Core. Improvements will create clearer routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Considering this Sub-Area as a whole will ensure there is a coherent network of routes and the Bus Loop will provide rationalised routing for buses. Together these proposals form a key part of the Urban Core’s transport strategy.
16.33
  Both Universities and the RVI continue to improve their public realm and
 
pedestrian environment and this will be extended into the Barras Bridge/Claremont Road area which is a major gateway into the City. Improving the environment surrounding the Civic Centre, the Universities, the Haymarket Bus and Metro Stations and expanding the amount of space dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists will provide legible more direct routes and enhanced public realm at this gateway. This will be achieved by creating obvious ‘front doors’ to the Universities, reducing the dominance of roads to allow wider footpaths and improving links between the main entrances to the university campuses, to the City Centre and to the RVI. Crossing points will be provided in locations that link to existing routes within the two campuses and the Civic Centre.
174Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies16.34   Percy Street is a key arrival point and provides access to the Haymarket 
and Eldon Square bus stations, the Metro station and the multi storey car parks at Eldon Gardens and Eldon Squar
e. There will be increased public 
transport priority on both Barras Bridge and Percy Street, with Percy Street remaining as a key access point for public transport. Improving crossings and reducing road widths on Percy Street will aid pedestrian and cycle movement and reduce the barriers to east/west movement. Vehicular through traffic will be restricted on some streets such as Percy Street, Queen Victoria Road and through Gallowgate.
16.35
  As part of the Bus Loop, St Mary’s Place will have increased bus priority and will be included in the wider impr
ovements to Barras Bridge. St 
Mary’s Place will also benefit from improvements to John Dobson Street which are set out in the Newcastle Central Sub-Area. Sandyford Road is a major sustainable commuting route for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport.
16.36
  Developments will be expected to make provision for gr
een 
infrastructure and/or public space. The extent of the provision will be determined on a site by site basis and will range from the inclusion of planting as part of the development to the creation of a new public space. These are the short term priorities and as development opportunities arise further sites will be identified. The redevelopment of Science Central will provide major new spaces and enhance the Urban Green Infrastructure Network by addressing a gap between the formal green spaces in the north to the Quayside area and Forth Yards.
16.37
  In this Sub-Area, the Science Central Key Site (Figure 16.4) is our priority
 
and its development will be supported by Accelerated Development Zone Status.
16.38
  In 2005, due to its success as a leader in science, Newcastle was
 
named as one of six Science Cities in the UK. Science Cities are regional development projects, based upon university, industry, and government collaborations that creatively bring together local and natural resources to achieve science based economic growth. The Science City initiative represents a major commercial opportunity that will allow us to further develop the fields of stem cell research, ageing sciences, energy, and environment and engineering technology. Newcastle has an international reputation for pioneering development in these fields and we will provide space in this Sub-Area for growth. The development of Science Central will build on the success of the research and development activities of the Centre for Life, Newcastle University and our hospitals.
175Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy C2 Science Central Key Site
Science Central Street Key Site (Figure 16.4) is allocated for Science and Research-led mixed-use, including for Research and Development and Offices (B1), Residential (C3), Student Accommodation (C4) and Non-Residential Institutions (D1) (as principal uses).
 1.  Development is required to be comprehensively planned and phasing
 
must ensure it provides:
  i.  A major east / west route through the site which will become a Primary Pedestrian Route c
onnecting Westgate Road to Strawberry Place,
  ii. A network of connected public spaces throughout the site, and
  iii.  Highly sustainable buildings which meet the latest design standards and energy solutions which support delivery of a district heating network.

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.39   Science Central, which is principally made up of the former Brew ery 
land, will drive forward major change in this Sub-Area associated with 
the potential of the science, education, health and research sectors. Development will make a significant contribution to the economic competitiveness of the city. 
16.40
  The Council will work closely with Newcastle University to attract
 
science and research led mixed-uses supported by a range of other complementary uses such as housing. The site is in an ideal location for the development of science uses on the edge of the City Centre close to the universities, the College, the International Centre for Life, the Royal Victoria Infirmary and the General Hospital site. We expect this development to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the immediate area but also improve linkages between our western communities and the City Centre.
16.41
  Planning permission was granted in April 2012 and Figure 16.4 shows how the site is expected to be de
veloped. The site is divided into 
four areas: a knowledge area including science and knowledge based industries, a live work area including smaller scale offices and houses, a home zone area which will be a new residential neighbourhood, and a local facility area.
16.42
  The predominant uses will be research and development related with some o
ffices, residential and student accommodation supported by 
local services. It will also be important on this large site to have a range of ancillary active uses to animate ground floors on key routes, such as retail, restaurants and cafes. An energy centre will be developed to serve the site and it is expected that development will be highly sustainable and carbon neutral.
16.43
  By designing streets which allow for permeability we will create links to the surrounding c
ommunities and improve connections to the City 
Centre. In particular it will be important to take a co-ordinated approach to the future development of both Science Central and Gallowgate. Gallowgate is a key office area where there has been major development in recent years and its future development will help integrate Science Central into the wider area.
16.44
  The development of Science Central should achiev
e a balance between 
the desire to create a pedestrian-friendly environment and the need to accommodate necessary traffic. Prominent ‘gateways’ into Science Central will be developed to create attractive routes and spaces for pedestrians, promoting walking, and traffic will be restricted. There will be areas where people have priority over vehicles and vehicle speeds will be reduced. In particular there will be improved access for pedestrians to the site by creating major new pedestrian crossings at Bath Lane/Wellington Street, Westgate Road/Buckingham Street and Gallowgate/Barrack Road.
16.45
  The scale of development on the Science Central Ke
y Site provides a 
great opportunity to bring forward a district heating scheme which could eventually serve a wider area. Development is expected to be highly sustainable and the layout and buildings will incorporate the latest design standards.
178Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesDiscovery Sub-Area
16.46   The Discovery Sub-Area lies on the south-west edge of Ne
wcastle, with 
the River Tyne as its southern boundary and the Redheugh Bridge/St 
James’ Boulevard (A189) as its north-south spine. It is a major gateway into Newcastle from the Gateshead side, by road (Redheugh), rail (King Edward VII) and Metro (QEII Bridge). The southern part of this Sub-Area benefits from having attractive views over the Tyne and is an area that is rich in archaeology and industrial heritage.
16.47
  The Sub-Area has two distinct character areas. Firstly, the northern ar
ea is made up of major activities which include Newcastle College, 
the Discovery Museum and the area of offices and hotels around the Boulevard which is steadily developing. It also contains the line of Hadrian’s Wall and Vallum and a number of important listed buildings, Westgate Hill Cemetery and the Summerhill Conservation Area.
16.48
  The second area, south of Scotswood Road and the rail
way viaduct, 
down to the Tyne, contains a large number of vacant or underused sites which are major development opportunities. It includes the Stephenson Quarter immediately south of Central Station, Forth Yards between the Redheugh and King Edward VII bridges, and the former Calders site to the west, adjoining the Metro Arena. This riverside area has a long history of industrial uses which contribute to its significance and still has a major influence on the area’s character. Elswick Lead Works was a major use in the west of this area until its closure in 2002, and there have been operational railway uses in the area since the development of Central Station in 1850.
16.49
  The characteristics of this area have a major influence on its form and
 
appearance. This includes the town wall and its setting, the dramatic physical landscape and southerly slope of the land towards the River Tyne, the north-south street pattern, and the dense industrial building blocks. This Sub-Area contains a number of large development sites in a prominent location at a major gateway into Newcastle. Some of the development sites will come forward in the short term while others will be in the longer term. We will support growth by:
  •  Regenerating vacant sites and ensuring there is a co-ordinated
 
approach to the provision of the infrastructure required to unlock development sites;
  •  Promoting an area of mixed-use including offices, leisure and
 
residential, supported by a wide range of other activities which will benefit from the proximity of Central Station, the riverside, and add to the capacity and ‘critical mass’ of the Urban Core;
  •  Improving ‘gateways’ into the Urban Core from the west and south
 
which reflect the character and quality of the regional centre;
  •  Promoting the continued expansion of Newcastle Colle
ge;
  •  Creating a vital link westward from the Urban Core through
 
Newcastle College to the residential neighbourhoods, stimulating both the expansion of the Urban Core and the regeneration of the residential neighbourhoods to the west.
179Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy D1 Discovery Sub-Area 
Regenerating the Discovery Sub-Area as a major gateway entrance and extending connections west will be achieved through:
 1.  Supporting the expansion of Newcastle College to meet their needs f
or 
new and improved accommodation. 
 2.  Improving accessibility and connections for pedestrians, cy
clists and 
vehicles by:
  i.  Undertaking improvements at: Dunn Street, Plummer Street, Tyneside R
oad, Westmorland Road, Skinnerburn Road and along the route of 
the former Carlisle Railway Line, and 
  ii.  Requiring development to contribute to improvements at: F
orth 
Street, Railway Street, Forth Banks, Pottery Lane, through the former Calders site, Shot Factory Lane, George Street, St James Boulevard, Churchill Street, Blandford Square. 
 3.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and network of public open spac
es by providing spaces at:
  i. Blandford Square, 
  ii. Former Calders Site, and   
  iii. Pottery Lane.
16.50   Newcastle College has extensively r
emodelled the campus over the past 
few years. Further redevelopment of the campus and improved links to the surrounding area will be supported.
16.51
  There are a number of important areas that surround the Sub-Area including C
entral Station, Newcastle Business Park, housing areas 
and the Quayside. In addition to improving pedestrian and cycling connections to these destinations, there is also a need to improve connections within the area.
16.52
  Scotswood Road is a major access route into Ne
wcastle from the west 
and in addition to the works completed at Redheugh Bridgehead, further improvements are needed to junctions at Dunn Street and Plummer Street. Development schemes at Scotswood Road junctions and Skinnerburn Road will be undertaken as part of delivering the UCDR. The capacity of Skinnerburn Road will be increased and alterations will be made to its alignment. This will reduce traffic on Neville Street and therefore provide an opportunity for public realm improvements as part of the Central Gateway project.
16.53
  Improving transport access to Forth Y
ards will help to stimulate 
development. This will be achieved through junction improvements, road widening schemes and new roads and will also create an attractive environment for pedestrians and cyclists.
180Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies16.54   Increased access into the area on major routes will link new  
development into the Centre, to Stephenson Quarter and to the west to 
Newcastle Business Park. Some works will be expected to be undertaken as part of site development in order to minimise the transport impact of the development. Improvements including the provision of an east/west road through the former Calders site and improved access to the river are required to create clear links. 
16.55
  Enhanced pedestrian access to Newcastle Colle
ge will be achieved 
through a combination of development requirements and there is potential to reduce traffic movement on George Street. Any new development in the George Street block should ensure improved pedestrian access to the College on Churchill Street.
16.56
  Development at Blandford Square and two former sites, C
alders and 
Pottery Lane, will need to provide public open spaces which will form part of the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and contribute to addressing the gaps in the network in this Sub-Area. This list of sites included in the policy is not an exhaustive list and as development opportunities arise further sites will be identified.
16.57
  Policies D2 and D3 are specifically related to the allocation of the Stephenson Quarter Key Site (Figur
e 16.5) and Forth Yards Development 
Opportunity Site (Figure 16.6). In this Sub-Area, Stephenson Quarter Key Site is our priority and its development will be supported by Accelerated Development Zone status.
Policy D2 Stephenson Quarter Key SiteStephenson Quarter Key Site is allocated (Figure 16.5) for office-led mixed-use development (B1) supported by a range of ancillary uses. 
 1.  Development is required to be comprehensively planned and phasing
 
must ensure it provides:
  i.  Improved access and permeability to and within the site for
 
pedestrians through links to Central Station, the Quayside and Forth Yards,
  ii.  A network of public open spaces within the area linked to the  
surrounding pedestrian network,
  iii.  Refurbishment of Listed Buildings and their integration into the r
edevelopment,
  iv.  Development which respects and responds sensitively to the Tyne Gor
ge setting, and 
  v.  Archaeological assessment, fieldwork, recor
ding and preservation 
where appropriate.

of significant industrial, archaeolo
gical and historical importance. It is 
best known for its pioneering role in the development of the locomotive engine. Comprehensive office-led mixed-use development of the area supported by ancillary mixed-use will create a distinctive new quarter, and this site will be the major catalyst for change in the area over the next few years. The site will be developed for offices as the primary use supported by a range of other uses including hotels, residential, leisure and other ancillary uses. A mix of uses will ensure that the site is vibrant throughout the day and night.
16.59
  The site is highly accessible. It benefits from being next to C
entral 
Station, of having south facing views over the Tyne and is an ideal location for office-led mixed-use. It is considered to be one of our prime office locations in the short term and the area is already established for this use through the high quality and prestigious Central Square North and South Buildings.
16.60
  Regeneration of this historic area will reinf
orce the Quarter’s significant 
archaeological and industrial heritage and strong sense of place and the Tyne Gorge’s special character. Buildings, routes and spaces will be developed to sustain and enhance heritage assets maximising views and activities.
 
16.61   Development at Stephenson Quarter will help stimulate regeneration of
 
the wider area including the Forth Yards area immediately to the west. New east/west links through the Stephenson Quarter to Forth Yards will be vital to the success of its future development.
16.62
  The Forth Yards Development Opportunity Site (Figure 16.6) is a further opportunity f
or development of significant scale in this Sub-Area. 
Although it is anticipated this will be longer term.
Policy D3 Forth Yards Development Opportunity SiteForth Yards (Figure 16.6) is allocated for mixed-use. The principal uses will include Offices (B1), Leisure (D2) and Residential (C3).
 1. Developments must: 
   i.  Maintain and improve access to the site and pro
vide clear routes   
across the site for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport,
   ii. Improve access roads to and thr
ough the site, 
   iii.  Maintain and improve access to the river T
yne creating visual links to 
the river,
   iv.  Provide a high quality landmark entrance respecting and responding sensitiv
ely to the Tyne Gorge and the scale and setting of the 
Redheugh and King Edward Bridges, and
   v.  Provide a public space in the area between Redheugh Bridge R
oad and 
Pottery Lane.
183Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.63   The Forth Yards area includes various former industrial sites and the 
Metro Ar
ena. It is a major gateway into Newcastle which has significant 
redevelopment potential and the Council will prepare a development framework to guide the future development of the area. It is close to main routes into the Urban Core and is only 10 minutes walk from Central Station. The principal uses in the Forth Yards area will be office, leisure and residential use reflecting the potential for this area to form the linkage between the Stephenson Quarter and Newcastle Business Park. There are also likely to be ancillary uses which could include student accommodation and hotels.

access roads together with pedestrian and cy
cle routes are required. A 
route through the former Calders site, improved access to the riverside and links to the surrounding area are required to integrate them into the Urban Core. New routes and improvements to existing routes are identified in policy D1.
16.65
  Proposals should work with and reinforce the topogr
aphy, provide 
links to the river and a gateway to the City Centre respecting heritage assets and existing landmarks. New development should incorporate visual links to the River Tyne by creating framed and unfolding views characteristic of the Tyne Gorge.
16.66
  Public space will be required as part of the development to support the mix o
f uses and promote links through Stephenson Quarter and 
to the surrounding area. There is potential to contribute to the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and improve links to the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network. It is anticipated that the Forth Yards area will come forward in the longer term. However, this does not preclude the earlier development of the site.
Quayside and Ouseburn Sub-Area
16.67
  This Sub-Area includes Newcastle Quayside and the Ouseburn Valley 
extending fr
om Redheugh Bridge along the Quayside to the former 
Spillers Mill and to the City Stadium in the north east. They are very distinctive areas characterised and greatly influenced by the rivers, their heritage, topography, and previous industrial activity. The Quayside’s steep Tyne Gorge slopes combine with historic buildings, iconic bridges and landmark buildings to form a memorable and instantly recognisable location, while the Tyne Gorge landscape of the Ouseburn River creates a very tight, enclosed, intimate character which still contains many striking former industrial buildings on small plots along the river.
16.68
  The Quayside has a long history as a port and focus for industrial activity. There have been tw
o historically significant periods of development. 
The first was during medieval times which saw the development of merchants’ houses and warehouses. The second was during the industrial revolution which saw the expansion of development along the River Tyne and large warehouses dominated the landscape. From the 17th century and through to the 19th century the Ouseburn played a key role in the Industrial Revolution on Tyneside. There were many industrial uses along the river including glassworks, leadworks, limeworks, mills and potteries and many of the warehouses still remain today providing an attractive setting for 21st century development.
16.69
  From the mid 20th century the port moved downstream and the industry
 
declined. Large areas of the Quayside and Ouseburn were abandoned and many buildings fell into a state of disrepair and decay. The renaissance of the Quayside began in the late 1980s.
185Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.70   The Quayside and the Ouseburn area has been transformed over recent  
decades, and now contains a cluster of creative industries, visitor and 
leisure attractions and a range of vibrant small businesses. It has many popular attractions including Seven Stories (the National Centre for Children’s Books), Stepney Bank Stables, the Ouseburn Farm, Biscuit Factory, artist studios, and a lively pub and music scene. While many buildings in this Sub-Area have been demolished or altered, there remains a legacy of rich heritage, striking townscape, historic buildings and archaeology. Hadrian’s Wall runs through the Sub-Area. It contains a Scheduled Ancient Monument and many listed buildings. The natural features  and historic development have created an attractive setting for the redevelopment of existing buildings and new development.
16.71
  The River Tyne and the Lower Ouseburn are parts of the Strate
gic Green 
Infrastructure Network and the Lower Ouseburn is also an important wildlife corridor which links the River Tyne to Heaton Park and Jesmond Dene. 
16.72
  This Sub-Area contains a number of short, medium and long term development sites which off
er the potential to provide a mix of uses. We 
will support growth by:
  •  Promoting housing in a mixed-use environment next to a variety of uses, cr
eating a vibrant, distinctive area,
  •  Promoting leisure, culture and tourism that complements the existing div
erse mix of uses,
  •  Promoting the Ouseburn as a home for arts, cultural, media uses, the creative sector and small-to-medium scale dev
elopment that 
sustains and enhances the existing fine grain character,
  •  Promoting the re-use of vacant historic buildings to maintain the quality of the historic environment and ensur
e the local 
distinctiveness of the area is retained,
  •  Improving pedestrian and cycling access by str
engthening 
connections to the City Centre, Byker and Gateshead, and
  •  Promoting river based leisure uses to increase activity on the River Tyne and the Ouseburn Riv
er.
16.73   Although this Sub-Area does not contain a Key Site there are many de
velopment opportunities. There are a number of sites that have early 
development potential where mixed-use will be supported. Many of these potential development sites are located in the lower area of the Ouseburn.
186Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesPolicy QO1 Quayside and Ouseburn Sub-Area
Promoting the development of the Quayside and Ouseburn Sub-Area as a diverseand sustainable mixed-use area will be achieved by:
 1.  The development of a mix of housing types, sizes and tenures including f
amily homes.
 2.  The continued development of creative business cluster f
or small and 
medium sized enterprises in the Ouseburn.
 3. Leisure, culture and tourism development that complements existing uses.
 4. Improving pedestrian and cycle access through:
  i. Undertaking crossing improvements at Byker Bank and Cut Bank,
  ii.  Providing a new north/south cycle route along For
d Street and Foundry 
Lane, and
  iii.  Rationalising on street car parking and promoting shared parking facilities as part of new de
velopments.
 5. Supporting and enhancing existing public transport infrastructure. 
 6.  Sustaining and enhancing the character of the area through the re-use of vacant historic buildings and by r
especting the scale, plot sizes, 
topography and historic grain of the area.
 7.  Requiring development along the riversides to provide ac
cess to the 
riverside walkways along the River Tyne and the Ouseburn River. 
 8.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and the network of public open spac
es through:
  i.  Undertaking improvements to the biodiversity and ecological value o
f 
the River Tyne and Ouseburn River, links to Heaton Park and Jesmond Vale
  ii.  Undertaking improvements at City Stadium, Ouseburn Farm Woodlands and fields, Ballast Hills, Tar
set Street, and
  iii.  Development providing green infrastructure and/
or public spaces at: 
Malmo Quay, Spillers Quay West, Land west of the Free Trade, Lower Steenbergs Yard, Ince Building and Heany’s Workshop.
 9.  Ensuring that new development minimises surface water run off into the Ouseburn.
16.74
   The Quayside has an established residential population. Although over the last decade, the Ouseburn has become a mixed-use ar
ea, the 
residential population is low as a limited number of sites have been developed for housing. There remains great potential for housing development across the area and a growth in population which will be essential to achieve the Ouseburn Valley’s vision of an urban village.
16.75
  There are many modern offices on the Quayside including major financial and legal occupier
s. Large offices extend along to East 
Quayside and they are complemented by the recent development of smaller scale offices in the Ouseburn. The former Maynard’s Toffee Factory has provided contemporary office space for the creative and digital sector. This gateway to the Ouseburn together with the East Bank will stimulate further development of small-scale offices in the area. Although a few vacant development plots still remain on the Quayside, the focus will be on promoting the re-use of vacant buildings.
187Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.76   Many of the development sites which have potential for early 
de
velopment are located in the Lower Ouseburn Valley on the river. Early 
development will be encouraged at the mouth of the Ouseburn taking advantage of links to the Quayside, the waterfront and the potential to bring further investment in the area. Development along the river and to the east of the area has the potential to provide a particularly attractive environment for mixed-use development. There are already a wide variety of uses in this Sub-Area which have created areas with distinctive character and sense of place, attracting people of all ages. A range of uses will be promoted to reflect the area’s vibrant character through residential use, new businesses and further growth in leisure, culture and tourism uses.
16.77
  The designation of the Close and Quayside as part of the UCDR will enable improved acc
ess between the Quayside and the Ouseburn. 
Priority will be given to east west vehicular movement during peak hours. This will be rebalanced outside peak hours when there will be improved north-south movement. On occasions this route will be closed to vehicular traffic for events.
16.78
  Improving access to the Ouseburn and reducing unneces
sary traffic 
will encourage the wider regeneration of the area. Improvements to pedestrian and cycle routes (between the Ouseburn to the City Centre, Byker, along the River Tyne to Gateshead), management of traffic, and a reduction in on street car parking will enhance the environment.
16.79
  National Cycle Route 72 runs through the south of the Ouseburn and it is a ke
y pedestrian and cycle link to the Quayside. It is part of the ‘Coast 
to Coast’ and Hadrian’s Cycle Way routes and is one of the most popular routes in the country with approximately 15,000 cycle trips a year. The provision of a cycle route along Ford Street and Foundry Lane, supported by the proposals at Byker Bank and Cut Bank, will link Hadrian’s Way with the existing route along Byker Bridge.
16.80
  Currently the Quayside and the Ouseburn Valley are served by the
 
Quaylink Bus and this is an important service. In the long term there is further potential to improve public transport by providing a new Metro Station at Stepney Bank. The feasibility of providing a new station will be investigated.
16.81
  The Quayside and Ouseburn’s built envir
onment is defined by distinctive 
buildings many of which are historic, of different sizes and orientations. This creates a unique area and it is important that development respects the topography of the Gorge and sustains and enhances the historic character of the Quayside and Ouseburn.
188Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies16.82   Variety in the scale and footprint of buildings are key elements that 
contribute to the Lower Ouseburn Valley Conservation Ar
ea’s character 
and appearance and development must enhance and reveal the significance of the historic urban grain. The topography of the Valley is a key characteristic of the area and this will determine the appropriate scale and height of buildings.
16.83
  The River Tyne and the Ouseburn River are the defining features o
f 
the Sub-Area. The completion of the barrage in the Ouseburn and improvements to the quay wall on the Quayside has enabled the promotion of leisure and recreation activities on both rivers. Developing access to the rivers edge will help to increase activity which is important for the Sub-Area’s vitality.
16.84
  Improvements to the public realm have been vital to the Quayside’s
 
renaissance. The area was transformed by the creation of high quality public realm along the edge of the River Tyne together with the provision of new spaces as part of developments. Most recently the NE1 Business Improvement District, has provided a number of temporary spaces such as the Quayside Beach. Improvements to the public spaces in the Ouseburn include the Ouseburn Village Green and new footpaths and associated landscaping improvements along the east side of the river. This route forms a continuous link along the East Bank to the Toffee factory and the Village Green.
16.85
  The River Tyne and Ouseburn River are key parts of the Str
ategic Green 
Infrastructure Network and host to a range of biodiversity. The Tyne River Mudflats are valuable habitats and designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance. The Lower Ouseburn Valley is an important wildlife habitat and its attributes make it a unique urban environment. Improvements to the river’s edge will assist in reinforcing the Lower Ouseburn as Newcastle’s most significant wildlife corridor. 
16.86
  Improving facilities for boat users will increase activity on the river
s 
and their use for recreation and leisure activities, helping to maximise their economic potential. In the Ouseburn, spaces at City Stadium, Ouseburn Farm Woodlands and Fields, Ballast Hill and Tarset Street will be enhanced. These spaces will provide important facilities and will be a focus for the community. There will be a need for play space and event space as further sites are developed and the population increases. Improvements are already being carried out to link the City Stadium to Heaton Park and beyond.
16.87
  Development will be expected to 
make provision for green infrastructure 
and/or public space. The extent of the provision will be determined on a site by site basis and will range from the inclusion of planting as part of the development to the creation of a new public space. The list of sites included in the policy is not an exhaustive list and as development opportunities arise further sites will be identified. Although the priority for the Ouseburn is to improve existing spaces, there is potential to provide a range of new spaces that will assist in creating a lively and vibrant urban neighbourhood. As part of the redevelopment of Malmo Quay a new public space will be located at the mouth of the Ouseburn. There is potential to create a series of linked small spaces along the riverside which would create a high quality route from the mouth of the Ouseburn to the central area.
189Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 516.88   The River Tyne and the Ouseburn River are the principal water courses 
in Ne
wcastle and are the primary sources of flood risk, both of which 
have a low risk of flooding. Within this Sub-Area the River Tyne is at risk of a 1 in 1000 year tidal event and the Ouseburn River, a 1 in 200 year tidal event. The risk of fluvial flooding in the Lower Ouseburn area is currently restricted to the banks of the Ouseburn River and the risk to development sites is low. It is expected that the effects of climate change will continue to result in more frequent extreme weather events and water flood levels are expected to increase by approximately 0.9m. Developments will need to consider this to mitigate flood risk.
16.89
  The Ouseburn River can only accept a limited amount of surface water run o
ff before there is an increased risk of fluvial flooding. 
Developments will be expected to control, separate and minimise surface water run off and include mitigation measures such as SuDS. Once the Ouseburn River threshold for surface water run off has been reached, developers will be required to manage surface water on site or seek other solutions to surface water management.
16.90
  In addition to the relevant flooding guidance and the strategic policy, de
velopment should consider the Environment Agency’s Tyne and Wear 
Catchment Flood Management Plan for the Ouseburn catchment. This document provides evidence for the preferred approach for managing flood risk from all sources for the next 50 to 100 years.

Newcastle Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesNewcastle’s Neighbourhood and Villages Site Specific Policies
16.91   The delivery of the sites identified in policies CS3 and CS4 are critical 
to achieving Newcastle
’s vision, particularly for housing, economic 
growth and creating sustainable communities. This section sets out the principles of development and the required infrastructure for delivering these sites. Assessments have been undertaken to consider sustainability, viability and deliverability. Masterplans must be submitted and approved by the Council. This recognises the need to plan new development comprehensively, ensuring it makes a positive contribution to the character of the area, and that access to facilities and services is provided. In addition to this developers will be required to:
 •  Provide a range of housing types. Particular attention should also be paid to the need to cater f
or families and an increasingly ageing 
population. All Neighbourhood and Village Growth Areas will be required to include 75% family homes.
 • Provide water management including sustainable drainage schemes  
  following the drainage hierarchy, giving priority to SuDS, measur
es  
  to ensure that flood risk is not increased both onsite and off-site  
  and, where possible, reduced over the lif
etime of the Plan.   
  Developers will be expected to discuss this requirement with   
  the Council and Northumbrian Water at an early stage, and to   
  demonstrate that the proposed solution will maximise the benefits to  
  the water environment.
 • Comprehensively plan green infrastructure to show ho
w a network of  
  multi- functional open spaces and links will be integrated into   
  the development area to achieve a range o
f aims including a net  
  gain in biodiversity and providing the necessary buffer
s between  
  these sites and the development. In addition, green infrastructure  
  should provide landscaping to integrate development into the   
  wider area and r
ecreational open space provision including children’s  
  play and allotments. A key feature will be to ensure that the   
  development area links with the adjoining countryside and creates an  
  enhanced recreational experience for adjoining communities.
 • Undertake a full Transport Assessment and provide nec
essary   
  measures, works and/or contributions to mitigate the impacts of  
  development on the transport network, including provision of and  
  access to sustainable modes of transport. Pedestrian and cycling  
  improvements will be required to integrate sites into the surr
ounding  
  area.
 • Provide a range of social infrastructure to meet the needs o
f the new  
  community, including local services and facilities, education provision  
  and access to adequate local health provision.
 • Undertake an ecological assessment and survey(s) to determine the

16.92   Newburn Riverside is located approximately 4 miles west of Ne
wcastle City Centre, 
near the villages of Newburn and Lemington. The area is a major brownfield 
opportunity which has good access to public transport, the Strategic Road Network, the River Tyne and surrounding countryside.
16.93
  The site has undergone a major reclamation programme and has benefited fr
om 
£46 million57 investment in reclamation and infrastructure. The Newcastle Unitary 
Development Plan58 allocated this site for employment as it was originally conceived 
as a modern industrial park. However, Newburn Riverside has experienced a slow take-up and has a high proportion of vacancies due to current market conditions and competing sites. Approximately 30 hectares of employment land is vacant.
16.94
  Newcastle’s ELR’s29 and SHLAAs28 recommend (in line with the NPPF) that the 
site should be de-allocated as it is unlikely to be delivered, and there is a greater need for housing. Policy AOC1 Newburn therefore allocates this site for residential development supported by a range of infrastructure, which will transform the area and will create a new sustainable urban neighbourhood.
16.95
  It is expected that the site (Figure 16.7) will deliver approximately 500 homes within the plan period and there is further capacity f
or housing beyond the plan period.
Policy AOC1 Newburn Land is allocated at Newburn (Figure 16.7) for residential development. Development within the allocated area is required to be brought forward in accordance with an approved masterplan to demonstrate a comprehensive and coordinated approach to site development and infrastructure provision and demonstrate how t-he following will be provided to ensure that each phase of development is sustainable. Development will be required to provide:
 1. A range of sizes, types and tenures of housing.
 
 2. For education provision for primary and secondary age school children to serv
e    
   the needs of the new and existing communities.
 3.  Access to and provision of local facilities and servic
es including shops and 
healthcare to serve the needs of the new and existing communities.
 4.  Road connections to the highways network and to existing communities and services.
 
 5.  Mitigation for the cumulative traffic impacts of the proposed development on the
 
highway network.
 6.  Measures to mitigate noise, vibration and visual impact of the Employment Areas to the east and w
est.
 7.  For the retention and development of rights of way, pedestrian r
outes and cycle 
routes to connect existing networks, green spaces, communities and local facilities, including improvements to the Riverside Park 
 8.  Protection and enhancement of important trees and hedgerows and ar

ecological and landscape importance.
 9. Necessary archaeological assessments.
 10. A design code to ensure development of distinctive neighbourhoods.
 11.  For open spaces to include access to formal and informal r
ecreational areas including 
sports, playing pitches and children’s play areas.
 12.  A Foul and Surface Water Drainage Strate
gy which demonstrates there is adequate 
foul and surface water capacity for the development with the aim of reducing flood risk and ensuring no deterioration of water quality.

16.105   Newcastle Great Park (NN4) comprises the existing dev
elopment area 
NN4d which includes site NN4a that is now allocated for housing and 
education uses; and in addition, the Neighbourhood Growth Area sites NN4b and NN4c both of which are now allocated for new homes.
16.106
  Site NN4d already benefits from a Masterplan and SPD (2006) and there is an outline planning consent linked to that.  The pr
ovisions of 
that SPD will remain a material consideration in the determination of planning applications within the defined area of  NN4d.  Promoting NN4a for housing development will necessitate a departure from that Masterplan and SPD (NN4a was previously allocated for employment uses).  The Comprehensive Masterplanning  required will ensure that the new allocation sites (NN4a, b and c) are planned to respond  to extant consents at the Great Park and the relevant parts of the existing Masterplan and SPD(2006). Masterplanning and phasing plans will be required to reflect the stage of the planning process that each component of NN4 has reached to ensure a comprehensive approach and timely delivery particularly in the early years of the Plan taking into account the phasing requirements of the Policy.  New Masterplanning will be required to include appropriate reservations of land at NN4a to enable connections from NN4b and KEA1 and explicitly deal with issues of connectivity and permeability.  These reservations are to ensure convenient road access from site NN4b and KEA1, at an early stage of its development, to the Great Park spine road, shops, services and other facilities.
16.107
  Development of NN4c will be phased to come forward between 2020-2025 to ensur
e that infrastructure is in place.  If NN4c can be delivered 
prior to 2020 the Council must be satisfied that the necessary local road, cycle and pedestrian connection, connection to the Strategic Highway Network and education provision can be provided as part of the development.
16.108
 It is expected that NN4a will deliver 880 homes and the Neighbourhood  
 Growth Area will deliver 600 homes within the Plan period and there is  
 further capacity for housing beyond the plan period (Figures 16.11

Newcastle International Airport16.115
   Newcastle International Airport is the principal international gateway into 
the Region and a ke
y economic growth driver. It is the largest airport in the 
North East, with 4.4 million customers in 2012 supporting 3,000 jobs on site and a further 5,000 across the region. The airport serves a key role as a major contributor to economic activity and regeneration in the North East and the wider north region. It provides access to air travel and to new and emerging markets for business, commerce and industry. Economic development and regeneration is encouraged by facilitating inward investment, and tourism is supported by providing access to UK destinations and attractions.
16.116
   For the local population of Gateshead and Newcastle, acces
s to Europe and 
worldwide destinations is provided for business, social and leisure purposes.
16.117    The airport is considered to be an important employment location for general emplo
yment uses and the Key Employment Site will be a premier 
business location in Newcastle’s portfolio of economic land. Specifically 10 ha net of land at Southside expansion site (KEAd) to be promoted for a large single user ‘Solus’ for B1 use. A Solus site is typically occupied by a large public or private organisation serving a national or international customer base, often providing head quarters accommodation in a high quality landscaped environment. Examples include The Sage, Newcastle Great Park and the Government Department for Work and Pensions at Longbenton.
16.118
   The Key Employment Area consists of New
castle Airport North (KEAa), 
which is allocated for airport related development and three sites to the south (KEAb), (KEAc) and (KEAd) where these restrictions do not apply. In particular site KEAd will be supported by the new Airport Access Road which will provide improved access to the A696.  In addition Policy NN4 requires reservations of land to be made at NN4a to enable suitable road connections to the facilities and services of Newcastle Great Park.
16.119
  Uses that directly relate to the operations or function of the airport include a wide range o
f facilities and infrastructure that is required to 
sustain and support an international airport. Such uses include those that will bring benefits to the operation and development of the airport, improve its role as a major contributor and stimulus to the North East economy. The uses are defined as:
 • Aircraft Apron,
 • Aircraft Maintenance, 
 • Airline sales, reservations and booking offices,
 • Airline training centres,
 • Aviation and vehicle storage facilities,
 • Avionics maintenance and supply,
 • Car hire operations and parking,

Gateshead C
entral Sub-Area
17.2   The Gateshead Central Sub-Area is the focus of shopping and 
commer
cial activity in Gateshead Centre, and the hub of the public 
transport network with bus and Metro connections to all parts of Tyneside. It extends from Regent Street/Charles Street north to Askew Road, and from Prince Consort Road east to the railway line.17. Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].227Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.3   The Sub-Area largely comprises buildings which date from the 
rede
velopment of the area in the 1960s and 70s, with later additions 
in the 1980s. The peripheral areas are generally older and there are a number of buildings of architectural interest which add character and interest to the local environment, notably: Walker Terrace/Regent Terrace Conservation Area, the former Co-op on Jackson Street, and the Old Post Office, Bank, Dispensary and Old Town Hall/Swinburne House along the northern boundary (within the Bridges Conservation Area).
228Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.4   Shopping is principally focused around three streets; West Street, Jackson 
Str
eet and High Street, with a range of small to medium sized shops offering 
convenience goods primarily serving the local population and some specific retailers serving a wider catchment. Significant change is required in the Centre to improve the quality, design, facilities and services it offers. This change is already underway with the redeveloped Trinity Square, providing new shops, student accommodation, cinema and healthcare facility, as well as a new public square and three new streets. It forms the new heart of Gateshead, providing the catalyst for further retail and leisure-led regeneration in the immediate area.
17.5
  The Gateshead Centre Regeneration Delivery Str
ategy ‘Fit for a City’ provides 
further guidance on the vision, masterplan and regeneration framework for Gateshead Centre, which has informed this chapter of the plan.
17.6
 In this Sub-Area we will continue to revitalise and concentr
ate the  shopping  
 and commercial area and create new and improv
ed green spaces and streets.  
 We will support growth by:
  •  Increasing the number and range of shops, creating a distinctive and div
erse mix of both ‘high street’ and independent and creative 
retailers.
  •  Revitalising the retail and commercial heart complemented by ne
w 
business, educational and leisure accommodation at Gateshead Quays and the Quayside, and new contemporary, urban, sustainable homes at Southern Gateway.
  •  Limiting through traffic in the Centre.
  •  Creating a high quality townscape which respects heritage assets and enhances their c
ontribution to the area.
  •  Providing a network of safe, green and pedestrian friendly r
outes 
and spaces that are well connected to destinations across Gateshead Centre, making it easy for people to walk and cycle between home, work, shops and leisure facilities.
17.7
  To be successful as a retail centre
, the Gateshead Central Sub-Area needs 
to improve the overall quality and range of its retail provision, including attracting more independent retailers and making provision for further complementary commercial and leisure uses.
17.8
  The redeveloped Trinity Square is an important step in revitalising Gateshead
 
Centre and will more effectively serve the needs of existing and future residents. It will also cater for a wider range of needs in terms of visitors, attracted by the leisure and cultural facilities in the area, and the increasing number of people working in and around the centre. The population living within the wider centre has increased significantly over the last decade and this will continue over the coming years with new student accommodation and up to 1,000 new homes at the Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site, located immediately south of the Gateshead Central Sub-Area. In meeting this diverse range of needs, the aspiration is to allow the centre to evolve to become a more distinctive and vibrant retail centre.
17.9
  The Primary Shopping Area is refocussed northwards, mo
ving away from the 
southern part of High Street, where shopping provision and footfall have been in decline for some years. Re-defining and refocussing the Primary Shopping Area in this way creates a more concentrated retail core and a better circuit for shoppers (Figure 17.1).229Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy GC1 Gateshead Central Sub-Area
Regenerating Gateshead’s shopping and commercial area and enhancing accessibility to and through the Gateshead Central Sub-Area will be achieved by:
 1.   Protecting the Primary Shopping Area by:
  a)  Permitting changes of use within the ground floor of the Primary  
   Retail Frontages where:
   i. The proposed use is within use classes A2, A3 and A4, and
   ii.  The proposed change does not result in a significant break in the  
    continuity of A1 retail frontage of 3 units or more
.
  b)  Ensuring the proportion of ground floor non A1 uses in a primary  
   frontage block does not exceed 30% of its total length, either   
   currently or as a result of the proposal.
 2.    Any proposal for large floorplate retail development, which cannot be  
  accommodated within the Primary Shopping Area, must be located in  
  the High Street (South) Area which benefits from a high level of   
  pedestrian and transport accessibility and strong links with the Primary  
  Shopping Area.
 3. Improving the environment and accessibility b
y:
  i.  Delivering a boulevard style streetscape along the section of  
    Askew Road between Prince Consort Road and Oakw
ellgate.  
    Development that incorporates or is adjacent to this route must  
    incorporate design principles that help deliver the boulevard  
    approach,
  ii.  Removing traffic from West Street between Nelson Str
eet and  
    Askew Road and re-locating and enhancing the existing bus   
    priority measures to maintain a route to Gateshead Interchange  
    and reducing the impact of traffic and improving the public realm  
    along Jackson Street,
  iii.   Improving conditions for pedestrians and exploring opportunities  
    to widen pedestrian space at the junctions of Nelson Street with  
    Prince Consort Road and West Street,
  iv.   Upgrading the existing pedestrian crossings on Askew R
oad   
    between West Street and Oakwellgate,
  v.  Upgrading the existing pedestrian crossing facilities at the eastern  
    end of Charles Street,
  vi.   Improving conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, along High  
    Street, Swan Street, and across a redeveloped Gateshead   
    Boulevard to provide a new link to the Quays and Baltic Sub-  
    Area; along the east-west pedestrian routes linking the Old Town  
    Hall Square eastwards to Oakwellgate and beyond to the Baltic  
    Business Quarter and Gateshead Quays; and over the Tyne Bridge,
  vii.  Upgrading cycling facilities to complete the Great North Cy
cleway,  
    providing: improved cycle lanes on West Str
eet between Charles  
    Street and Jackson Street and an improved link between   
    Swinburne Street Askew Road, and
  viii.  Reconfiguring the road layout at Oakwellgate to provide: a mor
e  
    direct pedestrian link to Gateshead Quays and the Baltic Business  
    Quarter; and opportunities to develop buildings which can form  
    streets, enclose space and enable a more urban streetscape to be  
    created.230Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies 4. Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and the network of  
  public open spaces by:
  i. Requiring major developments to incorporate living roof
s, where  
   technically feasible,
  ii. Requiring developments, adjacent to the primary and secondary  
   pedestrian routes, to provide street trees, and
  iii.  Encouraging temporary green infrastructure on sites that will not  
   be developed in the short term.
 5. Requiring all major developments to manage surface water eff
ectively  
  by:
  i. Considering the potential to slow and reduce stormwater flows  
   though the use of green roofs, permeable paving, r
ainwater   
   harvesting and attenuation measures, 
  ii. Considering existing surface water flow paths, and
  iii A Foul and Surface Water Drainage Strate
gy which demonstrates  
   there is adequate foul and surface water capacity for the   
   development with the aim of reducing flood risk and ensuring no  
   deterioration of water quality.
 6. Enhancing Walker and Regent Terrac
es through a coordinated approach  
  to repair and enhance the buildings; re-instate gardens and railings;  
  resurface the streets and rationalise car parking in accor
dance with the  
  Conservation Area Management Strategy.
 7. The allocation of three sites for mixed-use development: Old To
wn Hall  
  Area, High Street Area and Jackson Street Development Opportunity  
  Sites (GC2).
17.10   Very few blocks in the primary retail frontages are entir
ely A1 use. 
However, primary retail frontages need to be protected to retain the 
retail character of the centre. Accordingly, there will be a presumption against proposals for change of use from A1 retail within individual blocks where the percentage of A1 frontage is already below, or would fall below, the 70% threshold set. Outside the primary retail frontages we will seek to balance need to retain vitality and vibrancy of central Gateshead both during the day and into the evening.
17.11
  The High Street (south) Area lies within the Southern Gateway Sub- Area, where long-term aspirations ar
e for primarily residential-led 
redevelopment, with active uses, including retail, at ground-floor level. This policy has been included in this Sub-Area chapter because it links to the Primary Retail Frontages policy. Should there be a requirement for a site to accommodate a large floorplate retail proposal, which is appropriate to but cannot be accommodated within the identified Primary Shopping Area, priority will be given to the High Street (south) Area in terms of a sequential approach. There are discrete areas of land in Council ownership that can accommodate a large floorplate in this area. Unlike other potential edge-of-centre sites which are separated from the centre by dominant highway infrastructure, this area benefits from being immediately adjacent to the Primary Shopping Area and is highly accessible for pedestrians and public transport.231Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.12   The main roads both around the edge and through Gateshead Centre 
carry a high v
olume of traffic to the detriment of pedestrians and 
cyclists. It will be important to improve connectivity to and through the area for pedestrians, cyclists and sustainable transport users. In order to better integrate Gateshead Central with adjoining commercial, arts, leisure and residential areas, through traffic will be directed around the Centre and pedestrian and cycle routes will be enhanced. Improved pedestrian and cycle connectivity will reduce the dominance of, and severance caused by the road network, while also ensuring vehicles needing to access the Urban Core can do so.
17.13
  The Council will deliver, with its partners a boulevard style streetscape
 
along the Gateshead Highway to Oakwellgate, and along Askew Road to Redheugh Bridge. The boulevard approach will seek to humanise streets, with active frontages, high quality design, improved pedestrian and cycle crossings, street trees and improved public realm.
17.14
  Jackson Street is currently accessible to general tr
affic. The opening 
of Bewick Way as a pedestrian gateway into Trinity Square has strengthened Jackson Street’s position as a key shopping throughfare in Gateshead Centre. Acknowledging this, the objective is to make Jackson Street a more pedestrian friendly and attractive shopping environment.
17.15
  Removing traffic from West Street between Lambton Str
eet and Askew 
Road will enable this area to become an enclosed pedestrian-friendly environment. However, this is also an important link in the local bus network and the existing bus priority will be re-located to maintain a route to Gateshead Interchange.
17.16
  Options will be explored to reduce the capacity of Askew R
oad between 
Prince Consort Road and Oakwellgate with a view to defining a long term strategy for this route. A number of factors will guide options, including the likely closure of High Level Bridge to road traffic and the opportunities provided by the provision of additional cross-river capacity to the east and west of the Urban Core. A wider review of traffic movement in the Tyne Bridgeheads area (including the Oakwellgate junction) will be undertaken as part of this process.
17.17
  The Primary Pedestrian Routes running through the centre of this Sub- Ar
ea provide vital connections to the residential areas to the south and 
the commercial and leisure areas to the north. The improvements along the routes will give pedestrians and cyclists increased priority. 
17.18
   The upgrade of existing pedestrian crossings will pro
vide easier 
movement for pedestrians. This will include single phase crossings with wide pedestrian crossing areas and the removal of barriers. Each will be looked at on its individual merits.
17.19
  The Gateshead Interchange is the main arrival point for bus and Metro services into the Urban Cor
e south of the River Tyne, bringing people 
into the Sub-Area and also providing ongoing bus connectivity within the Urban Core (e.g. Quaylink) and out to the surrounding area (e.g. Centrelink to the Metrocentre). The sense of arrival and connectivity to the surrounding retail and commercial space at the Gateshead Interchange will be improved by increasing pedestrian space, removing pedestrian barriers and creating more direct pedestrian routes to the surrounding streets.232Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.20   Oakwellgate, located just south of the Tyne Bridge approach, is currently  
the point at which high volumes of north-south (A167) and east-west 
(A184) traffic merge. It is dominated by highway infrastructure, and the large volumes of traffic which use it, which restricts opportunities for development and severely impairs vital pedestrian and cycle movement between the Gateshead Centre Primary Shopping Area and its major leisure and office destinations at Gateshead Quays and Baltic Business Quarter. The long-term aim for this area is to re-configure the road layout to help unlock new development sites and bring about the necessary development to create more direct pedestrian links to Gateshead Quays and the Baltic Business Quarter. Further work is required.
17.21
  Walker and Regent Terrac
es are located on the south-western fringe 
of the Gateshead Central Sub-Area and comprise two mid-nineteenth century formal terraces and associated backlands. The terraces are Grade II and II* listed and are in use for commercial purposes. The site is in a number of private ownerships and the priority is to work with existing owners and occupiers to enhance listed terraces.
17.22
  The Conservation Area Management Strategy for the Walk
er Terrace/ 
Regent Terrace Conservation Area should be referred to when making changes to the buildings and their setting. The setting and enhancement of Regent Terrace will be enhanced by achieving a careful balance between vehicles and pedestrians. There is a desire to re-introduce a green link such as the reinstatement of the formal front gardens along the length of the street and the need to provide disabled access to the properties. This will contribute to the formation of the Regent Street Green Infrastructure Corridor. The use of natural materials and reference to evidence of the historic plan layout and design of the terrace including railings and street furniture will ensure that the scheme enhances the setting of the listed terrace. The Council will look to secure funding to carry out the works. The focus in this Sub-Area will be on creating new, small scale green spaces, introducing street trees and planting and improving connections to the wider Urban Green Infrastructure Network particularly to Windmill Hills Park via Regent Street.
17.23
  The Regent Street Green Infrastructure C
orridor is located along 
the southern edge of the Gateshead Central Sub-Area and forms an important link in the wider Urban Green Infrastructure Network. The characteristics of Urban Green Infrastructure Corridors are informed by the surrounding environment, which in this case is Regent Terrace and the highway network, resulting in a surfaced path including trees and planting. The improvements will also provide the opportunity to contribute to the enhancement of Regent Terrace, the conservation area within which it sits, and complement the restoration of the terrace and the land to the front.
17.24
   Living roofs can play a key part in helping Gateshead Centr
e adapt to 
climate change. They can bring the dual benefit of limiting the impact of climate change by keeping the centre cooler and reducing energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. Living roofs can provide additional living space and also enhance biodiversity, reduce flood risk (by absorbing heavy rainfall), provide insulation and improve the appearance of Gateshead Centre.233Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.25    Surface water management is also particularly important given the steep 
topography and lar
ge areas of impermeable surfaces. Surface water 
flows, originating from the south, follow the gradient towards the River Tyne, directed by combined and storm water sewers and highways. Surface water collects in locations where the gradient is interrupted, particularly on Askew Road. It will be important to control and reduce surface water runoff to manage flood risk and ensure efficient use of the public sewerage infrastructure. Developers should follow the drainage hierarchy set out in CS17, giving priority to SuDS, using green roofs, permeable paving and rainwater harvesting to manage surface water at source and incorporate attenuation measures, particularly to manage flows into Askew Road.
17.26    Three development opportunities have been identified within the Gateshead Centr 
al Sub-Area; High Street Area, Jackson Street and the 
Old Town Hall area. The development of these sites over the plan period will complement the new Trinity Square, provide additional space for shops, services, cafes, and restaurants, and play an essential role in creating a distinctive and vibrant retail heart for Gateshead Centre (Figure 17.2).
Policy GC2 Gateshead Central Development Opportunity Sites The following sites are allocated for mixed-use development:
 1. Old Town Hall Area where development will:
  i.   Encompass a mix of the following principal uses: Retail (A1, A2, A3, A4), Offic

© Crown copyright and database rights 2015 Ordnance Survey Gateshead Council [100019132].235Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.27   The Old Town Hall Area contains some of the most attractive buildings in  
Gateshead Centre which together form an important gateway into the Sub- 
Area. The site consists of the Old Town Hall, Swinburne House and the Old Dispensary all of which are grade II listed and primarily in use for culture, leisure and office purposes. The site is wholly owned by the Council. Delivery is anticipated to take place in the medium term.
17.28
  The Old Town Hall area provides richness to the urban fabric and c
ontinuity 
with the past. There are great opportunities for the creative re-use of historic buildings, and imaginative new design within their townscape context. Uses which guarantee their long-term care and maintenance will be encouraged.
17.29
  The spaces and setting of buildings are also important. They make a major contribution to the e
xisting and proposed public realm. These spaces should 
be enhanced through public realm improvements and / or sensitive new development on adjacent sites.
17.30
  The Old Town Hall and Swinburne House are located in the Bridges Conservation Area and a C
onservation Area Management Strategy has been 
prepared. Draft Conservation Statements have also been prepared for the two buildings to ensure that their significance is protected during future planning and development activities.
17.31
  The High Street Area is located on the corner of High Street and Jackson Street, at the heart o
f Gateshead Centre’s shopping area and is a gateway 
into the new Trinity Square. Its redevelopment will provide modern retail accommodation and at the same time enhance Bewick Way, an important new connection between Jackson Street and Trinity Square. The site is owned by the Council. Delivery is anticipated to take place in the short term, however this is dependent on demand for new retail and commercial premises following the opening of Trinity Square.
236Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.32   Jackson Street in particular has potential to be a prime retail space as part 
of the revitalised Primary Shopping Ar
ea. Only part of the site is owned by 
the Council and land assembly may be necessary to achieve the aspiration outlined above. Delivery is anticipated to take place in the medium to long term. A comprehensive and coordinated approach to site development will be required at Jackson Street. There will be a presumption against piecemeal development that will prejudice the wider development of the site.
Southern Gateway Sub-Area
17.33
  Southern Gateway, the most southerly edge of the Urban Core, wr
aps 
round Gateshead Centre to the east and south, extending as far 
east as the A184 Park Lane/Park Road. It marks the transition from the residential neighbourhoods of Gateshead into its shopping and commercial centre.
17.34
  The Sub-Area is made up of three distinct localities. The area to the south of Aske
w Road comprises mainly homes including medium- rise 
blocks on Prince Consort Road, and the Windmill Hills housing. The notable exception in this area is the former Windmill Hills School (latterly nursing home), a grade II listed building. The area to the west of the Gateshead Highway is the focus for Gateshead’s civic functions including the Civic Centre, Police Station and Law Courts. High Street (south), which is also in this locality, is a shopping area in transition with many dilapidated buildings and some vacant sites. To the east of the Gateshead Highway are the Tynegate Precinct office blocks, Chandless housing estate and a number of cleared brownfield sites, including the former Freight Depot. These sites are where the majority of change in the Southern Gateway will be concentrated.
17.35
   The Sub-Area developed in Victorian times with a dense pattern of streets surrounding the to
wn centre. Post-war redevelopment saw many 
of them replaced with major new roads and new housing estates in a mixture of high and low-rise blocks. The form of development and the highway infrastructure, prioritising the movement of vehicles, have led to a disjointed environment.
17.36
  In this Sub-Area the Exemplar Neighbourhood is the priority as it will deliver regener
ation and a new housing offer in the Urban Core. We will 
support growth by:
  •  Creating a new residential neighbourhood which will offer high-quality urban housing targeted principally at f
amilies mixed with 
uses appropriate to an Urban Core location,
  •  Integrating central Gateshead with its surrounding localities, by r
emoval of intrusive Gateshead Highway infrastructure and 
the creation of new attractive pedestrian links from all the surrounding areas, and
  •  Creating a Green Infrastructure Network, linking existing and new
 
parks, spaces and routes with the adjacent Sub-Areas.237Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy SG1 Southern Gateway Sub-Area 
Promoting new family neighbourhoods and reconnecting Gateshead’s urban communities to its centre will be achieved by:
 1. Improving the environment and accessibility b
y:
  i.  Providing a new bus, cycle and pedestrian link under the existing Gateshead Highway viaduct (until demolition), r
econnecting 
Sunderland Road with High Street (south) at ground level,
  ii.  Improving the pedestrian crossing facilities at the junction of Charles Str
eet and High West Street, 
  iii. Improving the pedestrian crossing facilities on Arthur Street,
  iv.  Improving pedestrian crossing facilities at the corner of R
egent 
Street and Prince Consort Road connecting enhanced green space with Windmill Hills Park,
  v.  Removing the Gateshead Highway and viaduct, and providing a tree lined City Boule
vard,
  vi.  Providing a boulevard style streetscape along the Gateshead Highway to Oakw
ellgate, and along Askew Road to Redheugh 
Bridge. Development along this route must include design principles that help deliver the boulevard approach,
  vii.  Improved gateways at Durham Road/Gateshead Highway (City
 
Boulevard, south junction); and Park Lane/Gateshead Highway (City Boulevard, central junction); by the removal of the elevated highway viaduct and remodelling of the junctions to create new development plots with better pedestrian and cycle links,
  viii.  Improving the road junction at Askew Road/Prince C
onsort Road by 
developing potential sites around this junction to provide public realm improvements including improved pedestrian and cycle crossing facilities, 
  ix.    Improving Bensham Road by remodelling the junction to create impr
oved public realm and pedestrian and cycle crossings, and
  x.   Upgrading cycling facilities to complete the Great North Cy
cleway, 
providing new lanes on High West Street between Durham Road and Charles Street.
 2.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and the network of public open spac
es by:
  i.  Requiring major development to incorporate living roof
s, where 
technically feasible, 
  ii.    Requiring developments, adjacent to the primary and secondary pedestrian routes, to pr
ovide street trees,
  iii.  Encouraging temporary green infrastructure on sites that will not be de
veloped in the short term, including Askew Road West and 
Askew Road East,
  iv.  Requiring development to contribute towards the establishment of
 
the Riverside Park to Windmill Hills Park Urban Green Infrastructure Corridor, including a new pedestrian route across Askew Road and an improved pedestrian route under the rail line, and
  v.  Improving the existing public green space at the northern end of High W
est Street, between Regent Court and the Civic Centre.
  238Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies 3.  Bringing the former Windmill Hills nursing home back into use by 
ensuring development:
  i.  Includes the following principal uses: Hotels (C1), Residential (C3), and Assembly and Leisure (D2), and 
  ii.  Retains, repairs and where appropriate, restor
es the grade II listed 
building; is sensitive to, and takes advantage of, its prominent position; and provides active frontages, including onto Windmill Hills Park.
 4. The allocation of three sites for mixed use development:
  i. Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site (SG2), and 
  ii.  Askew Road East and Askew Road West De
velopment Opportunity 
Sites. (SG3).
17.37   For the whole of the Southern Gateway, it will be important to improve
 
connectivity to and through the area for pedestrians, cyclists and sustainable transport users. In order to better integrate the Southern Gateway with the shopping and commercial areas, pedestrian and cycle routes should be enhanced. Improved pedestrian and cycle connectivity will reduce the dominance of, and severance caused by, the road network while also ensuring vehicles needing to access the Urban Core can do so.
17.38
  The primary objective of new crossings is to enable pedestrians and cyclists to mo
ve between key destinations along safe and attractive 
routes. While simple interventions, they are linked in the wider movement network and are particularly important in linking green spaces that form part of the Green Infrastructure Network.
17.39
  The Primary and Secondary Pedestrian Routes which run through the Sub-Area pro
vide vital connections from the residential areas to the 
retail, commercial and leisure areas to the north. The improvements along the Primary Pedestrian Route will give pedestrians and cyclists increased priority over vehicles across the busy network.
17.40
  The existing A167 Gateshead Highway viaduct is a physical and psychological barrier to east-west mo
vements for pedestrians and 
cyclists; is detrimental to development and regeneration because of the visual impact; and results in air quality and noise issues because of the dominance of motor vehicles. Removal of the viaduct offers the potential to create a high quality, usable and human-scale street in the form of a City Boulevard.
17.41
  The transformation to the City Boulevard is a long term aspiration for the C
ouncil, with the primary funding source being the Council. It will 
be delivered by the Council in partnership with the private sector. The City Boulevard will become a gateway into Gateshead and a positive stimulus for development and regeneration. The implementation of this project will in turn deliver improvements to the gateways of both Durham Road and Park Lane. The boulevard approach seeks to humanise streets, with active frontages, high quality design, improved pedestrian and cycle crossings, street trees and improved public realm.239Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.42   There are six gateways in the Southern Gateway Sub-Area: Askew R oad, 
Prince Consort Road, Bensham Road and Askew Road West, all of which 
are dominated by vehicular traffic and offer a low quality environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Each of these gateways will have its roundabout systems replaced, with a new crossroad junction at Park Lane and a new staggered junction at Durham Road. This will release land capable of accommodating new development, and will allow for the improvement of the pedestrian and cyclist environment by creating better crossing facilities and an improved public realm including an urban tree-lined street with footways and active ground floor uses within new buildings.
17.43
  There are also opportunities around the Askew Road Gateway ar
ea 
for junction improvements, and new development on surrounding sites that will create an urbanised streetscape and buildings with enhanced pedestrian and cycle crossing facilities; additional and improved footways; and active ground floor uses within new built form. Completion of commercial development at ‘The Point’ within the Ochre Yards development will also help to improve this gateway.
17.44
  Bensham Road Gateway is an opportunity for a ‘green space crossr
oads’. 
We will explore the potential to re-model this junction to provide additional space for improving the pedestrian and cyclist environment with enhanced crossing points, wider footways and additional space for soft landscaping to link green spaces as part of the network in the Sub- Area and beyond
17.45
  The focus in this Sub-Area will be creating a new Urban Green Infrastructur
e Corridor through the Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site 
and between Windmill Hills Park and Riverside Park. Windmill Hills Park and Riverside Park are two key green spaces within Gateshead Centre, however pedestrian and cycle accessibility to them is poor. These spaces will be connected to the wider area through the establishment of an Urban Green Infrastructure Network, and in particular in this Sub- Area the Riverside Park - Windmill Hills Park Urban Green Infrastructure Corridor.
17.46
  The existing green landscaping at the north eastern corner of the Civic Centre and that to the w
estern side of Regent Court will be enhanced to 
form more usable and accessible public green space. This will also create a new focal point and destination on the Primary Pedestrian Route. The aim is to expand the new city park further as redevelopment allows on the corner of Charles Street and High West Street.
17.47
  The Former Windmill Hills nursing home site is situated in a prominent position in the Urban Core ov
erlooking Windmill Hills Park. The site 
consists of a grade II listed building that is vacant and in a deteriorating condition. Bringing the building back into use will encourage its continued repair and maintenance, and prevent the building deteriorating further. The building is unused and is in private ownership. It is anticipated the site will de developed in the short term though a private developer.240Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.48   The Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site is bounded by the A184 (Park Lane) to the 
north and east, and Sunderland Road to the south, with the Gateshead High
way 
(A167) and the Metro and Sunderland railway lines dividing the area. It includes the cleared former Freight Depot site to the east of the railway and the area to the west of the railway comprising the Chandless housing estate, Tynegate Precinct offices, open space, the former Lindisfarne school site, a former glassworks, an operational bus depot and the Hilda House office block.
17.49
  The site is highly accessible by bus and Metro and well located in relation to the
 
Gateshead Central and the Quays and Baltic Sub-Areas. Successful housing-led regeneration has already taken place nearby through the Housing Market Renewal programme. At St James Village, more than 700 new homes have been delivered over the last ten years, greatly improving the choice of private homes and attracting new residents into the area (Figure 17.3).
Policy SG2 The Exemplar Neighbourhood Key Site
 1. The Exemplar Neighbourhood is allocated for a minimum of 1000 homes (C3) at  
  an average of 50 dwellings per hectare acr
oss the site.
 2. Development will provide a new sustainable neighbourhood through:
  i. Provision of small-scale ancillary uses that support the needs of the new   
   community including small shops, cafes and community facilities along    
   primary pedestrian routes and other main routes,
  ii. Mixed-use development which will be directed to the ground floors     
   of development on sites along the route of the future City Boulevar
d,
  iii. Developing a scheme that achieves “green” against all Building for L
ife 12   
   questions or equivalent,
  iv. Provision of good quality accessible e
xternal private or semi private space,
  v. Creation of the Exemplar Neighbourhood Urban Green Infrastructure Corridor
,  
   meeting the f
ollowing criteria: minimum corridor width of 10m, encompassing  
   a footpath with a minimum width of 3m, an avenue of trees and at least 2   
   usable multifunctional open green spaces,
  vi. Creation of the Primary Pedestrian Route, integrated with the gr
een     
   infrastructure corridor, and creating the pedestrian and cycle bridge o
ver the  
   rail line and a pedestrian and  cycle crossing at Park Lane,
  vii.   Provision of a series of connected green and/or public spac
es, forming part of  
   the key pedestrian and cycle routes that connect to locations outside the   
   neighbourhood, and
  viii.  Provision of communal parking spaces for car clubs and electric car hook up  
   points to promote sustainable transport.
 3. On Council-owned land development will:
  i. Achieve the minimum space standards set out in English Partnerships Quality  
   Standards: Delivering Quality Places, Revised: from Nov
ember 2007 or    
   equivalent,
  ii. Use of Building Research Establishment Green Guide materials at ratings   
   between A to C or equivalent, and
  iii. Deliver a good level of sustainability required b
y relevant government    
   schemes/guidance, aspiring to achieve zero carbon.
 4. Any development layout and design on the site should be flexible enough to   
  complement the future development of the City Boulevard.
 5. In accordance with Policy GC1, proposals within the High Street (south) Ar
ea    
  may also incorporate large floorplate retail development which cannot be    
  accommodated within the Primary Shopping Area. Such proposals should, in    
  accordance with urban design principles set out in Policy UC12 and the Exemplar  
  Neighbourhood SPD, be part of a mixed use development of an appropriate high  
  density urban form.241Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.50   The Exemplar Neighbourhood is allocated for approximately 1000 new 
homes, predominantly f
or families and it will contribute to increasing the 
overall supply of homes in the Urban Core. The neighbourhood will be an exemplar of urban housing, differentiating itself from other housing in the North East by combining excellent levels of design and sustainability in a central urban location to create a highly desirable neighbourhood, providing distinctive and innovative homes in the heart of Gateshead and Newcastle. The development will provide a network of streets providing safe, accessible and legible routes for pedestrians and cyclists. This will improve connectivity from east Gateshead, westwards through the site and across the road and rail infrastructure into the rest of the Southern Gateway and Gateshead Centre, and northwards towards the riverside areas.Potential Development Plot

wide enough to create a safe, attractive and green environment that has 
multi-functional benefits, including noise filtration, visual screening, shade and biodiversity enhancement. It may also incorporate wetland features which provide sustainable drainage, as well as adding to the landscape and biodiversity value of the corridor. The width necessary to achieve these objectives will vary significantly depending upon location, but will be a minimum of 10 metres.
17.52
  The aim is to achieve innovative and best practice housing acros
s the 
Exemplar Neighbourhood. Building for Life 12 (CABE, Design Council) principles will be applied to all new housing on the site with the aim of securing an attractive, functional and sustainable place. The Council aspires to deliver high standards of design and sustainability and will require new development on Council owned land to provide minimum space standards, ensuring adequate space is provided inside and outside of the home, and high standards of sustainability and energy efficiency, as set out in the policy.
17.53
  A new pedestrian, cycle and public transport route will extend the line of Sunderland R
oad across the route of the new Boulevard, connecting 
to the southern end of High Street. New open spaces will be created on this route, forming part of the wider Urban Green Infrastructure Network. 
17.54
  Much of the site is in Council ownership. The East of Highway and
 
Freight Depot areas are to be delivered through the Joint Venture partner, Evolution Gateshead, and include the development of a pedestrian and cycle bridge over the rail line. There are a large number of active businesses in the High Street (south) Area, and the Council will continue to support the area and its businesses, particularly through improvements of the built form. The Council will continue to examine the potential for further property acquisitions particularly on the western side of High Street. The private sector will play an essential role in delivering development and infrastructure on the site, in particular those areas not developed through the Joint Venture partner.
17.55
  The Exemplar Neighbourhood is the focus for significant development opportunity and public/private in
vestment. Comprehensive and 
coordinated development will be required (policy CS2) to realise the regeneration potential and to meet the Plan objectives. Further guidance can be found in the Exemplar Neighbourhood SPD which will be used in the negotiations for development in this area to ensure a coordinated planned approach. This framework sets out development principles ensuring high quality design while allowing flexibility for changing markets.
17.56
  Two Development Opportunity Sites have been identified in the Southern Gate
way Sub-Area: Askew Road (east) and Askew Road (west). 
The focus in the Southern Gateway is on residential led development, however it is important to recognise the opportunity for providing a broader mix of uses in the area given its proximity to the shopping and commercial provision in the Gateshead Central Sub-Area (Figure 17.4).243Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy SG3 Southern Gateway Development Opportunity Sites
The following sites are allocated for mixed-use development:
 1. Askew Road (east) where development will:
  i.  Encompass a mix of the following principal uses: Hotels (C1), Residential (C3) and As
sembly and Leisure (D2),
  ii.  Be urban in form, including active frontages adjacent to the footpath on Ask
ew Road and take account of the ‘boulevard approach’ along 
Askew Road, and
  iii.  Be sensitive to the setting of the Bridges Conservation Area and conf
orm to the Conservation Statements and Conservation Area 
Character Appraisal.
 2. Askew Road (west) where development will:
  i.  Encompass a mix of the following principal uses: Hotels (C1), Residential (C3) and As
sembly and Leisure (D2), 
  ii.  Be urban in form, including active frontages adjacent to the footpath and tak
e account of the ‘boulevard style streetscape’ approach along 
Askew Road, and
  iii.  Provide a green infrastructure link including improv

  Askew Road (west) is a major gateway into the Urban Core
. The site 
is vacant and has the potential to provide a range of development opportunities. The site is Council owned and it is anticipated that it will be developed in the medium term by a private developer.
Quays and Baltic Sub-Area
17.59
  This Sub-Area is on the south side of River Tyne from just east of the 
R
edheugh Bridge to Baltic Place, and back up the slope of the Baltic 
Business Quarter to the A184 Park Lane.
17.60   This Sub-Area has a strong and layered historic legacy. It includes the site o
f the Roman settlement and bridge, and the later medieval town, 
which developed from a village to a significantly sized urban settlement. The area has a long history as a port, and became a focus for industrial activity in the 19th century. Today, the area is characterised by the legacy of the rail development, and one of the most recognisable features of the area is the overlapping series of railway viaducts, arches and bridges. This is reinforced by the large former railway engineering sheds at Greenesfield, the King Edward VII rail bridge and most significantly, by the High Level and Tyne Bridges, which span the River Tyne at the top of the gorge.
17.61
  The renaissance of the area began in the late 1980s with the r
egeneration of the north bank, followed by the transformation of 
the south bank in the 1990s and 2000s. It now offers a wide range of activities and uses including galleries, music venues, hotels, bars and restaurants which have made the area a key leisure, culture and tourism destination. There are also many offices, businesses and apartment blocks. Gateshead College has recently moved its campus to the Quays area.
17.62
  In this Sub-Area Gateshead Quays is the priority. It will deliver major regener
ation and provides the space for commercial and leisure-led 
mixed uses. We will support growth by:
  •  Continuing to create and improve the place for people to liv
e, 
work and visit,
  •  Providing additional high quality development of business tourism and cultur
al attractions,
  •  Providing large-scale development, with the potential for a
 
conference venue to expand our business tourism offer, together with large-scale commercially-led development,
  •  Providing an improved and integrated Urban Gr
een Infrastructure 
Network by enhancing existing green spaces including Riverside Park and providing new multifunctional green infrastructure as part of new developments, and
  •  Exploiting the River Tyne’s potential and facilities for leisure use of
 
the water.245Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy QB1 Quays and Baltic Sub-Area
Promoting major regeneration of the Quays and Baltic Sub-Area for a diverse mixof cultural, commercial and leisure-led uses will be achieved by:
 1. Improving the environment and accessibility b
y:
  i. Providing a safe and legible primary pedestrian route from Gateshead  
   Primary Shopping Area to Gateshead Quays via West Street,      
   Wellington Street, Hills Street, Brandling Street and Church Street,
  ii.   Completing the Great North Cycleway by impro
ving cycle and     
   pedestrian facilities between Askew Road, Tyne Bridge and thr
ough the  
   Bridges Conservation Area,
  iii.   Improving the accessibility and safety of sec
ondary pedestrian routes  
   from the riverside to and through Riverside Park and Gateshead    
   Central Sub-Area, including the re-instatement of Bankwell Lane and   
   the creation of a secondary route between Abbots Road and South   
   Shore Road,
  iv.   Improving the Mill Road Gateway through: improv
ed pedestrian and   
   cycling facilities; and a streetscape and built form surrounding the Mill  
   Road / Hawks Road junction that allows for greater pedestrian priority,  
   a sense of enclosure to give the space around the junction stronger   
   definition and a high quality built form that is complementary to new  
    surrounding buildings, and
  v.    Creating a continuous recreational riverside route along the riv
er’s   
   edge that is between 10-30 metres in width where possible.
 2.  Enhancing the Urban Green Infrastructure Network and the network of   
  public open spaces by:
  i. Improving the Riverside Park’s existing space
, signage and lighting to   
   create safe and legible routes from the park to the riverside and    
   improvements to Keelman’s Way,
  ii.   Requiring major developments to incorporate living roof
s, where    
   technically feasible,
  iii.   Requiring developments adjacent to the primary and secondary    
   pedestrian routes, to provide street trees, and
  iv.   Encouraging temporary green infrastructure on sites that will not be   
   developed in the short term.
 3.  Requiring development to provide improv
ements to the Gateshead Quay  
  Wall to ensure its structural integrity and mitigate future flood risk taking  
  account of the Gateshead Quays Wall Condition Survey and Climate    
  Change Adaptation Strategy.
 4.  The allocation of 6 sites for mixed-use development:
  i. Gateshead Quays Key Site (QB2)
  ii.   Hawks Road, Pipewellgate, Hudson Street, The Point and the Baltic    
   Business Quarter Development Opportunity Sites (QB3)246Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.63   Walking and cycling will be encouraged on the Quays. Improved access 
for cyclists from Gateshead Primary Shopping Area to the Quays would also pr
ovide access to the Strategic Cycle Routes, including links over 
Gateshead Millennium Bridge.
17.64   In the short term, key routes have been identified to improv
e the links 
between the Gateshead Quays and Gateshead Central sub-areas. A safe and legible route from Gateshead Central to the riverside via West Street, Wellington Street, Hills Street, Brandling Street and Church Street would encourage greater pedestrian movement and improve permeability.
17.65
  Other improvements include the creation of a new pedestrian and cycle
 
link to allow the routeing of Keelman’s Way along the southern edge of the river and improve accessibility to Riverside Park from the river. The creation of a green infrastructure link between the riverside and Windmill Hills Park will reconnect the Bridges Conservation Area with Riverside Park by re-instating the Bankwell Lane route. The creation of a new route between Abbot’s Road and South Shore Road will extend this link to the riverside.
17.66
  There is only one gateway within this Sub-Area. It is the Mill Road Gateway, located near Gateshead C
ollege at the junction of Hawks 
Road, Quarryfield Road and Mill Road. This area marks the transition between the older industrial area of East Gateshead and the newer developments associated with Baltic Business Quarter and Gateshead Quays. It is currently surrounded by a mix of development, including derelict industrial units and Gateshead College Baltic Campus. The gateway is dominated by the highways infrastructure and while there are pedestrian and cycle facilities around the junction, the expanse of carriageway does not provide an attractive environment. The transitional state of the built form also presents a disjointed urban form with many poor quality buildings and routes.
17.67
  Green infrastructure in this Sub-Area includes the River Tyne which supports a c
olony of inland breeding kittiwakes, is a designated 
local wildlife site and wildlife corridor and forms part of the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network. There is good quality existing green infrastructure and public realm; however, linkages and usage need to be improved and increased. Areas of previously developed land such as that at Baltic Business Quarter have developed considerable biodiversity value, as well as providing multifunctional benefits such as informal accessible green space and climate improvement.
17.68
  A review of the structural stability and an appropriate Climate Change
 
Adaptation Strategy for the Gateshead Quays wall has been undertaken, considering the sensitivity to increased tidal flood risk due to the impact of climate change over the next 100 years. The review assesses the residual life of sections of the wall and options for renewal and mitigation measures. It provides a coordinated approach to improving the condition of the wall and recommends heightening of the quays wall to reduce the risk of future tidal flood risk to around 5.52m AOD so development can come forward safely in this area over its lifetime. In those instances where the Quay Wall is not capable of repair and/ or retention, the structure will be recorded in accordance with the County Archaeologist’s specification to ensure a record of the historical development of the river is retained.247Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.69   Gateshead Quays Key Site is located on the south bank and is bounded by 
the river to the north, the Baltic Business Quarter to the east and Gateshead C
entre to the south. The site includes the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art 
and the Sage Gateshead. It is the most significant development opportunity available on the riverside and offers the opportunity for major development, continuing the successful regeneration of the last 20 years.
17.70
  Gateshead Quays is allocated for mixed-use development with a strong offic
e and business component and a mix of supporting facilities and 
services. We have ambitions for a conference venue to complement the space already available at the Sage Gateshead and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art which will be the catalyst for further redevelopment of the area.
17.71
  Development of Gateshead Quays will expand the commercial and cultural
 
quarter for Gateshead and Newcastle and will utilise and further exploit the existing cultural and leisure attractions and unique landscape. It will also maximise the benefit of the internationally recognised location and support and complement the regeneration and growth of surrounding areas. It will create the North East’s premier business and visitor destination and will reconnect the river to the surrounding area.
Policy QB2 Gateshead Quays Key Site
 1.  Gateshead Quays is allocated for mixed-use development. The principal uses will include: Office (B1), Leisure and C
onferencing Facilities (D1, D2), Hotel 
(C1), Residential (C3) with ancillary Retail (A1, A2, A3, A4) uses.
 2. Development will provide cultural and commercial f
ocus through:
  i.  The provision of new public space(s), which will provide opportunities
 
for performances, events and external exhibitions, expanding the functionality of the existing Performance Square and Baltic Square,
  ii.  The provision of green spaces to form part of a gr
een infrastructure 
corridor from the Exemplar Neighbourhood, through the Baltic Business Quarter towards the Quays. This will include a series of pocket parks and squares integrated into the new development linking to existing spaces to the west and east of the site,
  iii.  The provision of a defined public realm network using streets, squar
es, 
lanes and stairs, with a legible and permeable urban structure, which clearly defines public and private space,
  iv.  The provision of a primary pedestrian route through the site to ensure impr
oved pedestrian and cycle access from Central Gateshead to the 
riverfront,
  v. The development of new public car parking at Mill Road/Hawks     
    Road,
  vi.  Ensuring that development along Oakwellgate will enhance the setting of St Mary’s Heritage C
entre,
  vii.  Enhancement of Maidens Walk Coal Drops through the use of
 
illuminations,
  viii.  The provision of effective surfac
e water management, following the 
drainage hierarchy, 
   ix.  Avoidance and mitigation of tidal flood risk along the river front, ov
er 
the lifetime of development,
  x.  Consideration of the potential to incorporate surface water flo
w paths as a 
design feature, to convey surface water into the River Tyne, and
  xi.  A Foul and Surface Water Drainage Strate
gy which demonstrates there is  
    adequate foul and surface water capacity for the development with the  
    aim of reducing flood risk and ensuring no deterioration of water quality.248Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.72    A new north-south pedestrian route between South Shore Road and the 
Sage Gateshead will pr
ovide a more accessible gradient for pedestrians. 
The site will be linked to an extensive network of cycle routes, including National Routes 14 and 72. All of the bridges permit cross-river movements for cyclists, and there are links with Gateshead Centre.
17.73
   A clearly defined public realm will be established through a variety of environments r
eflecting the nature of their context. They will be suitable 
for a range of uses from major events to informal relaxation areas. A network of streets, squares, lanes and stairs and major soft landscape interventions including the green infrastructure corridor and Riverside Park will form the foundation of a core network of open spaces at the Quays.
17.74
  Multi-storey public car parking facilities will be provided, which will include ground floor activ
e frontages. The primary multi-storey car park is 
proposed to be located on the corner of Hawks Road and Mill Road, for use by different users at different times of the day and week.
17.75
  Gateshead Quays already has many landmark structures: the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, the Sage Gateshead and Baltic Centr
e for Contemporary 
Art. One of the challenges is to ensure that new development is complementary and links these iconic buildings together to create and reinforce the unique sense of place.
17.76
  Parts of the northern boundary of site are at the risk of tidal flooding ov
er the next 100 years, between the Swing Bridge and the Tyne Bridge, 
where the 1 in 200 year peak tidal level is predicted to increase to around 4.92m AOD by 2100. Built development should be set back from the river front and allow for future changes in flood risk due to climate change, taking account the Gateshead Quays Wall Condition Survey and Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. If development is proposed within areas that are at risk of flooding over the lifetime of the development, a flood risk assessment will be required to consider the mitigation measures such as raising the height of the quays wall and ground levels, and flood resilience and resistance measures.
17.77
   The dramatic change in levels means that parts of Gateshead Quays are at risk o
f surface water flooding. The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and 
Surface Water Management Plan identify strong existing surface water flow paths running down from Oakwellgate/Church Street and Mill Road. Surface water will need to be managed effectively, in accordance with Policy CS17 following the drainage hierarchy and designing for exceedance of the drainage systems. Priority should be given to controlling surface water (reducing and slowing flows) using source control SuDS techniques and directing flows into the River Tyne. Consideration should be given to how the design of highways, green infrastructure and parking will plan for exceedance of the drainage systems beyond the 1 in 30 year design event and accommodate existing flow routes so that there is no property flooding in a 1 in 100 year plus climate change event. Opportunities to manage and direct overland flows through the site using flow corridors such as swales and storage in roadways should be investigated, to convey and discharge surface water into the River Tyne.
17.78
  Five Development Opportunity Sites have been identified in the Southern Gateway Sub-Ar
ea: Millennium Quay/Hawks Road(East West and Central), 
Pipewellgate, Hudson Street / Half Moon Lane, The Point and the Baltic Business Quarter (Figure 17.5).Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy QB3 Quays and Baltic Development Opportunity Sites

Quayside, adjacent to the River Tyne
. Development has recently taken 
place on adjacent sites including a hotel. Development on this site will contribute to the continuing growth of Gateshead’s riverside. The site is in private ownership and it is anticipated to be developed in the short to medium term.
17.80
  Pipewellgate offers a rare opportunity to pr
ovide a landmark 
development within the Tyne Gorge riverside that will contribute to the continuing growth of Gateshead’s riverside and the Urban Core by linking this part of the riverside to other developments. The site is in private ownership and it is anticipated it will be developed in the short to medium term.
17.81
  Both Pipewellgate and the eastern site of Millennium Quay/Hawks Road are at risk o
f tidal flooding from the River Tyne, particularly taking 
account of predicted climate change levels to 2100 where the 1 in 200 year peak tidal level is predicted to increase to around 4.92m AOD by 2100. Built development should be set back from the river front and allow for future changes in flood risk, taking account of the Gateshead Quays Wall Condition Survey and Climate Adaptation Strategy. If development is proposed within areas that are at risk of flooding over the lifetime of the development, a flood risk assessment will be required to consider the mitigation measures such as raising the height of the quays wall and ground levels, and flood resilience and resistance measures.
17.82
  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and Surface Water Manag
ement 
Plan identifies extensive surface water risk along Pipewellgate caused by water flowing down into the gorge from Riverside Park and there have been localised drainage problems along Pipewellgate. There is a need to discharge surface water into the River Tyne. Surface water will need to be managed effectively, in accordance with Policy CS17 following the drainage hierarchy and designing for exceedance of the drainage systems. Surface water will need to be conveyed into the River Tyne through the provision of overland flow paths swales or pipes to outfalls. To manage surface water flood risk consideration may also need to be given to flood resilience and resistance measures, the design of highways to store water and source control SuDS measures such as green roofs, swales, permeable paving, and rainwater harvesting to reduce stormwater runoff volumes.
17.83
  The Hudson Street/Half Moon Lane site is situated in the Bridges Conservation Area and is adjacent to rec
ently refurbished and re-utilised 
buildings such as The Central and railway arches and new housing development in Ochre Yards. The development of this site will help contribute to improved linkages between the centre of Gateshead and the riverside. The site is in private ownership and it is anticipated it will be developed in the short to medium term.252Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies17.84   The Point is a development site adjacent to Ochre Yards r esidential 
development. The development of this site should ensure it utilises 
visual dominance and help connect the centre of Gateshead to the riverside. The site is in private ownership and it is anticipated it will be developed in the short to medium term.
17.85
  The Baltic Business Quarter is located to the south of the Gateshead Quays and to the east of Gateshead Central. It is Gateshead’s premier
 
office location and development is already underway. The site is anticipated to provide employment land beyond the plan period, however it has the flexibility to provide a range of accommodation that can meet the full spectrum of tenants’ needs and changing market circumstances during the plan period. The site will be prioritised for business accommodation, with hotel and ancillary retail uses. It could support a wide range of complementary leisure, education, tourism and recreation uses, but it will be important to maintain a critical mass of office development with high quality landscaping.
17.86
  Baltic Business Quarter has the floor space capacity of 81,200 square metres of o
ffice accommodation, resulting in the potential for a 
strategic office quarter attracting regional and international investment. Improvements to road and parking infrastructure and the quality of environment may be required to assist delivery, supported by the ADZ. The scale of the Baltic Business Quarter is capable of providing large office floorplates and smaller office suites for SMEs or providing for a large user.
17.87
  There a number of strong surface water flow paths sloping to the north. Surf
ace water will need to be managed effectively, in accordance 
with Policy CS17, following the drainage hierarchy and designing for exceedance of the drainage systems, taking account of existing flow paths and conveying stormwater flows to the River Tyne, potentially through a series of swales and ponds. Surface water runoff should be reduced, ideally using source control SuDS techniques. Consideration should be given to how the design of highways, green infrastructure and parking will plan for exceedance of the drainage systems. The majority of the site is in Council ownership, and it is anticipated it will be developed over the plan period.
 253Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Gateshead’s Neighbourhood and Villages Site-Specific Policies 
17.88   The delivery of the sites identified in policies CS3 and CS4 is critical 
to achieving Gateshead’s vision, particularly for housing, economic
 
growth and creating sustainable communities. This section sets out the principles of development and the required infrastructure for delivering these sites. Assessments have been undertaken to assess their sustainability, viability and deliverability. A Masterplan must be submitted for each allocated site as defined in CS3 and CS4 and must be approved by the Council. This recognises the need to plan new development comprehensively, ensuring it makes a positive contribution to the character of the area, and that access to facilities and services is provided. In addition to this developers will be required to:
  • Provide on housing developments a range of housing types, with  
   a particular emphasis on meeting the accommodation needs of  
   families and an increasingly ageing population, and open space  
   and play facilities in accordance with identified needs and   
   standards.
  • Incorporate water management measures including: a sustainable  
   drainage scheme, following the drainage hier
archy, giving priority  
   to SuDS; and measures to ensure that flood risk is not increased  
   both on and off-site, and where possible reduced o
ver the lifetime  
   of the development. Developers will be expected to discus
s this  
   requirement with the Council and Northumbrian Water at an early  
   stage, and demonstrate that the proposed solution will maximise  
   the benefits to the water environment.
  • Comprehensively plan green infrastructure to show ho
w a network  
   of multi-functional open spaces and links will be integrated   
   into the development area to achieve a range o
f aims including a  
   net gain in biodiversity and providing the necessary buffer
s   
   between these sites and the development. In addition, an   
   appropriate level of landscaping will be required to integr
ate the  
   development into the wider area and countryside.
  • Undertake a full transport assessment and provide neces
sary  
   measures and/or contributions to mitigate the impacts of   
   development on the transport network including provision of
, and  
   access to, sustainable modes of transport. Pedestrian and cy
cling  
   improvements will be required to integrate sites into the   
   surrounding area.
  • Undertake an ecological assessment and survey(s) if r
equired  
   to determine the potential impact of the proposal on any habitats  
   and sites of nature conservation and biological and ecological  
   importance.254Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesAreas of Change - Metrogreen 
17.89   The Metrogreen Area of Change is located between the Riv
er Tyne 
and the A1, with Blaydon to the west and Dunston to the east. The 
area encompasses the Intu Metrocentre, retail, office and industrial development and areas of vacant and underused land. The area is rich in opportunities with the potential to regenerate a large area of brownfield land with good access to public transport, the Strategic Road Network, the River Tyne and surrounding countryside. The Metrocentre is located at the heart of the Metrogreen area and will continue to have a key role in the regeneration and growth of the area, particularly given its infrastructure and facilities. There is potential to transform the Metrocentre from an out-of-town shopping centre into the focal point for a new residential community. There are however a number of constraints that will need to be addressed (Figure 17.6).
Policy AOC2 Metrogreen A mixed-use sustainable community will be delivered through a coordinated phased approach, providing new residential neighbourhoods, commercial, leisure and community facilities, a network of green spaces and routes for pedestrians and cyclists, and substantial improvements to public transport and flood and surface water management infrastructure.
 1. This location will deliver:
  i. 850 new homes at an overall averag
e of 40 dwellings per hectare,
  ii.  Complementary mixed-use development located close to sustainable transport links, including up to 15,000 square metr
es of B1a office 
accommodation,
  iii.  Community facilities to support those people living and/or working in the area, and 
  iv.  A transformed and outward facing Metrocentre which is inte
grated into 
the wider Metrogreen area.
 2. Development Requirements:
  i.  Improved pedestrian and cycle accessibility to the T
ransport 
Interchange and improvements to public transport infrastructure and services to serve new development,
   ii.  Improvements to the highway network to mitigate the impact of additional tr
affic generated by the development on local and strategic 
roads,
  iii.  Integrated infrastructure to manage fluvial, tidal and surface water
 
flooding in accordance with the Flood Management and Surface Water Management Plans, and to secure adequate water infrastructure through a water supply strategy and foul water strategy, and
  iv.  A series of safe, usable and attractive spaces and routes f
or pedestrians 
and cyclists, forming a green infrastructure network across the area. This will include:
    •  A 10 to 30 metres wide continuous recreational riverside route
 
within a  landscaped setting on the Tyne riverbank,
    •  A new public space including a pedestrian and cycle route connecting 
 the river with the transport interchange, and
    • A new public green space to serve the new residential community
. 
 3.  Development proposals shall be in accordance with the Metr
ogreen Area 
Action Plan (AAP), which will determine the appropriate mix, quantum and location of development in the area. Proposals made in advance of the AAP are required to demonstrate that they would not prejudice but complement, and integrate with, the wider development of the area, taking into account the requirements of relevant evidence.255Gateshead Sub-Areasand Site Specific Policies            Section 517.90   The proposal is for residential-led mixed-use development supported 
b
y a range of infrastructure which will transform the area, creating a new 
sustainable urban neighbourhood and satisfying a significant proportion of Gateshead’s housing needs over the plan period.
17.91
   The Metrogreen area comprises 213 hectares including the Metroc
entre 
and surrounding land, a number of sites of which are in different ownerships and varying degrees of use; some occupied by long term active uses, some with transient, more temporary uses with the remainder vacant. Evidence indicates an oversupply of employment land in the area, while some sites are suitable for residential use.Existing Buildings

to the pro
vision outlined in the policy, can also deliver approximately 
1,300+ new homes in the post plan period. Mixed-use development will also contribute to the area’s regeneration, taking advantage of its sustainable transport links and complementing existing commercial uses and the proposed new neighbourhood. This includes approximately 15,000 square metres of office development, which is appropriate to this location.
17.93
  New development will support, and will be supported by, the evolution
 
of the Metrocentre and its integration into the wider area. This can be achieved by transforming the current building to create active external frontages, by redesigning existing surface car parks and distributor roads to provide new buildings, spaces and routes which improve the public realm and prioritise the movement of pedestrians and cyclists through the area. The transformation of the Metrocentre and its environs from an out-of-town shopping centre into a neighbourhood centre for Metrogreen, serving local as well as wider needs, will support the creation of a new and viable neighbourhood.
17.94
  Parts of Metrogreen are at risk from tidal flooding fr
om the River Tyne, 
fluvial flooding from the River Derwent and surface water flooding due to extreme rainfall events that create runoff from adjacent land. The Metrogreen Flood Management Plan (2011) and Metrogreen Surface Water Management Plan (2013) set out a high level approach to how flooding and surface water constraints can be mitigated as part of the development of a sustainable residential community at Metrogreen.
17.95
  A green infrastructure network will be created across the ar
ea for use by 
pedestrians and cyclists. A series of green spaces and safe, attractive and direct routes will connect new and existing development within the area and to the surrounding area. This network will encompass appropriate flood and surface water management solutions, integrating them with the public realm where possible and positively contributing towards the creation of a distinctive, well connected and sustainable place.
17.96
  The Metrogreen area supports significant biodiversity interest including
 
species and habitats listed in the UK and Durham Biodiversity Action Plans and three Local Wildlife Sites (River Tyne Tidal Mud, Tidal River Derwent and Dunston Pond). New development will protect and enhance biodiversity within an integrated green infrastructure network (encompassing flood and surface water management measures).
17.97
  The existing transport interchange at the Metrocentre pr
ovides direct 
bus and rail links to the Urban Core, surrounding area and wider region. New bus infrastructure serving new development should be provided as well as improved pedestrian and cycle accessibility to the transport interchange. Improving the train station itself and providing more frequent rail services would enable more people to access the rail network, serving both existing and new development.257Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 517.98   The Council will work proactively with its development partners to  
explore the feasibility of implementing a district energy centre in the 
area, which could provide heat to existing retail, leisure and commercial development as well as new development.
17.99
  To avoid further piecemeal and incremental development in the ar
ea 
an Area Action Plan (AAP) will be prepared to guide future sustainable development and ensure sufficient physical, social and green infrastructure is provided to mitigate the impacts of development and create a sustainable place. These considerations along with the need for sites to be well connected and integrated will also apply to applications for development which come forward in advance of the AAP .
17.100
  Particular issues that need to be considered and planned on an area wide basis are tr
ansport, flood risk, remediation, green infrastructure, 
design and physical infrastructure.
17.101  The AAP will
  •  Identify the appropriate mix and distribution of land uses within the area,
  •  Determine area wide and site specific infrastructure requirements, phasing, funding and deliv
ery, and
  •  Develop planning and urban design guidelines to ensure the full potential of the area is captured and a sustainable
, integrated 
place is delivered.258Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific PoliciesNeighbourhood Growth Areas
Dunston Hill17.102
  Dunston Hill is on the south west edge of the main built-up area of 
T
yneside. The proposed development sites would form an extension of 
the urban area into countryside south of the B6317 Whickham Highway on the site of the Council’s former Central Nursery and agricultural fields and would exclude but surround a block of woodland, Whickham Hill Plantation. The location is highly accessible to good public transport and major centres of employment (including the Urban Core, Team Valley and Metrocentre) but is also adjacent to Watergate Forest Park and the Whickham Conservation Area (Figure 17.7). 
Policy GN1 Dunston HillLand at Dunston Hill is allocated for approximately 530 homes (GN1). Development, delivering a mix of predominantly family housing, must take place in accordance with an approved masterplan and phasing plan. Development is required to provide:
 1. Mitigation of the cumulative traffic impacts of the proposed development  
  through:
  i.  Improvements to the junction of the A692 and Whickham Highway, 
  ii.   The provision of the Lobley Hill Park and Ride facility,
  iii.  Improvements to the junction of the B6317 and Dunston Bank,
  iv.   The provision of new pedestrian crossing facilities on the B6317, and  
  v.    Improvements to pedestrian facilities on Southfield Road.
 2. A contribution to local primary school provision.
 3. Mitigation of the impacts of the development on the historic environment,  
  landscape, biodiversity and ecological connectivity, including:
  i.  The protection of the setting of the adjacent locally listed Dunston

approximately 22 hectares of net developable employment land for B8 uses, supporting the distribution and logistics sector and ensuring sufficient employment land to meet Gateshead’s medium and long term requirements. The site has excellent access to the Strategic Road Network, with direct access to the A194 (M), and close proximity to the A1, A1(M) and A19, although the site would benefit from improved sustainable transport links. The site is located on the north bank of the River Don within a wildlife corridor, and is capable of accommodating a range of protected and priority species. The provision of landscape and ecology buffers will maintain and enhance ecological connectivity and preserve and enhance habitats, including wetlands. The buffers will also accommodate a Sustainable Drainage System, which will mitigate flood risk and prevent water pollution. Consideration should be given to existing utilities provision and required upgrades; existing gas mains, an overhead electricity cable/ pylons and sewers cross the site (Figure 17.15).

  The site has excellent access to the Strate
gic Road Network, with direct 
access to the A194 (M), and close proximity to the A1, A1(M) and A19. It is envisaged that the increased number of trips from the proposed  development can be accommodated on the highway network and no highways improvements will be required, with the exception of site access arrangements. Improvements to public transport links will be required; consideration should be given to the potential for a new bus service, the extension of existing services and links to the proposed Park and Ride site at Follingsby. An existing public right of way runs along the western edge of the site; this should be maintained or where this is not possible re-provision will be required. The site is served by an existing cycle route that leads to Felling and Washington. New cycle routes and pedestrian routes should be provided linked to adjacent routes and green infrastructure. Consideration should also be given to links to other large developments in the area, including Nissan. A transport assessment should consider these issues as part of evaluating the detailed impacts of any development. Where the transport assessment identifies deficiencies in the accessibility of the site it should also identify mitigation measures. As appropriate, in keeping with the scale of development, funding for these measures will be secured through a s.106 agreement.Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies275Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5Policy KEA2 South of Follingsby Lane

The provision of landscape and ecology buffers along the southern, eastern and western site boundaries will: provide landscape screening, maintain and enhance ecological connectivity between Local Wildlife Sites, and preserve and enhance habitats, including wetlands. The southern landscape/ecology buffer should measure approximately 100 metres in width and incorporate a range of predominantly open habitats that enhance the value and integrity of the River Don Wildlife Corridor for a range of protected and priority species including great crested newt, water vole and otter. Ecology/landscape buffers of around 50 metres in width should also be provided along eastern and western site boundaries; should South Follingsby Farm be retained the buffer will be required between the new development and the farm. The retention of existing hedgerows and trees and new planting throughout the site will be encouraged.  
277Gateshead Sub-Areas and Site Specific Policies            Section 5This section addresses the delivery of the Plan and considers how new 
infrastructure needed for development will be funded. It also outlines how the Councils intend to monitor and manage the Plan in terms of the delivery of the spatial visions, strategic objectives and implementation of the strategy.
Chapter 18 Delivery and MonitoringSection 6  Delivery and MonitoringDelivery and Monitoring18.1   Our planned growth must be supported by infrastructure and facilities 
which ar
e deliverable at the appropriate time and in the right locations. 
We will make the most of our existing infrastructure, upgrading and improving where possible, and investing in new infrastructure where it is essential to support sustainable growth.
18.2
  This Plan recognises there are different types o
f infrastructure including 
local infrastructure, such as access to a site, and strategic infrastructure which provides for the wider area and can either mitigate unacceptable impact or provide facilities.
Policy DEL1 Infrastructure and Developer Contributions 
 1. New development will:
  a) be made acceptable through the provision of neces
sary infrastructure, 
  b) take into account viability and other material considerations to:
   i. address the off-site and cumulative impacts,
   ii.  deliver schemes in a timely manner,
   iii. provide identified affordable housing need, and
   iv. provide for new or improv
ed facilities and services.
 2. Contributions will be required to mitigate the strategic cross-boundary  
  impacts of development.
18.3   Developers will be required to contribute towar
ds necessary 
infrastructure and planning obligations. This may include contributions towards: transport measures and public realm, drainage, green infrastructure, affordable housing and employment and training schemes, depending on the nature of the planning application.
 18.4
  The Councils will strike a balance between the need to fund strategic infr
astructure and the need to deliver sufficient development to meet 
our growth. Such funding will, where necessary, be secured through planning obligations, and CIL, after the adoption of charging schedules. Guidance documents will indicate mechanisms for funding different categories of infrastructure.
18.5
  Development may be required to provide infrastructur
e and facilities. 
Developers are encouraged to liaise with infrastructure providers as early as possible when developing proposals to ensure infrastructure services are provided effectively. In accordance with the NPPF, this includes the need to address the strategic cross-boundary impacts of development, particularly with regard to cumulative impacts on the transport network.
18.6
  A delivery framework for the policies and proposals, acros
s the plan 
period, is essential for a co-ordinated, phased and deliverable plan. The main methods and proposals for implementing Local Plan policies are identified in the tables that follow (Figure 18.1).
27918. Delivery and MonitoringDelivery and Monitoring            Section 618.7  Delivery and implementation will be supported by: 
  •  an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) which identifies relevant 
timescales, likely c
osts and funding for infrastructure where 
known,
  •  a monitoring framework to ensure the Plan’s policies are eff
ective 
and deliverable and in accordance with our intended timescales (Appendix 3).

Figure 18.1 Policy Delivery table
18.8   Gateshead and Newcastle Councils are currently revie wing the 
evidence and justification for preparing Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) Charging Schedules to fund strategic infrastructure, in line with government guidance. The evidence indicates there is a need to seek funding from developers to address the impact of growth and the subsequent infrastructure requirements, and therefore it is anticipated that the authorities will become CIL Charging Authorities as soon as possible. Interim policies may apply to ensure that appropriate contributions are collected in the period between the start of CIL regulations in April 2015 and the local adoption of CIL.
Infrastructure Delivery Plan
18.9
 This plan is supported by an IDP setting out timescales, costs where  
 known, and delivery information relating to strategic infrastructur
e  
 projects. Strategic infrastructure provides f
or facilities and services  
 that can mitigate unacceptable impact of development, or cumulative  
 impact of a number of sites, and can refer to off site pro
vision serving  
 a wider area. The IDP also includes information about the needs,   
 standards, deficiencies and any barriers to providing infrastructure
.287Delivery and Monitoring            Section 6Stakeholders
18.10   Stakeholders and service providers hav
e a crucial role in delivering 
high quality services and improving our infrastructure. The Councils 
will work in partnership with infrastructure providers, funding bodies, key stakeholders and other agencies and organisations to ensure a co-ordinated delivery of facilities and infrastructure is delivered in a sustainable and effective manner. For example, this includes:
  •  Continued joint working with other local authorities to facilitate cross boundary needs. 
  •  Infrastructure plans of partner organisations, such as the Clinical Commissioning Gr
oups, will help to shape policy and joint 
infrastructure planning, making best use, wherever possible, of facility buildings or land. 
18.11
  This is an ongoing dialogue, and we will continue to work tog
ether to 
help meet infrastructure needs, and reflect this in the IDP .
Viability and Developer Contributions
18.12   Viability testing has been a key part of the development of the Local 
Plan e
vidence base. The SHLAA and office needs evidence incorporates 
viability testing, and identified opportunities for seeking funds necessary to deliver infrastructure identified in the IDP .
18.13
  Viability assessments have also been used to review the policy c
osts of 
the Plan. Developers will be required to provide sufficient information to assess site viability. 288Endnotes1. Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act (2004)

large part of our combined area, including two thirds of the whole of Gateshead. It stretches from the urban edge of our neighbourhoods to the boundary with Northumberland in the north and west, with County Durham to the south and to the outlying parts of North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland in the east.
Secondary Retail Frontages - Secondary retail frontages have a significant 
proportion of retail uses but provide greater opportunities than the Primary Retail Frontages for a diversity of uses such as restaurants, cinemas and businesses.313Glossary            AppendicesSection 106 - See Planning Obligation.
Sequential Approach / Sequential Test - A planning principle that seeks to 
identify, allocate or develop certain types or locations of land before others. 
Site of Special Scientific Interest - Sites designated by Natural England under the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

its owner or part owners and having a small market share either by number of employees or turnover. 
Solus - Single user accommodation suitable for large public or private 
organisations serving national / international customer base.
Strategic Cycle Network - Strategic Cycle Routes are the main cycle links across 
the Plan area, which together form the Strategic Cycle Network.  
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) - European Directive 2001/42/EC (the SEA Directive) Strategic Environmental Assessment: A procedure (set out in the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004) which requires the formal environmental assessment of certain plans and programmes which are likely to have significant effects on the environment.
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) - A document which is normally produced 
by a Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Environment Agency, and which forms the basis for preparing appropriate policies for flood risk management at the local level.
Strategic Highways Network - The A1, A19, A69 and A696 are the strategic routes 
which form the Strategic Highways Network.
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) - Assessments of land 
available for housing development, the potential of these sites and the likely timeframe for their development. This assists with demonstrating a sufficient supply of land for housing to meet the identified need.
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) - Assesses the housing needs and 
demands by type (including affordable housing) for the plan area, and informs the housing mix required over the plan period.
Strategic Land Review and Green Belt Assessment (SLR) - An assessment to 
identify the most appropriate sites in the Green Belt to meet our future housing need in Newcastle. This was required as the SHLAA did not identify adequate housing sites to meet the identified demand.
Strategic Infrastructure - Provides for facilities and services that can mitigate 
unacceptable impact of development, or cumulative impact of a number of sites, and can refer to off site provision serving a wider area.
Strong Urban Frontage - A strong urban frontage which has a scale and massing 
that supports the surrounding urban streetscape and a design that responds to both distance and close up views in a well resolved manner. 
Sub Area - Areas within the Urban Core that share similar characteristics. They 
are defined by a combination of factors including established uses, built form, heritage, roads and how these areas are expected to develop in the future.314GlossarySupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) - Documents which add further 
detail to the policies in the Local Plan. They can be used to provide further guidance for development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. Supplementary Planning Documents are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the development plan.
Surface Water (or fluvial) Flooding - Flooding which occurs when heavy rainfall 
exceeds the drainage capacity of the local area.
Sustainable Communities - Places where people want to live and work, now and 
in the future. They meet the diverse needs of existing and future residents, are sensitive to their environment, and contribute to a high quality of life. They are safe and inclusive, well planned, built and run, and offer equality of opportunity and good services for all.
Sustainable Development - For the purposes of the Plan, sustainable 
development is living within the planet’s environmental limits; ensuring a strong, healthy and just society, achieving a sustainable economy; promoting good governance, and using sound science responsibly.
Sustainable Location - A location which is accessible and which provides facilities 
and services to meet peoples’ day-to-day needs.
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) - The sustainability appraisal considers the social, 
environmental and economic effects of a plan from the outset, to help ensure that decisions are made that contribute to achieving sustainable development.
Sustainability Statement - A Sustainability Statement should demonstrate the 
environmental benefits/impacts of any proposal.
Sustainable technologies - These technologies rely on renewable resources and 
do not have any long-term adverse impact on the environment such as wind, solar and geothermal. 
Sustainable transport modes - Any efficient, safe and accessible means of 
transport with overall low impact on the environment, including walking and cycling, low and ultra low emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport.

store surface water run-off as close to its origin as possible before it enters a watercourse or sewer. Usually used to avoid any increase in flood risk due to new development.
Tidal Flooding - Flooding caused by changing tidal and sea levels, and can be 
increased through storm surges and changes to atmospheric pressure.
Transport Assessment - A comprehensive and systematic process that sets 
out transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies what measures will be required to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures will need to be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development. 
Transport Interchange - Locations, usually off the main highway where 
passengers change between vehicles or transport modes.315Glossary            AppendicesTransport statement - A simplified version of a transport assessment where it is  
agreed the transport issues arising out of development proposals are limited and 
a full transport assessment is not required. 
Travel plan - A long-term management strategy for an organisation or site that  
seeks to deliver sustainable transport objectives through action and is articulated 
in a document that is regularly reviewed.
Tyneside Conurbation - Tyneside is a conurbation in North East England, defined 
by the Office for National Statistics and includes the City of Newcastle upon Tyne and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Gateshead, North Tyneside and South Tyneside all settlements on the banks of the River Tyne.
Unhealthy eating outlets - is predominantly Class A5 of the Town and Country 
Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 (as amended). 
Unitary Development Plans (UDPs) - The Newcastle UDP , adopted in 1998 
and Gateshead UDP in 2006, were extinguished by the 2004 Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, but selected polices were saved under provisions in the same act. The saved policies provide the current development plan and will remain until extinguished by policies adopted in the LDDs we prepare. 
Urban Core - The Urban Core is the compact heart of the Tyneside conurbation.  
It stretches about 3.6 km from north to south, extending from Newcastle’s Town 
Moor to Gateshead’s Durham Road; and from 4 km west to east, extending from the edge of Elswick in Newcastle, and the Redheugh Bridge on the Gateshead side, to Ouseburn and Gateshead Quays. In accordance with the NPPF and for the purposes of sequential and impact assessment work the plan defines the Urban Core as the Plan Town Centre boundary.  
Urban Core Distributor Route - A designated route providing the focus for traffic 
movements in order to reduce the level of traffic travelling straight through the Urban Core.
Urban Green Infrastructure Network - The Urban Green Infrastructure Network 
is the fine grained and locally significant element of green infrastructure within the urban area, including existing and proposed links to the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network.
Urban Traffic Management Control (UTMC) - Urban Traffic Management Control  
(or UTMC) systems are designed to allow the different applications used within 
modern traffic management systems to communicate and share information with each other. This allows previously disparate data from multiple sources such as cameras, car parks, signs, traffic signals, air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data, to be amalgamated into a central console or database.  
The idea behind UTMC is to maximise road network potential to create a more robust and intelligent system that can be used to meet current and future management requirements.
Use Classes Order - The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and 
subsequent amendments, group a number of land uses into categories or ‘Use Classes’. Changes of use within the same Use Class or between certain different Use Classes as set out in the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) are normally deemed to have consent and do not in most cases require specific planning permission.Village Growth Area - Chopwell, Crawcrook , Dinnington, Hazlerigg and 
Wideopen, Highfield, High Spen, Kibblesworth, Ryton, Sunniside and Throckley are identified as villages for housing growth. 
Walkability - A term used to describe how easy, in terms of its safety, 
attractiveness and ease of use, an area is for pedestrians to navigate. Waste Hierarchy - A framework that has become a cornerstone of sustainable 
waste management, setting out the order in which options for waste management should be considered based on environmental impact.
Wheelchair accessible housing - is housing designed for people who use a 
wheelchair. 
Wildlife corridor - Areas of habitat connecting wildlife populations.Windrow Composting - In agriculture windrow composting is the production of 
compost by piling organic matter or biodegradable waste, such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (windrows). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale composting method.
Zero Carbon - Means that there is no net increase in carbon dioxide emissions 
resulting from building use. The Government, with assistance from the Zero Carbon Hub, is currently developing a new definition of zero carbon development.Glossary317Gateshead and Newcastle Local Plan
Joint Monitoring FrameworkIntroductionMonitoring is a fundamental element of delivering an effective plan-led system. 
An effective monitoring framework is critical to the successful delivery of the objectives set out in our Local Plans.
This framework has been designed to effectively monitor the policies of the Plan. 
The framework also monitors our Sustainability Objectives, identified through the Sustainability Appraisal.
The indicators presented in this report are the ‘shared’ indicators that both 
Councils will include in our monitoring reports. However, this framework does not provide an exhaustive list of the indicators we will use to monitor our Local Plans. Other elements of each council’s Local Plan may require additional indicators to be determined. Similarly, locally specific issues may need to be assessed and better understood. Our monitoring reports will therefore also need to take into account the content of policies contained in those LLD’s that Gateshead and Newcastle produce separately.
Approach to monitoringThe Localism Act 2011 amends the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act
2004 with regard to monitoring reports. Local authorities are no longer required 
to submit annual monitoring reports to the Secretary of State, and must now produce at least one monitoring report each year and make them available to the public. The Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 set minimum requirements for authorities’ monitoring reports, which must now provide:
 •  The title of the Local Plans or supplementary planning documents specified in the authority’s Local Development Scheme, and
 information on the timetable, progress (including the date of adoption,
 
where applicable), and any reasons for delay (where applicable) in relation to each of these documents;
 •  Identification of the policies in the Local Plan that are not being implemented and any steps the authority intends to take to ensure the policy is implemented;
 •  The number of net additional dwellings, or affordable dwellings completed during the monitoring period, wher
e a Local Plan policy specifies a number;
 •  Details of any neighbourhood development order or neighbourhood development plans;
 • Community Infrastructure Levy receipts, where applicable;
 • Details of any action taken under the duty to cooperate.Appendix 3 Monitoring FrameworkMonitoring Framework            Appendices318Information provided within Local Plan Annual Monitoring Reports
Producing a monitoring report which contains a full range of relevant information 
on development activity, socio-economic indicators, and progress in Local Plan preparation constitutes an effective approach to analysing and presenting information relating to the Local Plan. It also provides a single simple and accessible source of information that the public and other stakeholders are generally familiar with. For these reasons, Gateshead and Newcastle Councils intend to continue to produce monitoring reports on an annual basis that include the full range of shared monitoring indicators in this framework. Annual monitoring reports will be produced in December each year, and include information relating to the full period of the previous financial year.
The 2012 local planning regulations make clear that up-to-date information 
collected for monitoring purposes should be made available as soon as possible. In most cases preparation of a monitoring report on an annual basis will be the earliest point that information is collected and can be made available. However,
it may be that changes to monitoring processes in each authority mean that 
information is available at an earlier stage, or that the pressing nature of locally significant issues are such that it would be appropriate to collect and report information outside of the annual monitoring report cycle. It may therefore
be appropriate for topic-specific monitoring reports to be produced by each 
authority in addition to the Local Plan annual monitoring report.
Monitoring FrameworkMonitoring Framework            Appendices
319Development of monitoring indicators
For the monitoring framework to remain manageable, we need to strike a balance 
between identifying appropriate indicators and ensuring that information is(and will continue to be) available without the required level of research being excessively burdensome. Although our priority has been to produce a monitoring framework that effectively and accurately monitors the implementation of the Plan’s policies and sustainability objectives, it has also been necessary to incorporate an element of pragmatism when determining indicators, with consideration given to the practicality of collecting the information.
Central sources of information at a regional or national level have been used 
where available, as they provide readily available data. Where central sources are to be used, the frequency with which data is released has been considered in an effort to ensure that it enables us to provide a meaningful and timely assessment of performance. Where information is to be collected by the local authority, we have sought to include indicators where there is a current, and ongoing process of data collection established in each Council. Where possible, indicators will be used which can directly inform the evidence base documents that we need to update regularly (for example our Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessments, and our Employment Land Reviews). In effect, this means that many indicators included in this framework are retained from those already used in our previous Annual Monitoring Reports, and therefore provide data in a format that is familiar to the councils and to stakeholders. Retaining indicators already in use provides additional benefits in that the availability of historic data allows trends to be more readily identified and interpreted.
Our overarching spatial strategy policies (CS1 to CS4) have a long lead-time and 
rely upon the implementation of other policies in the Plan. Thereforeno individual indicators are needed to monitor these policies - rather, their implementation will be assessed through the monitoring of other policies in the plan.
The Plan contains many policies which relate to development or interventions 
at specific sites or locations (either strategic allocations, or key sites within the Urban Core). We will monitor the implementation of these policies by providing a narrative account of progress made against their objectives.
The monitoring of policies that relate to the quality of the built and natural 
environment will include a narrative report on planning applications which have significance to the objectives of these policies.
Joint monitoring
Data provided in each Council’s monitoring reports will be used to monitor only 
the elements of the Plan that relate to that authority. 
Where combined targets for Gateshead and Newcastle are provided within the 
policy, the component relating to each local authority will be monitored through our separate reports. Publishing our monitoring reports at around the same time, and to cover the same period, allows for assessment against combined targets. Because each authority’s local Plan monitoring report will need to include indicators which relate only to that local authority, it may be appropriate for our monitoring reports to adopt different structures. Our monitoring reports will provide information on the implementation of Local Plan policies. Because the320policies contained within the Gateshead and Newcastle Local Plan are joint 
policies adopted by both councils, we will co-ordinate this critical element of both of our monitoring reports to ensure that our appraisal of the implementation of policies is consistent and thorough.
Although our monitoring framework has been designed to be effective and 
resilient to change, over time our shared indicators may need to be revised to respond to changes in the availability of information, and the effectiveness of specific indicators. Any necessary changes to our shared indicators will be identified, and reported within our monitoring reports.
Monitoring of Objectives
Monitoring indicators will be used to assess the extent to which the Strategic 
Objectives of the Plan, and the Sustainability Objectives of the Sustainability Appraisal are being achieved. The following tables identify which indicators these objectives will be monitored against.Monitoring Framework321Table 1: Monitoring of the Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan Objectives

 Monitoring Individual Policies
The following table identifies the indicators that will be used to monitor policies 
in the Plan. Some indicators are used to monitor a number of policies, this is due to the nature of the policies and the data that is collected.
A number of policies will also be monitored using narratives. The narrative is 
intended to:
•
 bring together the different elements of the policy that cannot be monitored 
e
ffectively by using quantitative information alone
•  report on the implementation of specific infrastructure or improvements
 
that are required on a site or in a topic area, for example, contributions to education provision or implementation of pedestrian route improvement schemes provide any additional information that either or both of the authorities may have to allow a more thorough understanding of the implementation of the policy/policies
•
 provide any additional information that either or both of the authorities may have to allo
w a more thorough understanding of the implementation of the 
policy/policies
Some of the policies have also been grouped together into broad topics/sub areas and will be reported on in a single narrative.SA Objective
