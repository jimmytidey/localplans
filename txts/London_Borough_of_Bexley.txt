 Draft Local Plan  
Proposed Submission Document   
Regulation 19 Stage  
May 2021  
  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
2 The purpose of this document  
This document is the Draft Local Plan, as proposed to be submitted to the Secretary of State for 
independent examination.  The Council will seek to deliver the principles of sustainable development 
through the final, adopted Bexley Local Plan and the development management process.  The Development 
Plan for the area, which includes the Bexley Local Plan and the Mayor’s London Plan, should be read in its entirety.  Planning guidance produced by Government, the Mayor of London, and by the Council expands on 
Development Plan policies and has material weight when taking planning decisions.  
The London Plan, as the spatial development strategy for London, provides the strategic framework.  It 
does not however preclude boroughs from bringing forward policies relevant to their areas where locally 
specific  circumstances and evidence suggests this would not undermine the objectives of the London Plan 
and where such an approach can be considered to be in general conformity with the London Plan.  The 
Local Plan does this.  It is also silent where the London Plan policy does not require a local approach.  
The London Plan runs from 2019 to 2041, and the Local Plan from 2021 to 203 8.  Longer term London Plan 
objectives may fall beyond the timeframe of the Local Plan although the key objective of sustainable develo pment underpins both documents.  
[Please note that all references to the London Plan in this Draft Local Plan are for the new London Plan that 
came into effect on 2 March 2021]  
The Local Plan contains strategic, non- strategic  and site allocation (for residential and residential -led 
mixed -use development)  polices along with supporting text, which take account of and are supported by: 
• legal requirements related to the preparation of local plans including the duty to cooperate;  
• Government planning policy and guidance (without seeking to repeat these)  
• London Plan policy and guidance (without seeking to repeat these);  
• integrated impact (IIA) and habitats regulations (HRA) assessments of the Local Plan;  
• a whole Plan viability assessment; and,  
• a proportionate evid ence base (including evidence underpinning the London Plan), in the form of 
plans and strategies, studies, reports, technical papers and assessments.  
Reviews at least every five years are a legal requirement for all local plans .  The Council’s review of it s Local 
Plan began in 2017.  This Local Plan is intended to replace, in full, the Bexley Core Strategy and remaining 
extant policies of the Bexley Unitary Development Plan and Proposals Map .  The Local Plan has been 
shaped by effective engagement with residents, businesses, local groups and statutory consultees in line 
with  the Bexley Statement of Community Involvement.  The Local Plan has taken account of comments 
received during the consultation process, and the evidence justifies the approaches taken in the policies and provides the direction for policies to be implemented.   
Local Plan strategic policies are prefixed ‘SP , ’ non- strategic, development management  policies prefixed 
‘DP , ’ and site allocation policies prefixed ‘SA. ’  The first two policy types are set out within the topic -based  
chapters in Part 1 of the Local Plan and the third policy type set out within the site allocations for 
residential, or residential -led mixed -use development in Part 2 of the Local Plan.  The site allocations are 
area spec ific and prefixed by their sustainable development location ( e.g.,  Bexleyheath sites are prefixed 
BXH).   The site allocations are not strategic allocations.  
Annexes set out  indicators for monitoring local plan policie s and  a glossary of terms and abbreviat ions  
(after Part 1), and a detailed local plan housing trajectory  (after Part 2).  Land -use designations are set out 
on the submission policies map
.  The  Local Plan is accompanied by an Infrastructure Delivery Plan.   Bexley Draft Local Plan

Setting the context: Bexley’s growth narrative  
Related Council overarching strategies  
Be
xley Growth Strategy  
#BrilliantBexley, Shaping our future together  
Connected Communities  Strategy  
1.1 One of the characteristics of Bexley is that people who live in the borough identify strongly with 
their local neighbourhoods, such as Welling, Bexleyheath or Erith.   Residents are committed to the 
local neighbourhood and enthusiastic in their contributions to their communities.  There are a wide range of active community and voluntary groups, spanning support groups, business, t he arts, sport 
and the environment.  
1.2 Regionally, London’s growing population is driving a renewed interest to the east.  Locally, Bexley’s population is also increasing significantly.  Currently, this growth in the size and nature of the 
population has largely been accommodated by intensification in the use of the existing housing 
stock, creating additional pressures on local services, including education.  
1.3 The population of Bexley will change significantly over the next few decades.  The north of the 
borough will grow the most, and Bexley will become more diverse.  Bexley has almost 248,000 
residents and is predicted to grow to around 277,000 by the end of the Plan period .  This has 
increased from 232,000 in 2011 ( Census data), when Erith, Belvedere and Thamesmead East had 
the largest populations in the borough of around 12,000 residents each.  Notwithstanding this, the 
borough is not particularly densely populated for London – with only 38.3 people per hectare of 
land – making Bexley the fifth lowest residential density of all London boroughs.  
1.4 By 2041, it is predicted that Erith will remain the highest populat ed area in the borough with over 
17,000 residents, which is the largest growth in Bexley by volume and perce ntage.  Wards in 
Bexleyheath and Crayford follow with almost 15,000 residents in each  area . 
Local plan vision : growth that beneﬁts all  
1.5 Government’s National Planning Policy Framework sets out a chapter on Plan-making, noting that : 
“The planning system should be genuinely plan- led.  Succinct and up -to-date plans should provide a 
positive vision for the future of each area; a framework for addressing housing needs and other economic, 
social and environmental priorities; and a platform for local people to shape their surroundings .” 
1.6 The Leader’s Foreword to the Bexley Growth Strategy  states: “ Bexley is about far more than building 
homes and workplaces, we want to create sustainable, healthy, high -quality neighbourhoods where people 
choose to live, play, learn and earn. Further transport improvements could enable us to develop large, 
underused sites around stations in the north of the borough. These better -connected places could see new 
higher density neighbourhoods offering a range of homes for all life stages supported by healthy streets with ‘walk to’ facilities and high- tech  infrastructure, and access to a variety of good quality jobs both 
locally and in economic centres outside the borough . ” 
1.7 Con nected Communities , the Council’s strategy for supporting and investing in community 
development, sets out how we will work with local people who want to take positive action to Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
7 support the people and places that they care about.  Growth that benefits all means that planned 
growth should be understood (why it’s happening, and when) by the people who will be impacted 
by, and benefit from it.  The strengths of existing communities, connected to new communities, will 
build the cohesive and successful communiti es of the future, with enough provision for schools, GP 
surgeries, and cultural and community facilities . 
1.8 Working with our communities and partners we want to create an environment in which everyone in Bexley can take a full part in the social, cultural and economic wealth of the borough.   This can be 
achieved by creating healthy communities, workplaces and homes; healthy environments, built, 
green and blue spaces; and  economic independence and a thriving local economy.  
1.9 The Council’s Corporate Pl an #BrilliantBexley  sets out five key outcomes that have spatial elements 
that are reflected in the local plan.  These five key outcomes are:  
• Growth that benefits all  
• Clean and green local places  
• Strong and resilient communities and families  
• Living well  
• Innovations and self -sufficiency  
Bexley Local Plan vision for sustainable growth  
As set out in our Growth Strategy, Bexley will play a key part in helping London grow sustainably while we continue 
to respect the borough’s overall character and identity.  We  have a key role in place shaping and to ensure that our 
communities, new and old, are connected, happy and prosperous.  
A well -connected borough, both within and beyond Bexley, provides the key to securing growth opportunities for 
residents and businesses.   People across the borough will have a better quality of life and improved health and 
wellbeing, supported by high -quality housing, rewarding employment opportunities and effective local services and 
facilities.  
Good growth will be secured by focussing ne w residential development in and around our main town centres and 
other parts of the borough that are well -connected by public transport.  We will make the most of Bexley’s riverside 
location and industrial heritage.  
Shopping, culture and leisure facilitie s will be vibrant, supported by innovative industries and businesses.  Core 
industrial areas retained for employment uses will be improved, diversified and intensified, fostering the growing 
movement of artisans and other manufacturers.  
The borough’s value d character, heritage and quality open spaces will be preserved and enhanced.  The natural 
environment will be protected for the future through net gains for biodiversity, and the management of air and 
water quality, flood risk and other effects of climate  change.  
Table 1: Bexley's vision for sustainable growth  
1.10 The Corporate Plan ’s key outcome of ‘Growth that benefits all, ’ states that:  
“Growth can significantly improve the lives of all who live in, work and visit Bexley, bringing much needed 
investment, creating new homes and jobs.  We will think carefully about what type of growth we need, 
where we want it and when.  Growth will be sustainable and will protect people’s lifestyles, improving the 
quality of life for our residents.  We will ensure that Growth is properly supported by the right 
infrastructure and that we protect all the things that make Bexley a good place to live and work, building 
on our proud legacy, character and identity. ” Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
8 Spatial objectives for the Local  Plan  
1.11 In line with Government guidance, the key spatial objective of a local plan is to set out the broad 
locations and specific allocation of land for different purposes; through designations showing areas 
where particular opportunities or considerations apply (such as protected habitats); and, through 
criteria -based policies , address the objectively assessed housing needs and other economic, social 
and environmental priorities of the area; in order to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.  
Local Plan spatial objectives -  principles of sustainable development  
Social sustainability:  encourage the creation of high -quality, well connected healthy lifetime communities that are 
mixed and balanced, safe, and well supported by infrastructure, local services, and cultural and education facilities, 
which offer a choice of living styles that appeal across generations.  
Environmental sustainability:  protect and enhance aspects of the natural and built environment, take account of, 
adapt to, and mitigate the impacts of climate change and flood risk and optimise the efficient management of 
existing and future resources and waste.  
Economic sustainability : support the strengthening of a diverse local economy including denser and higher quality 
industrial premises; a network of vibrant and successful town centres; increased inward investment in new high 
technology and creative sectors supported by state -of-the-art digital connectivity; the development of skills; and  
improved accessibility to jobs in London and the wider south east.  
Sustainable development is synonymous with good growth: ensure lasting places are created that work 
economically, socially, and en vironmentally in the long term to the lasting benefit of their residents and businesses . 
These principles are basic concepts of land use planning and will be secured through the creation of:  
lifetime communities , which offer a range of housing types enabling people to stay local and close to family and 
friends –  building strong, stable, self -supporting communities and promoting mental health  
high -quality environments , with safe, pleasant and accessible open spaces meeting current and future needs, wel l 
designed buildings and an outstanding cultural and heritage offer  
safe, walkable neighbourhoods  where everyday facilities are reached by walking and cycling, reducing car use, 
improving the environment and promoting health  
transport -orientated development  where higher density mixed -use development is concentrated around public 
transport and town centre nodes, thereby making the most efficient use of land in the best -connected  areas  
high -quality, sustainable employment areas  in accessible locations offerin g a range of high -quality  jobs  
Table 2: The key spatial objectives of the local plan  
1.12 The strategic and non- strategic (development management) policies and the spatial land use 
designations are designed to support the objectives of sustainable development.  By abiding by these core objectives, growth can  be positively shaped to the advantage of the people who live and 
work in the borough, ensuring that it unlocks a range of benefits whilst planning out any potential negative impacts.   
1.13 The Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA) uses sustainability objectives and sub -objectives alongside 
other methodologies associated with health, equalities and biodiversity assessments to appraise the Local Plan.  The IIA Report notes that the Plan’s spati al objectives are ‘ broad ranging spanning 
key socio -economic and environmental themes.  As a result, none of the Draft Local Plan objectives have 
been assessed as being incompatible with all of the IIA objectives whilst compatibilities have been 
identified with each IIA objective .’ Bexley Draft Local Plan

Related plans , strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
National Planning Policy  Framework  (NPPF)  
The London Plan (March 2021)  
Bexley Growth Strategy  
Bexley Local Character  Study  
Local Plan Spatial Strategy Technical Paper  
1.14 Government’s National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF ) sets out that l ocal p lans should provide  
a positive vision for the future, a framework for addressing housing needs and  other economic, 
social and environmental  priorities , and a platform for local people to shape their surroundings.  
Plans should be prepared with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable 
development , and set out an overall strategy for the pattern, scale , and quality of development.   
Broad locations for development should be indicated on a key diagram, and land -use designations 
and allocations identified on a policies map.  
1.15 The London Plan 2021, as the strategic development strategy for Greater London,  provides the 
overarching strategy that plans for London ’s growth in a sustainable way .  T able 4.1 of the London 
Plan sets ten-year targets for net housing completions  for which each local planning authority 
should plan .  Because of London’s ability to plan strategically, boroughs can rely on these targets 
when developing their local plans and are not required to carry out their own housing needs 
assessment or take account of nationally derived local level need figures .  For Bexley, the 10-year 
target is for 6,850 net new homes.  Sites are allocated in this Plan to make sufficient provision for housing development for the London Plan 10- year target and the remainder of the Plan period.  A 
full housing trajectory is set out at Ta b l e  41 in Annex C  of this Local Plan . 
1.16 A Plan -led approach, supported by key London Plan and local evidence, has been undertaken.  It 
has identified future housing and economic needs and makes provision for these in the right 
locations across the borough.  Economic growth , generating  10,000 net new jobs , has been 
identif ied over the Plan period.  These jobs are across many sectors, including traditional industrial 
and logistics but also in construction, retail, education and healthcare.  In line with the Local Plan 
vision and objectives, good growth will be secured by foc ussing new development in and around 
the borough’s town centres; railway stations; other relatively well -connected  areas .  Development 
will also be located within  designated i ndustria l areas , making the most of Bexley’s riverside 
location and industrial heritage.  These factors have informed Bexle y’s local plan spatial strategy.   
1.17 Bexley is an outer London borough, where the pattern of residential development has the potential 
for sensitive intensification over time.  Bexley  has two London Plan Opportunity Areas  (OAs) 
within the Thames Estuary growth corridor.  These are areas that have the potential to deliver a substantial amount of the new homes and /or jobs that London needs once the necessary 
infrastructure is in place .  The Thamesmead and A bbey Wood OA  is about to benefit from new 
transport infrastructure,  including  the Elizabeth Line to Abbey Wood .  The Council has worked 
with the Mayor  of London and Royal Borough of Greenwich to produce the recently adopted 
planning framework for the Thame smead and Abbey Wood OA . 
1.18 The  Bexley Riverside  OA is however unlikely to fulfil its development potential during the Plan 
period  as it is dependent on infrastructure improvements that have not yet been committed .  The 
Local Plan does identify growth opportunities in appropriate parts of the area but many of the 
Mayor’s aspirations for Bexley Riverside  OA that are set out in the London Plan will not be fully Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
10 realised in the Plan period.  The Council will continue to work with the Greater London Authority, 
including Transport for London, to identify and develop opportunities and an early review of the 
Local Plan will be undertaken should circumstances change sufficiently to justify it.  
SP1 Achieving sustainable development  – the spatial strategy  
Commitments for sustainable growth  
1. The Council, through its policies and decisions, will aim to:  
a) positively pursue sustainable development in the borough by providing locally specific requirements in 
line with the NPPF and the London Plan; and  
b) achieve sustainable growth in homes, jobs and services to create a network of healthy, well -connected, 
high -quality, desirable places where people want to live, play, learn and work in line with the vision and 
objectives of the Council’s k ey strategies and Local Plan, thus implementing the principles of sustainable 
development.  
2. All new proposals for development must conform with the following principles of securing sustainable 
development in Bexley, where appropriate . 
a) Strengthen and divers ify the local economy by:  
i. reinforcing the network of vibrant and successful town centres;  
ii. optimising the use of the borough’s industrial land through intensification of sites;  
iii. increasing inward investment in new high technology and creative sectors support ed by world -class 
digital infrastructure;  
iv. promoting circular economy principles and business models; and,  
v. improving access to jobs in Bexley, London and the wider south east through the development of 
local skills . 
b) Protect and enhance the natural and built  environment by:  
i. adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change, including flood risk;  
ii. focus sing new development on urban, brownfield sites in accessible locations; and,  
iii. optimising the efficient management of waste and existing natural resources . 
c) Create high -quality, safe and well -connected healthy lifetime communities by:  
i. offering a choice of accessible, living styles that appeal across generations; and  
ii. providing necessary infrastructure, local services, open spaces, and cultural and ed ucational 
facilities.  
Bexley’s sustainable development locations  
3. The p arts of the borough best able to accommodate, at varying densities and amounts, the housing, industrial 
and commercial growth identified for Bexley, including most of its supporting infrastructure, services and 
facilities, are:  
a) the l ocations within the blue boundaries on the key diagram ( Figure 1 ), which illustrate:  
i. areas within 800 metres walking distance of, and including, Bexley’s main town centres and 400 
metres from local town centres;  
ii. areas in the borough within 800 metres of rai lway stations that have a corresponding town centre 
nearby and 400 meters where the station has no adjacent town centre; and,  
iii. areas with public transport access levels (PTALs) of 3 -6; 
b) designated  industrial locations (specifically for industrial growth and intensification); and  
c) within the remainder of the Thamesmead and  Abbey Wood London Plan Opportunity Area not covered 
in parts 3a or b.  
4. Development proposals outside of these areas will only be supported where they demonstrably contribute to 
sustainable de velopment, respect local character and are supported by the required infrastructure.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

Policy implementation  
1.19 The principles of sustainable development are set out in the NPPF and the London Plan .  The 
London Plan, which comprises strategic policies for all of London , is part of Bexley’s Development 
Plan.  There is scope in these documents for local evidence to provide the basis for local plan  
policies, both strategic and detailed in nature.  Local plans are where a spatial strategy should be 
set out for a local planning authority area, demonstrating that local needs are being addressed.  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
12 1.20 Figure 1 (the key diagram) illustrates the  Local Plan spatial strategy.   Sustainable growth will be 
achieved by focus sing new housing, including accompanying services and facilities and many of the 
new jobs, in and around the borough’s main town centres and transport hubs.  These are the 
borough’s sustainable development locations  and are referred to as such throughout this Local 
Plan.  The sustainable development locations explicitly exclude designated Green Belt and 
Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and any designated open spaces and residential amenity green 
spaces within the sustainable development locations are protected from development.   
1.21 Designated green (and blue) infrastructure, including nature conservation areas and Green Belt , is 
protected from development; please refer to Local Plan and London Plan policies that address these areas .  All statutory planning and related land -use designations or functions are defined on 
the submission policies map . 
1.22 Bexley’s contribution to London’s economic growth will be achieved by  intensification of the 
borough’s town centres and designated industrial areas .  The se places are where most employment 
sectors will be located , although a significant number of new jobs in the borough will occur in 
residential areas, such as in schools, health and other community facilities, and in residential care. 
1.23 Use Class E  - Commerc ial, Business and Service, introduced in September 2020, broadly covers 
most town centre uses.  The borough’s town centres, both new and existing with updated boundaries , have the capacity to accommodate predicted growth in the commercial sector, and the 
flexible approach means that Bexley’s  town centres can adapt and thrive even in uncertain times.   
T own centres will play their part as the desired locations for many functions, including shops, 
community facilities and services, new employment opportunities  and housing.   
1.24 A review of Bexley’s industrial land has been undertaken.  Strategic Industrial Land  (SIL) will be 
intensified where possible to optimise the use of this land for appropriate business uses, including waste facilities and wharves, safeguarde d for their industrial purposes.  Locally Significant 
Industrial Sites (LSIS) will also play their part as designated industrial locations.  Most industrial 
uses in the borough are located within these designated areas – only around 7% of industrial 
businesses operate on non-designated industrial sites in Bexley.  
1.25 Bexley has enough surplus  designated industrial  land to accommodate all existing industrial uses, 
including those on non- designated industrial sites, and for the planned growth in jobs for 
employment sectors that should be located within industrial areas.  Nonetheless,  a strategic  
approach of ‘no net loss’ of  existing industrial floor space has been applied in the review and 
designation, or release,  of industrial land .  This allows redevelopment  for residential use in the right 
locations, and also the redevelopment of non -designated industrial sites for residential use, as 
these are often smaller sites located within residential areas or around town centres.  These are prime locations for new homes.  
1.26 New high -quality, affordable and accessible housing, supported by expanded or new community 
services and facilities where needed, should be focussed within the identified sustainable development locations, as these areas already have the best access to public transport, good 
walking and cycling links, shops, and other services.  
1.27 Many social and community services and facilities, such as schools, community centres and smaller 
health services, including GPs and dentists, are also appropriate within existing residential areas to 
provide walk -to services for the borough’s residents, and therefore can be outside of the 
sustainable development locations if necessary . Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
13 1.28 The sustainable development locations across the north of the borough are focussed on Erith town 
centre and the railway stations of Belvedere and Abbey Wood with their new town centre 
designations, and to a lesser extent around the railway  station at Slade Green.   The large 
designated industrial areas in the north of the borough provide sustainable development locations 
for employment growth.  
1.29 Belvedere and Erith can  provide significant mixed -use development opportunities from identified 
large sites.  Included in this approach is the release of a small amount of industrial land that sits 
closest to the new town centre at Belvedere Station –  a key growth location for the borough.  
Growth can also be accommodated within the Thamesmead and Abbey  Wood London Plan 
Opportunity Area, which has a recently adopted Planning Framework.  
1.30 Sustainable development locations across the middle of the borough are focussed in and around 
Bexleyheath and Crayford town centres  and areas with good access to public tr ansport.  These 
central areas provide significant residential or mixed -use development opportunities from 
identified large sites and good opportunities for housing on smaller sites.  As well as Bexleyheath  
and Crayford , these locations spread out to Wellin g and Northumberland Heath, and  the railway 
stations of Bexleyheath, Barnehurst and, to a lesser extent, Falconwood.  
1.31 Sustainable development locations in the south of the borough are focussed on Sidcup town centre 
and its railway station (and accompanying local centre), the local centres of Blackfen and Bexley 
Village, and around the railway station at Albany Park.  These areas will provide more modest growth from predominately smaller sites, around  Sidcup Station and the town centre.   The large 
designated industrial area in the south of the borough at Foots Cray provides a further sustainable 
development location for employment growth.  
1.32 These locations across the borough are considered reasonably accessible, but without a step -
change in public transport infr astructure by the Mayor, Transport for London and central 
Government, opportunities for significant growth will be constrained.  It is therefore vital that 
growth is delivered in a way that meets the needs of Bexley’s residents, whilst protecting the best 
elements of Bexley’s character.  
1.33 Where higher levels of infrastructure investment are confirmed , such as improvements to 
connectivity through the funding of strategic transport schemes , the Council will review this Local 
Plan in order to implement its longer -term  vision for sustainable growth set out in the Bexley 
Growth Strategy.  
Local Plan housing trajectory  
1.34 Figure 2 sets out a summary housing trajectory for the Plan period.  Bexley’s London Plan 10 -year 
housing target is 6,850.  The first five years of the traject ory are met by the Council’s published 
five -year housing land supply (2021/22 to 2025/26) and includes a 20% uplift in supply to meet the 
requirements set out in paragraph 73 of the NPPF.  
1.35 The remainder of the Plan period is made up of the site allocations set out in Part 2 of this 
document and a small sites windfall allowance.  For the Plan period beyond the London Plan period 
(e.g. after 2029), sites from later phases of the Mayor of London’s 2017 strategic housing land 
availability assessment (2017 SHLAA)  and local evidence of identified capacity have formed the 
basis of the site allocations and been used along with rolling forward the windfall allowance for 
small sites, in line with London Plan paragraph 4.1.11. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
14 1.36 The housing trajectory will be kept under r eview and updated annually in the Local Plan 
Monitoring Report, linked to evidence from the Government’s housing delivery test, and the 
Council’s five- year housing land supply report.   A detailed Local Plan housing trajectory is set out at 
Ta b l e  41 in Annex C of this Local Plan . 
 
Figure 2: Bexley local plan housing trajectory for the Plan period (2021 -  2038) (net numbers of housing units)  
1.37 Large sites  (0.25ha and larger) make up 55% of Bexley’s housing target.  Large sites  that are not 
already identified through the Council’s five -year  housing land supply are included in this Plan as 
site allocations  for residential, and residential - led mix ed-use development  (see  PART 2 of this local 
plan).  
1.38 These have been drawn from Bexley’s 2017 call for sites exercise; the GLA ’s 2017 SHLAA; and from 
engagement with landowners and developers .  This  includes three sites that have been released 
from industri al land use designations  for primarily residential development, achieved through an 
industrial land review that is set out in the Employment Land T echnical Paper and the Bexley 
Industrial Land Intensification Study.  
1.39 Small sites (smaller than 0.25ha) make u p 45% of Bexley’s 10- year housing target, as set out in 
London Plan T able 4.2.  Small sites are expressed as a windfall allowance in the housing trajectory, 
which is considered an appropriate approach in London.   
1.40 However, a  small sites exercise was  carrie d out, using the sustainable development locations  for 
areas of search , to ascertain a theoretical development capacity  from small sites.  It is considered 
that these  small  potential development sites, along with a n uplift from sensitive intensification of  
housing in the same areas , provides the basis  to meet the small sites component of the London Plan 
housing target for Bexley.  
1.41 Further information to support the development of small sites , such as design codes, will be 
included  in the Bexley Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document  [the ‘Design Guide SPD ’]. 0100200300400500600700800900Number of completions

2.1 This chapter sets out the strategic and non- strategic policies  that seek to ensur e housing provision 
meets the needs of Bexley’s population and that housing types and tenures reflect local 
circumstances, whilst also contributing to the sustainable growth of London as a whole, taking 
account of the policies already in the London Plan . 
2.2 There were an estimated 92,944 households in Bexley from the 2011 Census.  There were over 
101,000 households in 2019, and this is predicted to rise to almost 135,000 households by 2050.  The average household size was 2. 495 people at the 2011 Census . 
2.3 The population of Bexley will change significantly over the next few decades.  The north of the 
borough will see the highest amount  of Bexley’s growth and the whole borough will become more 
diverse.  In addition, Bexley has an ageing population – the population aged over 75 will almost 
double by 2050.  The younger population will also increase, but to a much smaller extent.

2.4 Bexley is typified as a n outer London borough dominated by predominately privately owned, inter -
war, low density residential neighbourhoods.   House prices in the borough have risen significantly 
in recent years and residents are experiencing affordability issues arising from the relationship between local incomes and house prices.   Since 2011, Bexley’s median house pric e has increased by 
62% compared with wage increases of 5% meaning that the average house price is now ten times the average wage in Bexley, putting home ownership out of reach for many Bexley residents.  
2.5 As a result of demographic change, Bexley is experiencing increased demand for homes, decreasing 
affordability, rising homelessness with its associated need for more temporary accommodation, as 
well as issues around providing suitable dwellings for particular groups such as for families, and for 
the elderly.  Whilst the private rented sector meets the needs of many people and will play an increasingly important role over the Plan period, there are still those that will need to be supported 
through social rented housing stock.  Without addressing these issues, it is likely that there will be 
continuing pressure for temporary accommodation, which is becoming an increasing financial 
burden for the Council to bear.  
2.6 Therefore, as part of the delivery of new housing, the Council encourages the provision  of homes 
that are affordable to local people.  This means housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
16 and/or is for essential local workers); and , which co mplies with one or more of the definitions of 
affordable housing set out in Annex 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF).  The 
NPPF also states tha t where a need for affordable housing is identified, planning policies should 
specify the type of affordable housing required.  
2.7 The NPPF requires that the size, type and tenure of housing needed for different groups in the 
community should be assessed and reflected in planning policy.  It sets out that these should 
include, but not be limited to, those who require affordable housing, families with children, older 
people, students, people with disabilities, service families, people who rent their homes, peop le 
wishing to commission or build their own homes, and travellers.   
2.8 In line with the footnote to paragraph 73 of the NPPF, any identified need for traveller accommodation is in addition to Bexley’s overall housing target.  The London Plan requires 10 -year  
pitch targets for gypsy and travellers to be set out in local plans.  
SP2 Meeting Bexley’s housing requirements  
The Council’s commitments for mixed and balanced communities  
1. The Council will seek to meet the Mayor’s 10 -year housing target for Bexley of 6,850  new homes.  In this 
context, and reflecting local evidence for housing, it is the Council’s aspiration to achieve 50% affordable 
housing as a proportion of all qualifying provision across the borough over the Plan period.  This should be 
achieved  with an overall tenure mix of 70% low cost rented and 30% intermediate housing products and with a 
mix of housing types and sizes identified in the Bexley Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) and set 
out in Ta b l e  3. 
2. The Council will seek to accommodate the specific needs of particular groups of residents.  The Bexley SHMA, 
the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA), and the Council’s Self -build and Custom 
Housebuilding Register identify demand for the fol lowing housing numbers over the Plan period:  
a) 1,008 units of specialist older person accommodation (falling within Use Class C3);  
b) 43 units of residential care accommodation (falling within Use Class C2);  
c) 3.2 gypsy and traveller pitches  (detailed in Ta b l e  4 ) based on a cultural definition of need ; and  
d) 408 self -build homes ( based the annualised figure from new entries on the Council’s self -build register ). 
3. In order to create high -quality, safe and well -connected lifetime communities, which offer a choice of living 
styles that appeals across generations, new homes should be provided that are available to households across a 
range of incomes and sizes.  T o achieve this, the Council will:  
a) seek to deliver a balance of family and other types and sizes of housing within affordable and market 
housing schemes, as identified in the Bexley SHMA;  
b) work closely with registered providers to support the development of n ew homes and explore the 
potential for intensification of existing social housing land;  
c) consider sensitive residential intensification within the borough’s identified sustainable development 
locations; and  
d) monitor the demand for self -build or custom build accommodation in the borough and plan accordingly.  
Housing development on small sites  
4. The Council recognises that the London Plan sets a significant proportion of Bexley’s housing requirement to be 
met through the development of sites smaller than 0.25 hectares in size.  Therefore, the Council will support 
proposals for appropriate developm ent of small sites within the sustainable development locations  set out in 
policy SP1 , illustrated on the Local Plan key diagram  (Figure 1) and defined on the submission  policies map.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

Policy implementation  
2.9 For the Plan period beyond the London Plan period (e.g. after 2029), sites from later phases of the 
Mayor of London’s 2017 strategic housing land availability assessment (2017 SHLAA) and local 
evidence of identified capacity have formed the basis of the site allocations and been used along 
with rolling forward the windfall allowance for small sites, in line with London Plan paragraph 
4.1.11.  
2.10 The Bexley Housing Strategy sets out the Council’s housing priorities over the next five years and 
how the Council will work with partners to deliver these.   The Bexley SHMA has informed the 
affordable housing target for the borough.  The affordable housing target is a borough- wide target 
for the whole of the Plan period  secured  from qualifying schemes.  A qualifying scheme is any 
development proposal that includes 10 or more (gross) homes.  Proposals can come from registered providers of intermediate and social housing, and from  private schemes .  Smaller 
developments (that are still qualifying schemes) could include payments -in-lieu where appropriate. 
2.11 In order to consider an appropriate share of each type of affordable housing tenure, the Bexley 
SHMA considers London Plan and national polic ies, past trends in delivery , and the relative 
affordability of alternative tenure options.  Household income is not available from the housing 
register,  but CAMEO household  income data and Household Survey data have been used to 
investigate the relative affordability of different tenure options.  
2.12 Additional sub -categories setting locally specific requirements within the London Plan target are 
included where justified by evidence.  The Bexley SHMA suggests that , for the elderly,  the need in 
Bexley is overwhelmingly for specialist older persons housing ( Use Class C3), which for clarity 
follows the same definitions set out in the Mayor’s London Plan policy H13 and supporting tex t.  
There is exceptionally low demand for care homes and institutions in the borough and proposals for this type of housing will need to provide a robust demonstration of need by Bexley’s residents.  
2.13 T able 4.3 of the London Plan sets a benchmark figure for specialist older persons housing for 
Bexley of 145 units per annum.  This figure is indicative only and is a component of Bexley’s overall 
housing target, not an additional requirement.  Bexley’s local level assessment of specialist housing 
has identified a need of 70 units per annum, fewer than half the indicative London Plan figure.  
2.14 The Bexley GTAA has considered the need for additional gypsy and traveller pitches over the Plan 
period , using the definition of need in the Planning policy for traveller sites (PPTS) and a ‘cultural ’ 
definition  of need .  Gypsies and travellers are recognised as distinct ethnic minority groups in law Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
18 because they are recognised as members of   communities with a shared history, culture and 
language stretching back over hundreds of years. As such they are granted the full protection of 
the Equality Act.  Therefore, the cultural definition of need includes settled members of the 
community.  
2.15 Ta b l e  4  sets out requirements for gypsy and traveller pitches over the Plan period.  T hese levels of 
need will likely be met through the intensification or extension of existing sites  in line with policy 
DP4 .  The Council will undertake further technical work closer to the time to ensure that this can 
be achieved  on the existing Council site.

Table 4: Overall gypsy and traveller pitch need (source: Table 7.4 from Bexley GTAA Report)  
2.16 The Council monitors both the demand and supply for self or custom -build accommodation.  
Whilst it is considered the polices in this Local Plan support self -build and custom housebuilding, 
the main constraint in London is a ready supply of appropriate land.  Those interested in registering 
on the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Register  can do so on the Council’s website.  
2.17 Family housing is considered to be the type of housing in most demand across all tenures, as 
indicated by Ta b l e  3 .  Analysis from the Bexley SHMA has concluded that 44.6% of hous eholds in 
the borough are families.  Modelling of affordable housing requirements suggests that a range of affordable dwellings are required that will help to address the needs of families.  
2.18 Housing development on small sites above what is needed for self -build is a strategic London- wide 
requirement, in order to boost the supply of land for housing.   The Council supports the 
appropriate development of small sites for new homes within the identified sustainable 
development locat ions  as illustrated on the local plan key diagram  (Figure 1 ). 
2.19 Further information to support the development of small sites, such as design codes, will be included in the Design Guide SPD . 
 DP1: Providing a supply of housing  
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Housing Strategy  
Bexley Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
Whole Plan Viability Assessment  
2.20 Ensuring a supply of appropriate sustainably located housing is possibly the most important 
development need that should be addressed in a local plan, according to Government in its presumption in favour of sustainable development set out in the National Planning Policy 
Statement and planning practice guidance.   A significant change in local housing need, for instance, Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
19 can trigger an early review of a local plan.   In addition, the NPPF cites the provision of affordable 
housing first in its list of types of contributions expected from development.  
2.21 In London, the Development Plan is formed in two tier s, with the  Mayor’s London Plan  setting the 
broad, strategic policies for the whole of London, and each planning authority within London 
preparing local plans for their area .  The NPPF states tha t strategic policy -making authorities 
should establish a housing requirement figure for their whole area, which shows the extent to which their identified housing need can be met over the P lan period .   
2.22 This Local Plan addresses how Bexley will contribute to meeting London’s housing need through its 
first two strategic policies, SP1 and SP2.  Providing a supply of housing of the right types and in 
sust ainable locations is addressed in this policy, justified by local and London Plan evidence.   
2.23 It is important that new housing built in the borough is in the right locations and of the right types 
to ensure that what is built helps to meet the needs of resi dents .   
2.24 Whilst historically much of the provision of hew homes in the borough comes from larger sites, t he 
NPPF and the London Plan seek to encourage a greater number of homes to be provided on small er sites  (less than 0.25 hectares) .  This may however ha ve an impact on the amount of 
affordable housing than can be secured through new development.   Whilst s ome small sites do help 
to deliver affordable housing  they are only required to do so if 10 or more homes are built on the 
site.  
2.25 Interrogation of the Gre ater London Authority’s d evelopment database has shown that since the 
beginning of the previous Local Plan period (2012) , 22% of all housing provision in Bexley has come 
from developments that provide fewer than 10 homes each.  Yet this residential development, close to a quarter of all homes built in the borough, is exempt by Government from making any 
affordable housing contribution.  This has quite an impact on the delivery of affordable housing in 
the borough.   By placing an emphasis on the development of smaller sites for new homes, there is a 
real risk that fewer units of affordable housing will be delivered.  
2.26 With a decline in traditional social housing, the working model is that private sector development 
will generate general market affordability through supply and demand.  However, t here is still a 
place for planning policy to influence; there are real benefits to providing a mix of housing types and tenures because it allows for a choice in the market and is  an effective way of  bringing together 
local communities.   
2.27 The private rented sector is playing an increasingly important role in meeting housing need in the boro ugh and has the potential to meet the needs of those who chose not to or are unable to 
purchase their own home.  Nonetheless there are still those that will need to be supported through 
social rented housing stock.  
DP1 Providing a supply of housing  
1. Development proposals for new housing should be in  the parts of the borough identified as sustainable 
development locations set out in SP1, and must:  
a) be well designed, appropriate for the area, high quality, sustainable and take account of the impacts of 
cumulative development, including on the health and wellbeing of the borough’s residents;  
b) make the most effective and efficient use of land, seeking to achieve higher densities in the most 
accessible locations;  
c) achieve all relevant space, accessibility, environmental, and housing amenity standards; and  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
20 DP1 Providing a supply of housing  
d) encourag e mixed communities  through  ‘tenure blind ’ architecture.  
Affordable housing from qualifying developments  
2. For residential development proposals with a capacity of 10 or more (gross) dwellings, the Cou ncil will follow a 
threshold approach and seek 35% affordable housing on- site.  
3. For all qualifying schemes, a mix of dwelling sizes and tenures, including family housing, will be sought in 
accordance with the Bexley SHMA, as set out in Ta b l e  3 , in order to meet overall need throughout the Plan 
period.  
4. Development proposals that do not meet the affordable housing threshold will be refused unless justified by a 
full, normally un- redacted viability assessment that is submitted at the same time that a planning application is 
submitted.   
Self -build and Cus tom Housebuilding  
5. Developers are encouraged to provide plots, where appropriate, within residential schemes for individuals or 
groups to build their own homes.  
Policy implementation  
2.28 The cumulative impact s of development will have a direct effect on capacity of existing services to 
support existing and new developments.    This can include all types of infrastructure, from social 
and community facilities through to utilities, such as digital, energy, water and wastewater, and 
services such as collection of  waste and street cleaning.  Many service providers have planning 
guidance available for developers.  
2.29 It is expected that the development capacity of sites will be optimised.  Further information on density will be set out in the Design Guide SPD .  The exac t housing type and size mix on each site 
will vary according to the location of the development, the character of the surrounding area and the need to ensure an appropriate range of tenures in the locality.  
Affordable housing  
2.30 On schemes that qualify for affordable housing contributions, affordable housing should be 
provided on -site.  Financial contributions will only be acceptable when on -site provision and all 
potential off -site options have been fully explored and discounted to the satisfaction of the 
Council.  Further information with regards to affordable housing calculations will be provided  in 
planning guidance, reflecting the Council’s preference for on- site provision.  
2.31 For the purposes of affordable housing, residential development is defined as development falling 
under Use Class  C3.  The percentage target mix for housing type and tenure has been set out in the 
Bexley SHMA.  ‘Low cost’ rent includes the London affordable rent and social rent products; intermediate housing products include London Living Rent and London Shared Ownership.  
2.32 The overall requirement for a 35% affordable housing contribution has been assessed for its 
viability and is the recommended policy approach to ensure that the maximum amount of 
affordable housing that can be delivered will be delivered.  By applying a threshold approach for 
securing affordable housing, development proposals that provide 35% affordable housing and that meet tenure, affordability and other relevant requirements , can progress without the need to Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
21 submit det ailed viability information and without late viability review mechanisms that re-assess 
viability at an advanced stage of the development process.  
2.33 This approach provides greater certainty to the market, speeds up the planning process, helps to 
increase the level of affordable housing secured in new developments, as tested through the whole 
plan viability assessment.  Schemes that do not provide the threshold level of affordable housing or 
meet other relevant policy criteria are subject to viabil ity scrutiny and late, as well as early, review 
mechanisms.  
2.34 Ensuring the transparency of a viability assessment is supported in the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.  The assessment will be made publicly available and will be 
independently eval uated at the cost to the applicant.  In very exceptional circumstances there may 
be legitimate reasons for keeping limited elements of viability information confidential.  In this instance the developer is required to follow the guidance set out in the May or’s Affordable 
Housing and Viability SPG.  
2.35 The Council will use Existing Use Value Plus (EUV+) as the comparable Benchmark Land Value when assessing the viability of a proposal.  An alternative approach should only be considered in 
exceptional circumstances which must be robustly justified by the applicant in line with the 
Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.  
2.36 The Council aims to maximise every opportunity to deliver affordable housing.  Where housing 
schemes are approved on the basis of an affordable housing offer below policy requirements, there 
will be triggers set for when a viability re- appraisal of the scheme will occur.  This will be when the 
scheme has been completed and largely occupied, or a mid -term review in the case of longer 
phased schemes, or for schemes that have not started within two years of being granted planning 
permission.  Where viability has improved, the applicant will be expected to make further 
affordable housing provision up to the maximum policy requirement. 
2.37 Whilst no demand has been identified in the borough, the Council will support proposals for new 
purpose built private rented sector accommodation where such schemes meet local need and 
requirements of the London Plan.  Purpose built private rented schemes will be assessed under a 
specific viability approach that recognises the distinct economics of this sector.

2.39 Small sites across the borough are subject to development pressures, with an average of 2 5% of 
new homes built in the borough coming from sites that are smaller than 0.25 hectares.  Many of these sites deliver only a few units and some contribute to a supply for custom housebuilding and 
self -build developments.  However, some small sites can deliver 10 or more homes and this level of Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
22 development would quali fy for a contribution to affordable housing, a key priority of Government, 
the Mayor of London and the Council.  
2.40 The Council carried out a development capacity exercise of small (less than 0.25ha) infill, back land 
and other sites in the sustainable development locations .  The study searched for sites  that had the 
capacity to deliver at least 10 homes and where the primary use of the site is not existing housing.   
This supply, when combined with the many sites that come forward each year with fewer units, 
demonstrates that the potential capacity is there to meet the small sites portion of Bexley’s 
London Plan housing requirement.  The supply is expressed as a small sites windfall allowance in 
the Local Plan housing trajectory.  
2.41 Development  on gardens, green spaces and other residential amenity spaces is o nly appropriate 
where certain criteria are met .  The development of gardens does not fall under the ‘previously 
developed land’ category and this policy sets out requirements that development proposals will 
need to meet in order to demonstrate that in exce ptional cases, building on a green or other 
amenity space can be achieved without adverse impacts.  
2.42 Since the largest proportion of residential gardens in the borough consist of soft landscaping with lawns, mature trees and shrubs and flower beds, they have important environmental benefits.  
Similarly, public, communal or semi- private amenity spaces make important contributions to 
quality of life and the environment.   Many gardens and communal amenity spaces in the borough 
combine with adjacent gardens to form green corridors.   
2.43 Back gardens offer an environment relatively free of vehicles and their associated noise and 
pollution, and thus make an important contribution to the quality of life in the borough, both in 
terms of their amenity and recreational value and outlook, and in terms of their ecological function.  
Development proposals that include these spaces could lead to a substantial loss of amenity for the 
residents of existing dwellings in the vicinity and the character of an area adversely affected . 
DP2 Residential development on backland and inﬁll sites  
1. Proposals for new dwellings on small (less than 0.25ha) brownfield sites, including infill and backland sites, will 
generally be supported where:  
a) the site is located within a sustainable development location as identified on the key diagram ( Figure 1 ); 
b) the development capacity of the site is optimised; and,  
c) the development provides well -designed housing with a high standard of amenity that makes a positive 
contribution to the area.  
2. Proposals for development on residential gardens and/or communal amenity spaces will be resisted, except 
where:  
a) adequate and safe access for veh icles and pedestrians is provided, with no adverse effects on the access 
to adjacent dwellings  
b) there are no adverse effects on the privacy and amenity of residents of neighbouring properties;  
c) distinctive landscape and nature conservation features, such as trees, hedgerows, and ponds, are 
retained; and,  
d) the proposed and existing dwellings retain sufficient private and , if appropriate , communal amenity 
space.  
Policy implementation  
2.44 The redevelopment of brownfield sites within the built environment can make a positive contribution to the street scene, as well as providing other benefits of the development itself.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
23 Redevelopment or extensions of existing non- residential or mixed -use buildings and their service 
yard areas or  blocks of residential garages are examples of brownfield sites where this results in 
net additional housing provision.  
2.45 Infill and back land development can provide an important source of new homes, but only where 
these sites meet certain criteria that ensures the protection of environmental features and an 
acceptable level of amenity for adjacent and future residents.  The character of an area can be 
adversely affected by infill, back land and similar developments both individually and cumulatively.  
Proposals will need to demonstrate that the development of these sites will not lead to a 
substantial loss of amenity for the residents of existing dwellings in the vicinity.   Proposals for 
development on small sites should follow the guidance in the Mayor’s SPG on housing and design 
and further inf ormation will be set out in the Design Guide SPD .  
2.46 In addition, new homes can also be delivered through sensitive intensification.  This would likely 
happen through a combination of extensions, alterations and conversions to existing homes to 
create additi onal units.  The Design Guide SPD will provide detailed requirements for residential 
intensification and further information can be found in the Bexley Local Character Study.  
2.47 In line with Policy SP8 part 1.c, harmful development on gardens will be resisted, unless the criteria set out in this policy  are met.  This applies to proposals within residential gardens, communal 
amenity space associated with flats (whether publicly acc essible, semi -private, or private), and all 
other front, side or back, and/or incidental open space in primarily residential areas that, if 
development were permitted, could lead to a substantial loss of amenity.  
2.48 Each development proposal will be considered on a site by site basis with regards to the criteria in 
this policy and all other relevant policies.   The principles of the urban greening factor (UGF) in the 
London Plan should be adhered to in major developments, including it at the start of the design 
process.  
 DP3: Providing h ousing for older people  
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Housing Strategy  
Aging well strategy  
Bexley Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
2.49 The population of older residents in Bexley is expected to increase, for example over 65s by 40% by  
the end of the Plan period.  Bexley’s Housing Strategy and the Bexley SHMA demonstrate a need to 
diversify the range of older persons’ housing provision, whilst many older people want to stay i n 
their own homes there will be a need for specialised housing for older people.   
2.50 This policy ensures that where this specialist housing is provided, it is of the best quality and in the right location to meet Bexley’s identified needs.  Widening the choi ce in alternative housing 
options for older people could help to free up larger homes for families whilst ensuring that the specific needs of Bexley’s older residents are met.  
2.51 The needs of older people are changing.  Changing aspirations and longer life e xpectancy means 
that different levels of care are needed, whilst also ensuring that people can stay independent for as long as possible.  The need for specialised provision in a safe, supportive environment is 
increasing, reflecting the rise in the number of people who live with dementia and other 
debilitating conditions.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
24 2.52 Further details for supporting older people are set out on the Council’s website.  
DP3 Providing housing for older people  
1. Proposals for new specialist housing for older people will be supported where:  
a) there is an identified need in the borough for the tenure and type of accommodation proposed;  
b) standards of HAPPI have been considered, and implemented where appropriate, to ensure the scheme 
is suitable for the intended occupants; and  
c) the scheme is sustainably located near public transport, shops, local services, community facilities and 
social net works for residents, carers and visitors.  
2. Proposals for residential care establishments that fall under Use Class C2 will need to demonstrate that they 
would provide levels of care as defined in Article 2 of the T own and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 
or any subsequent amendments.  
3. Any loss of specialist housing for older people will be resisted except where the applicant can demonstrate that 
there is no longer an established need in the borough.  
4. Specialist housing for older people will be expe cted to provide an affordable housing contribution  in line with 
policy requirements.  
Policy implementation  
2.
53 Affordable housing contributions from specialist housing for older people will be applied according 
to London Plan requirements and it should be noted that this does not apply to care home 
accommodation.  The London Plan has further detail in policy H13  with regards to care home 
accommodation exemptions.  
2.54 HAPPI (Housing our Aging Population: Panel for Innovation) design principles should be considered when designing specialist housing for older people.  Further details can be found on the 
Housing Learning and Improvement Network (Housing LIN) website.  
2.55 Specialist housing for older people, including those with shared facilities, will be required to 
provide affordable housing where the accommodation is arranged as separate dwellings rather 
than care homes or institutions.  A dwelling is a self -contained unit with a lockable front door that 
has its own bathroom and kitchen.  Each self -contained unit should be counted as a dwelling for the 
purposes of calculating affordable housing provision.  In the case of care homes or institutions, a 
mix of tenures will be encouraged.  
 DP4: Gypsy and traveller accommodation  
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment (GTAA)  
2.56 National planning policy instructs local planning authorities to set criteria to provide a basis for 
decisions on applications for traveller accommodation.  In addition, t he London Plan requires 
boroughs to actively plan for gypsies and travellers’ accommodation needs , and to protect existing 
gypsy and traveller accommodation capacity.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
25 DP4 Gypsy and traveller accommodation  
1. Bexley’s existing provision for gypsies and travellers , listed below and defined on  the submission policies map , 
will be protected, while demand exists.  
2. The following considerations should be taken into account in the determination of locations for future gypsies 
and travellers’ sites: 
a) complying with the requirements of other relevant policies, including policies that seek to protect 
designated areas, such as metropolitan green belt, from inappropriate development;  
b) avoiding areas of flood risk (Environment Agency Flood Zones 2 and 3); and  
c) ensuring there are no significant adverse impacts on the locality including:  
i. the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area;  
ii. the residential amenity of neighbouring properties; and  
iii. the local highway network.  
3. Any proposal  for a new site , or intensification of an existing site,  should:  
a) provide suitable access to local services and facilities and public transport links; and,  
b) be of suitable environmental quality (such as noise and air quality) to not unduly affect the amenity and 
health and wellbeing of potential residents.  
4. Proposed improvements to existing pitches and sites will be supported, where appropriate.  
Policy implementation 
2.
57 Policy SP2 sets out the identified need for additional gypsy and traveller pitches, evidenced by the 
Bexley Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment.  
2.58 There are three sites shown on the submission policies map  designated for traveller 
accommodation.  These are the Council’s site at Powerscroft Road and two private sites at Jenningtree Way and Willow Walk.  
2.59 Availability of government grant will be explored to assist with the maintenance and, where 
necessary, delivery of gypsy and traveller sites.   Improvements could be delivered through site 
intensification.  
 DP5: Houses in multiple occupation and live/work units  
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
Article 4 Direction providing additional planning control of HMOs  
2.60 A house in  multiple occupation (HMO) is defined in planning legislation as a house or flat occupied 
by a certain number of unrelated individuals who share basic amenities such a s a kitchen and 
bathroom.  HMOs are an important source of lower cost housing within the private rented sector, but a number of them clustered in any one area can have an adverse impact on local amenity.   
2.61 Large HMOs need to be licenced and the Council publishes the register of licences granted.  The 
Council has extended control of HMOs to ensure they provide suitable accommodation.  This includes a licensing regime for smaller HMOs, and the introduction of additional planning controls 
through an Article 4 Direction , which came into force on 24 September 2017.  
2.62 The Direction relates to development comprising of a change of use from a use falling within Class 
C3 (dwelling house) of the T own and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) to a Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
26 use falling within Class C4 (house in multiple occupation) of that Order and removes Permitted 
Development rights for this type  of development.  Planning permission will, therefore, be required 
for change of use from Class C3 to Class C4.  The Article 4 Direction applies to the whole of the London Borough of Bexley.  
2.63 Providing local policy requirements for live/work units is important to ensure that the standard of 
accommodation meets the usual requirements for normal residential dwellings.  
DP5 Requirements for HMOs and live/work units  
1. Development proposals for new houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) and non- self -contained live/work units 
(considered, and assessed, as HMOs) will be supported subject to:  
a) demonstrating they will not have an adverse impact on the local area; and  
b) the appropriate quality of the accommodation being proposed.  
2. Self -contained live /work units will be expected to meet all living and space standards for C3 residential 
accommodation.  
Policy implementation  
2.
64 HMO Legislation can be found in the published Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation 
(England) Regulations 2006 and the Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation 
(Additional Provisions) (England) Regulations 2007 . 
2.65 When assessing the impact and quality of the proposed HMO on the local area, issues such as 
highway safety, residential amenity of future and neighbouring occupiers, refuse arrangements, 
Bexley’s HMO Living and minimum space standards and the Rent it Right Scheme will be 
considered.  This policy may also consider the communal Collective Living concept, subject to 
evidence.  Non- self -contained live/work units will be considered, and assessed, as HMOs.  
2.66 A self -contained live/work unit is defined as a single unit (e.g. studio or one bedroom) consisting of 
both a commercial and a residential component that is occupied by the same resident (composite E(g)/ C3 use).  The live/work unit shall be the primary dwelling of the occupant.  
2.67 Self -contained live/work units must meet space standards for C3 accommodation, which are set 
out in the Mayor’s Housing SPG and nationally described space standards.  
2.68 Consideration will be given as to whether planning conditions are applied that seek to secure a 
continuing ratio between workspace and living space.  In addition, the Council will consider the use 
of planning conditions to prevent sub -division and to restrict residentia l occupation to those 
employed in the linked workspace.

compromised if the existing stock or sites identified for residential development are used for other 
purposes without replacement.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
27 DP6 Loss of existing housing  
1. Development resulting in the net loss of all or part of a dwelling will generally be resisted, except where:  
a) it would replace a ground floor residential unit within a town centre with a ground floor main town 
centre use;  
b) it would replace significantly substandard units with fewer, high- quality units; or  
c) the loss would allow for the provision of a community facility that is suitable for residential areas, 
subject to no significant adverse impacts on neighbouring properties.  
2. The loss of housing units through estate regeneration may be considered acceptable  where the overall amount 
of affordable floorspace or habitable rooms is retained or, ideally, increased.  
3. Proposals to return vacant homes back into use will be supported.  
Policy implementation  
2.
70 Residential units within town centres should be located above ground level where possible to allow 
for more ‘active’ main town centre uses at ground level.  It would be appropriate for access 
doorways and entrances to be located at ground floor level for accommodation above.  
2.71 A significantly substandard dwelling is determined by having regard to the following; current 
space, layout, ceiling height or amenity standards as set out in local or regional guidance and 
cannot be reconfigured to do so.  A high- quality dwelling is one that meets these standards as  a 
minimum and exceeds them where possible.  What constitutes an acceptable number of 
substandard dwellings to be lost and replaced with higher quality dwellings will be considered on a 
case by case basis.  
2.72 Where estate regeneration schemes would lead to an overall loss of housing units, this may be 
allowed if smaller units are being replaced  with much needed affordable family housing .  In 
addition, the overall amount of affordable floorspace or habitable rooms should be  retained or, 
ideally, increased .  These benefits will be considered carefully against any overall loss of housing 
units, on a case by case basis.  This can be within the scheme or potentially as part of a wider 
programme , provided  the overall amount of affordable  housing is not reduced within the borough .

Local Implementation Plan 
3.1 Bexley expects to play an important role in London’s future economy and making London a resilient 
city  and build back better.  This chapter sets out the strategic and non -strategic policies that help 
ensure growth is sustainable and dea lt with in a coordinated manner, taking account of the policies 
already in the London Plan.  A  variety of matters are addressed, such as protecting designated  
industrial land in the borough for employment uses, promoting the circular economy model, and sup porting increased diversity of the local employment offer and an improvement to workforce 
skills.  
3.2 Bexley has an established industrial land base, and a well -performing town centre network.  Local 
plan policies are needed to support the continued prosperity and development of these 
employment locations.  It is essential that enough employment land is set aside to accommodate 
job growth.  There is a need to stimulate land -use intensification in employment locations and in 
and around the borough’s town centres.  This ensures the most viable and sustainable areas remain the focus for future economic develop ment.   
3.3 The vitality and viability of the borough’s town and neighbourhood centres will not just rely on 
growth; it will also depend upon adapting easily to changes in national retail and leisure trends.  
Policies in this chapter set out a more flexible approach to uses in town centres to ensure they 
remain strong and successful over the Plan period.

Industrial Land Intensification St udy  
Employment Land Technical  Paper  
Employment Land Review Update  
3.4 Currently, the borough’s employment land is mainly connected to traditional industrial activities, 
particularly in respect of some larger employment sites that help to facilitate Bexley’s regional  role 
in sectors like logistics, recycling and waste management, and also support niche strengths such as food processing.  These employment sites, some of which have safeguarded wharves, are often 
located within Bexley’s London Plan Opportunity Areas.   However, some existing employment 
areas and sites are not well suited to the needs of modern business, as they suffer from poor public realm and ageing infrastructure.   
3.5 The borough is therefore well positioned to encourage businesses to transition from a li near 
economy  model , where resources are transformed into products that are then disposed of , to a 
circular economy  model .  The World Economic Forum defines this as an industrial system that 
replaces the end of life concept with restoration and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems and business models.   Development proposals that Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
29 adopt  the design principles of the circular economy for building approaches are supported by the 
Mayor of London.  
SP3 Employment growth, innovation and enterprise  
1. Bexley will continue to play a key role in contributing to London’s economic growth and prosperity.  The Council 
will support the economic growth of at least 10,000 new jobs over the Plan period.   The Council will assist in 
developing a strong and sustainable local economy by embedding circular economy principles, so as to 
contribute to the resilience of London and the regeneration of the Thames Gatew ay.  The Council will work with 
partners to secure investment that supports the local economy.  
2. The Council will promote sustained economic development and employment growth by supporting 
development proposals that broaden the mix of business uses and dive rsify the local employment offer, 
particularly in bringing higher quality and more knowledge based jobs to the borough, both within town centres 
such as Bexleyheath, and designated industrial locations, and through the designation of Sidcup as a Creative 
Enterprise Zone.  Proposals for economic development should, where possible:  
a) intensify land -uses to optimise the use of land, particularly on those sites identified in Ta b l e  7 ; 
b) increase employment densities;  
c) provide higher employm ent densities in well- connected locations;  
d) enable businesses to share facilities and equipment where practical, for example goods lifts, loading 
bays and ancillary facilities;  
e) make smaller units available as part of larger developments to support small and  medium businesses;  
f) improve the quality of employment areas and town centres, including the public realm, to make them 
more suitable and attractive locations for modern businesses; and,  
g) apply circular economy design principles for building approaches.  
3. Des ignated strategic industrial locations (SIL) and locally significant industrial sites (LSIS) will be protected for 
industrial type activities and related functions, including ancillary facilities, specific to their designation in the 
hierarchy, as set out in policy DP7  Appropriate uses within designated industrial areas.   These designations are 
defined on the submission policies map . 
4. The C ouncil aim s to ensure that residents of all abilities are provided with opportunities to access training and a 
variety of local jobs and enable local businesses to draw upon a wide range of skilled workers and employment 
premises.  Key to this will be a be tter integrated and enhanced public transport network connecting Bexley’s 
housing and employment locations.  The Council will achieve these aims by:  
a) reducing residents’ need to travel long distances by supporting the creation of a diverse local economy 
that offers a wide range of well -connected local job opportunities, particularly in Bexley’s designated 
industrial locations, town centres, neighbourhood parades and other places of employment including 
education and healthcare;  
b) improving the local skills base, especially by ensuring that education and training facilities, are available 
to residents, and by supporting the development of place and making initiatives in the borough;  
c) encouraging businesses and developers, through planning obligations, to use locally sourced labour and 
where viable, to provide apprenticeships and on -the -job training for residents seeking to improve their 
skills  
d) supporting the provision of workplace crèches at or near places of training and employment; and,  
e) facilitating gr owth of the visitor economy and creative industries to support local business, particularly 
by promoting the borough’s historic, cultural, recreational and environmental assets.  
Policy implementation  
3.6 This strategic policy provides a mechanism for the Council to proactively evolve its offer of 
business premises, such that it can attract the most beneficial mix of modern employers, including 
those of emerging growth and creative sectors and small and medium enterprises.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
30 3.7 Designated industrial locations and town centres are shown on the submission policies map .  To 
encourage commercial, business and service growth and investment, the i ntensifi cation and 
modernisation of  premises  and sites within town centres and designated  industrial locations to 
meet expected future business needs is necessary .  The Council will only accept schemes that have 
provided robust evidence that the development proposal optimises the site and applicants must 
set out the options explored for intensification in their Planning Statements.  This will contribute to 
the provision of  modern high- quality business accommodation and improve the effectiveness of 
the employment offer, creating a diversity of jobs and improved skills levels.  
3.8 Improvements to town centres and designated industrial  locations should include more 
sustainably designed buildings and sites, where the benefits add appeal to prospective tenants and 
allow busi nesses to grow.  Development proposals should not compromise the integrity or 
effectiveness of designated industrial locations to accommodate employment in accordance with 
the agent of change principle set out in paragraph 182 of the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF ). 
3.9 The Council will support education and training to improve the local skills base.  This policy supports the development of place and making initiatives in the borough, to facilitate education 
and training across all aspects of the built environment.

Article 4 Directions Technical Paper  
3.10 This policy ensures that industrial floor space capacity is appropriately managed across the 
borough.  The potential for industrial intensification has  been identified on designated industrial 
sites in order to free up land for much needed housing and supporting infrastructure.  Industrial land consolidation has been carried out as part of a strategically coordinated process that is 
integral to the development of this Local Plan.  
3.11 A review of Bexley’s industrial land has been undertaken.  Bexley’s primary and secondary 
employment land as identified on the 2004 Unitary Development Plan Proposals Map, has been assessed.  The Bexley Core Strategy 2012 and London Plan 2016 both identified a managed 
release of approximately 50 hectares of designated industrial land in the borough over the Plan 
periods of both those documents and this process was underway when reviews of the Local Plan 
and the London Plan began in 2017.    
3.12 Working with the GLA, a baseline position of remaining industrial land in the borough has been 
determined.  With a starting position of the designated employment land set out in the 2004 UDP 
and defined on the UPD Proposals Map, all employment land with planning consents that changed the use of the site up to and including 31 March 2017  have had the industrial designation  changed 
to the consented use, unless  the planning decision included a condition for the site to revert to 
employment use if the consented use ceased.   Th e date of 31 March 2017 has been used as it is the 
baseline date  for much  of the technical evidence supporting the reviews of the London Plan and 
the Bexley Local Plan.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
31 3.13 An audit has been carried out and the amount of existing industrial floor space and operational 
yard space determined.  The role and function of industrial sites and areas have been analysed and 
industrial designations (e.g. strategic, of local significance, or undesignated) reviewed.  Ta b l e  5  
summarises the changes to designated industrial land, and Figure 3  maps these locations.

3.14 Strategic Industrial Land (SIL) will be intensified where possible to optimise the use of this land for 
appropriate business uses, including waste facilities and wharves, safeguarded for their industrial 
purposes.  In some cases, land without a formal land -use designation has been allocated to SIL, to 
rationalise industrial processes already happening on the sites or to capitalise on a site’s ability to 
provide additional industrial land in a location that would be highly suitable.  Existing uses however 
will not be affected by this change to the land use designation.  
3.15 Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS) will also play their part as designated industrial locations.  
Most industrial uses in the borough are located within these designated areas –  only a round 7% of 
industrial businesses operate on non- designated industrial sites in Bexley.  
3.16 Bexley has enough surplus designated industrial land to accommodate all existing industrial uses, 
including those on non- designated industrial sites, and for the planned growth in jobs for 
employment sectors that should be located within industrial areas.  Nonetheless, a strategic approach of ‘no net loss’ of existing industrial floor space has been applied in the review and 
designation, or release, of industrial land.   
3.17 The Employment Land T echnical Paper and Industrial Land Intensification Study ha ve provided the 
evidence for the release of designated employment land through the assessment of sites, and the setting out of considerations to guide future uses on the relea sed sites.  The existing floor space 
capacity and operational area of industrial sites that have been released to other land uses totals 51,380m2 with the capacity provided on sites in designated strategic industrial locations identified 
as having good pot ential for intensification.  Ta b l e  6  summarises the floor space of the released

River Cray in the east, and falls within the Bexley  Riverside Opportunity Area  (a London Plan 
designation).  A planning framework prepared for the OA could  provide further detail and guidance 
for land released for other uses, and for land  remaining  in industrial use.  
DP7 Appropriate uses within designated industrial areas  
1. Two types of industrial land are designated in the borough:  
a) Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL); and  
b) Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS).  
2. In designated Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL) and Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS), as identified on 
the submiss ion policies map , the following uses for industrial type activities and related functions, including 
ancillary facilities, will be permitted and safeguarded:  
a) Class B2 and B8  
b) Class E(g)iii, only where the permitted function cannot change to any other E Use Class  
3. Within SIL, p roposals  for  sui generis industrial uses, such as for waste management and disposal installations or 
utilities functions, will usually be permitted within SIL, provided  that the use does not impede the effective 
operation of other n earby businesses in the SIL or the primary function of the SIL as a business area.  These uses  
are not considered  an appropriate use within LSIS.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
34 DP7 Appropriate uses within designated industrial areas  
4. In designated industrial locations, d evelopment proposals should seek to intensify, renew and modernise 
busin ess uses, including the assembly of land to achieve this . 
5. Development proposals should  not result in a net loss of  existing  industrial floor space for Class E(g)(iii), B2 and 
B8 uses in all designated industrial locations.  Co- location with non- industrial uses will be considered on LSIS 
provided the principle of no net loss of  existing  industrial floor space is achieved.  
6. Non- designated industrial sites should be assessed in line with criteria set out in London Plan policies, 
particularly E4 and E7 
7. The SIL at Crossness Sewage Treatment Works is safeguarded for its strategic utilities infrastructure use  and its 
operational area identified on the submission policies map . 
8. In the Foots Cray Business Area, development proposals for existing E(g)(i) offices will only be permitted to 
change use to other suitable business uses  (where not covered by permitted development rights).  
Non -conforming uses  
9. Extensions, alterations, intensification or any other form of development for existing non -industrial uses on 
designated industrial land will not be supported.  
T emporary uses  
10. The  Council will support the temporary occupation of empty buildings and cleared sites by temporary uses for a 
maximum of three years that shall not be renewed, where they contribute to regeneration; enhance the 
character and vitality of the area; and, where they do not harm the operation of the remainder of the estate.  
Policy implementation  
3.
20 The updated industrial land designations including changes to the hierarchy are defined on  the 
submission policies map .  For clarity and consistency, the London Plan designation notations of 
strategic industrial locations (SIL) and locally significant industrial sites (LSIS) are being used in the 
Local Pla n and submission policies map  in place of the terms primary employment areas and 
secondary employment areas, previously used in the Core Strategy and UDP .  
3.21 Notwithstanding the above uses, in designated industrial locations where non-B- Class operations 
are already in existence, proposals should seek to provide B -Class operations.  Proposals involving 
a quantum of floor space to be used for display and sales should demonstrate that those uses are clearly ancillary to a primary Class B use.  Small- scale walk -to services, such as a workplace crèche 
or café, which meet the essential day- to-day needs of industrial occupiers in the SIL or LSIS, wi ll 
generally be permitted, provided that the proposed use is necessary to support functioning 
industrial activity and it would not adversely affect the industrial status or operation of the area.  
3.22 A detailed approach to optimising sites, including criteria for sites considered to be suitable for 
multi- storey industrial typologies  are included  in the Industrial Land Intensification Study  and will 
be set out in the Design Guide SPD.  The baseline and methodology for this approach are  set out in 
the Industrial Land Intensification Study . 
3.23 Sui generis uses (uses that do not fall into a use category prescribed by the Use Classes Order 
1987, as amended) that are complimentary to industrial uses will be considered on their individual 
merits having regard to the objectives and policies for each area and the appropriateness of the Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
35 use in each location.  Proposals for waste management and disposal installations will usuall y be 
permitted, provided that the use does not impede the effective operation of other nearby 
businesses in the SIL or the primary function of the SIL as a business area.  These would not be 
considered appropriate in LSIS.  
3.24 The Council will monitor the number of changes of use of business and commercial units which fall 
under Class E to Class C3 (residential) to understand the loss of such units and the impact on the 
borough’s longer term ability to meet the need for employment floorspace.  Should the need rise to 
safeguard the provision of units within these key industrial sites, the Council will explore additional 
measures to provide protection for these designated areas.  This includes the introduction of an 
‘ Article 4 Direction. ’  
3.25 A concentration of large office premises in the Foots Cray Business Area  (designated strategic 
industrial land)  is evidence of a healthy and well -functioning office market that has been identified 
in this location, commanding the highest office rental values in the borough, reflecting the area’s 
good road  links and supply of purpose-built premises of good quality .  Where a proposal to change 
use is not covered by permitted development rights, the Council would only support the loss of office space where it would change use to anoth er employment use suitable for being located on 
strategic industrial land .  The Council is considering the use of an Article 4 Direction in the Foots 
Cray Business Area that would remove the permitted development rights for offices to convert to 
residentia l use.  
3.26 Non- conforming uses prevent the opportunity to maximise industrial capacity within SIL/LSIS and 
potentially cause harm to appropriate uses through the agent of change principle.  T o ensure an appropriate balance of employment uses, the Council will restrict further expansion of retail floor 
space in designated industrial locations to instances only where the use is demonstrated to be 
ancillary to a primary Class B use. 
 DP8: T elecommunications and digital infrastructure  
Related plans, strategies and k ey evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Local Character Study  
3.27 The Council supports the expansion of high- quality, reliable electronic communication networks, 
including telecommunications and high- speed broadband, and will facilitate the expansion of t his 
technology as it is key to economic growth.  And, as the world goes increasingly online, it will be 
essential that no one gets left behind.  Digital technology allows residents to access local 
community facilities and services.  
3.28 Some types of digital infrastructure, in particular data centres, are most appropriately located in 
the borough’s strategic industrial locations.  Other elements of the telecommunications network will need to be located throughout the borough in order to achieve full digital connectivity.  
3.29 However, it must also be recognised that telecommunications equipment can be very intrusive in 
the environment and the overall number of masts and sites should be limited to only what i s 
necessary for operational needs, including future capacity linked to the planned growth in the borough.  It will, therefore, be necessary to balance the need for such equipment with the need to 
protect the character and appearance of the area, particularly in certain sensitive areas.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
36 DP8 T elecommunications and digital infrastructure  
1. Proposals for new or upgraded telecommunications and associated equipment will be supported, including 
masts, cabinets and other related equipment, and should be located so as to minimise any adverse effects 
ensuring that:  
a) the installation(s) are kept to a minimum, consistent with the efficient operation of the network;  
b) opportunities for the sharing or clustering of facilities has been fully considered, including siting masts 
on existing buildings;  
c) they are sited and designed to minimise their visual impact and appearance, including through the 
choice of materials and colour;  
d) they do not cause undue harm to the character or appearance of the associated building or area;  
e) appropriate planting and landscaping ha s been incorporated to help screen installations; and  
f) there is no undue harm to highway safety or the functionality of other street furniture.  
Policy implementation  
3.30 Digital technology will help deliver social and economic growth and plays a vital role in the 
provision of local community facilities and services.  The Council will expect development to be 
supported by the latest digital infrastructure and encourages early discussions with operators.  
3.31 The criteria set out in this policy aim to minimise the intrusion of equipment by promoting shared 
use of masts, locating equipment on existing structures (e.g. tall buildings) and seeking the most 
sensitive location and design of equipment.  
3.32 Much of the development undertaken by code systems operators is permitted  development but 
some development requires prior approval of details of the siting or appearance of the equipment.  In determining full planning applications, the Council will take account of Government guidance 
including in statutory regulations as releva nt. 
3.33 National planning guidance outlines that telecommunications applications must be supported by 
detailed information including consultations with interested organisations and a certification that 
the operational exposure for new masts or base stations (or additions to existing) will not exceed 
International Commission on non- ionising radiation protection guidelines.

3.34 Evidence shows that town centres now function as much more than a retail destination, providing 
a large range of services, facilities, employment and experiences for residents  in an accessible 
location.  The Council wishes to ensure that this expanding role is encouraged, allowing a greater diversity of town centre uses and therefore reducing the need to travel . 
3.35 Creating and supporting a thriving local economy has positive benefits for residents, ranging from 
health outcomes and e mployment  opportunities to community cohesion and crime reduction.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
37 3.36 The London Plan also sets out a town centre hierarchy, of which Bexley’s network is a part.  Policy 
SP4 ensures that Bexley’s town centres continue to grow and develop in a way that supports and 
strengthens the town centre network hierarchy for the borough.  
SP4 Supporting successful town centres  
1. To realise a network of successful town centres, the Council will work with key stakeholders including the 
Mayor of London and Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), to maintain and enhance the vitality and viability 
of the borough's hierarchy of town centres.  In particular, the Council will:  
a) support proposals for main town centre uses in Bexley’s defined town and local centres, including 
residential -led dev elopment on appropriate sites;  
b) ensure that all new development is appropriate in scale, design and location, and does not negatively 
impact on the hierarchy in accordance with national and regional policy and local need;  
c) maintain town centres as the places  where c ommercial, business and service uses are  concentrated, as 
designated on the submission policies map , and support development proposals for the intensification, 
renewal and modernisation of these uses. ; 
d) seek to secure a healthy mix of shop sizes and types, as well as encourage the introduction of pop -up 
shops and other appropriate temporary uses, including for cultural and creative uses, where they 
support the vitality and viability of the centre;  
e) apply the town centre sequential test to all relevant developments as set out in national and regional 
policy and the retail impact assessment on new developments and redevelopments over a locally set 
threshold of 280m2 gross; 
f) support an evening economy across our town centres, and a night -time economy in Bexleyheath, with 
new development supporting the creation of a comfortable, safe, attractive and accessible day and 
evening environment;  
g) support the development of new cultural venues in town centres and places with good public transport 
connectivity;  
h) strongly encourage hot food takeaway operators to comply with the Healthier Catering Commitment 
standards;  
i) support the creation of attractive town centre through high- quality design;  
j) work with partners to enhance existing markets and, where appropriate, to establish new markets;  
k) promote the provision of Shopmobility schemes or similar to ensure maximum accessibility for all;  
l) seek to ensure that the vitality and viability of the borough’s designated neighbourhood centres are 
maintained and enhanced in order that they continue to provide a level of service of neighbourhood 
significance; and  
m) develop a town centre strategy for each town centre in accordance with London Plan requirements . 
Policy implementation  
3.37 Bexley’s town centres should be able to respond rapidly to changes in trends for leisure , retail and 
other commercial uses to ensure they remain lively and viable places, with low vacancy rates and 
healthy footfalls.  The requirements of national guidance now create a more balanced offer of 
retail and leisure within town centres protecting the town centre first approach, including the use of sequential and impact tests for appropriate developments.  
3.38 New development in or around town centres will be required to positively contribute to the town 
centres’ viability and vitality, as well as helping create a safe, attractive and accessible 
environment, both during the day and evening.  Detailed guidance and information will be  set out 
in the Design Guide SPD.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
38 3.39 The evening economy is town centre activities that tend to finish around 11pm.  The night time 
economy refers to establishments with late night licences that can run into the early hours of the 
morning, particularly at weekends.  
3.40 Residential development within town centres is supported above ground floor level, where this 
does not harm the viability and vitality of the town centre.  It is recognised that residents living in 
tow n centres should anticipate a different level of amenity that those in primarily residential areas.   
Separation distances may be closer, or noise levels higher, for example.   The agent of change 
principle in the London Plan supports this approach.  
3.41 Active street frontages (such as frequent doors and windows) should be achieved  where there are 
ground floor residential frontages within a town centre.  
3.42 Findings from the Retail Capacity Study suggest a local impact assessment threshold for retail and leisure development of 280m2 (gross) is appropriate for Bexley.  This applies to new and 
replacement gross retail floor space (the redevelopment of existing floor space alongside additional floor space) where this is outside of an existing centre.   This ensures that a town centre 
first approach is maintained towards cumulative incremental increases in out -of-centre retail 
stores that could materially change the nature of a whole scheme through small extensions.  
3.43 The Healthier Catering Commitment (HCC) is a pa n-London voluntary project, locally run to 
encourage restaurants, cafes and takeaways to make a commitment to adopting healthier food preparation practices and offer healthy options.   The Council will work with businesses to create 
the business case for supporting healthy lifestyles and explore the possibility of instigating a Bexley Business Award focus sed on Healthy Lifestyles.   The Bexley Obesity Strategy provides 
further information and guidance.   
3.44 Shopmobility schemes should use innovative approaches, such as the use of E -assist pedal scooters 
where possible rather than reliance on full Electric mobility scooter.

3.45 The London Plan identifies a range of measures boroughs should undertake in relation to town 
centres, including setting out policies for each type of area within centres.  The NPPF requires 
boroughs to make clear the range of uses permitted in designated town centres.  T own centres are 
places where a wide range of uses help to ensure vitality and viability is maintained.  This policy sets out appropriate  uses by location within a centre.  
3.46 T o ensure that a healthy balance of uses is maintained, the Council w ill actively manage through 
the planning process the concentration of different Use Classes (where it can do so through the Use Class Order) within town centres by designating town centre boundaries  where commercial, 
business and service uses are concentra ted. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
39 3.47 A review of town and neighbourhood centres has been carried out and the updated hierarchy of 
town centres and town centre boundaries are shown on the submission policies map .  The 
definition of each type is set out in the London Plan, which states in Part C of Policy SD8 that changes to District, Local, Neighbourhood centres can be brought forward through Local Plans 
where supported by  evidence in development capacity assessments and town centre health checks 
and subject to assessments of retail impact where appropriate.   
3.48 The additions of Lower Belvedere as a district town centre, and Abbey Wood Village, Bexleyheath Station and Sidcup Station as local town centres have been assessed in the review  and information 
is provided in the Retail and T own Centres T echnical Paper .  The Bexley Retail and Leisure Study 
has informed the new town centre boundaries and the allocation of future retail  capacity.   
3.49 The development of a planning framework for the Bexley Riverside Opportunity Area will further 
define the development of Lower Belvedere District Centre to help to improve the town centre to 
make it more sustainable.  
3.50 The town centre boundaries  are sufficient enough tools to manage the range of uses across town 
centres and will therefore replace the previously designated core and non- core frontages.  The 
new town centre boundaries reflect the current shopping patterns, the changing nature of the role 
and function of town centres, and the more diverse mix of uses that contribute to this, including residential .  Because of this, and the introduction of the new E Use Class that incorporates retail 
uses, the Primary Shopping Area (PSA) for each town centre will encompass the same area as the town centre boundaries.  
3.51 This policy applies to the following town centres or hierarchy level : 
• Major Centre – Bexleyheath  
• District Centres –Crayford, Erith, Lower Belvedere (new designation) , Sidcup, Welling  
• Local  Centres – Abbey Wood Village  (new designation) , Bexley Village, Bexleyheath 
Station  (new designation), Blackfen, Northumberland Heath, Sidcup Station (new 
designation) , Upper Belvedere 
DP9 Development within town centres  
1. The Council will promote a diversification of town centre uses, including commercial, business and service uses, 
community, leisure, cultural and recreational uses, and residential uses, whilst avoiding an over concentration of 
any one non- class E use.  
2. Development proposals in town centres will need to demonstrate that the Agent of Change principle has been 
considered.  
3. Changes of use that would result in a net loss of ground floor main town centre uses within the designated town 
centre boundary will be resisted.  
4. Changes of use tha t would result in a net loss of ground floor Class E uses within the town centre boundary 
should ensure that:  
a) the proposed use is a main town centre use;  
b) the use contributes to the vitality and viability of the town centre;  
c) a significant percentage of the units within the town centre boundary will remain in Class E use;  
d) the proposed use has an active frontage immediately accessible from the street; and,  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
40 DP9 Development within town centres  
e) the proposed use would not result in two or more adjoining units of takeaways, betting offices/shops, 
pay day loan shops, and pawn brokers, with a maximum of 10% of units with these uses collectively, and 
in any event, no one use above 5% of units, across the town centre . 
Policy implementation  
3.52 Use Class E Commercial, business and service, was introduced to the T own and Country Planning 
(Use Classes) Order in September 2020. This allowed for a greater range of movement between 
different uses within this class that are automatically permitted without the need to apply for 
planning permission. More information can be found on the Government’s Planning Portal  website. 
3.53 Main town centre uses are defined in the Glossary of the NPPF.  These include retail d evelopment 
(including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment facilities , the more 
intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive- through restaurants, 
bars and pubs, night -clubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo 
halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries 
and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities).    
3.54 For the purposes of this policy, Use Classes F1(d) public libraries and F2(b) local community halls 
are considered main town centre uses.  
3.55 Due to the importance of the maintenance of a critical mass of commercial uses to the viability and vitality of the borough’s town centres and the importance of these units in meeting employment 
need within the plan period, the Council will be monitoring the level and distribution of business 
and commercial units in its centres.  Should this monitoring indicate, or other emerging policy 
changes threaten, harm to amenity or wellbeing, the Council will explore additional measures to 
provide protection for these areas.  This will include the introduction of an ‘ Article 4 Direction. ’  
3.56 Within town centres, residential uses above shops are generally supported.  It would be 
appropriate for access doorways and entrances to be located at ground floor level for 
accommodation above.   The Council is considering the use of an Article 4 Direction that would 
remove the permitted development rights for existing Class E uses to convert to residential use at ground floor level within town centres.  
3.57 The Agent of Change principle is set out in the London Plan. It places the responsibility for 
mitigating the impact of existing noise and other nuisances firmly on the new development. The onus is on the new use to ensure its building or activity is designed to protect existing users or 
residents from noise impacts. Applications for development proposals in town centres should 
clearly demonstrate how noise and other nuisances will be mitigated and managed.  
3.58 As a general rule of thumb, a shopping unit is that part of the unit facing the main road.  One unit is 
considered to have a linear width of between five and ten metres.  Anything below or above this 
width will be calculated proportionately (i.e. a shop front with a width of 12 metres will be 
considered two units and less than five metres will be considered half a unit).  Guidance on creating 
active shopfronts, including window displays, will be  set out in the Design Guide SPD.  
3.59 Some sui generis uses are not considered to be town centre uses and will therefore be assessed on 
a use-by -use basis taking into account recent changes in the Use Class order regarding takeaways, Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
41 betting shops and pay day loan shops.  When any secondary use becomes more than just ancillary 
to the primary use it becomes a mixed -use sui generis unit.

Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Retail and Leisure Study  
Retail and Town Centres Technical Paper  
Article 4 Direction s Technical Paper  
3.60 The NPPF notes that planning policies should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places 
which promote social interaction through strong neighbourhood centres and the provision of local 
shops and other local services.   The London Plan states that boroughs should id entify and promote 
the complementary offers of the smaller centres in the network including neighbourhood centres and small shopping parades.   
3.61 This policy seeks to ensure that local people have immediate and convenient access to services and 
facilities to  meet their day- to-day needs through the maintenance of the borough’s supply of retail 
provision.  It recognises that neighbourhood centres  and small shopping parades are important for 
health, wellbeing and social interaction.    
3.62 These play a key role in meeting ‘walk to’ every day needs and are often the core of healthy lifetime 
neighbourhoods.  Planning policies should guard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities 
and services, particularly where this would reduce the community’s ability to meet its day -to-day 
needs.  They should also ensure that established shops, facilities and services are able to develop and modernise, and are retained for the benefit of the community.   
3.63 The borough- wide network of neighbourhood centres is listed in Ta b l e  8 , small parades listed in 
Ta b l e  9  and locations identified on the submission policies map . 
DP10  Neighbourhood centres and small parades  
1. Changes of use from Class E in designated neighbourhood and small parades will be supported if:  
a) the use positively contributes to the vitality and viability of the parade;  
b) the proposed use would include an active frontage immediately accessible from the street;  
c) the proposed use would not re sult in two or more adjoining units of  takeaways, betting offices/shops, 
pay day loan shops  and pawn brokers, with a maximum of one unit or 10% of units with these uses 
collectively across the neighbourhood centre  
d) the proposed use would not result in more than one unit of  takeaways, betting offices/shops, pay day 
loan shops , and pawn brokers, across the small parade.  
2. Neighbourhood centres are expected to contribute to projected jobs growth over the Plan period and 
commercial, business and services functions within the centre should not be lost to residential uses . 
Policy implementation  
3.64 Use Class E Commercial, business  and service, was introduced to the T own and Country Planning 
(Use Classes) Order in September 2020.  This allowed for a greater range of movement between 
different uses within this class that are automatically permitted without the need to apply for planning permission.  More information can be found on the Government’s Planning Portal  
website. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
42 3.65 The Council is considering the use of an Article 4 Direction that would remove the permitted 
development rights for existing Class E uses to convert to residential use at ground floor level 
within neighbourhood centres and small parades of shops.  These very local shopping areas provide walk -to services, contributing the liveable neighbourhoods, and are the most likely to be lost 
completely if ground floor commercial uses were not protected.  
3.66 A proliferation of certain sui generis uses can negatively affect the vitality and viability of Bexley’s neighbourhood centres and small shopping parades  and can have an impact on people’s health, 
including mental health.  These uses could be hot food take-away shops, betting shops, payday loan shops, pawnbrokers and amusement arcades, amongst others.  In addition, the London Plan sets 
out policies with regard to hot food takeaway uses.

Bex
ley Growth Strategy  
Bexley Local Character Study  
4.1 Bexley is characterised by a number of specific features worthy of protection and enhancement, 
including its herit age, character and areas of family friendly housing.  This chapter sets out the 
strategic and non- strategic policies to address how these characteristics will be preserved and how 
new development is expected to achieve this . 
4.2 The principle of design covers a wide range of matters that should be applied to all types of 
development.  The policies in this chapter set out Bexley’s strategic and detailed requirements for 
ensuring high- quality design in the borough.  
4.3 The historic environment forms part of Bexley’s identity and cultural heritage.  It incorporates a 
wide variety of assets and can help support the borough’s communities, particularly through 
tourism, leisure and recreation.  
 SP5: Placemaking through good design 
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Local Character Study  
4.4 Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development and is indivisible from good planning.  It 
should contribute positively to making places better for people.  National and regional policy 
makes cl ear that local authorities should not attempt to impose a certain architectural style, but 
rather to establish principles to determine whether good design is being followed.  
4.5 A key consideration is the local character and context and reinforcing local disti nctiveness.  This 
policy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to the local area’s character and heritage, 
thus ensuring that the character of Bexley’s neighbourhoods retain their authenticity whilst 
instilling a unique sense of place.  
4.6 Good design identifies fundamental elements of character and builds upon them, enhancing local 
distinctiveness.  Where existing character is poor, design should help to mend that character.  
Inspiration can still be taken from it, through an understanding of character in the broader sense 
than ‘ what’s currently on the ground . ’  Instead, clues can be taken from, amongst other things, the 
historic development and topography of the area.  Good design creates variety and adds identity to its surroundings.   
4.7 A review has been carried out on Bexley’s current planning design guidance, including Design for 
living, Bexley's residential design guide , the Bexley Sustainable Design & Construction Guide , and 
Design and Development Control Guidelines 2 through 9 from the Bexley Unitary Development 
Plan.  Relevant updated guidance from these documents will be  incorporated into the Design 
Guide SPD, which will be  informed by the Bexley Local Character Study.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
46 SP5 Placemaking through good design  
1. The Council will continue  to expect the highest quality standards of design in Bexley.  Design should respect the 
existing character and context but need not be constrained by what already exists; local character evolves over 
time.  The Council will seek to ensure that:  
a) all development within the borough is of high -quality  design, contributes positively to the local 
environment, and protects the best elements of Bexley’s character;  
b) design enhances social cohesion and health and wellbeing and considers the principles of inclusive a nd 
active design, in order to support good physical and mental health; and,  
c) design considers the relationships between building and spaces, including its contribution to and 
shaping of the public realm.  
2. The Council will masterplan future development, where appropriate, to ensure it achieves the objectives of 
sustainable development and proposals for developments in these areas will need to demonstrate that they will 
fit satisfactorily into the masterplan.  
3. In locations suitable for large d evelopments, proposals that are piecemeal in nature will normally be resisted 
unless the proposal demonstrates that it will fit satisfactorily into a larger development.  
Policy implementation  
4.8 Development should create beautiful buildings and contribute to a high- quality public realm which 
is comprehensible at a human scale following the healthy streets principles to create a streetscape 
that engages the pedestrian and helps to create a meaningful transition between the public, semi -
public, and private re alm. Principles of dementia and autism friendly design should be applied.  
4.9 It is important to ensure that piecemeal development does not prejudice the proper planning of a large development whether or not the large development site is formally identified in site 
allocations.  Development must either consider the larger site or must demonstrate how the 
development proposal will not prejudice the optimisation of the larger site, in terms of layout, open 
space, access and infrastructure, amongst other issues relevant to the particular site.  
4.10 Inclusive design ensures the development proposal is optimised for a specific user with specific 
needs.  The Design Council  provides further information.  Sport England has produced ‘ Active 
Design ,’ which establishes 10 principles for ensuring that active and healthy lifestyles are 
supported and enhanced through the built environment.  
4.11 Further advice and guidance applying to all development will be set out in the Design Guide SPD, 
which will include appropriate development densities by type and location.   National design 
guidance and design guidance supporting the London Plan also provide information on design matters.  
 DP11: Achieving high- quality design 
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Bexley Local Character Study  
4.12 Whilst Policy SP5 sets out the broader principles to achieving high- quality design within the 
borough, it is necessary to provide additional detail to ensure the creation of well -designed 
developments that respond positively and effectively to the locally specific character of the area.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
47 DP11  Achieving high -quality design  
1. Development proposals within a primarily residential area, as defined on the submission policies map , must 
seek to protect or enhance the area’s character and its amenities .  Proposals for uses other than those 
residential in nature, will only be acceptable where they provide community, social or leisure facilities, or 
employment uses compatible with a residential area . 
2. Development proposals for new buildings, extensions and alterations, conversions, changes of use and public 
and private spaces will be expected to follow the principles and requirements set out in this document and to:  
Character  
a) ensure that the layout, height, scale and massing, façade treatment, and materials are complimentary to 
the surrounding area contribute positively to the street scene  
Landscaping  
b) provide a high standard of landscaping design, appropriate to the proposal and with regard to the 
character of the surrounding area  
Privacy, outlook and adverse impacts  
c) ensure that  appropriate levels of privacy, outlook, natural daylight and other forms of amenity are 
provided  
d) ensure existing properties’ amenity is appropriately protected  
e) ensure that all proposed development and uses do not unacceptably affect residents or occupiers  of 
either the proposed development or of existing neighbouring residents, businesses and community 
facilities by means of noise, odour, vibration and light spill or other disturbances  
Quality of residential accommodation  
f) provide sufficient useable on -site external amenity space (communal, semi -private and private) and 
appropriate play spaces for children, relative to the proposed scale of development  
g) meet appropriate internal accommodation standards  
Crime  
h) apply the principles of designing out crime whilst maintaining an attractive, connected environment  
Advertisements  
i) ensure that new advertisements do not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding 
area and do not have an adverse effect on public safety  
Policy implementation  
4.13 The Design Guide SPD will contain detailed guidance and further information on how the policies 
of this Local Plan should be applied to matters of design, for all types of development, in the local 
context.  This includes addressing appropriate density, design for specialist housing; extensions and 
conversions, including basement development; and additional detail on housing design standards, 
including internal standards.  
4.14 Criteria should be implemented where they are relevant and appropriate.  Depending on the 
nature of the proposal, not all criteria will be relevant in all cases.  A matrix style checklist may be developed to help understand the differences in design requirements for different scales of Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
48 development, from changes of use and conversions and extensions through to large developments.  
Conversions are the development of two or more dwellings from a lesser number of dwellings.  
Character  
4.15 The character of an area is made up of both the buildings and the spaces around them.  Scale is considered to be relative to the locality and context, massing is considered in terms of volume and 
is a free-standing measurement.  
4.16 Ensuring that materials are complimentary to the surrounding area does not mean they have to match.  They should be of an appropriate style  that is compatible with  and can even contrast with, 
as long as it  does not jar or clash with  the locality.  Appropriate landscaping and active frontages, 
such as entrances and windows along the façade, can enhance the street scene.  
Landscaping  
4.17 Urban greening as part of the development process can play a vital part in Bexley’s green 
infrastructure network, improving air quality, reducing the risk of flooding and helping to mitigate the effects of the urban heat island.  This can include walls and roofs covered in plants, street trees 
and small pocket parks in -between buildings.  The principles of the urban greening factor (UGF) in 
the London Plan should be adhered to in major developments, including it at the start of the design 
process.  
Privacy, outlook and adverse impacts  
4.18 Privacy is important to enable residents to feel comfortable in their own homes.  Innovative design solutions to achieve a high standard of privacy, amenity and outlook are encouraged.   New 
development should take responsibility for mitigating the impact of existing noise and other nuisances in accordance with the agent of change principle set out in the NPPF.  In addition, the 
London Plan includes policy D12, providing further guidance on applying the agent of change 
principle.  
4.19 Developers are required to consider the impact of their developments on neighbouring uses, as 
well as the potential impact that existing neighbouring uses could have on the proposed 
development, particularly with regard to noise.  The Council  will seek to employ the agent of 
change principle, by which the person or business responsible for the change is responsible for managing the impact of the change for both the existing and proposed uses.  
4.20 Identified impacts should be mitigated through design.  The layout, orientation, design and use of 
buildings will ensure that operational noise does not adversely affect occupants or neighbours, 
particularly noise -sensitive land uses such as housing, hospitals, schools and quiet open spaces.  
Where necessary, development is required to robustly demonstrate how conflict with existing uses will be avoided, through mitigation measures.  
Quality of residential accommodation  
4.21 Amenity space makes an important contribution to the character of an area through the setting of 
buildings in their locality.  When quantifying the amount of amenity space to be provided within 
new development, the measure of this space should include functional elements such as gardens, 
balconies, terraces and roof gardens and exclude areas for vehicle circulation or parking and 
incidental green spaces.  The Design Guide SPD will set out  standards regarding the amount of 
usable on -site amenity space.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
49 Crime  
4.22 Design has an important role to play in preventing crime and reducing criminal activity and should 
be designed -in at the start of the process.  Careful consideration  of designing out crime can 
prevent or reduce incidences of crime without compromising the enjoyment, usability and attractiveness of the development.  More information can be found in Designing out crime: A 
designer’s guide  by the Design Council.  
Advertisements  
4.23 Advertisements can often be unsightly and detract from the appearance and character of the 
environment.  They can constitute potential hazards if they obscure traffic signals or obstruct traffic sight -lines or directional signs.  Most conservation areas, by their special nature, are 
particularly sensitive to the visual impact of advertisements.  The Council will therefore impose 
strict controls over the display and illumination of advertisements and signs within sensitive areas, 
particularly conservation areas.  Further guidance with regard to advertisements will be detailed in 
the Design Guide SPD.

Locally Significant Views within London Borough of Bexley  Draft Report  
4.24 The need to use land efficiently and to its full potential in order to provide more homes across all tenures will require an increase in development density in appropriate locations across the 
borough, with an emphasis on achieving higher densities with more human scaled typolog ies. 
4.25 Bexley is currently a borough of relatively low density development and few tall  buildings when 
compared to other parts of London.  As well as one approach to achieving higher density, tall er 
buildings can be used for place- making purposes, to create iconic buildings, to create landmarks 
and contribute to wayfinding .  Therefore it is important to provide a guide to appropriate building 
heights within the borough. 
4.26 Appropriate locations for taller buildings have been informed by the Local Plan spatial strategy 
(Policy SP1 and the Key Diagram), the Bexley Local Character Study and  the local strategic views 
framework .  Some locations in the borough already have quite tall buildings but this does not set a 
precedent for more tall buildings in these areas if the area has not been identified as being suitable . 
DP12  T all buildings and building heights  
Borough -wide b uilding heights  
1. Typically, the maximum height of buildings shall not normally be more than:  
a) 45 metres within and near the town centres of Abbey Wood Village and Lower Belvedere, as set out in 
Part 2 of this policy ; 
b) 25 metres in sustainable development locations as identified on the key diagram ( Figure 1) outside of 
Part 3a of this policy ; and,  
c) 15 metres across the rest of the borough. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
50 DP12  T all buildings and building heights  
2. For development proposals that include buildings taller than 15 metres, applicants must submit design 
appraisals with alternative options to demonstrate whether similar densities can be achieved using more 
traditional and human- scaled typologies including terraced housing, maisonettes, and courtyard apartments.  
3. The proposed heights for buildings should reflect other design and policy requirements, including the 
requirement to have regard to the existing or emerging character and context of the area.  
Ta l l  buildings  
4. T all buildings in Bexley are considered to be more than 25 metres in height and must comply with the tall 
buildings policy in the London Plan.  In addition, the applicant must demonstrate:  
a) sufficient access to public transport; 
b) access to local services and facilities, depending on the number and type of residents expected;  
c) the proposal will not have an adverse impact on local character, including heritage assets;  
d) the design considers topography;  
e) the proposal will not create adverse environ mental impacts, including flood risk, creation of a wind 
tunnel, loss or lack of daylight and sunlight;  
f) the design is of the highest architectural quality; and  
g) the proposal will integrate into its surroundings at all levels, particularly at street level an d into the 
skyline.  
5. Suitable locations for tall buildings are within and near the town centres of Abbey Wood Village (defined in  
Figure 4 ) and Lower Belvedere (defined in Figure 5 ). 
Policy implementation  
4.
27 This policy seeks to achieve higher levels of residential density through alternative and more 
tradit ional housing typologies.  Where a taller building is proposed for housing, this policy requires 
developers to submit alternative design approaches that employ more traditional typologies to demonstrate whether equivalent residential densities (measured in  internal floor space or 
habitable rooms) can be achieved.  
4.28 For clarity, the building height  is the vertical distance between finished grade and the highest point 
on the building, including any plant located on the roof.  On sloped sites the building height is 
measured from the average finished grade to the highest point on the building . 
4.29 The equivalent height in residential storeys is  typically : 
• up to four storeys  for 15 metres ;  
• up to  eight storeys for  25 metres ; and  
• up to 1 5 storeys  for 45 metres  
4.30 Non- residential buildings will have varying storey heights; therefore,  it is the overall  building 
height that is measured  rather than the number of storeys . 
4.31 Suitable locations for buildings up to 25 metres in height align with the principle of developing a t 
higher densities in areas that have key public transport links with good connectivity and that have good access to services and facilities.  These are the sustainable development locations set out in 
Policy SP1, illustrated by the spatial strategy ( Figure 1) and also set out on the submission policies 
map .   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
51 4.32 Bexley’s contribution to London’s economic growth will be achieved  in part by  intensification of the 
borough’s designated industrial locations.  All designated SIL in the borough is considered to be a 
sustainable development location for industrial uses and therefore appropriate for the 
optimisation of sites including increased building heights, as defined by Part 1.b) of this policy.  
4.33 In the borough’s sustainable development locations (defined in Policy SP1 and Figure 1) taller 
buildings are considered to be between 15 and 25 metres in height.  Building typologies, such as 
mansion blocks, perimeter blocks, or stacked maisonettes, are the borough’s taller buildings of 
choice for residential or residential led mixed -use development.  These typologies achieve higher 
levels of density whilst fitting in sympathetically to the borough’s predominantly lower density residential character.  
4.34 The parts of the borough outside of the sustainable development locations, illustrated on the key 
diagram and submission policies map , is considered inappropriate  for taller building heights and a 
maximum building height of 15m applies.  Proposals for development outside of the sustainable 
development locations should include an options appraisal as part of the design and access 
statement, as well as demonstrating that the scheme is sustainable, in line with P olicy SP1.  
4.35 Height should be an output of other considerations.  Buildings should not be designed to reach 
certain heights .  Development proposals should ensure that they contribute to the placemaking of 
the wi der area.   Planning applications for schemes with tall buildings should justify the proposed 
heights with regards to these considerations and the requirements of the policy.  
 
Figure 4: Thamesmead and Abbey Wood location where a ma ximum building height of 45 meters would be acceptable  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
52  
Figure 5: Belvedere location where a maximum building height of 45 meters would be acceptable  
4.36 T all buildings, in the context of Bexley, are defined in the policy as being more than 25 metres in 
height.  Buildings taller than 25 metres may have a place in Bexley in very few locations, and only 
when they respect the character of their local areas and  do not obstruct designated local views.  
The areas near to Abbey Wood and Belvedere railway stations, illustrated in Figure 4  and Figure 5 , 
have been identified as suitable for tall buildings (up to a maximum height of 45 metres).   This is 
based on evidence that has informed the Bexley Local Character St udy, including a detailed Urban 
Morphology  Study of the borough, and will be the exception rather than the rule.  This should not 
be a uniform approach across a site, but rather the tall buildings should be in key locations on the site.

Locally Significant Views within London Borough of Bexley  (May 2021)  Draft Report  
4.37 London Plan policy HC3 requires development plans to ident ify locally significant views and to set 
out what it is about the view that is significant.  The Locally Significant Views within London Borough of Bexley report identifies views that possess sufficient architectural, townscape, 
landscape or environmental quality to be designated as protected local views.  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
53 DP13  Protecting local views  
1. Development proposals with the potential to impact a protected local view must meet the following criteria:  
a) Development in the foreground and middle ground of a protected view should not be overly intrusive, 
unsightly or prominent to the detriment of the view;  
b) Development in the background of a protected view should give context to landmarks and not harm the 
composition of the view as a whole; and,  
c) Any existing or proposed viewing places within the development should be accessible and managed so 
that they enhance people’s experience of the protected view.  
2. Development proposals that will have a significant adverse impact on the aesthetic and character of a 
protected view will be resisted.  
3. Development proposals should consider whether the proposal has the potential to impact on a non- designated 
view.  Non -designated views should be identified through the Development Management process.  A proposal 
with the potential to impact on a non- designated view must demonstrate that the proposal will not have an 
adverse impact on that view.  
Policy implementation  
4.
38 Assessment of the impact of development in the foreground, middle ground or background of a 
protected view or the setting of a landmark will be made with regard to the significant features of 
local views that warrant their designation.  
4.39 The protected views are not intended as a comprehensive list of all significant views within the 
borough; just because a view is not designated does not mean that it is not important.  Additional 
views should be identified through the development management process, including through local 
character assessments or, for larger schemes, through townscape and visual impact assessments.  
This policy protects views identified through the development management process.  
4.40 The Design Guide SPD will set out detailed guidance including submission requirements for 
development schemes.  The local protected views will be included on the submission policies map.

4.42 Bexley’s heritage and archaeological assets comprise registered historic parks and gardens, 
scheduled ancient monuments, listed buildings and structures,  non -designated heritage assets of 
local architectural and historic interest (the Local List), conservation areas, and archaeological priority areas.  All these assets contribute to the heritage of Bexley’s built environment and add to 
the attractiveness and character of the borough.   There is also an active record of locally listed 
buildings within the borough that are considered to have historic or architectural merit at the local Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
54 level.  A complete list can be found in the Council’s Historic Environment Record (a live document 
that is updated outside of the Local Plan process).  
4.43 Statutorily listed buildings and structures  include , at the highest level,  Grade I listed Danson 
Mansion, Crossness Beam Engine House, and Red House and its well head.  Hall Place and Gardens and Lesnes Abbey are also scheduled ancient monuments as well as being Grade I listed .  The 
remaining listed buildings and structures are Grade II* and Grade II, with notable mentions for the Carnegie Library in Erith , Sidcup Manor House and two iconic K6 telephone boxes in Bexley 
Village . 
SP6 Managing Bexley’s heritage assets  
1. The Council will manage its heritage and archaeological assets, whilst seek ing opportunities to make the most 
of these assets; including adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.  This will enhance the local 
sense of place and support the revitalisation and development of the borough, including promoting the visit or 
economy.  This will be achieved by:  
a) promoting the borough’s heritage assets, such as Lesnes Abbey, Danson Mansion, Hall Place and 
Gardens, Crossness Beam Engine House and Red House;  
b) reviewing the status of existing and identifying new heritage and archaeological assets;  
c) applying the NPPF  and London Plan requirements for development proposals affecting heritage assets 
to conserve and enhance the significance of heritage assets, their settings, and the wider historic 
environment, and the requirements to protect assets from development that is likely to adversely 
impact on the significance, integrity, character or appearance of those assets or their settings;  
d) protecting the internal features of Council owned non- designated heritage assets where they 
contribute to the asset’s significance; and,  
e) supporting historic restoration schemes through partnership working and seeking funding to enhance 
and utilise heritage and archaeological assets in an appropriate and sympathetic manner.  
Policy implementation 
4.44 The Council will seek opportunities to support the identification of heritage assets in the borough, as well as supporting restoration of historic assets, for example, through grants where they are 
available.  There are also a number of specific projects being undertaken in the borough to 
preserve and enhance Bexley’s heritage and archaeology, including works to the Crossness Beam 
Engine House.  
4.45 The Council supports regeneration and development schemes that make use of historic assets in 
an appropriate and sympathetic manner.  It will also keep under review its heritage and 
archaeological assets.  This includes character appraisals and management plans for the borough’s 
conservation areas, locally listed building  and structure reviews, and the  Heritage at Risk Register.  
Research has indicated that Bexley’s heritage faces various challenges, including small incremental changes to buildings, low quality maintenance, and environmental impacts such as traffic 
congestion and graffiti.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

4.46 Heritage assets make a strong contribution to the local economy .  An asset’s ability to create a 
sense of place and local identity is valued highly in Bexley.  Herit age assets include: listed and 
locally listed buildings and other structures; conservation areas; registered parks and gardens; 
scheduled ancient monuments; archaeological remains; and any other non -designated asset which 
the local authority identifies as having historic or architectural significance.  A complete list can be 
found in the Greater London Historic Environment Record (a live document that is updated outside 
of the Local Plan process).   
4.47 Bexley currently has over 1 50 buildings and structures , an d registered parks and gardens,  on the 
National Heritage List for England.  The statutory  listing of a building  or structure is recognition of 
its architectural and/or historical significance at a national level and provides additional protection .  
Only a very small number of buildings  or structures  in Bexley are statutorily listed, and these 
represent a very important limited resource.  Continuity and preservation of original fabric is, 
therefore, important.  This policy applies to planning applications and to applications for Listed 
Building Consent, and also applies to development proposals for buildings and structure on the local list.  Development proposals to alter a building or structure,  or its use in a way that  could 
impact on the special character of the listed building  or structure require Listed Building Consent . 
4.48 Bexley currently has 23 conservation areas across the borough and the strategic policy requirement to conserve and enhance heritage assets is applied to these areas.  It signposts the 
area appraisal and management plans, which describe  the special characteristics of each 
conservation area and provide more detailed guidance on what is considered appropriate and inappropriate within the conservation area.  The process for identification, des ignation and review 
of conservation areas sits outside of the Local Plan.  However, these areas are identified on the submission policies  map  and in the conservation area appraisals.  
4.49 Archaeology, specifically the remains below the ground, provides evidence of the evolution of 
development and settlements in this area.  All remains are unique and represent a finite and non-
renewable resource.  The borough also has a wealth of archaeological remains, which represent a 
storehouse of historic information, including evidence of the evolution of development and 
settlements in the borough.  Archaeological sites should be retained in situ wherever possible, and 
an appropriate level of archaeological investigation and documentation should be undertaken.  
4.50 This policy provides a mechanism to manage new archaeological evidence.  Further information 
and guidance, including the archaeological priority areas within Bexley, is set out in Historic 
England’s Archaeological Priority Areas Appraisal for London Borough of Bexley.  The appraisal 
establishes the relative potential significance of each of the priority areas.  
4.51 The Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service (GLAAS)  identify Archaeological Priority 
Areas (APAs) based on evidence held in the Greater London Historic Environment Record Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
56 (GLHER) .  Each APA is assigned to a tier reflecting their archaeological sensitivity and significance. 
APAs are non- designated heritage assets, but as set out in the NPPF (Footnote 63) where these are 
found to include sites or archaeology of national importance equivalent to Scheduled Monuments, 
these sites  or archaeological findings should be accorded the same weight as designated heritage 
assets.

1. Development proposals with the potential to directly or indirectly impact on a heritage asset or its setting 
should meet NPPF requirements to describe the significance of the asset and demonstrate how the proposal 
conserves or enhances the significance of the asset.   
2. Development proposals on sites with existing heritage assets, particularly listed or locally listed buildings, 
should incorporate those assets.  Outline applications will not generally be acceptable for developments that 
include heritage asse ts. 
Change of use  
3. Any development proposal to alter or change the use of a heritage asset will need to conserve or enhance that 
asset; proposals must demonstrate how the change will support the building’s preservation and future 
maintenance.  Development proposals should restore, re- use and incorporate heritage assets, wherever 
possible.  Proposals must demonstrate that the new use would not adversely affect the fabric of the building.  
Demolition  
4. There is a general presumption against any proposal for development that demolishes a heritage asset in part 
or whole, including locally listed buildings.  
5. Proposals to demolish buildings within conservation areas will be considered with regards to the NPPF 
approach to determining harm and will gener ally be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the 
development proposal would enhance the special character of the area; demolition will not be approved until 
consent for the replacement building is agreed.  
Listed buildings  
6. Any proposed alteration mu st have regard for conserving or enhancing the special character of the building, 
both internally and externally.  Replacement materials should be like for like or, where this is not possible or not 
preferable, should be compatible with the existing charac ter of the building, either by sympathetically matching 
or contrasting.  
Locally listed buildings  
7. Any proposed alteration to a locally listed building or other non -designated heritage asset must have special 
regard to the asset’s contribution to the stree tscape.  
8. Any proposed alteration to a locally listed building should conserve the particular characteristics that justify 
that structure’s identification.  
Conservation areas  
9. Proposals for development within conservation areas must have due regard to the area appraisal and 
management plan in terms of design, use, and any other element identified as relevant.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
57 DP14  Development affecting a heritage asset  
Archaeological evidence  
10. Development proposals should be assessing the archaeological potential of sites and then retaining, in situ, 
archaeologi cal evidence within sites, wherever possible.  Where archaeological evidence cannot be retained, 
the appropriate levels of archaeological investigation and recording should be undertaken prior to the 
redevelopment of the site.  
Policy implementation  
4.
52 A development proposal will be considered to conserve a heritage asset if it would result in no 
impact on the asset, or an impact that is not adverse.  A development proposal will be considered to 
enhance a heritage asset if it would restore or reveal a feature of significance.  
4.53 Inappropriate alterations may irreparably damage the architectural or historic integrity of the 
building and will not be acceptable.  It will therefore be expected that all original features of 
architectural or historic interest, both internal and external shall be retained.  Alterations to these 
important buildings require the greatest skill and care in design and implementation in order to 
avoid damage to historic fabric and to ensure that any works are in keeping with the remainder of 
the building and its setting.  
4.54 It is considered very unlikely that the demolition of a listed building could be justified.  A building's 
setting is often an important part of its character.  Schemes that affect the setting of a listed 
building can, if insens itively designed or located, detract from the special architectural or historic 
interest, or character of this valuable and limited resource.  
4.55 The Council has various statutory powers to secure the protection of listed buildings, including, as a last resort , compulsory purchase at minimal value if a building is deliberately neglected.  The 
Council will keep under review the desirability of using these powers in order to secure the protection of these important buildings.  
4.56 The test of substantial harm to registered parks and gardens is based on Historic England advice.  
4.57 Bexley maintains an active list of over 400 buildings and structures of local historic value, which 
contribute significantly to the character of the borough.   Whilst these have no statutory 
prot ection, the Council recognises their importance and will seek their retention.   The Local List is 
actively kept under review.  Residents, local amenity groups, and other stakeholders can nominate additions or deletions to the Local List at any time, which triggers a case -by-case basis review of 
the particular building.  Further information can be found on the Council’s website.  
4.58 The primary heritage consideration for applications for development affecting a locally listed building is how it will be viewed fr om the public realm and how it will contribute to the streetscape.  
Particular care should be paid to the impact of external alterations.  The Council will strongly encourage the protection of internal features where they contribute to the structure’s desi gnation.  
4.59 The Council will continue to monitor loss of the borough’s non- designated heritage assets through 
demolition.  These assets are important within a local context and their long -term retention a 
priority.  The Council will consider additional measur es to provide protection for buildings and 
structures which appear on the Council’s Local List.  This includes the introduction of an ‘ Article 4 Direction. ’  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
58 4.60 Alterations or extensions to buildings within conservation areas should respect the design, scale 
and materials of the original building and harmonise with the location.  Any proposals will be 
assessed on the extent to which they respect and respond positi vely to the character or 
appearance of the area .  Not all elements of a conservation area contribute to its significance; 
sometimes high- quality new developments or replacement or alteration of existing buildings can 
enhance a conservation area .  The Area Appraisal and Management Plan documents set out 
guidance on these issues for each of the borough’s conservation areas . 
4.61 Applications for development which involves ground works in APAs in Tiers 1 -3 must be 
accompanied by an archaeological desk- based assessm ent and, where appropriate, field 
evaluations to demonstrate that potential impacts of proposed development on archaeological 
significance have been fully considered. All land outside APAs is treated as being in Tier 4 but major 
developments in these areas  sometimes require the same archaeological evidence as higher tiers.  
4.62 The design of development should make provision for incorporation, safeguarding and 
preservation in situ of archaeological remains wherever possible and there will always be a 
presumption in favour of the retention of nationally important archaeology in situ. Where we 
agree that conservation of archaeological remains in situ is impossible or deposits are of lesser 
significance, investigation, recording and an appropriate level of publication and archiving will be 
required.   Bexley Draft Local Plan

Bexley Growth Strategy  
Connected Communities  Strategy  
Start Well, Live W ell and Age Well (Bexley System -wide Prevention Strategy)  
5.1 The Council is actively promoting a positive state of health and wellbeing for residents in the 
borough.  Start well, live well and age well, Bexley’s system-wide prevention strategy , states that:  
“The decisions we make locally to shape Bexley as a place will have a significant impact on 
the environment and the choices people make.  Considering health  and wellbeing in the 
policy making process helps broaden the reach of prevention, from transport to planning 
and leisure, to housing, environmental health, education and social care . ” 
5.2 To  support the creation of sustainable, healthy and inclusive communities, the Council has taken 
into  consideration the amount of development proposed, the type of development, its distribution 
around the borough, and when it is expected to be built.  
5.3 However, directly related to this is the  impact new residential development will have on existing 
social a nd community infrastructure.   T he capacity of the existing services and facilities will be 
assessed to determine  whether an increase in population  from the new development can  be 
accommodated , or, if more services and facilities are needed, whether they should be expanded, or  
new provided. 
5.4 The policies in this chapter focus on ensuring that development in the borough both contributes to 
the provision of, as well as the protection and enhancement of, community services and facilities, 
green and blue infrastructure, and the ecology of the borough.  Specific infrastructure projects are 
identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which supports growth set out in the local plan.  
5.5 The link between human wellbeing and nature is well demonstrated.  The wider network of green 
spaces that are included within social and community infrastructure provides benefits which 
contribute to the quality of life of residents .  These areas balance  the built environment and help 
enhance a sense of place, providing a focal point for healthy exercise, community interaction and food -growing.  Key features of good design include walkable space, community space, and 
greenspace.  These spaces increase physical activity, encourage social interaction, mitigate pollution and therefore sup port health and mental wellbeing.   
5.6 The quality of Bexley’s environment is determined by how ongoing growth and development can 
be balanced with the sometimes conflicting need to manage the borough’s ecology .  Some of the 
adverse effects of the built environment, such as the urban heat island effect and increased risk of flooding, can be mitigated by the presence of nature.   
5.7 Understanding the level of people’s access to nature and ensuring the protection of the highest 
quality natural habitats are fundamental.  A high level of biodiversity is generally considered to be desirable for a number of reasons, including species retention, environmental quality, mental 
health and child development – in other words, qual ity of life.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

5.8 Social and community infrastructure help  to creat e and maintain strong, cohesive, healthy and 
sustainable communities.  These are the facilities and services  and accessible open spaces that 
provide for the needs of Bexley’s residents, of all ages and abilities .  They can act as focal points for 
new and existing communities and can help to give an area a sense of identity . 
5.9 The I nfrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) sets out the measures that will accommodate the growth in 
this respect.  It is important that the right level of provision of social and community infrastructure 
is in place when it needs to be, suitably located either in town centres with good public transport or 
embedded within the residential areas that they serve.  
5.10 The Bexley Green Infrastructure Study includes an assessment of both current and future need for 
open spaces and playing pitches.  The playing pitch audit provides an assessment of the existing 
sports pitches and facilities, whilst identifying opportunities for retaining, reducing or removing 
this provision and prospects for new provision and partnerships.  The open space assessment 
provides an understanding of deficiency and need in terms of quantity, quality/value and 
accessibility.  This is a fundamental piece of evidence informing future need in the borough.  
5.11 The policy sets out how the Council will plan and monitor growth in terms of its impact on social 
and community ser vices and facilities.  Any development generating additional demand for 
infrastructure should appropriately contribute to meet the associated increase in demand.  It will also be important to ensure that the provision of social and community facilities continues to 
reflect the needs of a changing and diverse population, in the most appropriate locations.  
SP7 Social and community services and facilities  
1. The Council will ensure the identification, development, completion, safeguarding and monitoring of services,  
facilities and open spaces of the types set out in Ta b l e  10  that are required to support housing and employment 
growth in the borough so as to make a positive contribution to creating strong, cohesive and sustainable 
communities.  This will be achieved  through:  
a) addressing the needs of existing and future residents, of all ages and abilities, by ensuring the protection 
and improvement of existing services, facilities and open space and the creation of new services, 
facilities and open spaces where they a re needed, in accessible locations if possible, including town 
centres, with good transport connectivity;  
b) working with partners such as the Mayor of London, Crossrail Limited, utility companies, developers, 
registered social housing providers, the NHS, vol untary sector, other Council departments and/or 
adjacent boroughs to develop, integrate, implement and monitor relevant social and community 
projects and programmes, particularly in the borough’s identified sustainable development locations; 
and,  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
61 SP7 Social and community services and facilities  
c) ensuring developers contribute to the reasonable costs of new and expanded services, facilities and 
open spaces made necessary by their development proposals through the use of planning obligations 
and/or the community infrastructure levy.  
Types of social and community infrastructure  
Category  Examples of types of social and community services and facilities

Table 10: Types of social and community infrastructure  
Policy implementation  
5.12 For the purposes of  policies in this Local Plan , the categories  of types of social and community 
services and facilities  are set out in Ta b l e  1 0 , with examples of each type included.  It is important 
to note that this is not an exhaustive list, as there may be additional services or facilities arising 
from development that could fit into one o r more of the six categories  listed above.   
5.13 Education Land and Urban Open Space are formal land use designations that are defined  on the 
submission policies map .  The Education Land designation includes only primary and secondary 
schools which form part of the Council’s statutory responsibility with regards to schools and 
school admissions. Other types of educational facilities listed in Ta b l e  1 0 , whilst not included in the 
land use designation, are nonetheless protected under policies SP7 and DP15.  
5.14 The  types of social and community infrastructure listed a re those that offer a general public 
benefit .  These would  normally  be (but are not limited to) publicly funded or subsidised services 
and facilities that are universally available .  Individual proposals for new, or expansion of existing , 
social and community faci lities will be considered by the Council on a case by case basis.   
5.15 Major developments will be expected to accommodate new social and community  infrastructure as 
part of mixed -use  proposals where practical and feasible or contribute to the expansion of exis ting Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
62 infrastructure in order to increase the capacity of the facility to serve the development, 
particularly where a deficiency is identified though the IDP or Bexley Green Infrastructure Study . 
5.16 It is important to note that Changing Places facilities for severely disabled people are now 
compulsory in new or major refurbished public buildings, specifically places of assembly, recreation 
and entertainment with a capacity for 350 or more people, as set out in the Building Regulations 
2010.  
5.17 Deve lopment proposals in locations where new infrastructure is planned must also be compatible 
with and provide the necessary safeguards for, and network links to, the future community 
infrastructure project as appropriate.  
5.18 The IDP provides more detail on social and community infrastructure requirements and 
demonstrates how the Council will work with partners to identify any gaps in provision and how 
these gaps can be addressed .  Through the IDP , the Council will regularly monitor the amount of 
growth in Bexley , and any potential impact on services, so that the long -term delivery of 
sustainable development can be achieved.   
5.19 Where there are services and facilities that have existing deficiencies or gaps in their services and 
funding, the Council will continue to work with these partners to ensure that the critical 
infrastructure and services to support new development are provided.   In addition to statutory 
provides, the voluntary sector also takes an active role in the planning and delivery of services in 
Bexley , coordinated through BVSC , the   Council for Voluntary Service (CVS) set up to offer support 
to Bexley organisations and residents.  
5.20 The IDP will be regularly updated by the Council to ensure this is a working document.   The IDP is a 
living plan, which will be subject to national, regional and local priorities.  It will need to be adapted 
where lead delivery agencies may change their responsibilities, or where any shortfall in funding is 
secured sooner than anticip ated. 
5.21 Where possible the Council will make sure necessary improvements to infrastructure are made a 
priority as funding opportunities and investment programmes come forward, which will help to 
provide a more sustainable, inclusive and healthier community.   The Council will also ensure that a 
process and timetable for delivery of infrastructure remains in place and that contributions are monitored and distributed as developments are implemented.  
5.22 The Community Infrastructure Levy  and the Planning Obligations Guidan ce SPD  will be kept under 
review to ensure infrastructure delivery meets Local Plan growth requirements and to accommodate any changes to the national and regional framework in this respect.

Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP)  
5.23 Chapter 8 of the NPPF sets out requirements for planning policies to promote healthy, inclusive 
and safe places.  This includes providing, and preventing the unnecessary loss of, the social, 
recreational , play  and cultural facilities and services the community needs.   Para graph 94 of the Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
63 NPPF gives great weight to the need to create, expand or alter schools to ensure that there is a 
choice of school places available to meet need  and paragraph 97 sets out the requirements for 
protecting existing open space, sports and recrea tional buildings, including playing fields. . 
5.24 Social and community infrastructure comprises many different types of services and facilities, 
including health, education, local shops, social services, leisure, heritage, culture, open space , play 
space and th e public realm, all of which are vital to the identity and function of the borough, as well 
as its attractive and distinctive character.  It is essential that this is maintained and enhanced so 
that the borough retains its diversity and vitality.  
5.25 Open space is included in the types of social and community infrastructure as it is important to 
health and wellbeing through its contribution to the landscape and in providing attractive breaks in 
the built -up area.  
5.26 Larger open spaces are important because they accommodate a wide range of open- air 
recreational,  play,  leisure, educational, institutional and other uses within easy reach of residential 
areas.  And smaller open spaces, particularly if they are enclosed by buildings along several edges, 
can provide a respite from the built form of the borough.  Once open land is built on it is lost 
forever and a positive benefit must be demonstrated for it to be developed.  
DP15  Providing and protecting social and community infrastructure  
Providing  
1. Proposals for new social and community infrastructure (as set out in Ta b l e  10  above) or for the enhancement or 
expansion of existing infrastructure will  generally be supported, particularly the provision of health, physical 
activity, leisure, education and children and young people’s facilities. In all cases, proposals should be:  
a) sustainably located, ideally close to the local community the facility is in tended to serve, or within areas 
of good access to public transport, such as town centres, particularly where the proposal is likely to 
generate a significant volume of traffic; 
b) easily accessible to all by a range of sustainable travel modes, including wal king, cycling and public 
transport;  
c) of an appropriate character, size and scale to meet the needs of the community; and,  
d) designed to be as flexible, adaptable and capable of multi -use as possible. 
2. Proposals for education (including early years) facilities and places of worship should provide a Travel Plan to 
assess any traffic issues and ways to resolve these as a result of the development  
3. Proposals for new or expanded Education facilities should be designed to reflect the community needs 
assessments.  
4. Proposals need to demonstrate that they are supported by the relevant service provider.  
5. The creation of F.2(a) small walk -to convenience shops (that do not exceed 280 m2 gross in total) should be 
provided in new larger residential developments wher e there is no convenience shop within 1,000 metres 
walking distance to the site.  
Protecting  
6. The Council will not permit the loss of existing social and community infrastructure types included in Ta b l e  10, 
or defined on the submission policies map  as Education Land,  except where:  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
64 DP15  Providing and protecting social and community infrastructure  
a) it can be demonstrated that there is no current or future need for the existing premises or land for  any 
community use (or specifically for educational use where the land is designated as Education Land)  and 
that it no longer can  serve the needs of the community; or  
b) alternative community facilities for the specific end user that meet current or future needs are provided 
within the relevant area; or,  
c) it is part of an agreed strategy or programme of estate management . 
7. For urban open space, it must also be demonstrated that the land has no visual amenity value as a landscape 
feature in providing br eaks in the built -up area.  
8. Changes of use from individual F.2(a) convenience shops will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated 
that an alternative convenience shop is available within reasonable walking distance from the existing unit.  
Policy imp lementation 
5.27 The Council is supportive of development proposals for the provision of new social and community 
infrastructure or for the enhancement or expansion of existing infrastructure, where the need 
exists.  This policy encourages all available facilit ies to be used to their full potential, provided that 
it is within safe, accessible and appropriate environment for the activity taking place.  
5.28 This is especially true of proposals that enable the multiple uses of facilities i.e. the sharing of facilities, equipment or resources across different sectors of the community.  Multi -use social and 
community infrastructure offers local communities increased opportunities to access a wider range of facilities in the local area and can help to improve health, social  and cultural wellbeing.  
5.29 This policy applies to social and community infrastructure listed in Ta b l e  1 0 .  The types of social 
and community infrastructure listed are those that offer a general public benefit.  These would 
normally be (but are not limited to) publicly funded or subsidised services and facilities that are 
universally available.  Individual proposals for new, or expansion of existing, social a nd community 
facilities will be considered by the Council on a case by case basis.  
Providing  
5.30 Existing facilities may need to be extended or upgraded so that they are adaptable and able to meet the changing needs of the borough’s population.  Existing services should be maintained 
whilst the upgrade or replacement is taking place.  New development can provide the opportunity 
to facilitate this.  
5.31 Changing Places facilities for severely disabled people are now compulsory in newly built and 
major refurbished pl aces of assembly, recreation and entertainment with a capacity of 350 or more 
people , in line with the Building Regulations 2010.  
5.32 Social and community infrastructure should be provided within easy reach by walking and public transport for the community that they serve.  This is particularly important for facilities attracting 
large numbers of people or drawing users from a wider catchment area, which should be located in 
sustainable, accessible locations, ideally using existing vacant community  facilities.  
5.33 Generally, town centres are the most accessible locations in the borough, although it is recognised 
that some social and community infrastructure is not required to be located in areas of good 
connectivity to public transport, for example emergency services or early years provision.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
65 5.34 The provision of new and/or enhanced infrastructure should be designed to meet the needs of 
their intended occupants, taking into account any appropriate regulations and national design and 
space standards, includi ng disabled access.   
5.35 Larger residential developments where the creation of walk- to convenience shops is encouraged 
are considered to be 300 homes or more.  
5.36 Proposals for new and refurbished play and informal recreation facilities will be supported to address the identified deficiency in the Bexley Green Infrastructure Study .  These will be expected 
to follow the standards identified in the Mayor’s Shaping Nei ghbourhoods: Play and Informal 
Recreation planning guidance.  
Protecting  
5.37 In order to demonstrate that there is no current need for the existing community facility, evidence 
will be required, such as a record of attempts to market the premises/land for the e xisting use with 
an appropriate property agent on reasonable terms for at least 18 months or, in the case of a local convenience shop, at least 12 months.  Vacancy in itself will not be sufficient evidence.  
5.38 Proposals resulting in the loss of sports pitches  and facilities, including those associated with 
schools, or open spaces need to demonstrate that they have met the requirements of paragraph 97 of the NPPF including that the loss will be replaced elsewhere if needed.  The Bexley Green 
Infrastructure Stud y findings should inform the assessment and development proposal.  The study 
should also be used to help address the requirements set out within London Plan Policies S5 Sports and recreation facilities, and G4 Open space.  
5.39 The types of uses that are considered to retain the open appearance of Urban Open Space include, 
but are not limited to: predominantly open- air recreation, leisure, community activities, tourism, 
sport and physical activity; allotments and nursery gardens; cemeteries; nature conservation; children and young people’s play facilities, and educational or community uses in large grounds.  
5.40 Where land designated on the submission policies map  as Urban Open Space (UOS)  is no longer 
needed for its use , the Council will favour alternative uses that would retain the generally open 
appearance of the land.  
5.41 An estate management programme or strategy would normally be prepared by a registered 
provider of social housing for the redevelopment of large housing estates and should be submitted 
alongside development proposals to demonstrate changes to existing services and facilities.  
5.42 Protecting local shops will ensure that existing local convenience shops (defined by the Use Class 
Order as F2(a)) located outside of the designated centres and neighbourhood parades continue to 
serve local communities.  A convenience shop is considered to sell everyday items such as food, 
drinks, and household item s, and should be at least one full width shopping frontage (minimum of 
five metres).  Bexley Draft Local Plan

5.43 Generally, Bexley has a healthy community, and this is demonstrated through local residents living 
longer on average and enjoying more years without illness or disability than the London and 
England population.  
5.44 Despite the relatively positive health situation, people living in more disadvantaged areas of the 
borough tend to exhibit poorer health characteristics.  For example, they are more likely to suffer 
chronic ill health and die younger.  It is essential that health inequalities – and the social, 
environmental and economic factors that contribute to them – are taken into account.  
5.45 This policy ensures development contributes towards a healthy built environment in accordance with the London Plan and the aims and objectives set out in this Local Plan and other key Council 
plans and strategies by providing a framework for assessing proposals.  
5.46 Health Impact Assessments  (HIAs) provide a systematic approach for assessing the potential 
impacts of development on the social, psychological and physical health of communities.  HIAs are designed to consider whether: a development proposal might reinforce health inequalities and  
inadvertently damage people’s health; or, have positive health outcomes for the local community.  Ensuring issues, and opportunities, are considered at an early stage in developing planning 
proposals can help improve both the physical and mental health of  the population.  
DP16  Health impact assessments  
1. The following types of development are required to complete and submit a desktop health impact assessment 
checklist as part of the planning application:  
a) major developments; and,  
b) development proposals that contain any of the following uses:  
i. hot -food takeaways;  
ii. betting shops  
iii. education facilities;  
iv. health facilities;  
v. leisure or community facilities; and,  
vi. publicly accessible open space.  
2. Development proposals of a scale referable to the Greater London Authority are required to have a completed 
detailed health impact assessment, submitted as part of the planning application.  The assessment will be 
expected to include details of engagement undertaken with local health and community stakeholders and how 
their input has influenced the proposals.  
Policy implementation  
5.47 The scope of an HIA will vary depending on the size of the development and its location.  The HIA should identify the likely health impacts of the development and include measures to improve 
health outcomes and address negative effects and inequalities.  HIA can be undertaken as a stand -
alone assessment or, for relevant applications, as part of a wider Environmental Impact Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
67 Assessment.   Measures that will help contribute to healthier communities  and reduce health 
inequalities must be incorporated in a development wherever the opportunities arise.  
5.48 In order to mitigate any potential negative impacts, HIAs should be undertaken for hot food 
takeaways and betting shops.  T o maximise potential positive impacts, and help reduce health 
inequalities, HIAs should be undertaken for social and community infrastructure.  
5.49 The London Healthy Urban Development Unit (HUDU) provides guidance  on Health Impact 
Assessments.  A desktop health impact assessment should use HUDU’s Healthy Urban Planning 
Checklist  to identify the key issues and impacts and when they are likely to occur.  
5.50 The checklist aims to ensure a development proposal is as ‘healthy’ as possible, by achieving as many ‘Yes’ ticks and avoiding ‘No’ ticks.  A ‘No’ gives a warning that an aspect of a development may 
need to be reconsidered.  Actions should be identified to enhance the positive impacts and mitigate the negative impacts.  Local circumstances may justify why a scheme cannot meet the expected 
standard.   
5.51 Developments of a scale referable to the Greater London Authority will be expected to complete a 
more extensive full health impact assessment in accordance with the guidance from HUDU.

Study , which includes an assessment of deficiency illustrated by Figure 6.  As well as providing new 
areas of open space, Bexley’s open space deficiency areas can sometimes be improved through enhanced public access to existing open space.   Although a new development may be located very 
close to an open space, if there is no direct public walking route provided then the open space may provide little benefit to the residents of the new development.  
DP17  Publicly accessible open space  
Maximising access to existing open space  
1. In order to maximise access to existing publicly accessible open space, new developments will be required to:  
a) provide new or improved access to adjacent or nearby publicly accessible open space, where 
appropriate;  
b) not block or hinder existing public access, unless suitable alternative access is provided; and  
c) promote publicly accessible open spaces as multi- functional spaces that cater for a range of activities, 
lifestyles, ages and needs. Bexley Draft Local Plan

Provision of new open space  
2. New open s pace provided as part of a development should be inclusive and highly accessible to residents of the 
development and surrounding areas.

69 Policy implementation  
5.54 New or improved access can decrease the practical walking distance from an existing open space 
that may have previously only been accessible by car or public transport.  By making it easier for 
pedestrians to cross barriers or walk along newly created routes, open space deficiency in the 
borough can be reduced.  
5.55 A suitable alternative access is considered to be one that does not increase existing walk times 
from the open space to the residential community that it serves and to nearby public transport.  
5.56 This policy promotes innovative approaches to delivering new open spaces as well as locating 
parks in areas of the borough where accessibility to public open spaces is poor by creating smaller 
open spaces e.g. pocket parks, which could play a vital role in increasing accessibility.  
5.57 Rivers and waterways fall under the definition of open space and it will be vital that new 
development alongside these spaces either maintains existing access or provides for new access, 
including waterside walks.

National Planning Policy Framework  
The London Plan 2021  
Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  
5.58 The term green infrastructure refers to the network of all green and open spaces and includes 
Bexley’s waterways .  Some green spaces may have buildings and other development  within them , 
particularly schools and other community facilities in large open grounds.  
5.59 The  primary function of Metropolitan Green Belt is to serve as a break between settlements.  
Metropolitan Open Land functions similarly, but as a break within a built -up area rather than at the 
edge.  Both of these land use designations are strongly protected  from development.  
5.60 Green infrastructure is a multifunctional network that will secure benefits including, but not 
limited to, biodiversity; natural and historic landscapes; culture; building a sense of place; the 
economy; sport; recreation; local food production; mitigating and adapting to climate change; 
water management; and the social benefits that promote individual and community health and 
wellbeing.  Public realm includes the parts of the borough, whether publicly or privately owned 
that are available  without charge for everyone to use, including parks, squares and streets.  
5.61 Green infrastructure assets identified within Bexley include: open spaces such as parks and 
gardens, natural and semi -natural green spaces, linear open spaces, amenity green spaces , 
allotments and community gardens, cemeteries and churchyards, play spaces; playing pitches and other outdoor sports spaces; development greening features such as green roofs and walls covered 
in plants ; small pocket parks, domestic gardens, the borough's  network of trees, street trees and 
ancient woodland; rivers and waterways; along with strategic green wildlife corridors, footpaths 
and cycleways that connect them.   The Bexley Green Infrastructure Study sets out the hierarchy of 
open spaces.  
5.62 Bexley is on e of London’s greenest boroughs.  Its parks and open spaces are central to the 
character and identity of the borough.  The network of open spaces totals some 1,253 hectares 
(excluding sites that are primarily used for outdoor sports provision).  Of this, 1 ,099 hectares is 
publicly accessible.   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
70 5.63 The Southeast London Green Chain forms part of a virtually continuous arc of public and private 
open spaces, largely in recreational use, that extends through the borough of Bexley, Bromley, 
Lewisham and Royal Greenw ich.   
5.64 A number of Bexley’s parks are listed on Historic England’s Register of Parks and Gardens of 
Special Historic Interest in England , and five open spaces contain listed buildings, including Danson 
Park at Bexleyheath and Hall Place and Gardens at Bexley.   
5.65 The River Thames forms the northern boundary of the borough and the Cray and Shuttle rivers 
also flow through Bexley.  These river corridors are important defining features of the borough’s 
landscape and views.  Waterways are rich sources of biodiversity and archaeology.  A number of 
waterways cross or originate within the borough.   
5.66 National and regional policy seek to contain development to previ ously developed land and protect 
open spaces.  This policy approach address es open space deficiencies and ensures that Bexley 
remains a ‘green’ borough, well served by a network of high- quality, safe and accessible open 
spaces, offering a range of opportunities and providing attractive relief to the built form.  
SP8 Green infrastructure including designated Green Belt  
The Council’s commitments to creating a multifunctional network  
1. Bexley’s green infrastructure, including open spaces and waterways will be protected, enhanced, restored and 
promoted as valuable resources to provide a healthy integrated network for the benefit of nature, people and 
the economy.  Future development must support the delivery of a high quality, well connected and sustainable 
network of open spaces.  In particular, this will be achieved by:  
a) protecting Metropolitan Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land from inappropriate development;  
b) encouraging beneficial use of Metropolitan Green Belt such as opportunities for public access, outdo or 
sports and recreation, retaining and enhancing landscapes, visual amenity, biodiversity or to improve 
damaged and derelict land;  
c) resisting harmful development of gardens and other green amenity spaces;  
d) keeping under review existing allotments and encouraging provision of space for community gardening, 
including for food growing, within new developments;  
e) working in partnership, seeking funding and supporting projects to promote the restoration and 
enhancement of open spaces, public realm and the waterway network within the borough;  
f) implementing the priorities outlined in relevant borough strategies or studies on open space, green and 
blue infrastructure including, where appropriate, rivers and waterways restoration;  
g) supporting the role waterways can play a s tools in place making and place shaping, contributing to the 
creation of sustainable communities;  
h) protecting land that forms part of the Southeast London Green Chain, including the Green Chain Walk, 
seeking to improve public access to and through the are a, and promoting it as a recreational resource 
and visual amenity;  
i) supporting the creation of new cycling and walking routes to connect publicly accessible open spaces to 
main destination points, such as town centres, public transport hubs, community facilities, and other 
publicly accessible open spaces;  
j) ensuring all new developments deliver a net increase to green infrastructure;  
k) seeking opportunities in new development , where appropriate, to provide new open space, play space 
and/or public realm, either through direct provision of new open space or improvement of existing open 
space through planning obligations;  
l) protecting new, or existing, amenity space that has been pr ovided as part of a development, including 
incidental green spaces that add amenity value;  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
71 SP8 Green infrastructure including designated Green Belt  
m) protecting and enhancing the biodiversity, heritage and archaeological values of open spaces, including 
the Thames, Cray and Shuttle rivers and their tributaries wit hin the borough;  
n) using water spaces for transport, cultural, recreational and leisure activities and other water -related 
uses; 
o) providing opportunities within waterside development for river and waterway restoration and the 
protection and enhancement of biodiversity;  
p) protecting green wildlife and ecological corridors, seeking opportunities to increase connectivity 
between the network of green spaces and habitats to enhance biodiversity and promote accessibility 
wherever appropriate; and,  
q) seeking opportunities to support the functions and drivers for green infrastructure, such as using good 
urban design to reduce air pollution, integrating green infrastructure into development where there are 
opportunities to mitigate poor air quality on a local scale . 
Policy implementation  
5.
67 National, regional and local formal land use designations for green infrastructure are identified on 
the submission policies map .  These include: Metropolitan Open Land (MOL); Metropolitan Green 
Belt; Urban Open Space; Southeast London Green Chain; Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs); Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS) and Locally Important Geological Sites (LIGS); Local 
Nature Reserves; and  Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC).  
5.68 The areas designated as Metropolitan Green Belt (MGB) and Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) play 
a variety of important functions in Bexley.  As well as p roviding open expanses, these protected 
designations have high levels of nature conservation, landscape, recreation and historic value.   
5.69 The Metropolitan Green Belt also provides the vital function of containing the further expansion of built development.   The quality and character of these areas are deserving of protection and 
enhancement, both for local residents and visitors.  Inappropriate development, as defined by Government guidance, will be resisted, unless very special circumstances apply.  
5.70 New dev elopments have an important part to play in the protection and enhancement of Bexley’s 
open spaces and waterways.  This includes contributing towards open space provision, making a positive contribution to green infrastructure and the public realm, and enhancing biodiversity.  
Open spaces also have a significant positive impact on health and wellbeing.  
5.71 There are parts of the borough that are deficient in access to open space, as illustrated b y Figure 6 .  
New development in these areas can contribute by providing new publicly accessible open space, or better access to existing open space.  
5.72 The Council seeks the enhanced provision for biodiversity in open spac es and identifies local 
quality and accessibility standards.  Partnership working and using funding opportunities to support projects will provide opportunities to protect and enhance Bexley’s open spaces and 
waterway network.  
5.73 The London Plan sets requirem ents for play space provision and local guidance will be set out  in 
the Design Guide SPD.  Where it is not possible to provide new open space and/or play space provision, many new developments will have the potential to contribute to green infrastructure 
and the public realm, including through the use of planning obligations.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
72 5.74 When seeking open space and play space opportunities in new development, the Council will have 
regard to its green infrastructure, open space, indoor and outdoor sports facilities and recreation 
studies.  The strategies developed from these studies will set a framework for the future planning 
and management of open spaces, outdoor sport and recreation facilities by encouraging 
developers, Council services and other partners to plan for the future delivery and implementation 
of open space improvements.

5.75 The River Thames and the River Cray are part of the Mayor of London’s Blue -Ribbon  Network, 
where development to increase use for transport, sport and leisure activities, particularly in areas of deficiency, is supported.  Waterside development will be expected to have particular regard to 
the contribution that could be made by the waterway network.  
5.76 Water spaces play an important role within the borough, supporting ecosystems, providing open 
space, residential moorings and providing transport networks.  Waterways are valuable public 
assets, contributing to the borough’s cultural and built heritage and encouraging physical and 
healthy outdoor activities which are essential to our health and wellbeing.  
5.77 Within Bexley, there are a number of watercourses including  the Rivers Cray and Shuttle.  The 
River Thames flows along the north of the borough, and the River Darent along the northeast.  Additionally, there is a network of lakes, canals, smaller streams, dikes  and ditches within the 
borough and ‘lost rivers’ such as the Wansunt and Stanham that now run in tunnels beneath 
Crayford.  
DP18  Waterfront development  
1. All development proposals adjacent to rivers and other watercourses such as lakes, ditches and dikes  will be 
required, where appropriate, to:  
a) activate space to a nd along the waterfront;  
b) maintain existing public access to and along the water and/or provide new access to and along the water 
where none exists;  
c) create residential moorings and visitor moorings to accommodate suitable vessels;  
d) enhance the appearance and  quality of the water space including:  
i. de-culverting watercourses and naturalising the river channel where practical;  
ii. using green infrastructure to improve water quality where possible;  
iii. improving nature conservation value for wildlife;  
iv. improving visual connections with important features, considering the design and landscaping of 
the adjacent area; and  
v. preserving the openness and character of the water spaces.  
e) provide suitable setbacks from water space edges to mitigate flood risks and to allow waterside 
walkways and cycle paths;  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
73 DP18  Waterfront development  
f) improve river walls and embankments, taking into account sea level rise, and/or fluvial, ground water 
and surface water flood risks;  
g) promote safety along the water’s edge , including the provision of riparian lifesaving equipment ; and,  
h) avoid the loss of water spaces. 
2. Development proposals should not adversely affect:  
a) the integrity of the waterway structure;  
b) the quality of the water;  
c) levels of pollution due to unauthorised discharges and run off or encroachment;  
d) the landscape, heritage, ecological quality or habitat continuity and character of the waterways;  
e) the waterway’s potential for being fully unlocked; or  
f) the use of the waterway network.  
Policy implementation  
5.
78 Applicants submitting proposals for waterfront development have obligations, as riparian owners, 
to maintain watercourses that are on, under or on the boundary of their site.  Restoration and/or 
improvement of walls and embankments of main rivers should be carried out in liaison with the 
Environment Agency.   The Environment Agency requires undeveloped setbacks alongside fluvial 
rivers  of 8 metres and 16 metres from tidal rivers to provide access in order to maint ain walls and 
embankments.   Ordinary watercourses maintenance should be carried out in liaison with the flood 
risk management authority.  
5.79 Bexley’s waterways provide or have the potential to provide various benefits including environmental and ecological health, transport, heritage, sport and recreation, and amenity.   The 
opportunity to enhance the quality of the built and natural environment should be taken through positive incorporation of waterways into development proposals.  With careful design, the outlook 
onto these biodiversity rich areas will be enhanced.  
5.80 The watercourses in Bexley are a unique aspect of the borough, many of which are designated Sites 
of Importance for Nature Conservation.  Consideration must be given as to how they can be 
positively incorporated, maintained and enhanced as part of any future development.  
5.81 Restoration of the river walls, embankments and wharfs should be designed to improve their 
biodiversity value, taking into account sea level rise, or, in the case of fluvial rivers, surface water 
and ground wa ter flooding .  Plans for future updates to defences should be designed into 
waterfront development plans and local masterplans and incorporate green infrastructure and placemaking.  
5.82 Development proposals for riverside sites and existing parks and open spaces should investigate 
the potential for full or part realigned flood defences prior to commencement of site planning.  All 
existing access points to riverside paths should be safeguarded  and opportunities for new access 
points considered, particularly if there are no access points nearby.  
5.83 Developments must take into account future flood defence improvement needs and maintenance access as part of waterfront development plans.  Considerations of the retention of access for 
long -term maintenance and upgrades to the flood defences should be factored in.   Surface water 
discharge to existing canal and lakes systems should be prioritised over sewage discharge, where 
sufficient capacity exists or can be created.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
74 5.84 Habitats that naturally provide flood defences and carbon sequestration should be protected and 
where possible, enhanced.  Setting back defences could reduce the dependence on vertical walls 
and provide opportunities for sloping riversides and public amenity areas.  
5.85 Developments adjacent to waterways should fac ilitate the safe and active use of the water space, 
including the provision of  riparian lifesaving equipment, such as grab chains, access ladders and life 
buoys along the riverside, along with the incorporation of suicide prevention measures in 
appropriate  locations, such as CCTV and signage with information to access support.   The Port of 
London Authority provides guidance on standards and best practice in its A Safer Riverside  
document. 
5.86 Pollution of the waterways must be avoided.  Methods to avoid polluted runoff, for example from 
petrol chemicals and salts into waterways, need to be considered in planning applications adjacent 
to waterways.

5.87 This policy sets out the development management considerations that relate to the nature 
conservation interest and quality of the River Thames,  which is a strate gically important feature of 
London, and to the special character of Bexley’s blue infrastructure.  
5.88 The River Thames , London’s most famous natural feature, has several important functions to play 
in the borough in terms of potential contribution to transport, contribution to nature conservation 
interest, flood defence, archaeology and other heritage assets . 
5.89 The River Thames creates a wildlife corridor running right across the capital, and is extremely 
important for species such as fish, birds and bats.  It i s a designated Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation of Metropolitan Importance and an Area of Archaeological Priority.  These interests 
should be protected and enhanced by new development.  
DP19  The River Thames and the Thames Policy Area  
1. The Thames Polic y Area is defined on the submission policies map . 
2. Development proposals for riverside sites and existing parks and open spaces should investigate the potential 
for full or part realigned flood defences prior to commencement of site planning, and are required to:  
a) follow the strategies for water management set out in the TE2100 Plan and subsequent updates;  
b) enhance the relationship b etween the development site and the Thames; and,  
c) contribute to the completion of the Thames Path, a continuous public riverside footpath and cycleway, 
including safeguarding existing or providing new access points to the riverside path. 
3. The Council encourages improving the efficiency and promoting the sustainability of waterborne freight 
movements, including waste transfer and aggregates handling, on the Thames.  Viable wharves are safeguarded 
for such uses through a Direction by the Secretary of Sta te. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
75 DP19  The River Thames and the Thames Policy Area  
4. Proposals in the Thames Policy Area should pay attention  to their impacts on the ecology of the River Thames, 
and on its priority habitats and protected species.  Ecological enhancements will be sought from all proposals; 
development  directly adjacent  to the River should look to enhance essential fish habitats and reduce the risk of 
invasive species.  
5. The Council will encourage improved access to nature across the Thames Policy Area.  Opportunities should be 
sought to link proposed and existing wildlif e corridors, including the Ridgeway Link, Thames Marshes corridor, 
Thamesmead Link and the River Thames itself, and integrating these networks with pedestrian and cycle paths 
where appropriate.  
6. Habitat creation and enhancement will be promoted.  Opportunities should also be sought for related 
enhancements to visitor’s centres and other facilities.  Habitat creation along the Thames should aim to improve 
the area’s flood resilience and water management.  
Policy implementation  
5.
90 Development within the Thames Policy Area (as defined on the submission policies map ) should 
consider the most up to date relevant published guidance.  Strategies for water management are 
set out in the Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary 2100 Plan (TE2100 Plan).   
5.91 Developments along the Thames should incorporate flood defence measures that improve the 
waterfront environment and increase awareness of flood risk.   Opportunities to improve the river 
frontage should be taken as new defences are constructed.  In particular, there is scope to combine new defences with new development, and possibly retreat the defence in some areas with resilient 
development on the riv erward side. 
5.92 The Mayor of London, the Port of London Authority and the Council are committed to improving 
Bexley’s wharves on the River Thames for freight operation.  A review of safeguarding directions 
for London’s wharves has been carried out by the Mayo r and been approved by the Secretary of 
State.  One of Bexley’s wharves, Railway Wharf  in Erith, adjacent to the town centre, has been 
removed  from safeguarding.  Safeguarded wharves are shown on the submission policies map . 
5.93 Alternatives to encroachment by development should be sought to increase storage of the river, 
restore character and conserve archaeology.  Water management measures should also maximise 
ecological and amenity value.  Opportunities to use large open spaces such as Erith and Crayford 
Marshes as tidal flood storage must ensure these spaces are multifunctional in that they are also 
designed to enhance biodiversity value and  appropriate forms of recreation and public access.  
5.94 The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) should be referred to for guidance on any planning 
activity that includes a section of coast or tidal river.  The tidal Thames and the tidal extent of its 
tributar ies are within  the South East Marine Plan  area , and all planning decisions that relate to the 
UK marine area must be made in accordance with the South East Marine Plan. 
5.95 The MMO is also responsible for issuing marine licences under the Marine and Coastal Ac cess Act 
2009.  A marine licence may be needed for activities involving a deposit or removal of a substance 
or object below the mean high- water springs mark or in any tidal river extent of the tidal influence.  
Any works may also require consideration under The Marine Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations (as amended).  Early consultation with the MMO is advised.  A River 
Works License is also required from the Port of London Authority (PLA).  Bexley Draft Local Plan

National Planning Policy Framework  
The London Plan 2021  
Sites of Importance to Nature Conservation (SINC) Report  
Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  
5.96 The NPPF sets out the overarching approach to biodiversity protection and the London Plan 
protects designated SINC from development, whilst also placing an additional duty on the London 
boroughs to ensure steps are taken to further protect biodiversity.  The Environment Bill 
strengthens provision for improving the natural Environment, including a biodiversity net gain 
objective, to ensure biodiversity value attributed to a development exceeds the pre- development 
biodiversity value of the onsite habitat by at least 10%.  
5.97 This strategic policy seeks to ensure that the quantity of Bexley’s biodiversity is protected and enhanced, including  avoiding adverse impacts from development on species and sites of nature 
conservation value.  Biodiversity is short for biological diversity and includes every living thing; plants, animals, fungi, algae, bacteria, even viruses.  Geodiversity is the variety of rocks, fossils, 
minerals, natural processes, landforms and soils that underlie and determine the character of our 
landscape and environment.  
5.98 Bexley is home to a number of important wildlife species and habitats.  Some species of plants and 
animals are afforded legal protection, for example under Schedules 1, 5 and 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  A number of habitats and species are identified in national , 
regional  and local biodiversity action plans.  The important contribution of sites of importance for 
nature conservation (SINC) and geodiversity value in the borough is recognised.  
5.99 Linking many of Bexley’s SINC, Green Belt and other green spaces and waterways is a network of 
green wildlife corridors.  This network allows some species with specialised habitat requirements 
to extend their distribution into parts of London where they would otherwise not be present.  The 
rivers, canals road and rail -side land are important components of these corridors and are a great 
benefit to London’s biodiversity.  
5.100 The SINC land use designation protects those local wildlife sites that are important to the whole of London, to the borough and the local area.  SINC are identified according to London- wide set 
criteria for biodiversity and local distinctiveness.  The process of site identification, review, and changes to SINC is overseen by the London Wildlife Sites Board.  Although sites  of similar quality 
may be found elsewhere, damage to designated sites would mean a significant loss to London or the borough.  Sites and designated areas are updated periodically by the Council, which publishes 
the most up to date site boundary information and description in its SINC Report.  
5.101 Local Nature Reserves (LNR) are specifically designated by the Council for public access to nature, 
under Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and amended by 
Schedule 11 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 .  Nature reserves  
provide a significant and long -term contribution to nature conservation and are an important 
resource for the community, making a positive contribution to health and wellbeing.   The borough 
has  four local nature reserves, covering 103.02ha.  These are: Lesnes Abbey Woods; Danson Park 
Bog Garden; Foots Cray Meadows; and Crossness nature reserve.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
77 SP9 The protection and enhancement of biodiversity and geological assets  
1. In its planning decisions, planning policies and action plans, the Council will protect and enhance the b orough’s 
biodiversity and geodiversity assets, in line with national and regional policy, by:  
a) ensuring development in Bexley does not adversely affect the integrity of any European site of nature 
conservation importance;  
b) recognising the value of landforms, landscapes, geological processes and soils as contributors to the 
geodiversity of the borough by protecting designated sites of special scientific interest (SSSI), and 
regionally and locally important geological sites (RIGs and LIGs) and supporting their sustainable 
conservation and management;  
c) establishing clear goals for the management of identified geological sites, in order to promote public 
access, appreciation and interpretation of geodiversity;  
d) protecting, conserving, restoring, and enhancing ecological networks, sites of importance for nature 
conservation (SINC), local nature reserves and strategic and local wildlife corridors, thus securing 
measurable net gains for biodiversit y. Recognising and promoting those sites where ecological value has 
increased to a higher grade of nature conservation importance;  
e) resisting development that will have a significant adverse impact on the population or conservation 
status of protected or pr iority species as identified by legislation or in biodiversity action plans 
prepared at national, regional or local level;  
f) protect ing and enhanc ing the natural environment, seeking biodiversity enhancements, net gains for 
biodiversity and improved access t o nature, particularly in areas of deficiency , as illustrated by Figure 7 , 
through new development and projects that help deliver opportunities for green infrastructure – 
preference will be given to enhancements that help to deliver the targets for habitats and species set 
out in the London Plan and local biodiversity action plans and strategies;  
g) enabling environmental education oppo rtunities at the borough’s schools, and investigating 
opportunities to involve the wider community in biodiversity or geodiversity restoration and 
enhancement through projects;  
h) ensuring landscaping schemes in development proposals use native plant species of local provenance; 
and,  
i) seeking opportunities to provide for greening of the built environment.

102 Internationally protected sites include Special Protection Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of 
Conservation (SACs) and Ramsar Sites (collectively referred to as Natura 2000 sites) and form part 
of an international network of protected areas for nature conservation.  There are no Natura 2000 sites within the borough.  However, possible pathways whereby development within the borough 
proposed by the Local Plan that may affect sites outside the borough have been assessed in the 
Habitat Regulations Assessment.  
5.103 London’s geological sites are protected through their designation as sites of special scientific 
interest (SSSI), regionally important geological sites (RIGS) or locally important geological sites 
(LIGS).  SSSI have statutory protection and are nationally recognised for their flora and fauna, 
geological, or physiographical (landform) features.  In Bexley, there are two SSSI: Abbey Wood  in 
Belvedere, and Wansunt Pit in Crayford.  
5.104 RIGS and LIGS complement the SSSI coverage and are the most important places for geology and geomorphology outside the statutory network.  These are geological sites of particular importance 
in London and the borough that are identified by the London Geodiversity Partnership, working 
with the GLA.  Much of our geological knowledge has come from the study of exposed rock faces Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
78 and the fossil remains found in the rock strata, making geological sites a vital part of our historical 
heritage.  The list of sites may be updated periodically by the London Geodiversity Partnership.   
Areas deﬁcient in access to nature  
 
Figure 7: Map of designated SINC and areas deficient in access to nature  
5.105 There are three RIGS in Bexley: North End Pit in Erith Park; Chalky Dell; and the Erith Submerged 
Forest.  In addition, Parish’s Pit has been designated as a LIGS.  Sustainable conservation, 
management and interpretation of Bexley’s underlying geology is importa nt as they provide an 
important resource for education and research.  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
79 5.106 Chapter 10 of the Bexley Green Infrastructure Study presents an overview of the ecological 
networks in Bexley, including green and wildlife corridors, SINC and stepping stones between sit es.  
There are also smaller unidentified local wildlife corridors within and between sites that support the functioning of the network.  A list of designated sites can be found on the biodiversity pages of 
the Council’s website.  The Bexley SINC Report pro vides additional details of local wildlife sites and 
strategic wildlife corridors that are of the highest importance within the borough.  The definitive boundaries and hierarchy of all SINC in the borough can be found on the submission policies map . 
5.107 Biodiversity and geodiversity are material considerations in determining planning applications 
regardless of whether ecological or geological features benefit from statutory protection.  It must 
be recognised that important habitats and protected or notable species are not confined to 
designated sites but can be found on almost any site.  
5.108 Applicants preparing development proposals that might have the potential to adversely impact a 
European site of importance for nature conservation outside the borough should seek advice from Natural England as to whether a Habitat Regulations Assessment will be required.  Consideration 
should also be given to any potential adverse impacts on the Thames Estuary and Marshes SPA 
through increased visitor pressure and reduced water quality, and on Epping Forest SAC through reduced air quality. 
5.109 Applicants should consider whether their development proposal is likely to affect an SSSI and 
choose whether to seek pre-application advice from Natural England.  This will allow any potential impacts to be considered within the planning application and so minimise the risk of delays at the 
formal planning stage.  Natural England ’s impact risk zone assessment tool helps inform whether 
the development proposal is likely to affect an SSSI.  This uses a geographic information system to define potentially damaging developments and activities in order to help provide an important first  
line of defence for conserving natural features.  
5.110 Development proposals, especially those that are within or adjacent to a designated wildlife corridor will be expected to protect, conserve, restore and enhance wildlife movement by creating 
and enhancing ecological network linkages and/or enhancements between and through the 
development site and the corridor, where appropriate.   
5.111 Notwithstanding the extensive network of biodiversity sites, parts of the borough are deficient in 
access to nature (see Figure 7 ).  Development proposals should maximise opportunities for 
biodiversity enhancements; including pursuing opportunities to improve biodiversity in and around other developments as an integral part of design, especially where this can secure 
measurable net gains for biodiversity and enhance public access to nature.  
5.112 The Council is committed to reducing habitat fragmentation from new development and increas ing 
ecological connectivity.  Development proposals should consider features such as living walls and roofs, hedgerows, tree networks, wildlife corridors and wildlife crossing points to improve 
connectivity for wildlife through developments.  T aking action at a local level and through specific 
developments is supported.  The introduction of features such as green roofs can provide insulation as well as improving the biodiversity value of a development.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

ites of Importance to Nature Conservation (SINC) Report  
Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  
5.113 Bexley contains a wide variety of wildlife habitats, including woodland, heathland, reed beds, rivers 
and streams, ponds, lakes, marshes, grassland and "wasteland” – the latter a term usually given to 
the open, flower -rich habitat that develops on brownfield sites.  Geology has strong ties with 
biodiversity, in that the nature of the substrate, as usually determined by the nature of the 
underlying rock, is a key factor in determining the distribution of habitats and species.  
5.114 Bexley is home to a number of different plant and animal species.  Some of these are rare or 
declining and are of regional or national importance.  However, a species does not have to be rare 
or threatened to be interesting and important.  They may have strong cultural significance, or 
simply look or sound beautiful.  Key species in Bexley include black poplar, lesser calamint, 
bluebells, wild daffodil, common lizard, kingfisher, newts, skylark, stag beetle and water vole.  
5.115 The richness of Bexley’s natural environment also includes wildlife corridors along waterways and 
railways as well as on the River Thames and its tributaries, private gardens including front gardens 
that are of importance in terms of providing habitat and wildlife corridors or stepping stones, and 
contribute extensively, especially in outer London, to green infrastructure and the ability of wildlife 
to move between larger sites and extend their distribution into parts of London where they would 
otherwise not be present.  
DP20  Biodiversity and geodiversity in developments  
Protection for biodiversity  
1. Development proposals will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
a) a strict approach to the mitigation hierarchy has been taken (i.e. avoid, mitigate, compensate and net 
gain) and all unavoidable impacts on biodiversity can be justified;  
b) completion of the development will result in a measurable long -term net gain for biodiversity, as 
demonstrated through the application of an acceptable method of measurement, and/or impact 
assessments; 
c) biodiversity enhancement measures and where appropriate mitigation measures have been 
incorporated within the design, layout and materials used in the built structure and landscaping;  
d) opportunities to help connect and improve the wider ecological networks, wildlife corridors and 
stepping stones for wildlife have been taken by creating linkages through the development site;  
e) deficiencies in access to nature conservation are reduced, where possible; and,  
f) opportunities to increase wildlife aesthetic value and visual connections with important features have 
been considered.  
Protection of designated sites and habitats  
2. Developmen t proposals that would have a direct or indirect impact on a site designated for its nature 
conservation or geological interest should protect and enhance the designated site’s value, and will not be 
permitted unless all of the following criteria are met:  
a) there are no reasonable, less damaging, alternative solutions, locations or sites;  
b) ecological buffer zones have been incorporated into the scheme, where appropriate, to protect and 
enhance the designated site’s intrinsic value;  
c) the continuity of wildlife h abitat within wildlife corridors is maintained; and,  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
81 DP20  Biodiversity and geodiversity in developments  
d) access to the designated site is not compromised and where possible, access and/or interpretation is 
improved.  
Protection of ancient woodland and veteran trees  
3. Irreplaceable habitats, including ancient  woodland and aged or veteran trees found outside of ancient 
woodland will be protected from loss or deterioration resulting from development.  Where development 
proposals may affect irreplaceable habitats and their immediate surroundings, the following principles of good 
practice shall be used to guide the site assessment and design of development:  
a) establishment of the likelihood and type of any impacts;  
b) implementation of appropriate and adequate mitigation, compensation, and management measures 
that respe ct the features and characteristics of the veteran trees and/or ancient woodland;  
c) provision of adequate buffers; and  
d) provision of adequate evidence to support development proposals.  
Policy implementation  
Protection for biodiversity  
5.116 Before starting a project, all applicants including householders and smaller developers should 
consider what current value their site has for wildlife, whether ecological surveys are needed, and 
what opportunities exist to enhance or create wildlife value through good design.  The Design 
Guide SPD will provide  useful guidance.  
5.117 Any development has the potential to impact , both negatively and positively , on local biodiversity 
through its effects on nature conservation features.  Proposals should demonstrate how each step 
of the mitigation hierarchy has been considered within the design , ensuring measures for 
mitigation, compensation, and biodiversity net gains are appropriate , in terms of design and 
location, and are secured for the lifetime of the development.  Where appropriate, future 
maintenance, monitoring, and funding mechanisms will need to be secured.  Development 
proposal s that  cannot satisfy the requirements of the mitigation hierarchy will be refused  planning 
permission in accordance with the NPPF . 
5.118 T o achieve net gain for biodiversity a development must leave biodiversity in a better state than it was before development took place; and to ensure biodiversity value attributed to a development 
exceeds the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat . During the early stages of 
design, developers should  confirm what  % uplift  will be required with the local authority . Natural 
England’s Biodiversity Metric can be used as a quantitative metric to calculate the biodiversity of a 
site before and after development .  
5.119 Development proposals should demonstrate within the design and access statement and other material submitted with the planning application  how biodiversity has informed the design.  Major  
development , and where applicable smaller  developments,  will be expected to submit an ecological 
assessment that has informed the design, layout and type of enhancements incorporated in the 
proposal.   
5.120 Developments can contribute to the wider ecological network by reducing artificial light spill and 
including simple features such as permeable boundary walls and fencing for small mammals, or 
vegetative crossing points and eco -passages under roads to help maintain, create and enhance 
existing and new wildlif e commuting routes.   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
82 5.121 Features such as artificial nest sites, which are of particular relevance and benefit in an urban 
context, should be incorporated within the built structure.  Where biodiversity features are 
incorporated within development proposals, conditions will be set that will seek to protect the 
features to ensure their long term retention and replacement if needed .  
5.122 Nature conservation is not restricted to the preservation of wildlife but goes hand in hand with the 
enjoyment of it by all people.   During the design process, consideration should be given to the 
visual qualities of nature conservation features, both on and offsite; and how views of them can be enhanced.  
5.123 Access to nature is an important consideration, especially in areas where deficiencies have been 
identified.  In these areas, it is particularly important that opportunities be taken to preserve, 
enhance or create areas of nature conservation value, so that people are able to have access to 
enjoy nature.   
5.124 For those sites not within nature conservation deficiency areas, it is also important to consider 
opportunities to further improve accessibility to nearby SINCs.  Some access is desirable to all but 
the most sensitive of SINCs.  Opportunities to improve biodiversity in and around other 
developments should be pursued as an integral part of their design, especially where this can secure measurable net gains for biodiversity and enhance access to nature.  
Protection of designated sites and habitats  
5.125 The identification of direct and indirect impacts of a development  proposal  that  is adjacent to or 
incorporates a designated site within its site boundary should be informed by an impact 
assessment.  Proposals will need to demonstrate how the overall spatial design has avoided and 
minimised negative impacts on the designated site and maximised opportunities to benefit the designated site ’s intrinsic value.  
Protection of ancient woodland and veteran trees  
5.126 Most of the woodland areas within the borough lie within designated SINC and comprise 
broadleaved woodland with some small pockets of coniferous woodland scattered across Bexley, 
including 134 acres of ancient woodland.  All areas of ancient woodland within the borough are 
also covered by a SINC designation.  Several areas of ancient woodland are of a notable size, including Lesnes Abbey Woods, which adjoins Bostall Woods in Greenwich, and Joyden’s Wood, 
which crosses the boundary into Dartford.  Several smaller fragmented areas of ancient woodland 
are distributed throughout the borough, either within residential areas or included within other 
open spaces.  The Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  maps the locations of ancient woodland.  
5.127 Development must be designed to avoid the loss of, or in the case of adjacent development 
detrimental impact on, irreplaceable habitat.  If a development is likely to harm ancient woodland 
or veteran trees, unequivocal and credible evidence should be prepared to justify the exceptional 
need and benefits  and submitted alongside the planning application.  The need for housing, or need 
for new transport infrastructure, does not constitute exceptional circumstances.   
5.128 Natural England and Forestry Commission Standing Advice on Ancient Woodlands and Veteran Trees  will be considered when assessing planning applications. Further guidance on how to adopt 
principles of good practice is detailed within the woodland trusts practical guide on planning for ancient woodland .   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
83  DP2 1: Greening of development sites  
Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
The London Plan 2021 – Policy G 5  
Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  
5.129 The ‘g reening ’ of Bexley’s streets, buildings and other public spaces does more than change the 
look of these places.  Roofs and walls covered in plants, street trees and small pocket parks in 
between buildings make the borough a better place to live, work and invest.  These greening 
features act as an important part of Bexley’s green infrastructure network: cleaning the air, 
reducing the risk of flooding ; helping to cool the borough; and provid ing important habitats for 
species.   Certain habitats such as wetlands can reduce the impacts of water run- off and hence 
reduce flood risk and pollution of waterways.   
5.130 Wildlife habitats and access to them also play a vital part in human wellbeing.  The benefits to local people provided by nature conservation features can be far ranging.  They include valuable 
ecosystem services such as mitigating the damaging effects of air pollution and climate change, as 
well as aesthetic and amenity benefits.  Trees and planting can provide a valuable shading effect in 
summer and insulation effect in winter.   
DP21  Greening of development sites  
1. Development proposals should set out what measures have been taken to achieve urban greening onsite; and 
all new major developments should quantify what Urban Greening Factor (UGF) score has been achieved.  
2. Development proposals will be required to provide a high standard of landscape design, having regard to the 
well -being, water, wildlife and character of the surrounding area, ensuring sustainable planting for the long 
term and be supported by appropriate m anagement and maintenance measures.  
3. There will be a presumption in favour of the retention and enhancement of existing trees, woodland and 
hedgerow cover on site; and planning permission will not normally be permitted where the proposal adversely 
affects important trees, woodlands, or hedgerows.  
4. Development proposals should maximise potential for the planting of new native trees and hedges within the 
development site and new streets should be tree -lined, unless, in specific cases, there are clear, justif iable and 
compelling reasons why this would be inappropriate.   
5. Planting and landscaping within developments and ecological buffer zones:  
a) will be required to contribute to habitats and features of landscape and nature conservation 
importance; and,  
b) must not  include ‘potentially invasive, non- native species’; and, where found on a site, appropriate 
measures to remove these species must be taken as part of the redevelopment.  
Policy implementation  
5.131 Applicants are required to incorporate urban greening measures in the layout and design of a scheme with the aim of achiev ing a UGF  score of at least 0.4 for major residential schemes and at 
least 0.3 for major mixed -use or commercial schemes.  These targets are a starting point that will 
inform the right level of greening for each development.  
5.132 Several accreditation schemes have been developed that set standards for the quality of green 
infrastructure within developments.  Proposals which undergo a recognised accreditation process 
will be considered positively.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
84 5.133 The UGF  should be based on the factors set out in Table 8.2 following London Plan Policy G5 Urban 
Greening.  This will help to increase green cover across each development .  In areas where there is 
little opportunity for additional vegetation at ground level, the  UGF will promote the incorporation 
of green walls and green/brown roofs.    
5.134 Chapter 9 of Bexley Green Infrastructure Study  sets out evidence on existing urban greening 
features in Bexley; and  the Design Guide SPD will provide  additional guidance on incorporating 
greening into developments.  
5.135 Planting schemes should be selected according to their suitability for local growing conditions (soil, 
temperature ranges, rainfall, sunlight and shade), the ability to attract wildlife (e.g. nectar rich 
planting) and conserve water.  The selection of species for planting schemes should also consider 
the species long term sustainability in a changing climate.  This will need to be evidenced in a Design and Access Statement and soft landscaping plans to ensure the right plants are located in 
the right place.  
5.136 As part of the formal planning process, all trees and hedges present on a proposed  development 
site should  be assessed to establish their amenity, nature or landscape conservation value .  The 
Council expects  that trees or hedges deemed to have significant  value will be retained and 
protected from harm.  Their significance may be as a result of their size, form and maturity, aesthetic value or because they are rare or unusual, form part of ancient woodland  or hedgerow , 
have a veteran tree status or are prot ected under a tree preservation order.   
5.137 Applicants should check with the planning authority to ascertain whether any trees potentially affected by the proposed development are protected by way of a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) or 
Conservation Area. When considering felling trees related to development, consents for tree 
felling may be required under different regimes, even if a planning application is not needed. The  
Forestry Commission guidance on planning applications affecting trees and woodland provides 
advice on  when to consult the Forestry Commission.   
5.138 A landscaping scheme should be submitted alongside the planning application that makes 
provision for the retention of existing trees and hedges with significant value.  Younger trees  or 
hedges  that have the potential to add significant value to the landscape character in the future 
should also be retained where possible.  Their retention should be reflected in the  layout of the 
development  proposal , allowing sufficient space for new and young trees to grow to maturity, both 
above and below ground.  
5.139 Due to the environmental importance of trees, implementing at least a ‘1 for 1’ replacement rate is 
desirable for a ny tree affected by development  that is not covered in paragraph 5.130 above .  The 
Council expects  developments to incorporate additional trees wherever possible.   Where trees are 
incorporated within development proposals, conditions will be set that will seek to protect the 
trees to ensure their long term retention and replacement if needed.  
5.140 Not all h edges are beneficial to the environment and, in certain cases, planting the wrong type of 
hedging plants can lead to difficulties.  Hedge heights can sometimes detract from the reasonable enjoyment of a home or garden.  Part 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 gives local authorities 
powers to determine complaints submitted by householders in respect of a neighbour's high 
hedge.  Further information and advice on high hedges  can be found on the Council’s website. 
5.141 Landscaping should aim to complement the biodiversity of the locality and incorporate native plant 
species.  Where appropriate the Council will  accept non- native species for trees and other plants, Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
85 as long as they are deemed to be suitable and non- invasive. Opportunities to increase wildlife 
aesthetic value and visual connections with important features should be considered.  This is 
particularly important where the application adjoins a site of importance for nature conservation, 
nature reserve or is within or adjacent to a wildlife corridor.  Where appropriate, the Council will 
require details to be provided within a Landscape and Ecological Management Plan.  
5.142 In selecting appropriate trees a nd layout for new tree- lined streets, applicants should work with 
the local planning authority including local highways officers and tree officers to ensure that the right trees are planted in the right places, and solutions are found that are compatible w ith 
highways standards and the needs of different users.  
5.143 Planting new trees and shrubs, especially of native species, can help to soften the harsh lines of new built development and add interest to the design.  The benefits of trees include improved 
mental  health and wellbeing, contributing to the beauty and quality of the street scene, providing 
shade and cooling to offset the ‘heat island effect, ’ providing habitats, mitigating against the risk of surface water flooding, reduction in noise pollution, filt ering pollutants from the air, and preventing 
shrinking and heave during hotter weather.  
5.144 Potentially invasive, non- native species are listed in Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act.  Invasive non -native species (INNS) are one of the largest threa ts to global biodiversity after 
habitat loss and destruction.  The London Invasive Species Initiative (LISI) has been created to help address these environmental and economic problems within the Greater London area and ha s 
compiled a list of species of concern.  
5.145 Development sites where invasive non- native species are present (most commonly Japanese 
knotweed) require coordinated and considered action to ensure that there is no breach of relevant 
legislation or no threat of spread.   Where they are present on a  development site, appropriate 
methods must  be used to ensure they are removed.   The following steps should be followed: 
1. early detection; 
2. create a site plan;  
3. control;  
4. contain;  
5. keep records and monitor.  
5.146 The LISI website should be referred to and the guidanc e provided should be followed.  The Great 
Britain Non -Native Species Secretariat (NNSS) and the Invasive Non- Native Specialists 
Association (INNSA) provides further guidance.   Bexley Draft Local Plan

Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP)  
6.1 The NPPF’s economic objective includes the need for  identifying and coordinating the provision of 
infrastructu re.  As well as setting out an overall strategy for the pattern, scale and quality of 
development, local plans should make sufficient provision for  the infrastructure needed  to support 
this strategy .   
6.2 Chapter 5 focussed on ensuring that development in the borough both contributes to the provision 
of, as well as the protection and enhancement of, community services and facilities, green and blue 
infrastructure, and the ecology of the borough.   
6.3 Policies in this chapter seek to ensur e that s ufficient provision  is made for infrastructure for 
transport, waste management, water supply, wastewater , and minerals and aggregates .  ‘Sufficient 
provision’ is considered to be the need for projects that are critical in relation to planned growth  
set out in this Local Plan and those that are essential to ensure that development is  sustainable or 
otherwise acceptable. 
6.4 This chapter sets out the strategic and non- strategic policies to address these infrastructure issues 
and how they should be dealt with in a coordinated manner as proposals for new development come forward, taking account of the policies already in the London Plan.   Specific infrastructure 
projects are identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan that supports the Local Plan.  
6.5 In line  with both the NPPF and the London Plan, these policies have been developed through 
liaison with  relevant  infrastructure providers , operators and stakeholders  wherever possible .

Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
Mayor’s Transport Strategy (MTS)  
Local Implementation Plan (LIP)  
Local Plan Transport Assessment (LPTA)  
6.6 As an outer London borough, Bexley has transport characteristics that combine those of both 
Greater London and its bordering county of Kent.  The borough has no Underground, Docklands 
Light Railway, tram or other rapid transit services.  Bexley has a low average PTAL (public transport access level) score – on the cusp of PTAL 1b/2 – that places it in the bottom five London boroughs 
for accessibility.  Much of Bexley  is made up of relatively lower density residential areas.  
6.7 Factors such as these have informed the approach to sustainable development in this Local Plan.  The low levels of public transport in the borough ha s led to higher car ownership than many 
London boroughs and the car being the travel means of choice for the majority of journeys.  The Elizabeth line is currently expected to open to Abbey Wood in the first half of 2022; it will bring a 
major step -change in connectivity (including much reduced journey times) particularly for Abbey 
Wood and for part of the north of the borough.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
87  
Figure 8: Bexley and the strategic transport network (road and rail)  
6.8 Bexley’s strategic transport corrid ors all run east -west (both rail and road), as shown in  Figure 8 .  
The nearest strategic north-south road links are the A205 South Circular to the west a nd the M25 
to the east.  Indirect north-south rail links are provided by loop services between the east -west 
lines.  The potential to improve to north- south movement within the borough, by any mode of 
travel, is severely constrained.  
6.9 Likewise, options for improving freight movement are limited.  There is no provision in the borough 
for freight to join the rail network, though it does benefit from wharves along the Thames.  
Distribution/logistics is a key sector for Bexley’s industrial areas, especially in the north of the 
borough.   As a consequence, local distribution is hampered by the nature of the borough’s road 
network – adding to delivery costs by making journey times longer and less reliable.  Longer 
distance freight movements are reliant on strategic corridors such as the A2, A20 and 
A206/A2016 South Thames Development Route (STDR), so operational performance relies on the 
smooth operation of those routes, along with the feeder roads to and from them.   
6.10 Despite all this, Bexley’s positio n on the wider transport network and in the Thames Gateway sub -
region may provide significant opportunities for development growth in the medium to long term, 
as supported in the Growth Strategy.  This would be heavily dependent on the required 
infrastruct ure (particularly additional transport schemes) being put in place.   
6.11 Bexley’s L ocal Implementation Plan (LIP)  sets out both the local strategy for transport in the 
borough and a three-year programme of measures for implementation.  The LIP supports delivery 
of the Mayor’s Transport Strategy ( MTS ), including the Mayor’s objective that, by 2041, 80% of all 
journeys in London should be by means other than the car.  The LIP includes a local mode share target for the borough for 2041, set at  a lower level than the outer London average, taking some 
account of Bexley’s connectivity issues.  
6.12 The Council is both highway and traffic authority for all roads in the borough apart from the A2 and the A20.  This includes the strategic road network for London (which takes i n the A206/A2016 
STDR), although Transport for London (TfL) also has a network management role in respect of those roads.   The classification of roads is set out i n Ta b l e  1 1 . 
6.13 Despite existing bus and rail connections and support for cycling and walking initiatives, the car 
will still have a role to play in Bexley.  Unless other measures are put in place, providing more road 
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
88 capacity will  simply increase t raffic flows, resulting in more traffic congestion, less attractive places 
and more air pollution.  It is important therefore that development schemes  include positive 
proposals that provide for and promote the use of more sustainable ways of travelling . 
SP10  Bexley’s transport network  
1. The Council will work to achieve a comprehensive, high- quality, safe, integrated and sustainable transport 
system, which makes the most of existing and proposed transport infrastructure within the borough.  The map 
of Bexley’s transport network, including locations of key transport project proposals, are set out in Figure 9 .  
The Council seeks to ensure a much improved and expanded role for sustainable transport through the 
following actions:  
a) initiating or supporting the future development of major new public tra nsport infrastructure proposals 
within or affecting Bexley, including an extension of Docklands Light Rail to Belvedere, Bus Transit from 
North Greenwich to Slade Green, River Thames passenger services, including the upgrading of Erith 
Pier, and new Thames  crossings – the Council will explore, by continued negotiations with Transport for 
London and the Port of London Authority a firm basis for the further progression of these schemes;  
b) increasing the capacity, frequency, accessibility and safety of establish ed bus and rail facilities;  
c) supporting the improvement of interchange facilities within the borough’s major town centres through 
area -based schemes and other initiatives;  
d) encouraging walking and cycling within the borough through implementation of local an d strategic 
walking and cycling programmes, travel plans, local safety schemes, the provision of facilities within 
development proposals, and environmental improvement projects;  
e) using local targets included in the Council’s Local Implementation Plan to ens ure Healthy Streets 
concepts and the Mayor’s Transport Strategy’s mode share targets are reflected in development 
proposals;  
f) working with the Crossrail to Ebbsfleet (C2E) partnership to secure the potential extension of the 
Elizabeth Line, including the pr otection of the land required for the scheme in accordance with existing 
and future Safeguarding Directions, and the managing of development to preserve and enhance the 
deliverability of the scheme;  
g) promoting improvements in north- south transport provision, including facilitating junction 
improvements, clearer signing, and enhanced bus services and facilities –  in particular, improved 
connections will be sought with Abbey Wood station and the Elizabeth line;  
h) improving the efficiency and promoting the sustai nability of freight movement in the borough and 
ensuring construction and operation of any new rail freight facilities, or wharves for waterborne freight 
handling, where this does not unduly prejudice other objectives of the Local Plan;  
i) developing other ta rgeted road schemes, where they assist regeneration and/or reduce congestion, 
whilst generally promoting modal shift away from the use of the car;  
j) effectively maintaining and efficiently managing the existing highway network to reduce congestion and 
unnece ssary delays, improve the environment, in particular air quality, and promote safety, health and 
wellbeing;  
k) encouraging a new transitional approach to providing and managing residential car parking within new 
developments in areas where parking demands and  provision could both reduce over time as more 
sustainable means of connectivity are improved; and  
l) resisting the change of use or redevelopment of existing railway station car parks and car parks that 
perform a wider town centre function unless suitable re placement spaces are provided.  
2. The Council will work with Transport for London and with Highways England so that necessary infrastructure 
interventions on the strategic road network required to support future development proposals in the borough 
are better understood, potential solutions found, and a funded and deliverable programme of measures 
identified.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

90 Policy implementation  
6.14 The Council will continue to work with TfL to deliver new development and improved public realm 
in a way that encourages walking, cycling and use of public transport (including using the Mayor’s 
Healthy Streets approach).  The Council therefore supports delivery of projects as part of the 
London Bus Priority Network.  The Council will also work with Network Rail and neighbouring 
local authorities towards overcoming the remaining barriers to full 12 -car train operation (both 
within and outside the borough).  
6.15 The Healthy Streets Check for Designers will be applied to Council LIP- funded schemes as 
appropriate.  Further details and information are set out in Bexley’s Highway Authority Developer 
Guidance and will be included in the Design Guide SPD.  Figure 10  illustrates the ten Healthy 
Streets indicators, which describe how their design should enable and encourage people to choose to walk, cycle and use public transport more.  
 
Figure 10: Transport for London's 10 healthy street indicators (source: Lucy Saunders ) 
6.16 It will be important to support the growth set out in the Local Plan with new transport services and infrastructure.  This will be across the Plan period, through a mix of LIP implementation, transport 
improvements through new development and investment in major schemes.  T o this end, the 
Council will work closely with TfL and, in respect of transport on the River Thames, the Port of 
London Authority ( PLA ).  Beyond the Plan period, further examination of DLR to Belvedere will be 
needed when preparing a planning framework for the Bexley Riverside  Opportunity Area . 
6.17 The Council will work with TfL on the scheme’s technical development; future development 
propos als will be expected to facilitate its delivery; and the Council will expect development 
proposals on the route corridor to design buildings and public realm that positively incorporate it.  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
91 6.18 The Council supports delivery of an upgraded Thames pier at Erith  for access to extended river bus 
services.  Erith pier has been incorporated into the town centre boundary to encourage more 
active use The Council will work with TfL and the PLA towards delivery of the upgrades to the pier 
and provision of a new river bus link.  
6.19 Adverse impacts to air quality from emissions to air from vessels on the River Thames is a health 
and environmental priority issue.  Further information, including targets and actions, is set out in 
Port of London Authority’s Air Quality Strategy.  
6.20 Additional Thames crossings are supported in principle, subject to no significant adverse impacts, 
such as increased traffic flows or worsening air quality along the borough’s roads.  
6.21 The Council will work with TfL, Network Rail and train operators to protect and improve public 
transport interchanges.  Area schemes that focus on interchange nodes will be progressed as part 
of the LIP .  
6.22 North -south links within the borough have long been a concern.  The Council continue s to work 
through its LIP programmes and with TfL to secure solutions.  TfL have proposals for upgrading bus feeder services to Abbey Wood for the opening of the Elizabeth line.   
6.23 Many businesses in the borough rely on effective logistics  and need routes available to them that 
are not congested or unreliable.  Freight wharves on the Thames are safeguarded for that use and 
their access routes protected .  Rail routes through Bexley remain important corridors for freight. 
The Council will work with TfL to identify ways to make freight movement in the borough more sustainable, particularly for local deliveries.  
6.24 Key points along STDR are already operating at or beyond capacity, including the Queens Road 
roundabout at Erith and the single carriageway section of Thames Road.  Delays along the route 
are already of concern to businesses along the corridor.  The Local Plan therefore expects targeted 
interventions to deal with excess congestion will be necessary along STDR in particular, to ensure a 
suitable ‘level of service’ is maintained.   
6.25 Air quality monitoring will be through Bexley’s Air Quality Annual Status Report, which provides a 
detailed overview of air quality in the borough.  Monitoring stations across the borough are 
located mainly at roadside.  
6.26 Where larger development is to be phased, parking layouts should be designed flexibly, with less 
private on- plot parking, so that parking areas can be re- used or redeveloped as other means of 
travel are improved and the need for car parking reduces. This will enable later phases to be brou ght forward so that they reflect and support the newer travel alternatives.

6.27 The London Plan stresses the need to work collaboratively with strategic partners to achieve good 
transport connectivity  and Policy T3 Transport capacity, connectivity and safeguarding sets out 
expectations for Development Plans , with T able 10.1 sett ing out the indicative of transport 
schemes.   Part B of the policy  requires the safeguarding of  both the existing transport asset base 
and the land and other requirements for future transport infrastructure requirements.  Part C Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
92 expects relevant schemes in T able 10.1  to be safeguarded .  Part D includes the need to give 
particular priority to securing and supporting delivery of eastern extension of the Elizabeth line.  
6.28 Policy SP11  sets out Bexley’s approach to these requirements, taking into account identified 
transport needs in the Bexley Growth Strategy and in the Bexley Local Implementation Plan (L IP).  
New development  identified  in the Local Plan will increasingly need to be supported by new 
transport interventions across the P lan period, as well as by existing transport assets in the 
borough.  Emphasis will be placed on public transport provision, on walking and cycling, and on 
other transport schemes that are required to deliver the Local Plan’s objectives.  
SP11  Safeguarding land for transport schemes  
1. The Council will support development proposals that complement and do not frustrate delivery, operation or 
retention of existing and future transport infrastructure.  
2. Unless existing transport infrastructure is agreed as surplus to requirements by the relevant strategic authority, 
operator or owner, development proposals should not prejudice its continued role, operation or effective, 
beneficial use.  Where this is unavoidable, development proposals should include feasible means of replacing 
the affected transport infrastructure with alternatives of at least the same quality, funded through developer 
contributions.  This applies to transport infrastructure used for:  
a) walking;  
b) cycling;  
c) public transport services;  
d) traffic on the public highway; and  
e) piers/wharves (and access to them) to enable movement of people and goods on the River Thames.  
3. Developme nt proposals should support the plans to secure investment in, deliver and operate the following key 
transport infrastructure:  
a) an extension of the Docklands Light Rail to Belvedere via Thamesmead;  
b) Bus Transit route corridor priority measures and related in terventions;  
c) targeted traffic capacity increases on the South Thames Development Route (A206/A2016);  
d) a crossing of the River Thames between Belvedere and Rainham (likely to be beyond the Plan period);  
e) an upgrading of Erith Pier to accommodate riverbus serv ices; and  
f) a cycling/walking crossing of the River Darent north of the A206 Bob Dunn Way.  
Development proposals will not be accepted that prejudice the successful planning and delivery of these 
schemes , illustrated on Figure 9. 
4. Land is safeguarded for the following strategic transport infrastructure schemes: 
a) Eastern extension of Crossrail services from Abbey Wood towards Ebbsfleet (C2E), in accordance with 
the relevant Safeguarding Direction(s) by the Secretary of State for Transport; and,  
b) A206 Thames Road dualling between Bob Dunn Way and Crayford Way, including widening Cray Mill 
Bridge and enlarging the Thames R oad/Crayford Way roundabout, as illustrated on the  submission 
policies map . 
Policy implementation  
6.29 The Local Plan Transport Assessment ( LPTA ) includes a schedule of existing transport assets and 
infrastructure in the borough that should be protected from adverse impacts of development unless  it is genuinely surplus to requirements.  The onus will be on development proposals to 
identify the status of existing transport assets that may be affected by the development and to determine how to avoid or, where necessary, mitigate any negative impacts.   The Council will work Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
93 with TfL and developers to ensure that future delivery of the identified transport schemes will not 
be compromised by any development proposals.

The London Plan 2021 – Policy T 1(A)

Local Plan Transport Assessment (LPTA)  
6.30 London Plan policy T1(A) places emphasis on the Mayor’s strategic target of 80% of all trips in London by foot, cycle or public transport by 2041.  Policy T1(B) looks to all development to make the most effective use of land (given that is achieved, amongst other things, through greater roles for public transport, walking and cycling) and protection of London’s transport networks and supporting infrastructure.  The indicative list of transport schemes in T able 10.1 places its emp hasis on active travel and public transport -based travel solutions.  
6.31 The Growth Strategy stresse s the need for greater use of public transport, walking and cycling, 
especially at neighbourhood and local levels, from new developments.  Encouraging walking and cycling at neighbourhood level should especially be addressed through development design.  Cycling and public transport use for local journeys beyond the immediate neighbourhood requires development layouts that positively point to use of those modes of travel.  
6.32 Bexley’s LIP has taken forward the Mayor’s strategic mode share target and how different solutions will work towards delivery of local targets.  The LIP places emphasis on public transport -
based solutions, as well as promoting and seeking better provision for walking and cycling.   
6.33 The LIP also points to the importance of smarter travel options, which are becoming more relevant and accessible to many people.  More electric vehicle (EV) charging points support transfer to less environmentally damagin g vehicles, preparing the way for the government’s planned ban on petrol 
and diesel vehicles; this was to be from 2040, but has been brought forward to 2035, with potential proposals for the ban to be brought even earlier to 2030.   
6.34 T echnical development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is advancing.  Car manufacturers and other providers are developing mobile apps for Mobility- as-a-Service, which will enable people 
to ‘rent’ mobility by a blended range of travel choices.  Local Demand Responsive Transit networks are taking off around the country, providing a shared taxi -style of operation that operates purely 
on demand.  Photo- voltaic road surfaces are being developed that can generate electricity and 
charge EVs on the move.  
6.35 These policy and technology developments place an increasing emphasis on more sustainable travel solutions.  Other lifestyle options are moving people towards more home- based working and 
home shopping, which reduces the need to travel at all.  Factors such as these are beyond the direct 
control of the Local Plan.  However, these are all aspects that need to be considered in development proposals to ensure a greater emphasis on the importance of more sustainable access and connectivity.  
DP22  Sustainable transport  
1. The Council will expect to see measures in development proposals that facilitate and promote walking, cycling, 
public transport and shared mobility.  In particular, major development proposals should incorporate where 
appropriate the below points at an ear ly design or pre- application stage:  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
94 DP22  Sustainable transport  
Walking  
a) identify and implement accessible, safe and convenient direct walking routes to town centres, transport 
nodes and other key destinations;  
b) promote and improve pedestrian wayfinding;  
c) provide for the undertaking of audits to ensure that the existing pedestrian infrastructure is suitable for 
its proposed use and that new development improves pedestrian amenity;  
d) encourage a higher quality pedestrian and street environment for all users through the promotion of 
healthy streets and integrated communities;  
e) ensure residential streets encourage children to play out;  
Cycling  
f) provide secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities in line with the standards 
set out in the London Plan, as  a minimum;  
g) provide on -site changing facilities, including lockers and showers for cyclists, where appropriate;  
h) contribute positively to an integrated cycling network for London by providing infrastructure that is 
safe, comfortable, attractive, coherent, d irect and adaptable;  
i) provide links to existing and planned cycle infrastructure projects including the Council’s strategic 
quietways network;  
Public transport network  
j) allocate road space and provide high level of priority on existing or proposed routes;  
k) ensure good access to and within areas served by networks;  
l) ensure that all parts of the network can be used safely, easily and with dignity by all;  
m) ensure direct, secure, accessible and pleasant walking routes to stops;  
n) ensure standing, garaging an d drivers’ facilities are provided where needed;  
o) improve interchange between different modes of transport;  
Shared mobility (smarter travel)  
p) provide electric vehicle charging infrastructure in line with London Plan minimum standards, to be made 
publicly a vailable where possible;  
q) provide spaces for car clubs/pool cars, to be made publicly available where possible; and  
r) ensure compatibility with recognised providers of both services.  
Policy implementation  
6.36 Development proposals have a key role to play in shaping how users of that development choose to 
travel.  Developers should demonstrate that use of more sustainable means of travel has been 
considered throughout the design process and proper provision made – whether on- site as part of 
the development or off -site to either reinforce that use or to mitigate negative impacts from the 
development.  
6.37 Account should be taken of the applicable requirements  for each relevant travel mode,  recognising 
that some can apply equally to walking and cycling.  Design standards are set out in T fL ’s suite of 
design documents .  Further details and information are set out in Bexley’s Highway Authority 
Developer Guidance and will be included in the Desi gn Guide SPD .  The result should be that, 
where there is a need to travel at all, the development will naturally point people towards using the more sustainable modes.  The result should be better connectivity with facilities, goods and Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
95 services in a way that helps the borough to achieve the benefits of achieving its travel mode 
objectives.   A statement to show how these points have been addressed should be supplied at pre-
application stage for discussion with the Council.  Where a transport assessment or t ransport 
statement is required in support of a planning application, that statement should be included.   
6.38 Both active and passive provision for electric vehicle parking will be required in line with the 
standards in the London Plan and details agreed in ac cordance with Council guidance.  In larger 
schemes these should be evenly distributed throughout the development.  Mixed use town centre development will provide secure off -street space where possible as part of the development and 
on- street spaces as part  of public realm improvements.  
6.39 The Council will support the bringing forward of car clubs and car sharing schemes in connection with new developments.  Car clubs have the potential to reduce congestion and parking pressure, 
particularly where parking provision in new developments has been set materially lower than the 
maximum standard .

Local Implementation Plan (LIP)  
Local Plan Transport Assessment  (LPTA)  
Bexley Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
Local Plan Parking Standards and the Delivery of Family Housing Technical Paper  
6.40 The London Plan sets out maximum parking standards to encourage the uptake of sustainable modes of transport and manage impacts of development  on the road network.  However, the 
London Plan also allows for higher provision in outer London boroughs and in areas that have lower public transport access levels (PTALs) w here there is clear evidence that it supports 
additional family housing to meet identified local need . 
6.41 This is consistent with the Government’s position, which acknowledges the need to meet housing 
need whilst avoiding the adverse impacts of increasing on street parking stress.  The Bexley  SHMA 
identifies family housing as being the type most needed to be delivered in the borough, across all tenures (market, low -cost/affordable rent and intermediate housing products).  
6.42 A flexible approach is supported by the NPPF, which states that local authorities should take into 
account a number of considerations when setting local parking standards.  This should include local car ownership levels and the availability of public transport.  
6.43 In line with both NPPF and London Plan guidance, the Council has taken into consideration 
characteristics of developments and the actual level of access to public transport and services and facilities when deciding whether to apply a more flexible approach to parking.  
6.44 The Council has considered higher levels of residential parking for family housing in areas that 
have a lower level of public transport access to address specific on- street parking issues such as 
overspill and inappropriate parking, which may affect safety, amenity, accessibi lity, and congestion  
as well as the effective roll out of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles .  The Council also 
wishes to prevent the creation of any traffic flow, safety and amenity issues through the impacts of new development.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
96 6.45 Some areas with in the borough are less connected by public transport.  Even where public 
transport access levels (PTALs) are higher, there are still some challenges to sufficiently cater for 
people’s travel needs .  The dispersed pattern of travel can mean that dependence on the car 
remains high.  This suggests that there is still a role for the car in Bexley, even as the Council looks 
to increase walking, cycling and public transport use in the borough.  
6.46 The London Plan has set specific and highly ambitious maximum parking  standards for outer 
London Opportunity Areas.  However, the spatial approach to sustainable development set out in 
policy SP1 does not apply a blanket approach to growth in these areas.  Parts of the Bexley 
Riverside OA in particular have poor connectivit y, including access to shops, services and facilities.  
These areas are unlikely to change during the Plan period without significant interventions and there are no fixed London Plan commitments for these.  However, if new public transport 
commitments were secured for Bexley , for example through the development of a planning 
framework for the OA , then the local policy position will need to be re viewed . 
DP23  Parking management  
1. In applying the principles of sustainable development in line with Policy SP1, the Council will seek to balance 
the need for parking and the environmental, economic and social impacts of traffic movement and parked 
vehicles.  Therefore, proposals for resid ential development will be expected to provide parking within the 
lowest applicable maximum London Plan standards except:  
a) areas  with a PTAL of 2 that  are more than 5 minutes ’ walking distance from a railway station and  town 
centre (see Figure 11 ) where 3 or more bedroom dwellings will have a maximum standard of 1.25 
spaces; and  
b) within the Bexley Riverside Opportunity Area where, except for development s covered by 1a) above, 
maximum residential parking standards will be the London Plan outer London standards rather than the 
Opportunity Area standards for outer London.  
2. Parking provision materially below London Plan maximum standards may be acceptable i n areas that have a 
PTAL of 3 –  4, for residential development sites that are:  
a) outside of a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) or Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ), where it can be 
demonstrated through a parking survey that there is sufficient on- street, off -site parking capacity 
within 200 metres of the development boundary; or  
b) inside an existing or planned CPZ or RPZ, in which case the applicant will normally be required to enter 
into a legal agreement to restrict future occupiers from obtaining on- stree t parking permits.  
3. For residential developments of fewer than 10 units, where the spaces per dwelling calculation results in a 
fraction of a space, provision will be rounded up to the nearest whole space.  
4. For specialist housing for older people, the stan dards should be:  
a) a maximum of 1 car space for every 6 residents (for visitors);  
b) a minimum of 1 car space for every 2 staff full time equivalents (FTE) for non-  resident staff and visiting 
health care workers.  Further spaces may be required to support addi tional demand, to be determined 
through a transport statement or assessment.  
5. Parking for industrial development should be provided in line with projected need, calculated via a transport 
assessment once applicants have demonstrated they have minimised parking requirements through a delivery 
and servicing plan, parking management plan and travel plan.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

6.47 This policy has been informed by and compliments policy SP1 and the spatial strategy.  The 
methodology for determining the borough’s sustainable development locations, set out in policy 
SP1, takes into consideration the projected increase in connectivity, including access to shops, services and facilities within the borough’s town centres.   
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
98 6.48 Developments must provide a level of parking that does not significantly impact on residential 
amenity, safety, vehicle, cycle or pedestrian flow or access and is appropriately maintained, managed and enforced to achieve these outcomes.  This may include mitigating the loss of existing parking where necessary.  
6.49 For residential development proposals of one or more (net) new units, the Council may seek a level of parking within the maximum standard, informed by a transport assessment or statement.   
6.50 A transport assessment or statement will likely be required from all development proposals to determine the appropriate level of parking.  For developments where transport assessments are required, developers will be expected to assess parking provision within the transport assessment, which should demonstrate that demand has been minimised.  Designated blue badge parking should be provided in line with the standards in the London Plan for all development types.  
6.51 Parking brought forward in connection with major development proposals will need to be accompanied by a car parking design and management plan, which will allow the flexible management of parking pr ovision.  The policy ensures that parking standards are locally 
appropriate, and that provision supports additional family housing, identified in the Bexley SHMA as the main type of housing needed in the borough.  Family housing is defined as housing with a minimum of three bedrooms.  
6.52 The Council may seek a level within the maximum standards on a case-by -case basis, depending on 
the scale of the development and local factors including parking stress and general highway conditions.  Where a masterplan proces s has been undertaken, the higher maximum standards set 
out in part 1 a) and b) may not apply, as informed by the accompanying transport assessment.  
6.53 Where required by the Highway Authority, all development proposals will need to demonstrate through a parki ng survey that sufficient on -street capacity will be able to accommodate 
comfortably any overspill parking from the development.  Surveys will need to include all publicly available parking areas normally within 200 metres of the site.  The scope of parking surveys must be agreed in advance with the Council.  In order to encourage low car ownership and protect the amenity of residents a legal agreement may be required to restrict future occupiers from obtaining parking permits in a CPZ or RPZ.   
6.54 Introducing  new or expanding existing CPZ/RPZs creates a financial burden to existing residents 
and to the Council that must enforce the restrictions.  In addition, existing residents may also be affected by other impacts of the new developments in their area.  Howev er, in some cases an 
extension to an existing CPZ/RPZ may be appropriate, subject to local support.  Where a development is proposed on the edge of an existing CPZ/RPZ and it is assessed that this will have an adverse impact to on-street parking in the area, then the Council may consider whether an 
extension to the existing CPZ could be justified, at the developer’s expense.  
6.55 New specialist housing for older people includes sheltered accommodation (C3), extra care accommodation (C3) and residential/nursing care homes (C2) and each may have slightly different parking needs for residents and visiting healthcare workers.  The London Plan has further detail in policy H13.  In addition to car parking, consideration should be given to the safe storage of and chargi ng point locations for mobility scooters when designing retirement/sheltered housing 
developments, and the safe storage of cycles/motorcycles across developments in general.  Waiting and turning space should be available for ambulances, dial -a-ride vehicle s etc.   
6.56 Developers should mark- out an appropriate proportion of spaces at non- residential developments 
for motorcycle parking, in line with the predicted usage as agreed through the transport assessment or parking management plan. Bexley Draft Local Plan

6.57 The NPPF aims to encourage the development of sustainable transport polices that support the 
reduction of emissions from greenhouse gases as well as reduce congestion.  The guidance requires that local authorities do all that they can to ensure that opportunities to move goods and people using sustainable transport are maximised.   
6.58 This policy approach embraces the concept that development proposals must not have a severe impact on transport network operation and efficiency, as set out in the NPPF.  It is also important that developers consider transport impacts on loca l amenity.  
DP24  Impact of development on the transport network  
1. Proposals that reduce the need to travel and improve access to sustainable modes of transport will be 
supported.  
2. Proposals should not have a significant negative effect on the safety of any users, including vulnerable users of 
the transport network such as pedestrians and cyclists.  Proposals should identify, minimise and mitigate 
potential negative impacts.  
3. Proposals should not have a significant negative impact on the operation or efficien cy of the local road network, 
the Transport for London Road Network or Highways England’s Strategic Road Network, the public transport 
system or local amenity.   Proposals should identify, minimise and mitigate potential negative impacts.  
4. Development propo sals should not result in:  
a) unsuitable use of any road that is prejudicial to its function in the road hierarchy as set out in Ta b l e  1 1  
and identified  on the submission policies map , or a street according to its position in the movement and 
place matrix of street types, as set out in the Local Implementation Plan,  illustrated by Figure 12 , and 
taking into account the function of adjacent streets; or  
b) severe cumulative adverse impacts on the operation of roads or streets in the area.

6.59 All development  proposals likely to generate significant amounts of movement should be 
supported by a transport assessment or transport statement and a travel plan.  Ultimately, these 
measures will ensure that the impacts of development are appropriately managed and the 
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
101  opportuniti es to reduce travel demand and increase access to sustainable transport modes have 
been taken up as far as practicable and to reduce the need for major transport infrastructure.  
6.60 Assessments supporting development proposals should take into consideration the potential 
impacts of both the proposal itself and the potential cumulative impacts of wider development set 
out in the Local Plan.   
6.61 Transport statements, which have a less extensive scope than full transport assessments can be 
produced for smaller developments that are also likely to have a material impact upon the 
surrounding transport network.  
6.62 There will be instances where applicants will need to mitigate issues that are directly attributable 
to their proposal, such as access to public transport, highway safety or capacity.  This could include 
off-site highway improvements to pedestrian and cycle routes to enable access to a local station 
for example.  By doing so an otherwise unacceptable proposal may be made acceptable.   
6.63 Where measures are required  to address impacts upon highway safety, network efficiency, or 
amenity (including measures to reduce travel demand, improve access to sustainable modes and 
monitor outcomes), the Council will expect that the measures be secured either by condition or 
that the applicant enter into a legal agreement regarding their provision.  
6.64 Developers should identify the impacts of development on the transport network and associated 
mitigation measures through transport assessments.  This could include, for example, facili ties to 
assist vulnerable road users, such as crossings, cycle ways and footpaths.  Transport assessments should include a construction management and logistics plan, a delivery and servicing plan and a 
travel plan.  
6.65 The purpose of travel plans, delivery and servicing plans, and outline construction logistics plans, is  
to encourage more efficient use of the transport system and reduce private vehicle use .  Safety is 
also a factor, particularly in respect of construction vehicles, and construction management and 
logistics plans will be expected to be prepared to the construction logistics and community safety (CLOCS) standards.   
6.66 This is achieved through the identification and implementation of various measures such as car 
sharing or the scheduling of deliveries outside of peak traffic times.  Or, during construction, 
consideration should be given to sustainable transport modes, such as waterborne transport via 
the borough’s safeguarded wharves, for handling construction, demolition and excavation waste.  
Such measures can make a significant and cost -effective contribution to mitigating development 
impacts on the transport network.  Further guidance is available from TfL . 
6.67 The Council will support development proposals that are phased in line with the provision of enabling transport infrastructure or services.  The Council encourages developers to engage in pre-
application discussions on transport matters at the earliest possible stage.  This will help to achieve 
right first -time applications, reducing the risk of  abortive work and associated costs and delays.  
6.68 The movement and place matrix of street types is used to establish design principles that influence 
the use and management of the highway network, particularly in connection with development 
proposals.  The list of street types has been developed from the Mayor’s Transport Strategy and 
Bexley’s Local Implementation Plan.  All nine types identified in the key occur in the borough, although some only in very few places.  The movement and place matrix of street types is set out in 
Figure 12 . Bexley Draft Local Plan

Southeast London Joint Waste Technical Paper  
Bexley Reduction and Recycling Plan  
6.71 Waste Planning Authorities such as Bexley have a key role to play in the management of waste, set 
out in the National Planning Policy for Waste (NPPW).  As a London borough, Bexley also has waste requirements set out in the London Plan.   
6.72 The Council is committed to pro moting a more circular economy  by:  
• encouraging waste mini misation , including support for repair and reuse facilities  
•  increasing the efficiency of waste sorting and recycling operations ; and   
• supporting  recovery of energy from waste  and diverting it from landfill. 
6.73 The construction industry also has an important role to play in the circular economy.  The construction and operation of the built environment currently accounts for 60% of UK materials consumption and one third of all waste arisings.  For measurable and achievable waste prevention 
targets to be set, waste generation should be decoupled from economic growth, which is a challenging task.  
SP12  Sustainable waste management  
1. In new development, the Council will ensure that waste is managed in ways that protect human health and the 
environment and will follow the principles of the circular economy by applying the waste hierarchy (see Figure 
13).  Where opportunities arise, this principle will also be applied to existing development, for example for flats 
above shops where it can be challenging to segregate waste.  
2. The Council will support sustainable waste management by:  
a) Implementing the waste hierarchy in its approach to future waste management;  
b) meeting its waste apportionments and other requirements, such as the Mayor’s recycling or composting 
targets, including collaborating with  and supporting other London boroughs as appropriate;  
c) safeguarding strategic waste management sites for waste uses  as shown on the submission policies 
map ; 
d) supporting regionally significant waste management infrastructure, including the Crossness Sewage 
Treatment Works; and,  
e) considering the use of planning contributions, including from the borough’s community infrastructure 
levy, to provide better waste management for existing development.  
3. The Council will support the development of the circular economy by encouraging the waste and construction 
industries to:  
a) make resource use more efficient;  
b) reduce the production of waste;  
c) max imise the recycling of waste; and  
d) identify alternative business models.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

74 The waste hierarchy ( Figure 13) provides a framework for how waste management can be made 
more sustainable by following circular economy principles.  The aim is to move up the waste 
hierarchy by moving away from a reliance on disposal to increased recovery, recycling, composting, 
reuse, reduction and ultimately to rethinking products and design so that waste is prevented.   
T argets for recycling and composting have been set in the Council’s waste management strategy, in 
line with national and regional guidance, and local circumstances and these will be reviewed as 
appropriate.  The waste hierarchy and waste apportionment targets are set out in the London Plan.

except for landfill, which the borough is moving towards a zero -waste to landfill target.   
6.76 Safeguard ed strategic sites suitable for waste management uses are des ignated in partnership 
with the Southeast London Joint Waste Planning Group (London Boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Lewisham, Southwark, Royal Borough of Greenwich, and the City of London) in order to meet , 
across the subregion, pooled waste apportionment targets set by the Mayor of London in the 
London Plan.  These sites are set out in the Southeast London Joint Waste Planning T echnical 
Paper (a shared evidence base that is kept up -to-date when each partner borough submits a local 
plan) and designated on the submission policies map . 
6.77 Waste management capacity in the borough exceeds the apportionment assigned to Bexley in the 
London Plan.  Because of this, Bexley has formally accepted responsibility for meeting the waste management capacity for London Plan waste apportionment requirements identified for the City  
of London and Westminster.  Therefore, Bexley brings a higher apportionment requirement into its collaborative working with the other southeast London waste planning authorities.    
6.78 In addition, t he Council may enter into joint waste planning arrangements with other London 
boroughs, as appropriate,  to make the most efficient use of any surplus capacity after London Plan 
apportionments have been applied.   This can happ en unilaterally or in partnership with the 
Southeast London Joint Waste Planning Group.

Southeast London Joint Waste Technical Paper  
Bexley Reduction and Recycling Plan  
6.79 Bexley has one of the highest numbers of permitted waste sites in London.  There is currently a 
range of waste management facilities in the borough, licensed to store and process various waste 
streams , and it is considered that a mix of options is generally needed to arrive at the most 
balanced environmental, social and economic solution for sustainable waste management .  The 
borough’s strategic waste management facilities have therefore been safeguarded for this purpose 
and are identified on the submission  policies map .   
6.80 However, there are some facilities that  are not suitably located and there can also  be issues with 
poor environmental standards that can cause multi -agency issues.  There is therefore is a clear 
need for local policies to address any of this issues that are pl anning matters.  
DP25  New waste management facilities and extensions and alterations to 
existing facilities  
1. Development proposals for new waste management facilities, or for extensions and alterations to existing 
facilities, must demonstrate that they will contribute to the Council’s strategic approach of moving waste up the 
waste hierarchy (see Figure 13) and that the type of facility proposed is needed in the local area in line with the 
proximity principle and the self -sufficiency principle.  
2. Designat ed strategic industrial locations (SIL) are appropriate locations for new waste management facilities, 
however  consideration will be given to adjacent businesses within SIL and nearby land uses such as for 
residential or nature conservation, using the Agent of Change principle.  A sequential approach to locating new 
waste facilities should be applied and  locations chosen only were there are no significant adverse impacts. and a 
preference given to parts of SIL that have the least detrimental impact on other  businesses or land uses.  
3. Development proposals will be assessed using locally specific criteria, having regard to the requirements of UK 
legislation, the Government’s policies on waste and the Mayor’s London Plan, including impacts of the proposal 
on the local environment and residential amenity.  
4. All new waste facilities with the potential to have a negative impact on amenity of surrounding areas should be 
fully enclosed on all sides and have a roof and fast -acting doors or provide equival ent environmental protection.  
5. Proposals for new facilities, extensions and alterations should be well designed and contribute positively to 
local character.   
Policy implementation  
6.81 Given the significant amount of surplus waste capacity in Bexley, applicants proposing new waste facilities in the borough must demonstrate that they are necessary to be located in Bexley (e.g. that 
they meet the proximity principle and self -sufficiency principle) and that the envisaged facility will 
not undermine the waste planning strategy through prejudicing movement up the waste hierarchy.  
6.82 Criteria for considering the potential impact of the development proposal for a new facility, an extension or alteration are set out in the National Planning Policy for Waste and the London Plan.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
105  The Council has applied  these to its designated SIL to determine the best locations within SIL for 
new waste management facilities.   Therefore, proposals for development of new waste 
management facilities will be assessed to determine that they are in an appropriate location.  
6.83 Waste management facilities have the potential to pollute the environment through emissions to 
air, releases to ground and surface water and leaving a legacy of contaminated land.  Development 
proposals, including extensions t o existing facilities, should be for fully enclosed facilities.  Impacts 
will be assessed against local criteria including: amenity considerations, traffic movements and the 
existence of protective designations such as nature conservation, and protection of water 
resources.   The Design Guide SPD will set out detailed principles for the design of waste facilities.

6.84 In order to facilitate recycling, to meet London Plan waste management targets, while protecting visual and residential amenity and public health, proposals for residential development should 
include detailed consideration of waste arising from the occupation of the development including consideration of how waste will be stored, collected and managed.   It is equally important that

DP26  Waste management in new development  
1. All proposals for major development (defined in the Glossary) should promote circular economy outcomes and 
aim to be net zero -waste.  Applications should include a circular economy statement in accordance with London

a) there is adequate space within each flat/apartment for the temporary storage of waste generated by 
that flat/apartment allowing for the separate storage of recyclable materials;  
b) there is adequate communal storage for waste, including separate recyclables, pending its collection;  
c) storage and collection systems (e.g. dedicated rooms, storage areas and chutes or underground waste

85 The London Plan sets requirements for waste management in all types of development.  Circular 
economy principles should be incorporated into the design of developments, in order to extend the 
useful life of buildings and allow for materials to be reused or  recycled.  
6.86 Appropriate types of storage and collection systems for waste will depend on the type of 
residential development proposed.   Other residential development includes HMOs, live/work 
accommodation and residential institutions, including specialist housing for older people, and 
student accommodation.  
6.87 Local guidance will be set out in the Design Guide SPD and developers and applicants are expected 
to liaise with the Council’s waste services team where there are any difficulties with layouts  of

sterilisation.  Minerals are sterilised when their future extraction is prevented through non-
minerals development.  The NPPF states that Minerals Planning Authorities (MPAs) , including 
Bexley, should designate mineral safeguarding areas (MSA) on their submission policies map . 
6.89 London imports most of the aggregates used for construction in the capital; it is therefore vital that sites involved in the transport and handling of aggregates are also safeguarded.

1. Land designated as aggregates sites  and facilities  on the submission policies map  will be safeguarded for its 
existing use for transporta tion, distribution, processing and/or production of aggregates and minerals, unless it

90 An MSA has been designated on the submission policies map .  This is an area where the presence of 
mineral reserves (predominantly sand and gravel) has been indicated by British Geological Survey 
mapping, and where there is potential for mineral extraction.  For practical reasons, urban areas 
have been excluded from the MSA.  However, the Council would be supportive of any viable 
opportuniti es for extraction of minerals prior to development in these areas.  
6.91 Designating an MSA does not, in and of itself, preclude non- minerals development from being 
permitted in these areas, nor does it create a presumption that the mineral will be worked or 
indicate predetermined support for grant of consent for minerals development.  An MSA does 
however act as a flag that minerals may be sterilised by non- minerals development and that this 
should be taken into account in the planning process.

1. Where development is proposed on contaminated land or potentially contaminated land, a desktop  study and 
site investigation, including appropriate proposals for remediation will need to be carried out where required.  
2. Development proposals for hazardous installations and development proposals within the relevant 
consultation zones for existing hazardous installations must consult with the Health and Safety Executive 
(HSE).  
Policy implementation  
6.93 Bexley has a long history of industrial and other development and land contamination is one of the 
legacies of this.  Therefore, the Council will require applicants to survey sites that are known or 
suspected to be contaminated to determine the source of any pollutants and any remedial 
measures necessary to prevent these causing hazards either during construction or through 
subsequent use of the site.  Desk study and site investigation should be carried out in line with 
current guidance.   The Council may require applicants to enter into an appropriate condition/legal 
agreement to ensure that the necessary remedial measures are made.  
6.94 The Health and Safet y Executive ( HSE ) sets a consultation distance around every site with 
hazardous substances consent and notifies the relevant local planning authorities.  Whenever a hazardous waste development is proposed within any consultation distance, the applicant should 
consult the HSE for its advice on locating the development  there.  
6.95 In addition, there are installations in the borough, such as gasometers and associated pipelines, 
where there is a requirement to notify the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) if a development

National Policy Statement for Wastewater  
London Plan Policy SI 5 Water infrastructure  
6.96 Crossness Sewage Treatment Works (CSTW) is Thames Water’s second largest sewage treatment 
works and is located in Thamesmead.  CSTW is regionally strategic infrastructure, serving not only 
Bexley but surrounding areas .  Therefore, the level of future capacity will also depend in growth in 
these areas.  CSTW drains 10% of Bexley’s sewerage, the remaining 90% drains to Long Reach STW 
in Dartford.  
6.97 It is likely that C STW will  need to be upgraded or extended to provide the increase in treatment 
capacity required to service new development.  Water and sewerage infrastructure development 
may therefore be necessary in flood risk areas.  
6.98 Increased amounts of development can lead to reduced water quality through pollution of ground 
or surface water, including pollution to underground water resources.  Poor water quality can have a range of environmental impacts including impacting on the borough’s wildlife.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
109  6.99 Bexley is bordered by the Halfway and Erith reaches of the Thames Estuary to the north.  This is 
the most significant waterway in the catchment.  The large London sewage treatment works of 
Crossness (in Bexley) and Beckton (on the northside of the Thames in Newham) are the main 
factors that influence of water quality in these reaches, where dissolved oxygen levels can be a 
problem in the summer.  Significant improvements to these works over the next 10 years are 
expected to improve estuarine water quality in the Thames.  Other surface water bodies in the 
borough consist of artificial dikes  draining Thamesmead and the River Cray to the east.  
6.100 The Environment Agency routinely monitors the chemical and biological quality of the Rivers Cray 
and Darent and their tributaries, classifying the ecological quality of the rivers to be poor to 
moderate and the chemical quality of the river to be good in 2016.  
6.101 There are two classified rivers in Bexley : the River Shuttle and the River Cray.  The classifications of 
the rivers are based on the Thames River Basin Management Plan.  The River Shuttle has been classified as poor ecological status, and the River Cray has been classified as moderate ecological 
status.  These need to achieve good ecological potential.  A programme of measures to improve the 
status is being developed by the Environment Agency.  The key issues include: 
• point source pollution from water industry sewage works; 
• physical modification of water bodies;  
• abstraction;  
• diffuse pollution from urban sources.  
6.102 As climate change continues to influence our water supplies via summer droughts and increased winter rainfall, and in the face of a large housing growth agenda, it is critical that local authorities 
implement water conservation measures through their Local Plans.  
SP13  Protecting  and enhancing water supply and wastewater infrastructure  
1. The Council will:  
a) work with Thames Water in relation to local wastewater infrastructure requirements and support 
wastewater treatment infrastructure investment to accommodate London’s growth and climate change 
impacts;  
b) promote improvements to water supply infrastructure, particularly within the defined sustainable 
development locations, to contribute to security of supply in a timely, efficient and sustainable manner 
taking energy consumption into account;  
c) promote the protection and improvement of the water environment in line with the Thames River Basin 
Management Plan, taking account of catchment plans ; 
Crossness Sewage Treatment Works (CSTW)  
d) support the protection of CSTW , as a key infrastruct ure asset, from the risks of flooding;  
e) promote public access to the Thames Path through the CSTW and the conservation and enhancement 
of the Crossness Beam Engine House, including the site and buildings within its curtilage, and seek to 
affect these by mea ns of planning obligations in the event of substantial planning permissions being 
contemplated in the vicinity.

6.105 There are many things that can affect the quality of our water supply.  Sewers, for example, that 
have been incorrectly connected to the network, or not connected at all, can allow untreated 
wastewater to discharge into rivers .  Road and rail represent the predominant modes of transport 
within Bexley  and  both modes have the potential to contaminate both land and groundwater. 
Potential leakages, spillages of fuel oils, particulate emissions from vehicle engines and tyre dust 
generated may form a residue on road surfaces, which may be transferred to land and groundwater 
via surface water run -off.  In addition, potential spillage and leakage of diesel from passenger and 
freig ht trains, as well as brake dust generated, can also transfer to pollutants to watercourses and 
groundwater via surface run- off.  Pollutants f rom  industrial land can also run -off into rivers and 
watercourses.  
6.106 The potential for climate change to result in more intense rainfall during the summer months and a 
wetter winter season in the UK is likely to affect the borough’s water quality.  Currently, water 
quality in London’s rivers is assessed as ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ with only a small number of water bodies c lassed as ‘good .’   Surface water run off can cause sewer overflow to the detriment of water 
quality in the Thames and its tributaries.   The potential for rainwater to carry hydrocarbons, 
metals, dust, litter and organic materials into watercourses as it wa shes the urban streets and 
buildings poses a threat to the water quality at local watercourses.

developments.  Developers are encouraged to contact the water/ wastewater  company as early as possible to 
discuss their development proposals and intended delivery programme to assist with identifying any potent ial 
water and wastewater network reinforcement requirements.  Where there is a capacity constraint the Council

Development within the vicinity of Crossness Sewage Treatment Works  
5. When considering sensitive development, such as residential uses, close to the Sewage Treatment Works, a 
technical assessment should be undertaken in consultation with Thames Water.  The technical assessment 
should confirm that:

b) the development can be conditioned and mitigated to ensure that any potential for adverse amenity 
impact is avoided.  
Policy implementation  
Water quality  
6.107 There is increasing concern for the protection of the water environment, which not only serves as a 
source of water but provides essential habitats and a valued resource for leisure and recreation.  
New development must ensure that there are no direct or indirect adverse effects on the qual ity of 
water supplies, and it will not be permitted unless measures are included which would overcome any threat, to the satisfaction of the Council, in consultation with the Environment Agency (or 
equivalent) and other appropriate authorities.  
6.108 Measures to avoid polluting the borough’s waterways including groundwater resources will need 
to be included within a scheme where appropriate.  Methods to avoid polluted runoff, for example from petrol chemicals and salts into waterways, need to be considered in pla nning applications 
adjacent to waterways, along with the use of SUDs.  
Water supply and wastewater/sewage infrastructure  
6.109 Development should improve water quality, addressing issues such as wrong connections and 
removing pinch- points that can contribute to poor water quality and localised flooding.  
6.110 The development or expansion of water supply or wastewater  facilities will normally be permitted, 
either where needed to serve existing or proposed development in accordance with the provisions of the Development Plan, or in the interests of long term water supply and waste water 
management, provided that the need for such facilities outweighs any adverse land use or 
environmental impact that any such adverse impact is minimised.  
Development within the vicinity of CSTW 
6.111 Development in the vicinity of Crossness STW will be expected to undertake an odour, noise and 
vibration impact assessment, where required, and respond with appropriate mitigation as 
necessary.  
6.112 Where development is being proposed within 800m of a sewage treatment works, the developer 
should liaise with Thames Water and the local authority to consider whether an odour impact 
assessment is required as part of the promotion of the site and potential planning application 
submission. The odour impact assessment would determine whether the proposed development 
would result in adverse amenity impact for new occupiers, as those new occupiers would be 
located in closer proximity to a sewage treatment works.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

113  7. Bexley’s c limate : adapting to and mitigating the 
effects of climate change 
Related Council overarching strategies  
Be
xley Growth Strategy  
7.1 Climate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases 
(GHG).  These emissions are altering the composition of the atmosphere and contributing to 
climate c hange.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant GHG globally, and concentrations in 
the atmosphere have risen dramatically.  
7.2 This chapter sets out the strategic and non- strategic policies to address climate change and how it 
should be dealt with in a coordinated manner as proposals for new development come forward, 
taking account of the policies already in the London Plan.   
7.3 Mitigation can mean using new technologies and renewable energies, making older equipment 
more energy efficient, or changing management practices or consumer behaviour.  Recycling, 
greater resource efficiency and circular economy business models offer huge scope to reduce 
emissions.  T aking strong action on emissions can deliver substantial net benefits to local 
communities.  Government research has found that such action can improve people’s health, 
reduce energy costs, create employment, enhance community cohesion and restore local ecosystems.  
7.4 Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of climate change by reducin g 
vulnerability and exposure to its harmful effects and exploiting any potential benefits.  A wide range of adaptation options are available in urban areas to reduce the risks to natural and managed 
ecosystems, the risks of sea level rise, and the risks to health, livelihoods, food, water, and 
economic growth (e.g. green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water management).  
7.5 Climate change is a global issue; the Paris Agreement 2015 brings almost all nations into a common 
caus e to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.  Under the 
Paris Agreement 2015 the UK is committed to following a decarbonisation pathway that aims to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C, while ensuri ng it is held to “well below” 2°C, 
by taking steps reflecting its “highest possible ambition. ”  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing a large body of reputable, international scientists, has reported for 
several decades that th e global climate is changing.  
7.6 The Council signed up to the Nottingham Declaration in 2001, stating its commitment to tackling 
climate change.  In 2019, the UK passed legislation to revise the Climate Change Act target to an 
emissions reduction of “at least  100%” by 2050 (‘net zero’), in line with the advice of the Committee 
on Climate Change (CCC).  The Mayor of London has also committed to making London a zero-carbon city by 2050.  Action to help tackle climate change must also be taken a local level in Be xley 
to help deliver on these commitments.   
7.7 The effects of this change include rising temperatures and sea levels, retreating ice, and increases in the number of severe weather events, including extended period of dryness and heat in the 
summer which could lead to droughts: and  heightened flood risk due to more intensive and 
prolonged rainfall, particularly in winter months.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

7.8 The consequences of climate change for the UK includes dangerous flood events, increased deaths 
due to high summer temperatures, migration of native and invasive species, and habitat loss (UK 
Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18)).  Such environmental effects may also have significant socio-
economic and health implications, particularly for regions across the country less able to adapt.  
7.9 The geographical location of the borough and population density means that, alongside the rest of 
London and southeast England, it is likely to suffer from some of the severest impacts of climate 
change in the UK.  One of the effects of climate change is an increased risk of flooding and 
appro ximately one quarter of the borough is at risk from tidal or fluvial flooding.  The risk is not just 
from the Rivers Thames, Cray and Shuttle, but includes surface water flooding.  As such, even parts of the borough that are outside of the Environment Agency’s flood zones are at greater risk than 
others.   
7.10 Reducing overall energy consumption and being more energy efficient is vital to reducing GHG 
emissions and contributing to a secure energy future.  Reducing energy consumption through more 
efficient buildings and appliances can also help to tackle issues of energy affordability and fuel 
poverty.  Applying circular economy principles – reuse, remanufacture and recycle – to the built 
environment will also reduce GHG emissions.  
7.11 This will be achieved by mitiga ting the causes of climate change through reducing emissions and 
sequestering carbon; and, adapting to the effects of climate change by reducing vulnerability and 
adjusting to change.  Whilst the Plan, taken as a whole, is designed to secure that the devel opment 
and use of land in Bexley contributes to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change, this strategic policy brings a number of key requirements together.  
SP14  Mitigating and adapting to climate change  
1. The Council will actively pursue the delivery of sustainable development by:  
a) supporting developments that achieve zero- carbon and demonstrate a commitment to drive down 
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero;  
b) administering the borough’s carbon offset fund, ring- fencing payments to implement projects that 
deliver greenhouse gas reductions;  
c) investigating opportunities for the funding and development of decentralised energy networks in the 
borough; and, supporting the provision of infrastructure, including safeguarding routes and land for 
such use,  where necessary;  
d) supporting new and enhanced green infrastructure, including greening of development sites such as 
living roofs, and the contribution green infrastructure can make to managing flood risk and surface 
water, and to the mitigation of the urba n heat island effect;  Bexley Draft Local Plan

12 Proposals for zero carbon and zero carbon ready developments are strongly supported , including 
the sustainable retrofitting of existing development with provisions for the reduction of carbon 
emissions.   The Council will promote and support the requirements and targets set out in national 
and regional planning policy and guidance, in particular the requirements set out in the Mayor’s 
London Plan regarding reducing carbon dioxide emissions, flood risk management and sustainable 
drainage methodologies, as well as policies in this Local Plan.  
7.13 Planning for water provides opportunities to design the urban environment to be greener, 
healthier, more biod iverse and more resilient to climate change.  Identifying the best type of and 
locations for integrated water management measures, such as sustainable drainage systems and rainwater harvesting, should start from the master planning stage, informing the design process .  
The Bexley Sustainable Drainage Design and Evaluation Guide provides further details.  
7.14 Securing appropriate IWM interventions for new developments can provide multiple benefits, including reduced risk from flooding, increased water efficiency and reduced water stress, clean 
and good quality water environment, enhanced biodiversity, enhanced blue and green 
infrastructure, improved public spaces and places, contributing health and wellbeing, mitigating 
and adapting to climate change, using resources more sustainably and effectively, enables new 
housing and facilitating economic growth and regeneration.  
7.15 By taking a risk -based approach to the location of development in the borough, the Council will 
seek to avoid, where possible, flood risk to people and property.  The flood risk sequential test has 
been applied to the whole local planning authority area, and the flood risk exceptions test applied 
to the site allocations in this Local Plan.  The sustainable development locations set out in policy 
SP1 and illustrated on the key diagram ( Figure 1) are the parts of the borough that have passed the 
sequential test, ensuring that the amount of growth set out in this Local  Plan can be 
accommodat ed and mitigating risks through design solutions . Bexley Draft Local Plan

Related plans, strategies and key evidence – why we need this policy  
L
ondon Environment Strategy  
7.16 New development is required to incorporate design features that help deliver radical reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 emissions, and thus help mitigate climate change 
impacts.  This will be achieved using the measures set out below and in the London Plan unless 
superseded by national policy or legislation.   
Energy reduction in buildings  
7.17 Reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2) is critical in limiting the impacts 
of climate change.  In 2008, the Climate Change Act set a legally binding target for reducing UK 
CO2 emission by at least 80 per cent by 2050.  It also allowed for a Committee on Climate Change 
to be set up to create binding carbon budgets for five -year periods.  
7.18 The first three carbon budgets aimed to achieve a 34% reduction by 2020.  This target represent ed 
an appropriate UK contribution to global emission reductions consistent with limiting global temperature rise to as little as possible above 2°C.  However, the findings of the 2018 ‘Special 
Report: Global Warming of 1.5°C’ from the IPCC concluded global  temperature rise should be 
limited by 1.5, not 2°C.  In addition, in the 2015 progress report to Parliament, the Committee on 
Climate Change acknowledged for the first time that the country was not doing enough to meet its carbon targets and that new, stronger policies would be needed to meet the existing fourth carbon 
budget and to stay on track for the 2050 target.  
7.19 The London Environment Strategy explains that the Mayor of London has re -establish London’s 
position as a leader in tackling climate change by setting an ambition for London to become zero carbon by 2050.  Making London zero carbon will require economy- wide decarbonisation.  This will 
involve changes to the way in which Londoners travel, work and live, including how energy is sourced and generated.  Energy efficiency will have to increase dramatically, leading to homes and 
workplaces being highly insulated.  This is reflected in The London Environment Strategy.  
7.20 The Government ’s future homes and future b uildings standard s set out plans to radically improve 
the energy performance of non- domestic and buildings and dwellings through changes to building 
regulations, with all homes to be highly energy efficient, with low carbon heating and zero carbon 
ready by 2025.   With this in mind, and the knowledge that the NPPF states that places should be 
shaped in ways that contribute to “radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions” , the urgency for action becomes clear.  
Sustainable Design Standards  
7.21 The NPPF directs planning authorities to ensure that the quality of approved development is not materially diminished between permission and completion, as a result of changes being made to 
the permitted scheme and advocates the use of assessment frameworks (paragraph 129) such as 
sustainab ility standards.   Many international and national standards are available for use, the best 
known of which is the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method,  or 
BREEAM.  The BREEAM family of standards include standards for:  
• The build, refurbishment and operation of non- residential development;  
• The masterplanning of major development (BREEAM Communities);  
• Public realm works (CEEQUAL); 
• The build, refurbishment and operation of residential development (Home Quality Mark).  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
117  7.22 Further st andards include Passivhaus and Building for Life (see detailed guidance by the Design 
Council .  
Water efficiency  
7.23 Water is supplied to customers in Bexley by Thames Water, the largest water supplier in London.  
Water resources are already under pressure in London and the south east with a risk of a drought if 
there are two consecutive dry winters.  Severe droughts may have significant economic social and 
potentially health implications.  
7.24 The Environment Agency  has designated the Thames Water region to be “seriously water 
stressed” which reflects the extent to which available water resources are used.  Future pressures 
on water resources will continue to increase and key factors are population growth and climate change.  
7.25 Water conservation and climate change is an important issue.  Not only is it expected to have an 
impact on the availability of raw water for treatment but also the demand from customers for 
potable (drinking) water.  T o successfully proceed with housing growth, water efficiency initiatives 
are vital to reduce people’s daily water use and maintain a supply -demand balance.  
DP30  Mitigating climate change  
Energy reduction in new buildings  
1. Major development proposals must meet London Plan requirements and calculate whole life -cycle carbon 
emissions through a nationally recognised Whole Life -Cycle Carbon Assessment and demonstrate actions 
taken to reduce life -cycle carbon emissions.  
2. Minor development proposals should aim to achieve net zero  carbon; reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 
operation and minimising annual and peak energy demand in accordance with the London Plan energy 
hierarchy.  
Sustainable design standards for all development  
3. The Council expects that, where possible:  
a) new homes  be designed to achieve:  
i. BREEAM Home Quality Mark (HQM), or  
ii. BREEAM Communities standards (for major housing -led mixed -use development), or  
iii. Passivhaus, or  
iv. other appropriate sustainability measures.  
b) residential conversions, refurbishment, extensions and changes of use should be designed to achieve 
BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment Excellent or other appropriate sustainability measure.  
c) new non- residential development, refurbishment of existing buildings , and conversions, over  500m2 
floor space ( gross) must meet or exceed BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating;  
d) minor non- residential development achieves a BREEAM ‘Very Good’ rating;  
Water efficiency  
4. Development must be designed to be water efficient and reduce water consumption.  Residential development 
must not exceed a maximum water use of 105 litres per head per day (excluding the allowance of up to 5 litres 
for external water consumption).  Refurbishments and other non- domestic development will be expected to 
meet BREEAM water -efficiency credits.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
118  Policy implementation  
7.
26 Developments must m aximis e potential to achieve zero carbon or be  zero carbon ready  to ensure 
that buildings can become fully zero- carbon over time as the electricity grid decarbonises without 
the need for further costly retrofitting.   
7.27 Compliance with this policy should be demonstrated with a design stage Energy Strategy Report, 
which is revisited during the construction phase to confirm its predictions are still valid and thus 
help avoid a ‘performance gap. ’  Both submissions should contain adequate information to 
demonstrate how the energy hierarchy has been followed.  The level of detail provided should be 
proportionate to the size of the development.  Energy Strategies and Whole Life-Cycle Carbon 
Assessments should contain the inform ation prescribed within the London Plan.  
7.28 The Building Research Establishment Environment Assessment Method (BREEAM) provides national sustainability standards for residential and non- residential buildings in order to assess 
their environmental performance.   The Home Quality Mark is one way of demonstrating the 
standard of a new residential dwelling, which includes measures for low carbon dioxide (Footprint 
Quality Indicators), sustainable materials, good air quality and natural daylight.  The Council 
strong ly encourages all schemes, including self -contained residential proposals, to use the Home 
Quality Mark.   
7.29 Developers must begin work to obtain the required design standard at an early stage in the design process so that benefits can be maximised, and this  should be demonstrated in a Design and Access 
Statement.  These standards allow some flexibility in meeting the sustainability policy requirements, which will be assessed on a site by site basis.  This may apply, for example, if a 
developer can demonstrate that the standards would restrict their ability to achieve a truly exceptional or innovative design (as set out in para 79 of the NPPF).  
7.30 This policy details the circumstances under which sustainable design standards are expected to be 
met in the borough.   Development proposals that exceed the expectations will be strongly 
encouraged, subject to all other material considerations being acceptable.  The Council is aware that design standards are occasionally updated in order to drive up standards.  If a developer's 
chosen design standard undergoes a nationwide uplift in expectations, the equivalent replacement 
requirements will be applied.  
7.31 Development must be designed to be water efficient and reduce water consumption. 
Refurbishments and other non- domestic de velopment will be expected to meet BREEAM water -
efficiency credits.  Residential development must not exceed a maximum water use of 105 litres per head per day (excluding the allowance of up to 5 litres for external water consumption).  
Planning conditions  will be applied to new residential development to ensure that the water 
efficiency standards are met.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

tional Planning Policy Framework  
The London Plan 2021 – Policy SI 3  
London Environment Strategy  
Thamesmead and  Belvedere heat network feasibility study (work package 2 ) 
7.32 The NPPF states that local planning authorities should design their policies to maximise renewable 
and low carbon energy development while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed 
satisfactorily, including cumulative landscape and visual impacts.  
7.33 Part C of London Plan P olicy SI 3 Energy infrastructure states that Development Plans should  
identify : the need for  any necessary energy infra structure requirement s; existing heating and 
cooling networks ; proposed locations for future heating and cooling networks ; and  opportunities 
for expanding existing networks as well as establishing new networks.  
7.34 The Council is working closely with partners,  including the GLA, on the development of a heat 
network within the borough.  This decentralised energy network will capture affordable low 
carbon heat from waste to energy facilities, supplying it to residential and commercial buildings in 
the area, in the form of hot water and/or steam through a system of pipes to where it is needed.  
7.35 The Bexley Energy Masterplan  was commissioned to determine the potential for a district heat 
network in Bexley.  The study centred on the north of the borough, with the total  level of heat 
demand and annual consumption determined for all loads modelled for connection to an initial 
“Core Scheme” network.  It was determined that the Belvedere, Thamesmead and Abbey Wood 
sustainable development locations (plus limited adjacent existing buildings/sites) c ould  be met via 
heat offtake from Cory’s Riverside Resource Recovery (RRR) Energy from Waste (EfW) facility . 
7.36 The Thamesmead and Belvedere heat network feasibility study (work package 2)  has considered 
this further .  The  best  opportu nity for a heat network is for the EfW  facility to supply heat to estate 
regeneration schemes in Thamesmead, Abbey Wood and Lower Belvedere, and other new housing 
or commercial development on the route west along Yarnton Way.   
7.37 Feasibility work is continuing in regard to this potential heat network, in order to deliver significant 
economic, environmental and social benefits.  These include facilitating inward investment and 
new jobs, providi ng affordable low carbon heat to residents, businesses, industries and the public 
sector, helping to tackle fuel poverty by reducing heating costs and reducing London’s carbon footprint, in line with London Plan policy.  
7.38 T o facilitate heat transfer for export from Cory’s EfW  facility , a heat exchange plant has been 
identified to be located adjacent to the existing turbine hall (150 m
2 split across 3 levels).  N ew 
residential development will retain satellite energy centres with back up plans and thermal stores 
as they connect along the network; therefore,  this will not be required in the main distribution 
plant . 
7.39 In line with Cory’s proposed annual availability of 90% for heat offtake, the provision of 
supplementary heat generation and storage is required to meet year -round demand and is 
proposed to comprise a mix of centralised and distributed plant.  It is proposed to provide 
supplementary heating plant via a mix of centralised and distributed/local gas -fired boilers.  The 
centralised plant will only provide heat to those buildings that do not have their own localised boilers (3 no. boiler modules 300 m
2), and this could be integrated with the heat exchange plant.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
120  Network routing  
7.40 The network scheme has been designed around minimising the distance travelled by pr imary 
transmission pipes between the largest load centres, as well as avoiding the need to cross major 
obstacles and utilises a combination of Norman Road and Yarnton Way.  T o connect into Belvedere, 
a crossing of the railway line could be through either a  dedicated bridge, micro -tunnelling under 
the line or divert to the Picardy Manorway road bridge.  
7.41 Secondary heat exchange located in the premises of residential development plantrooms. Further hydraulic separation would be introduced via the use of heat interface units within or local to 
individual flats/properties.  
DP31  Energy infrastructure  
1. Developments within heat network priority areas should be designed to facilitate cost -effective connections to 
the existing or proposed network in accordance with the London Plan.  
2. In designated  heat network priority areas, p roposals for the development of decentralised energy network 
infrastructure an d related apparatus , including the use of low carbon technology , will be supported.   
3. Proposals for major developments that produce heat and/or energy should consider how they can contribute to 
the supply heat in a designated heat network priority area or  demonstrate that this is not technically feasible or 
economically viable.  
Policy implementation  
7.42 The Mayor of London has identified Heat Network Priority Areas, which can be found on the 
London Heat Map website.  These identify where in London the heat density is sufficient for heat 
networks to provide a competitive solution for supplying heat to buildings and consumers.   
7.43 The London Heat Map  identifies much of the north of Bexley borough, along with areas around 
Bexleyheath town centre, Welling and Sidcup as Heat Network Priority Areas (HNPAs), which therefore qualify as “competitive” opportunities for heat networks.  Data relating to new and  
expanded networks will be regularly captured and made publicly available, therefore additional areas may be added in the future. Developers should refer to the London Plan policy on energy 
infrastructure for further requirements.  
7.44 To realise significant emissions reduction using district heating, the heat in the networks must be 
provided from low carbon sources.  As the electricity grid also decarbonises, this presents a 
potential opportunity to use heat pumps to deliver heat from sources to networks and from 
networks to buildings .  New build networks serving thermally efficient buildings  are able to 
operate at lower flow temperatures, thus increasing the efficiency of heat pumps providing heat to the network.   The Government has produced a report on Heat Pumps in District Heating  
7.45 Renewable energy schemes will be strongly promoted in the borough and encouraged as part of 
development proposals where they are effective, viable and practical.  Applications for renewable 
energy generation will be expected to demonstrate how the proposal has been sensitively designed to integrate into the local environment, minimising any potential negative impacts, both 
physically and environmentally.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

Thames Estuary TE2100 Plan  
Strategic Floo d Risk Assessmen t (SFRA) , Level s 1 and 2  
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment – Sequential and Exceptions Tests Technical Paper  
Local Flood Risk Management Strategy  
7.46 Bexley is prone to flooding from many sources, such as ground water, surface water, sewer floodi ng 
and river flooding ,and climate change could increase the probability and severity of flooding.  The 
Government has a flood map for planning  including the designation of flood zones, which a ddress 
tidal and main river flooding.   
7.47 The area of land in Bexley within  Flood Zones  2 and 3 is predominantly in the north of the borough, 
where the risk is tidal flooding from the River Thames.  Other areas include the land around the 
River Cray, along the eastern part of the borough.  There are approximately 13,000 properties in 
areas at risk of flooding in Bexley, mainly from tidal sources.  This equates to 12% of all properties in the borough.  
7.48 Along with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, Bexley falls within the Thamesmead policy unit in 
‘action zone 4’ of the TE2100 (Thames Estuary 2100) Plan, a strategic document produced by the 
Environment Agency (EA) that looks to manage flood risk through London and the Thames Estuary.  
The TE2100 Plan was approved by the Government in November 2012.  The land is this area low 
lying, with ground levels typically two to three metres below high water on spring tides.  Flood 
depths in a surge tide event, that would have the ability to overtop or breach flood defences, could 
exceed five metres (although this would be an extreme event).   
7.49 Whilst the area is therefore very vulnerable to tidal flood risk, the recommended flood risk 
management policy for the Thamesmead policy unit is to take further action to keep up with 
climate and land use change so that flood risk does not increase.  
7.50 Therefore, the approach will be to manage flood risk through new development opportunities in 
the area.  Planning for flooding brings m ultiple benefits such as making existing communities more 
resilient; helping to improve water quality; enhancing biodiversity and recreation opportunities; and helping promote local economic growth through releasing land for development.  
7.51 Redevelopment of a reas provides opportunities to improve flood risk management arrangements 
including floodplain management to achieve safer floodplains, and defences that enhance the riverfront environment.  This might include resilient development and realignment of defences.  
Existing open space could be further enhanced to provide for tidal flood storage.  The Bexley Local 
Flood Risk Management Strategy includes an assessment of local flood risk, objectives for 
managing flood risk and measures for achieving those objecti ves.  
7.52 T o support the preparation of the Local Plan, a  strategic flood risk assessment (SFRA) for Bexley 
was undertaken in two distinct parts to reflect the two levels of SFRA presented by national guidance.  The purpose of the Level 1 SFRA is to provide an  evidence base to support spatial 
planning decisions, and it contains an assessment of the risks of all types of flooding at a borough -
wide scale as well as a series of recommendations to deal with a range of flood sources, whilst the 
Level 2 SFRA  supports  the assessment of individual sites.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
122  DP32  Flood risk management  
Planning for flood risk  
1. In areas at risk of flooding, as identified in the Bexley Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), development 
proposals, including redevelopment (except minor development), must:  
a) be within a sustainable development location if the site is within Flood Zones 2 and 3a, and the 
development type is acceptable within the Flood Zone, as only these locations have passed the Local 
Plan sequential test  
b) apply the exceptio n test, where required, to sites within flood zones 2 and 3a that have met the 
requirements of part 1a;  
c) comply with the guidance and recommendations set out in the Bexley SFRA Level 1 and 2;  
d) apply the sequential approach advocated in the NPPF to all source s of flooding, not just tidal and fluvial;  
e) be used as an opportunity to reduce the causes and impact of flooding;  
f) make as much use as possible of natural flood management techniques as part of an integrated 
approach to flood risk management); and,  
g) provide floodplain storage capacity as close to the development as possible, where the proposed 
development will reduce this capacity.  
Tidal and fluvial flooding  
2. Habitable rooms in residential development within the fluvial flood zones, should be set 300 mm above the 
predicted 1 in 100 year plus climate change peak flood water level.  
3. Development in areas designated as functional floodplain (as identified in the SFRA  Level 1  and the submission 
policies map ) will not be permitted outside of water -compatible development, as defined in the NPPF.  
4. All proposals for development in flood zones 2 and 3, and all proposals on sites of 0.25 hectares or larger  
regardless of what flood zone the site is in , must include a site -specific flood risk assessment (FRA), including a 
drainage impact assessment . 
5. New developments in riverside locations are required to help reduce flood risk now and into the futur e.  
Development proposals located within 100 metres of the Thames tidal flood defences should demonstrate 
consideration of and act on the recommendations of the TE2100 Plan; and be designed in such a way as to 
easily facilitate the raising and re -engineeri ng of the tidal flood defences.  
6. Basements will not be permitted in Flood Zones 2 or 3  
Surface water, groundwater and sewer flooding  
7. Development must not increase flood risk on- site or off -site, and exceedance flows must be considered and 
appropriately m anaged.  
8. All basement developments should include, within their proposal, protection to the property by installing, for 
example, a non- return valve or other suitable device to avoid the risk of backflow at a later date, on the 
assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions  
Safe refuge, access and egress in, to and from development  
9. New developments below the predicted flood water level  should include a detailed evacuation plan that clearly 
outlines how people can easily leave to safety or move upwards from the lower floors to safety . Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
123  DP32  Flood risk management  
10. Site design in floodplains must facilitate safe escape, access and egress. Only in exceptional circumstances 
where this cannot be demonstrated should the emergency plan be to reside in situ and escape upwards in a 
building . 
11. All development that is intended to be occupied below the predicted flood water level must provide internal 
safe refuge above the desi gn flood level  
Policy implementation  
7.
53 Government’s flood risk vulnerability classifications and compatibility tables  are the starting point 
for understanding whether a development proposal is appropriate for a specific location.  
7.54 The Bexley SFRA supports the proposed development in the Local Plan .  The SFRA Level 1 provides 
an evidence base to support spatial planning decisions at a borough- wide sc ale, including 
application of the sequential test, which has informed the sustainable development locations.  
These locations are identified in policy SP1 and illustrated on Figure 1 (the key diagram) and the 
submission policies map . 
7.55 It also facilitates the application of the exception test for  sites  loca ted in areas that have passed the 
sequential test (e.g. within flood zone 1 or sustainable development locations  in flood zones 2 and 
3a).  The SFRA Level 2 applies a sequential approach within the sustainable development locations, 
and at the site- specifi c level for sites identified through the site allocations process.  It also 
provides information for windfall sites to establish whether they can be made safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere.  
7.56 Site-specific FRAs should be supported by evidence set out in Bexley’s SFRA  (levels 1 and 2) . The 
Bexley SFRA Level 1 Chapter 6 provides guidance on managing the risk through site layout and 
building design.  Flood risk management by design should only be considered after the sequent ial 
approach has been applied to development proposals.  The sequential approach is applicable both 
in terms of site allocation and site layout.  Site layout should seek to avoid flood risk.  
7.57 The sequential approach to land use planning on sites can mitigate some of the flood risks, however, there will be instances where a level of risk remains. In these circumstances, flood risk management through design is required. This would need to be addressed as part of site-specific FRA.  
7.58 The Bexley SFRA Level 1 Chap ter 8 provides c lear instruction to developers and Council officers  as 
to when a site -specific  flood risk assessment is required  to accompany a planning application; and 
having determined that it is required, the minimum requirements for a site -specific  flood risk 
assessment.  
7.59 Applicants proposing development within 100m of flood defences  should consult with the 
Environment Agency .  New development provides an opportunity to improve the riverside both 
when defences are raised and when they are repaired or replaced.  The Environment Agency has developed guidance and can provide examples for improving the riverside.  Significant public access and public amenity improvements, landscape improvements and environmental enhancements can be achieved at modest cost if  they are included as part of an integrated 
riverside design that includes flood defences.  
7.60 Corridors of land along the existing defence lines should be safeguarded.  This should include space for vehicle access for maintenance and repair of the defences.  The width of land that should be Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
124  safeguarded for future flood risk management interventions  on the River Thames should be at 
least sixteen metres.  More space may be required especially if wider enhancements are to be 
achieved, and the Environment Agency should be contacted to discuss specific sites.  
7.61 New developments in riverside locations are required help reduce flood risk now and into the future and to act on the recommendations of the TE2100 Plan.  This could include for example; raising existing flood defences, providing improved access to existing flood defences, safeguarding land for future flood defence raising and maintaining, enhancing or replacing flood defences to provide adequate protection for the lifetime of development.  
7.62 Where possible  and viable, opportunities appropriate in scale should  be taken to re- align or set 
back flood defence walls and improve the river frontage to provide amenity space, habitat, access and environmental enhancements.  Financial contributions  should be secured  towards the 
anticipated costs of flood risk management infrastructure required to protect the proposed development over its lifetime.

Local Flood Risk Management Strategy  
Sustainable Drainage Design and Evaluation Guide  
7.63 The NPPF states that local planning authorities should adopt proactive strategies to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change taking full account of flood risk, including from surface water and 
groundwater.  Surface water drainage occurs when rainwater falls on a property and drains away; 
however,  in some cases this can lead to flooding issues  and onsite drainage management can help 
to reduce flood risk.  
7.64 The London Plan states boroughs should utilise surface water management plans to identify areas where there are particular surface water management issues and develop actions and policy 
approaches aimed at reducing these risks.    
DP33  Sustainable drainage systems  
1. All development proposals, whether increasing or decreasing the impermeable area of the site, will be required 
to manage surface water through sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) in line with all national, regional and 
local policies and related guidance, in order to minimise flood risk, improve water quality and enhance 
biodiversity and amenity.  
2. In addition, all development proposals will be required to demonstrate that:  
a) the drainage for the site achieves greenfield runoff rates for flood events up to and including 1 in 100 
years plus 40% climate change;  
b) surface water run -off has been reduced by sustainably managing run- off on site;  
c) permeable paving has been used for hardstanding areas (e.g. car parks);  
d) the nature of water flow (both surface water and groundwater) across a steeply sloping site has been 
considered in order to provide suitable SuDS; and,  
e) water reuse mechanisms have been included for either indoor or outdoor purposes.  
3. Development proposals on sites of 0.25 hectares or greater require a drainag e strategy, which must be 
accompanied by a suitable maintenance management plan.   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
125  Policy implementation  
7.
65 SuDs for new major developments have been a national planning requirement since 2015 and are 
prioritised in the London Plan.  Policy DP33 makes this a  requirement for all development schemes.   
All development proposals should incorporate sustainable drainage systems in accordance with the guidance set out below.  
7.66 Applicants are strongly encouraged to consider the requirements for SuDS at the earliest stages of 
design as this will enable their more effective integration and provision.  Sustainable drainage 
systems should also be considered alongside the ‘living building’ requirements as they can provide 
biodiversity and urban greening benefits as well as practical drainage management.  
7.67 SuDS features deliver important urban wildlife habitats and plants that encourage invertebrates, 
birds, bees and other pollinators.  Incorporating green features to promote biodiversity will also 
improve rainwater management.  SuDS can help combat the decline in biodiversity by contributing 
to the delivery of biodiversity net gain in new build or refurbishments.  
7.68 Areas of the borough that are vulnerable to surface water flooding have different issues that can 
be addr essed through new development and need to be resolved by development proposals.  
These areas are mapped in Bexley’s  Local Flood Risk Management Strategy .  For most of these 
areas there are no flood defences in place and opportunities will need to be taken to accommodate 
sustainable urban drainage measures.  
7.69 The Mayor’s Sustainable Design and Construction Guide sets detai led standards with regards to 
use of sustainable drainage measures and the principles of flood resistant design.  Bexley’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment includes guidance on sustainable surface water management.  
7.70 The Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) is the industry standard method for assessing flood flows in 
watercourses in the UK.  Applications should follow the revitalised FEH statistical method  to 
estimate greenfield runoff rates.  Greenfield runoff is usually calculated as the peak rate of runoff 
for a specific return period due to rainfall falling on a given area of vegetated land.   
7.71 For smaller, single dwelling sites, the IH124 method  is considered an acceptable approach for 
assessing greenfield runoff rates.  This method was specifically produced by the Institute of Hydrology to address the runoff from small catchments . 
7.72 Large increases in impermeable areas for a site could contribute to a significant increase in surface 
water runoff, peak flows and volumes.  In turn this could contribute to an increase in flood risk elsewhere.  Examples for minimising surface water flooding in all development include maximising 
the use of soft landscaping, permeable surfacing materials, living roofs and walls and on- site 
rainwater storage.    
7.73 For hardstanding areas (e.g. car parks) permeable paving is recommended, as it  is considered to be 
a viab le and environmentally friendly option that helps to reduce run- off.  Pumping in all cases is 
discouraged without robust evidence that there is no alternative.  
7.74 All SuDS must protect and enhance water quality by reducing the risk of diffuse pollution by mea ns 
of treating at source and including multiple treatment trains where feasible.  Schemes should be 
designed in accordance with Bexley’s Sustainable Drainage Design and Evaluation Guide  and 
relevant national standards , and there must be long term operation maintenance arrangements in 
place for the lifetime of the development.   The Mayor has also produced surface water guidance, 
including a proforma for referable planning applications.   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
126  Annex A - I ndicators for monitoring local plan  strategic 
and non-strategic policies  
Planning delivers the Council’s spatial objectives for its place through planning policy and the development 
management process.  The m onitoring of local planning policies is essential to demonstrate their 
effectiveness  and  identify any potential need for a review of all or part of the local plan . 
The Council produces a local plan monitoring report on an annual basis to measure this, for which the 
indicators set out in the tables below will be used as the basis for assessment.  During a review of all or par t 
of the local plan , indicators  may be amended reflecting updated policy content.

129  Annex B -  Glossary of planning terms  
This glossary provides guidance on the meaning of terms that  are specific to the Bexley Local Plan.  Refer to 
the National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan for terms not defined here.  
Active frontages add interest, life and vitality to the street and public realm.  Buildings should have active 
frontages that have:  
• frequent doors and windows without blank walls  
• articulated facades with bays and porches  
• lively internal uses visible from the outside, or spilling onto the street  
• concentrations of activity at particular points.  
Alteration Work intended to change the function or appearance of a place . 
Amenity A positive element or elements that contribute to the overall character or enjoyment of an area.  
For example, open land, trees, historic buildings and the inter - relationship between them, or less tangible 
factors such as tranquility . 
Amenity Space is a garden or balcony that is used for the day -to day activities of a household, such as 
clothes drying, relaxation, play and gardening .  Communal amenity spaces may be provided for blocks of 
flats or within residential areas.  
Ancient Woodla nd has been continually wooded since 1600 and is generally considered to have never 
been cleared since prehistoric times.  
Archaeological Priority Areas are areas where there is potential for significant archaeological remains. 
Planning applications within these areas must be accompanied by an archaeological assessment and 
evaluation of the site, including an assessment of the potential impact of the proposed development on the 
significance of archaeological remains.  
Archaeology specifically the remains bel ow the ground, provides evidence of the evolution of development 
and settlements in this area.  All remains are unique and represent a finite and non- renewable resource.  
Archaeological interest there will be archaeological interest in a heritage asset if i t holds, or potentially 
may hold, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point.  Heritage assets 
with archaeological interest are the primary source of evidence about the substance and evolution of 
places and of the people a nd cultures that made them (NPPF definition).  There can be an archaeological 
interest in buildings and landscapes as well as earthworks and buried remains.  
Asset of Community Value is a building or other land which it main used currently or was recently used to 
further the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community.   The Localism Act 2011, Chapter 3 
states that ‘social interests’ include cultural, recreational and sporting interests.  
Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) is a report produced by the Council to monitor the performance of 
planning policies using a range of different indicators, including housing delivery.  
Building Research Establishment Assessment Method (BREEAM) measures the environmental 
performance of commercial build ings by assessing water, waste, energy and travel usage.  
Built Heritage means all the heritage places and features that survive as buildings or structures , above or 
below ground, whether visible or not, and whether visitable or not.  
Carbon footprint is th e amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period, or the Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
130  amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product  
Circular economy  is where materials are retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and 
are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.   The end goal is to retain the value of 
materials and resources indefinitely, with no residual waste at all.  This is possible, requiring 
transformational change in the way that buildings are designed, built, operated and deconstructed . 
Climate change is a pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average 
temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. 
This variat ion may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term 
used to describe climate change caused by humans  
Climate change adaptation is adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic f actors or their effects, including from changes in rainfall and rising temperatures, which moderate 
harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.  
Climate change mitigation is action to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate system, primarily through reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
Community facilities are defined by the T own and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and its 
subsequent amendments.  Community facilities include:  
• Leisure and culture facilities (including arts, entertainment and sport facilities)  
• Community centres and meeting places (including places of worship)  
• Libraries  
• Facilities for children (from nursery provision to youth clubs)  
• Education (including adult education)  
• Healthcare facilities  
Conservation is the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains 
and, where appropriate, enhances its significance (NPPF definition).  
Conservation Areas are areas of special architectural or historic interest whose character or appearance is 
protected. They have to be formally designated under the provisions of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.  
Context refers to the setting of a site or area, including factors such as townscape, built form, land use, 
activities, heritage and vehicular and pedestrian movement.  
Core strategy is the most important spatial planning document the Council has produced over a decade.  It 
sets out how we propose the borough develops over the next 15 years to meet the challenges of changing 
environment, population and economy.  
Density is the amount of internal floor space of a building in relation to an area of land.  Density can be 
expressed in terms of plot ratio (floor to area ratio (FAR)) for commercial and mixed -use development and 
number of units or habitable rooms per hectare for residential development.  
Designation is the recognition of particular heritage value(s) of a significant place by giving it formal status 
under law or policy intended to sustain those values  
Designated Heritage Asset is a term used in the NPPF to refer to heritage places that have been selected 
under a range of relevant legislation or criteria for formal recognition of their heritage value and 
significance. Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
131  Dwelling may be a house, bungalow, flat, maisonette or converted farm building.  
Emissions are any release of  gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of 
climate change  
Flatted development refers to homes which have neighbouring  homes above and/or below.  Maisonettes 
and duplexes are flatted development.  
Flood Risk Zones are areas at risk of flooding. Flood Risk Zones are categorized as Zone 1 (low probability), 
Zone 2 (medium probability), Zone 3a (high probability) and Zone 3b (the functional floodplain) . 
Global warming is the steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts believe is 
largely caused by human- produced greenhouse gas emissions  
Green and brown roofs are roofs with vegetation cover and/or landscaping over a drainage layer. They are 
designed to provide insulation, increase biodiversity and retain rainwater  and reduce the volume of surface 
water runoff.  
Green infrastructure is a network of multi-functional green and blue spaces and other natural features, 
urban and rur al, which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental, economic and health 
wellbeing benefits for nature,  climate and local and wider communities and prosperity.  
Green wildlife corridor  is a network of green and blue spaces that allows some species with specialised 
habitat requirements to extend their distribution into parts of London where they would otherwise not be present.  The rivers, canals road and rail -side land are important components of these corridors and are a 
great benefit to London ’s biodiversity . 
Gross External Area (GEA) is the whole area of a building taking each floor into account.  
Gross Internal Area (GIA) is the enclosed area of a building within the external walls taking each floor into account and excluding the thickness of the external walls.  
Harm in planning terms means something that may damage a heritage asset or result in a loss of 
significance. This should not be permitted.  
Heritage (asset) goes beyond physical form to involve all of the individual characteristics that can 
contribute to giving somewhere a distinctive ‘sense of place. ’  Certain places hold special meanings for 
people and a strong ‘sense of place’ that can be deeply felt by local inhabitants and appreciated by visitors.  It reflects the knowledge, beliefs and traditions of diverse communities and provides a sense of inclusivity, 
continuity and a source of identity.   It is a social and economic asset and a resource for learning and 
enjoyment.  Understanding the historic character of a pl ace is an essential starting point for deciding its 
future.  
Heritage (natural) includes inherited habitats, species, ecosystems, geology and landforms, including those 
in and under water, to which people attach value.  
Hierarchy of town centres is a ranking of town centres based on size and importance. The types of town 
centre in Bexley are Major Centres, District Centres , and Local Centres (all defined in the London Plan) and 
local designations of Neighbourhood Centre and  Small Parades.  
Historic Environment  is a very general term used to refer to everywhere around us that has something 
significant about it. It is defined by the NPPF as: ‘all aspects of the environment resulting from the 
interaction between people and places through time, including all surviving physical remains of past human 
activity, whether visible, buried or submerged and landscaped and planted of managed flora. ’  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
132  Historic Environment Record (HER/GLHER) is a public, map -based data set, primarily intended to inform 
the management of the historic environment. This includes information services that seek to provide 
access to comprehensive and dynamic resources relating to the historic environment of a defined 
geographic area for public benefit and use. Historic England maintains the Historic Environment Record for 
Greater London.  
Historical interest (buildings) refers to buildings that have important aspects of the nation’s social, 
economic, cultural or military history, such as industrial buildings, railway stations, schools, hospitals, 
theatres, and town halls.  
House is a self -contained residential dwelling.  Houses can be detached, semi -detached or terraced.   
Bungalows are houses.  
Infrastructure includes educational infrastructure (such as early years facilities, schools, facilities for 
childr en and young people), social infrastructure (such as community buildings, faith premises, leisure 
facilities, cultural facilities), health infrastructure (such as health and emergency services), utilities (power, gas, water, sewerage and telecommunications  (digital)), transport infrastructure (such as roads, railways, 
bridges, cycle routes, walking routes, tunnels) and environmental infrastructure such as (green links (open spaces), Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs), Waste Management facilities and consolidation 
centres).  
Integrated Impact Assessment is a method of estimating the potential environmental, social or economic 
implications of planning policies.  Planning documents must be assessed to identify the extent to which they 
may have any unfair impacts on groups in the community, such as people of different gender, ethnic group, age, religion, belief, sexual orientation, or disability.  
Landscape refers to the character and appearance of land, including its shape, topography, form, ecology 
and natural features.  
Layout refers to the way buildings, routes and open spaces are placed in relation to each other.  
Listed Building is a building or structure which is considered to be of 'special architectural or historic interest. This includes a wide variety of structures and buildings. There are three grades of listing 
depending on the importance of the building.  
Live/Work Units  are units of living accommodation, which are specifically designed to accommodate work 
facilities for those residing therein.  
Loca l Centres are the smallest town centres in the T own Centre Hierarchy. Local Centres have good access 
and include a small group of shops and services serving the needs of the local community. They typically 
have shops like newsagents, off - licenses, general grocery stores and post office and occasionally a 
pharmacy, a hairdresser and other small shops of a local nature.  
Local Development Scheme (LDS) sets out the council’s timetable for preparing planning documents over a 
three-year  period a nd the purpose and scope of each document.  
Locally Listed Building is a building, structure or feature which is not statutorily listed but is important in 
the local context owing to its special architectural or historic interest or its townscape or group value. The protection of local heritage is important because it enhances the value of Bexley’s built environment, but 
also maintains a sense of local distinctiveness which can assist with regeneration and place -making.  
London Plan is the Mayor’s spatial  dev elopment strategy  for London.  It forms part  of Bexley’s 
Development Plan  alongside the Local Plan.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
133  Maintenance includes routine work necessary to keep the fabric of a place in good order  
Material (assessment) is relevant to  and having a substantial effect  on a decision, therefore demanding 
consideration . 
Major development  means development involving any one or more of the following: 
a) the winning and working of minerals or the use of land for mineral -working deposits;  
b) waste development;  
c) the provision of dwel ling houses where: 
i. the number of dwelling houses to be provided is 10 or more; or  
ii. the development is to be carried out on a site having an area of 0. 25 hectares or more and it 
is not known whether the development falls within sub -paragraph (c)(i);  
d) the provision of a building or buildings where the floor space to be created by the development is 
1,000m2 or more; or  
e) development carried out on a site having  an area of one hectare or more. 
Massing refers to the combined effect of the height, bulk and silhouette of a building or group of buildings.  
Metropolitan Open Land is a designation equivalent to the Green Belt.  The designation is intended to 
protect areas of landscape, recreation, nature conservation and scientific interest which are strategically 
important.  
Mitigation is a measure introduced to avoid or reduce an effect. 
Non-designated Heritage Asset places which do not have formal recognition but  may  nevertheless be 
demonstrably equivalent in value to formally recognised  assets, and in some cases should be treated in the 
same way.  The value of places can change over time and heritage value and significance may become 
apparent when new evidence or knowledge is revealed.  
Preserve is to keep safe from harm  
Protected species are a species of animal or plant which it is forbidden by law to harm or destroy.  
Private (or market) housing is available to either buy or rent privately on the open market.  
Public realm is the space between and within buildings that is  publicly accessible, including streets, 
squares, forecourts, parks and open spaces.  
Public transport includes bu sses, trains and river boats that operate on fixed routes for fixed fares  
Publicly accessible is accessible from the public realm, including streets, squares, forecourts, parks and 
open spaces.  
Registered Providers (RPs) are housing providers that are registered with the Homes and Communities 
Agency.  Most RPs are housing associations, but some RPs are trusts, co-operatives and companies.  
Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished 
on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.  Renewable energy 
often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off -grid) energy services.  
Restoration is to return a place to a known earlier state, on the basis of compelling evidence, without 
conjecture Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
134  Scale refers to the relationship of the relative size of a building or structure to another.  
Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM) is a legally protected (generally archaeological) site that is 
considered to be of national importance. Scheduled monuments are described here because of the high 
level of legal protection that is afforded them.  
Scheduled Monument is protected by law, and any development that affects a scheduled monument 
requires formal written Scheduled Monument Consent (SMC) from the Secretary of State for DCMS. 
Historic England’s Inspector of Ancient Monuments gives advice to the government on each application 
and administers the consent system. In assessing applications, the Secretary of State will aim to ensure that 
the significance of protected sites is safeguarded for the long term.  
Setting of a heritage asset is the surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not  
fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or 
may be neutral.  
Sensitivity is the  likelihood of typical development impacts causing significant harm to assets of National, 
Regional and Local Interest. Sensitivity is closely allied to significance and potential but also takes account of an asset’s vulnerability and fragility.  
Significance is the value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. 
That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset's physical presence, but also from its setting.  
Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCS) provide valuable wildlife habitat and opportunities 
for experiencing nature. These are important in helping local plant and animal specifies to survive. Sites are classified a ccording to whether they have London- wide, borough- wide and local importance.  
Statement of Community Involvement sets out how the council will consult people on the preparation of 
planning documents and on planning applications.  
Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRA) assess risks from flooding, including from the River Thames, 
surface water runoff and drainage overflow.  
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) explain how current planning policies in the Local Plan will be 
applied. They also contain background information applicants may find useful when preparing their planning applications.  
Sustainable development is a state of being capable of meeting present needs without compromising 
ability to meet future needs.  
Sustainable drainage system is an enviro nmentally friendly  way of dealing with surface water runoff to 
avoid problems associated with conventional drainage practice. These problems include exacerbating flooding. This approach may also be termed “SuDS” (or sustainable urban drainage systems)  
Te m porary uses refer to a range of temporary uses of vacant buildings of land for social or economic gain 
until they can be brought back into commercial use.  
T all Buildings are 25 meters and taller  (approximately eight storeys) , measured from the ground to the top 
of any equipment on the roof . 
T enure  blind  architecture  is design of a housing estate so that houses for sale (whether at ‘market’ prices or 
through a shared ownership agreement) and houses built to be rented (from the local authority, from a Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
135  housing association or from a registered social landlord) are purposefully made similar in design to mask 
the tenures. The conviction is that tenure blind design helps social integration without affecting property 
prices.  Whether tenure masking is applied or not, properties will vary in size and sort. They may be ‘buffered’ to appear as a graduated range of different house types within the same street . 
Transparency means something is open to public scrutiny.  
Town centre uses  are defined in the Glossary of the NPPF .  Main town centre uses include retail 
development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment facilities, the more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive- through restaurants, bars 
and pubs, night -clubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls); offices; 
and arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels 
and conference facilities). For the purposes of policies in this Local Plan, F1(d) public libraries and F2(b) 
local community halls are con sidered main town centre uses.   Within town centres, residential units, which 
are also a town centre use, should be located above ground level where possible to allow for more ‘active’ 
town centre uses at ground level.  It would be appropriate for access doorways and entrances to be located 
at ground floor level for accommodation above.  
Urban design involves the design of buildings, spaces and landscapes at a variety of scales. It can involve 
the establishment of frameworks and processes which facilitate successful development.  
Urban Open Space (UOS) refers to a land use designation that is similar in spirit to Metropolitan Open 
Land ( MOL ) or Green Belt.  Urban open space is important to the health and wellbeing through its 
contribution to the landscape and in providing attractive breaks in the built -up area.  Larger open spaces 
are important because they accommodate a wide range of open- air recreational, leisure, educational, 
institutional and other uses within easy reach of residential areas.  Even small open spaces that are 
enclosed by buildings along several edges can provide a respite from the urban form of the borough.  Once 
open land is built on it is lost forever.  
Value includes an aspect of worth or importance, attached by people to the quality of places.  
Waste management facilities are facilities where waste is processed including sorting, composting, 
recycling, and biological treat ment , and recovery of energy from incineration.   Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
136  PART 2: RESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL -LED MIXED -
USE SITE ALLOCATIONS  
Introduction  
Bexley is experiencing significant change and population growth – the London Plan identifies housing need 
across the whole of London and sets  10- year targets for net housing completions for each London borough.  
For Bexley, the 10 -year target is for  6,850 (net) additional homes in the borough.  Bexley is an attractive 
and sustainable place for growth; however, there is only a limited amount of land available .  Therefore, 
where development  does  takes place it is important to ensure that the most  efficient use of land and 
buildings is achieved, and that the development responds to local needs and aspirations.  
Plan- making authorities carry out land availability assessments for development in order that sites may be 
identified for the use(s) which is most appropriate.  The assessment is an important source of evidence that 
provide s information on a range of sites that have t he development potential  to meet the plan -making 
authority’s requirements  although it does not in itself determine whether a site should be allocated for 
development .  It is for the Local  Plan itself to determine which of those sites are the most suitable to meet 
those requirements  based not just on the site assessments but on other evidence.   Further detail on this 
process is set out in the Site Allocations T echnical Paper  and Regulation 18 Consultation Statement.  
Part 2 o f the Local Plan sets out the Council's site allocations for residential and residential -led mixed -use 
development.  It builds on the policies in Part 1 of the Local Plan and on the Mayor’s London Plan, following 
the spatial strategy set out in Policy SP1 and the Key Diagram ( Figure 1) ensuring that development areas 
are planned for in a way that respects the local character of the surrounding area and meets the needs of local communities  and businesses.   It demonstrates the large sites component of the Local Plan Housing 
Trajectory (Annex C ), working in tandem with the published  5-year housing land supply  of housing land  and 
small sites windfall allowance .  It can also inform as well as make use of sites in brownfield registers . 
The s ite allocations set out a le vel of detail to provide certainty to relevant stakeholders and demonstrate 
that Bexley’s housing requirement can be met in a sustainable way.  The sites have been tested through the integrated impacts assessment, the transport assessment and the flood ris k assessment.  Each site 
allocation includes a policy that is unique so that it can respond to local and site- specific issues and 
opportunities.  Policies set out land uses, the minimum number of homes to be delivered, and other site-
specific requirements that proposals must meet to be policy compliant .  In addition to conforming to all 
other relevant policies in the Development Plan , development p roposals should have regard  
supplementary planning guidance , in particular design guidance , and other strategies where relevant . 
What are considered to be optimum  residential development capacities have been established using a 
design -led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All Londoners 
Consultation Draft SPG .  Module A sets out an approach to assessing sites and provides a tool that uses the 
application of residential typologies to test and establish site capacity.  The tool assumes that sites are 
cleared, unless specified otherwise, and therefore the residential capacity figures are gross . 
Sites within town centres are constrained to 75% of the gross site area to allow for the inclusion of town centre uses .  Sites that include other land use designations such as urban open space or sites of importance 
to nature conservation will also constrain the residential area of the site .  Committed transport 
interventions can increase site densities.  Development p hasing is indicative  and has been included to 
inform  the housing trajectory.   Development proposals can be put forward to the Council at any time for 
consideration although piecemeal development must be avoided .  The site allocations are defined on the 
submission policies map . Bexley Draft Local Plan

Development approach  
2. Development of this site shoul d transform the area.  The site should act as a gateway to Abbey Wood town 
centre and the wider Housing Zone to the north.  As well as meeting other policy requirements, proposals must 
provide high -quality public realm and an appropriate mix of uses to cre ate a sense of arrival when leaving the 
station at both flyover and ground level.  Reducing flood risk, particularly surface water flooding, must be a key 
consideration for development proposals on this site.  A bike hub should be included within the public realm, 
and an element of public car parking should be integrated into the scheme.

Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
139  Site and surroundings  
Felixstowe Road car park is a medium sized brownfield site located within the local town centre of Abbey 
Wood Village. It is adjacent to Abbey Wood station which, once the Elizabeth Line begins operating, will act 
as an important transport hub and will bec ome the best -connected station in the borough. It lies on the 
boundary with the Royal Borough of Greenwich.  
The site has formerly been a car park and has most recently been used as a compound for the Crossrail works. It is dissected in the southwestern corner by the Harrow Manorway flyover, a busy elevated 
roadway which causes severance locally and under which the site provides the connection between the 
station and the established residential area to the east.  
The site is part of the Abbey Wood and South Thamesmead Housing Zone, which is the focus of registered 
housing provider Peabody’s efforts to regenerate the oldest parts of the 1960s/70s Thamesmead estate, including the provision of new high- density mixed -use and residential development and extensive public 
realm improvements. In this context, the site was included within a larger outline planning consent that highlights the importance of integrating the site with the broader opportunity to its north.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Const raints  
Providing high -quality public realm around Abbey 
Wood station that incorporates a ‘bike -hub’ and forms 
part of a legible sequence of public spaces leading 
pedestrians and cyclists towards Southmere Lake and 
the wider Thamesmead area.  National Grid underground power cable s cross the site, 
entering near Harrow Manorway and exiting down 
Rushdene Road. Maintenance access will need to be 
maintained. The culverted Great Breach Dyke also runs 
under the site, from which development must be offset.  
Creating a mixed -use development with town centre 
uses at ground and flyover levels with residential 
accommodation above.  The Harrow Manorway flyover arches over the site, 
covering approximately a quarter of its area. This places a 
constraint on the developable area and raises potential 
issues around amenity, traffic noise, and air quality.  
Using the development to create a sense of arrival 
when exiting Abbey Wood station and reinforcing the 
station’s location within the local area as an important 
transpor t hub.  Development will be expected to provide an element of 
public car parking, with contributions sought towards the 
potential expansion of the Controlled Parking Zone 
around Abbey Wood station.  
Intensifying an empty site adjacent to Abbey Wood 
station,  which has one of the highest levels of access to 
public transport provision in the borough.  The site is within 425m of ancient woodland and 
development is likely to be highly visible from elevated 
position of the Lessness Abbey scheduled ancient 
monument.  
Reducing flood risk by improving surface water runoff 
with possible scope to open up the Great Breach Dike 
culverted watercourse, to ‘daylight’ the river.  The site falls within flood zone 3a and a critical drainage 
area where surface water flooding is prevalent.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’ s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location a nd size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the 
site, could be considered.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
140  Streets and public spaces: Consider re- establishing the historic alignment of Railway Road (now known as 
Rushdene Road) across the site. Incorporate the area under the flyover into high-quality public realm that 
addresses Abbey Wood station and use this sheltered land for the provision of a bike hub. Consider the use 
of pavi ng materials which would continue to provide a high- quality street scape in the eventuality that 
access is needed to the underground cable. An offset from any built structure to the Great Breach Dike  
watercourse culvert, which runs directly under the site should also be observed.  
Blocks: Consider expanding the development site to include the carriageway of Felixstowe Road and other 
adjacent land to add flexibility to the site’s developable area and establish the potential for creating a block adjacent to th e railway.  
Height and massing: Consider the design and arrangement of buildings to point the way towards 
Southmere Lake and the Thamesmead Housing Zone. Consider the use of a tall building up to 15 storeys to mark the presence of Abbey Wood station.  
Uses: T own centre uses should be located at ground and at flyover level (which is the main entrance to the 
station), to create public realm with shops fronting the station entrances at both levels. Residential accommodation should be incorporated above. An element of public parking should also be incorporated 
into the scheme.

1. This site is allocated for primarily residential development through  estate regeneration , proposed by Peabody, 
the registered housing provider and landowner, to deliver 1,849 new homes, replacing 746 units of existing 
housing.  
Development approach  
3. Development of this site should transform the area. As well as meeting other policy requirements, proposals 
should introduce a simplified street layout and block pattern, improving permeability through the site. A key 
north- south route should be established, providing a link between the Housing Zone sites. High- quality public 
open space should be integrated throughout the proposed scheme with clear definition between public and 
private spaces. Flood risk must be mitigated effectively and sleeping accommodation should be avoided on 
ground floors. Proposals should be future -proofed to allow for later intensification and should not preclude 
public transport routes through the site.  
Figure 16: Lesnes Estate/Coralline Walk site map and details  
Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
143  Site and surroundings  
The Lesnes Estate and Coralline Walk together form a large, developed  site (11.07 ha) located within 300m 
of Abbey Wood station and adjacent to the borough boundary with RB Greenwich.  
The existing estate currently suffers from issues brought about by a lac k of active frontages, confusing 
street layouts, over dominance of cars and poor public realm. However, the location has many benefits that 
include access to good community facilities and proximity to green and blue assets at Lesnes Abbey Wood, 
Abbey Way a nd Southmere Lake.  
The site includes part of the Abbey Wood and South Thamesmead Housing Zone, which is the focus of 
registered housing provider Peabody’s efforts to regenerate the oldest parts of the 1960s/70s 
Thamesmead estate, including the provision of new high- density mixed -use and residential development 
and extensive public realm improvements.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Intensifying development on this site, whilst providing an 
improved environment for pedestrians, including the 
creation of a new large public open space.  Underground utilities along Wolvercote Road and 
associated 7 metre exclusion zone. Costs associated 
with relocating the services could be prohibitively 
expensive.  
Improving movement through and within the site. Providing 
active and animated access routes  to landscape, leisure 
amenities, community facilities, and transport nodes 
surrounding the site.  The sites northern boundary may conflict with 
Yarnton Way Bus Rapid Transport safeguarding 
area.  
Removing the Yarnton Way wall, allowing improvements to 
frontage onto Yarnton Way to create the feel of a local street 
and improve the experience of walking and c ycling.  The site falls within flood zone 3a and a critical 
drainage area where surface water flooding is 
prevalent.  
Positively addressing the wider South Thamesmead housing 
area, including the prospect of redefining Lensbury Way as 
an active residential street with homes fronting onto the 
street and create an attractive route between the station and 
neighbouring housing estates.  Limited height of housing to the south of the site 
will restrict building heights in adjacent areas. 
Opening up the boundary wal l to the north will 
open up the site to the effects of noise and traffic 
generation along Yarnton Way.  
Enhancing ecological value and connections between the 
built environment and the Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation and green wildlife corridor along Abbey Way.  Design will need to protect the SINC along Abbey 
Way.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Streets and public spaces: Develop clear and legible street layouts, with fewer, but higher quality streets. 
Wayfinding could further be supported with careful placement of key buildings. Consider integrating 
landscaping into street design and improving accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists in both the north-south, and east- west direction. Consider the creation of a large green open space, which could act as a key 
node along a green route from the station to Southmere village. Future intensification of the site could be facilitated by providing parking in a way that would allow it to be later developed, subject to impro vements 
in public transport accessibility.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
144  Blocks: Consider the creation of perimeter blocks that have clear fronts and backs as well as clearly defined 
public and private spaces and carefully designed privacy zones. Explore the opportunity to create a var ied 
scale across the site and consider creating two distinct character areas.  
Height and massing: Consider a carefully distributed cluster of taller buildings to the west of the site, 
relating to the emerging context along Harrow Manor Way. Development will need to respond to lower 
heights of existing housing to the south. Building footprints should be maximised.  
Uses: Any non -residential uses should be limited to Coralline and Southmere frontages and should not 
undermine the town centre or community facilities at Southmere public square.  
Flood risk:  Sleeping accommodation is to be avoided on the ground floor to comply with flood risk 
requirements. Sustainable drainage measures will need to feature heavily in the design; water retention features will need to be carefully designed to take into account the higher water table in this area.

2. Development of this site should transform the  area.  As well as meeting other policy requirements, proposals 
should provide legible routes between the station and the wider area, and the developer should contribute to a 
new pedestrian link across Lower Road to help unlock the site.  Proposals should create a sense of arrival at 
Belvedere station.  Landscaped buffers, including through improvements to the existing ditches and d ikes, 
should be introduced at the northern and eastern edges of the site to limit impacts on the adjacent SINC and 
reduce the risk of flooding.  T own centre parking should be provided at an appropriate amount and designed to 
minimise its functional and visual impact.  Proposals should not preclude public transport routes through the 
site and should not result in harmful piecemeal development.

147  Site and surroundings  
This is a large brownfield site (3.31 ha) that forms a significant part of Lower Belvedere town centre.  The 
site is adjacent to Belvedere station and is currently occupied by a large retail warehouse.  Approximately 
550 car parking spaces surround the store and isolate it from the street, creating a large car -dominated 
void along much of Lower Road.  On the south side of Lower Road, a mix of apartment blocks and houses sit 
in an elevated and set back position opposite the site.  Picardy Manorway flyover bo unds the site to the 
east. Three bus routes (229, 401, 469) also stop directly outside the site boundary.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Intensifying a sparsely developed site to create a 
residential -led mixed -use quarter within a town centre, 
with access to good provision of public transport and 
potential future transport interventions including a DLR 
terminus, extension of Crossrail, and a new station 
entrance.  The site remains in active use.  Retail warehousing 
occupies the northern half of the site whilst the 
remaining southern half is laid out as surface parking.  A 
phased approach could be necessary to ensure 
businesses can remain operational whilst the site is 
intensified and new floorspace created.  
Creating a positi ve and distinctive sense of arrival at 
Belvedere station by working in partnership with 
neighbouring sites to improve local levels of 
permeability and better integrate Belvedere station into 
the wider area.  A buffer strip along the site’s northern boundary should 
be provided to avoid precluding the delivery of Crossrail 
and DLR to Belvedere station in the future.  
Increasing development potential by working in 
partnership with neighbouring sites to create a coherent 
masterp lan that brings about rationalised development 
parcels and allows for efficient building layouts.  The site falls within flood zone 3a and a critical drainage 
area where surface water flooding is prevalent.  The 
southern and eastern areas of the site are al so identified 
as particularly at risk of surface water flooding.  There is 
no surface drainage currently on site.  
Establishing built frontage along Lower Road and 
creating a street environment defined by buildings and 
less dominated by the presence of veh icles.  Significant air and noise pollution are generated from 
rail and road transport routes adjacent to the site.  
Enhancing the adjacent SINC and alleviating flood risk 
by treating it as a green asset that could be extended 
across the site and integrated  with development.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the site, could be considered.  
Streets and public spaces : Work in partnership with BEL02  Station Road Ea st to create a network of 
streets and public spaces which establish new legible routes between Belvedere station, Picardy Manorway and Frank’s Park.  
A new station entrance:  Explore ways to futureproof the north- eastern corner of the site to provide 
develop ment that could be integrated with a new station entrance onto Picardy Manorway.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
148  Unlocking development:  A phased approach is encouraged that would allow for retail uses to remain active 
whilst the site is being intensified.  A phased approach would also a llow development to respond to future 
increases in connectivity.  Earlier phases could focus on working in partnership with neighbouring site 
BEL02 Station Road East  to provide mixed -use development across the southern half of the site with direct 
access t o Lower Road.  Later phases could then concentrate on building out a block structure in the place of 
the present retail warehouse which could respond to subsequent changes in connectivity around 
Belvedere station.  The site should be considered in the context of the surrounding site allocations and 
developers should look to work in partnership with adjacent landowners to ensure the cluster is developed coherently and development opportunities are optimised.  
Height and massing:  Perimeter blocks between 4 and 8 storeys.  Ta ller buildings up to 15 storeys could be 
used to signify the location of station entrances.  Consider focus sing height along the railway edge and use 
of a regular rhythm of massing along the northern boundary to deliver a strong and distinctive sense of 
arrival at Belvedere station.  
Parking provision: The functional and visual impact of car parking should be minimised, for example by 
incorporating parking within the new block structure.  Proposals should avoid using large portions of the 
site as surface ca r parking.  
Ecology and landscaping:  The creation of a landscaped buffer along the site’s eastern boundary could 
create an enhanced SINC environment, provide a buffer from the noise and air pollution of Picardy 
Manorway and provide a landscaped setting for a taller building sitting in the north-eastern corner of the 
site.  
Flood risk:  An offset from any built structure to the watercourse, which runs adjacent to the sites northern 
and eastern boundaries, should be observed.  Discharge routes will need to be established to alleviate 
surface water flood risk.

Increasing development potentia l by working in 
partnership with neighbouring sites to create a 
coherent masterplan that brings about rationalised 
development parcels and allows for the use of

ownerships. I ndividual landowners  will need to work 
together to unlock the full potential of the overall site and 
engage with neighbouring sites to ensure development is 
advanced in an integrated manner across the wider area.  
Working in partnership with neighbouring s ites to

Blocks and building heights: Work in partnership with BEL01  ASDA and B&Q Belvedere to create a 
rational block structure which optimises development potential and allows for new  connections to be made 
between Station Road and the wider Belvedere area.  Carefully consider the architectural treatment at the 
junction of Station Road and Picardy Street to ensure this prominent corner positively contributes to wayfinding when approaching the site.  Consider using a taller building at this corner up to 15 storeys in

Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Intensifying land uses near Belvedere station.  The site falls within flood zone 3a and a critical 
drainage area where surface water flooding is 
prevalent.  
Introducing a significant amount of new residential 
development as part of a mixed -use scheme within Lower

Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is considered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy wil l be similar to the optimum capacity.  
Streets and public spaces: Create a high -quality streetscape along Picardy Street that is fronted by town 
centre development at ground floor level. The development should provide visual links to Belvedere station from Picardy Street.  
Blocks and building heights : The development should optimise space including by building upwards whilst 
respecting the existing buildings to the west and the east, which are relatively low -rise. There is potential 
for significant additional  height as the site moves towards the railway line, ranging from 3/4 storeys 
fronting Picardy Street rising to over 10 storeys towards the rear of the site.  
Uses:  Provide town centre uses at ground floor level fronting Picardy Street with residential 
acco mmodation fronting a realigned Railway Place and on upper floors.

Site and surroundings  
The land adjacent Woodside School is a large brownfield site (1.88 ha) that sits in an elevated position next 
to Frank’s Park. Land levels fall along the site’s northern boundary down towards Lower Road with mature SA6 BEL04 Land adjacent Woodside School  
Land use and capacity  
1. This site is allocated for primarily residential development.  The design -led approach for optimising site 
capacity suggests that a minimum of 138 new homes can be achieved on this site.  
Development approach  
2. Development of this site should enhance the area. As well as meeting other policy r equirements, proposals 
should respond to the steep and varied topography of the site, using a variety of typologies, incorporating 
changes in levels and varying building heights to enhance views into and out of the site. Pedestrian routes 
should be introdu ced through the site, especially onto Lower Road to improve access to Belvedere station, and 
onto Halt Robin Road to improve access to Woodside School and Frank’s Park.

T o the south east of the site, the main Victorian school building stands outside the site boundary fronting 
Halt Robin Road and Frank’s Park. Flatted blocks and town houses back onto the site along its western 
boundary. Footpaths lead down from the site towards Lower Road which faces Belvedere station whilst 
three bus routes (229, 401, 469) are within walking distance.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Oppor tunities  Constraints  
Intensifying a site that is surplus to educational 
requirements within walking distance to Belvedere 
Station and with access to moderate levels of public 
transport provision.  Vehicular access to the site is provided off Halt Robin Road 
with changes in land levels separating the site from Lower 
Road. This access arrangement is likely to be a constraint on 
development and on vehicular movements across the site.  
Drawing inspiration and character from the 
neighbouring Victorian school building and 
responding to it in a sympathetic manner.  Residential plots back on to the site with low -lying housing 
being present to the north of the site along Lower Road. 
Potential  issues around overlooking and overshadowing.  
Allowing residential accommodation to gain views 
north over low -lying land towards the River Thames.  The site falls within a critical drainage area, where surface 
water flooding is prevalent.  
Improving local permeability and the site’s 
accessibility to Belvedere Station by re- establishing 
pedestrian footpaths down towards Lower Road.   
Embracing grade variations across the site and using 
changes in land levels to design in servicing and 
parking and inform street structure.   
Helping with wayfinding by making a positive visual 
contribution at the junction of Lower Road and 
Picardy Manorway when approaching the site from 
the north.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: Wh at are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is considered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy will be similar to the optimum capacity.  
Make use of the heritage asset: The main Victorian school building is not located within the development, but it does provide a potential focal point around which the site could be developed, in terms of layout and 
appearance. Although the building is not a designated heritage asset, it exhibits a distinct character to 
which the development can respond in an appropriate and sympathetic manor.  
Make use of the topography: The development should embrace the unique topography of the site and not 
attempt to impose a standard development layout and typology onto unsympathetic land conditions.  
Layout, heights and massing: The varied topography of hills at different degrees broken with level surfaces provides unique opportunities in terms of a naturalistic layout, heights and views. Amenity space and Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
158  parking should similarly resist formal layouts and instead be scattered across the site, particularly where a 
break between buildings would allow for views across the Thames floodplain. The rising topography 
provides opportunity for taller buildings that would have a greater impact on a flatter landscape, because 
the relative rise of the land behind the buildings reduces the visual impact. Building heights and 
orientations should be designed to maximise outlooks across the Thames floodplain, and to avoid 
overlooking and overshadowing the adjacent housing along Halt Road and Lower Roads.  
Streets:  The site could be served primarily by Halt Robin Road, utilising the existing access from that road 
and/or with additional access. The footpath from Lower Road should be upgraded, which would improve permeability and enhance access to Frank’s Park. A potential green route running from Frank’s Park across 
Belvedere should be facilitated through the site.

order to restore and enhance its wildlife function, and its function as part of a strategic green corridor.  
Figure 22: Belvedere Gas Holders site map and details  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
160  Site and surroundings  
Belvedere Gas Holders is a large site (3.53 ha) that sits north of the North Kent railway line within walking 
distance to Belvedere Station. The site fronts Yarnton Way, a main thoroughfare. It is occupied by two large 
gas holder structures which are now surplus to requirements due to upgrades being undertaken to 
pressurise the gas network.  
In addition to the two gas holders, a significant amount of vegetation is present which adjoins the linear 
strategic green wildlife corridor which runs along the site’s southern boundary following the route of the 
railway line. Industrial uses on industrial land neighbour the site to the east whilst the residential streets of 
Suther land Road and Maida Road run between Belvedere Station up to the site’s eastern boundary.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Dismantling aged industrial infrastructure and 
creating a significant new residential quarter within 
walking distance of Belvedere Station and Belvedere 
town centre.  The site contains two derelict gas holders. These will need 
to be disassembled and the land decontaminated prior to 
development.  
Facilitating the route of DLR between Yarnton Way 
and Belvedere Station and potentially incorporating a 
station stop at the heart of a new residential quarter.  The site falls within flood zone 3a and a critical drainage 
area where surface water flooding is prevalent.  
 
Improving the quality of the strategic green w ildlife 
corridor and improving deficiencies in access to nature 
through the retention and enhancement of mature 
vegetation and tree coverage.  Land across the site and along the site’s southern 
boundary (adjacent to the railway) may need to be 
safeguarded to ensure that aspirations for Crossrail and 
DLR can be delivered to Belvedere Station.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Qua lity Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the 
site, could be consi dered. 
Integrate development with green infrastructure:  Integrate the site with the surrounding area by 
establishing a network of streets and public spaces which connect with Sutherland Road and Maida Road. Establish accessible links to an area of species rich woodland habitat in the southern part of the site; and 
focus development onto a new green linear route that would provide a comfortable landscaped street 
environment capable of supporting a DLR route across the site. Design should maximise opportuniti es to 
support, restore and enhance the wildlife function of natural assets.  
Blocks and building heights:  Establish a consistent building line along Yarnton Way and ensure that new 
routes across the site are well defined by built form. Explore ways in which the gas holders might inform the 
alignment of building lines to provide a reminder of the site’s past industrial use. Use architecture and 
massing to reinforce the importance of those street spaces with an important transit function and consider 
the use of tall buildings up to 15 storeys to provide emphasis along the proposed DLR route.  
Uses:  Deliver residential accommodation using the site’s ecological features  as an asset to enhance the 
quality of environment for residents. Consider the use of maisonettes at ground and first floor levels to Bexley Draft Local Plan

166  Site and surroundings  
Crabtree Manorway South is a large brownfield site (5.03 ha) that is located 500m east of Belvedere 
Station on the northern side of the North Kent railway line. Bronze Age Way and the railway line form the 
site’s north- eastern and southern boundaries respectively and industrial land surrounds much of the site to 
the north and east. The site is comprised of a number of separate land parcels and industrial sheds and is bisected by Crabtree Manorway South. Site al location BEL06: Monarch Works  comes within 15m of the 
site’s western boundary and a footbridge over the railway line puts the site within walking distance to schools, Belvedere T own Centre and three bus routes (229, 401, 469).  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Establishing a substantial new residential neighbourhood 
within walking distance of Lower Belvedere town centre 
established residential area and local amenities.  Vehicular access to the site is provided via 
Crabtree Manorway South. This route also 
provides neighbouring sites with their sole 
vehicular link on to the wider road network.  
Creating substantial improvements in local permeability 
around Belvedere station by working in partnership with 
neighbouring sites. Co ntributions are likely to be sought for 
junction improvements at Bronze Age Way as well as a 
replacement pedestrian bridge over the railway to Mitchel 
Close.  Development proposals will be expected to 
consider how other land parcels within the wider 
industrial area could come forward in the future to 
avoid piecemeal development and allow for a 
rational structure of future streets and blocks.  
Facilitating the running of a Bus Rapid Transit route linking 
Belvedere station to Erith and bringing improvements to local 
connectivity.  Existing industrial uses next to the site will likely 
place a constraint on the form of new residential 
development.  
Meaningfully contributing to the creation of a new open space 
which would address the site’s deficiency in access to open 
space.  Development will need to consider how to mitigate 
against noise generated from Bronze Age Way and 
the railway line.  
Reducing flood risk by improving surface water runoff; and 
improving the amenity, ecology and environmental value of 
the watercourses, which run through and adjacent to the site.  The site falls within flood zone 3a , a critical 
drainage area where surface water flooding is 
prevalent , and is at  potential risk of elevated 
groundwater levels. 
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circum stances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the site, could be considered.  
Streets and public spaces:  Seek to improve accessibility across the site from east to west and work in 
partnersh ip with BEL06: Monarch Works  to create a street alignment that could establish a direct 
pedestrian and Bus Rapid Transit route through to Belvedere station and increase accessibility through the 
site into the surrounding area. Improve permeability of the s ite by introducing a legible internal movement 
network which establishes Crabtree Manorway South as a tree lined boulevard and a key north/south movement corridor providing green views towards Frank’s Park and maintains vehicular access into the Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
167  site and i ts industrial neighbours. Future intensification of the site could be facilitated by providing parking 
in a way that would allow it to be later developed, subject to improvements in public transport accessibility.  
Integrate development with green infrastru cture: The design should positively incorporate the natural 
assets of the site, restoring and enhancing the Belvedere dykes SINC and should create a high- quality open 
space along Bronze Age Way that would enhance the environment around the network of drainage ditches. 
An offset will be required between any built structure and the watercourses on and adjacent to the site. 
Define the green space with buildings that have active frontages. Use the ditch network to inform the 
alignment of streets, incorporating them as part of the street scene.  
Blocks and building heights : Establish a series of perimeter blocks with heights predominantly within the 
range of 4 to 8 storeys. Incorporate taller elements at locations within the street network that help to define the route of Bus Rapid Transit and provide emphasis at site entrances. Ensure that development 
blocks safeguard the potential of neighbouring land parcels to come forward as an integrated part of the block structure. Explore internal layouts and building orientations that could mitigate the impacts of 
industrial neighbours on residential amenity.  
Uses:  Deliver residential accommodation across the site and consider the use of maisonettes at ground and 
first floor levels to provide front doors on to the street whilst allowing for an internal arrangement of living space that could mitigate against the risk of flooding. Consider delivering a small shop at a point in the 
street network that would be visible and help support activate public space.  
Parking:  Deliver p arking in a variety of ways and consider using approaches that would allow for parking to 
be phased out as connectivity increases. If parking is to be incorporate into street spaces, it should be in a manner that ensures that vehicles are not a dominant component of the street scene. Consider 
incorporating an element of podium parking within the block structure that is wrapped by active frontages 
with additional short- term parking that can be developed out as a later residential phase.

should retain and sensitively incorporate the locally listed buildings.  A new internal network of streets should 
be created, including a north/south route along the previous Cross Street alignment and a new east/west route, 
serving as gateways into the site.  Proposals should also, as a minimum, retain the existing amount of designated 
Urban Open Space to serve both residents and town centre users.  Existing mature trees should b e retained.  
Proposals should not preclude public transport routes through the site and should not result in piecemeal 
development.

171  Site and surroundings  
Erith Western Gateway is located north of ERI02: Pier Road West  and ERI03: Pier Road East . It is a large, 
mostly developed site (3ha), characterised by a mix of commercial and residential uses.  The site is occupied 
by two locally listed buildings, Erith T own Hall to the south west, and Erith Post Office and former Sorting 
Office to the east; there are two residential tower blocks towards the centre and significant areas of open 
space on site, including an area of designated Urban Open Space. The LEB Substat ion is within the site, 
adjacent to the Carnegie former library building to the west. Erith town centre boundary extends into the site at the south -east corner. East of the site is Erith train station, with direct connections to London Bridge 
and Abbey Woo d; nearby bus stops serve the south of the borough. The River Thames is within 50m of the 
northern perimeter.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Conservation area and neighbouring listed and locally 
listed buildings offer potential focus for regeneration and 
inspiration for character of the development.  Parts of the site to the north are located within Flood 
Zones 2 and 3 and the north -western corner is 
identified as at particular risk of surface water flooding.  
Utilising existing green open spaces and mature 
vegetation.  LEB sub -station on the site immediately north of 
Carnegie Library.  
Some buildings on the site already achieve good densities 
with sound structure.  Heritage assets on site and in immediate surrounding 
conte xt. 
Chance to restore the historic high street character lost 
as a result of the 1960s demolition programme.  Some buildings are expected to be retained which 
constrains layout and outlook.  
Strong relationship with the river. Steep topography 
offers views to the River Thames and longer views across 
the Thames River valley.  Air and noise pollution along western edges of the site, 
particularly the portion of the site to the west of 
Walnut Tree Road.  
New routes through the site can better integrate the 
town centre with the rail station and the river.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been established using a design- led approach to site c apacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SP G.  However, given the character of this site , including existing housing 
and designated open space to be retained , it is considered that the minimum capacity in the Policy will be 
similar to the optimum capacity.  
Make use of the conservation area: The sit e includes a section of the Erith Riverside Conservation Area, 
which focus ses on the historic high street, including the group of historic buildings adjacent to the site, and 
the town’s relationship with the River Thames. The site offers opportunities to r ecreate the historic 
typology of a high street through redevelopment of vacant spaces creating a sense of enclosure.  
Make use of the historic buildings:  The site contains two locally listed buildings –  the former T own Hall and 
the Post Office –  and is with in the settings of other listed and locally listed buildings. The heritage buildings 
on the site must be retained and could serve as focal points within the development. The T own Hall should 
be restored and converted. The Post Office should only be extended where done in a sympathetic way and Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
172  with an extension that respects the height and massing of the original building and retains features of 
significance including the roof and the decorative urns.  
Streets: The size of the site offers the opportunity to create a ‘new piece of town’ that facilitates movement 
throughout the site as well as connections between the station, town centre and the Riverside Gardens. A north/south route along the previous Cross Street alignment and a new east/west r oute should be 
provided, with these routes serving as gateways into the site.  
Layout : Blocks should be arranged to reinforce this movement hierarchy, with the main routes fronted by 
active ground floor frontage and consistent building lines. Across the sit e, blocks should be laid out and 
orientated to maximise outlook to the River Thames and longer views across the river valley, exploiting the topography. Additionally, blocks must respond to the existing tower blocks, which will be retained.  
Public open sp aces: Public open spaces should improve the quality of existing provision, provide breaks 
within the built environment, maximise views to the Thames, and where they can utilise existing natural features, such as the mature trees to the south of the T own Ha ll.  
Heights and massing : The gradient differential between the part of the site to the south of the college and 
the surrounding streets offers potential for a taller building. Across the site, heights should be designed to 
maximise outlook to the River Th ames and longer views across the Thames River valley. Heights should be 
reduced towards the cluster of historic buildings on Erith High Street to mitigate any adverse impact on these heritage assets. Heights should reinforce the hierarchy of the existing a nd new movement network.

175  Site and surroundings  
Pier Road West is a brownfield site adjacent t o ERI03 Pier Road East and south of ERI01 Erith Western 
Gateway . The site is characterised by mixed use commercial development to the north, a small office block 
to the south, and extensive surface level car parking. The site is located within the Erith town centre 
boundary, the shopping parade along Pier Road cutting east west through the centre of the site. Access to 
the site from the north is achieved via Bexley Road, and from the south via Elrick Close and Queen Street. 
The site is well serviced by bus routes to all parts of the Borough and is a short walk from Erith train station.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Re-establish the late C19th urban grain through 
consolidation of Pier Road as the primary east -west 
walking and cycling route through Erith Town Centre.  There are statutory and local listed buildings to the 
west of the site and the Lesney Park Road 
Conservation Area is located to the west of the site.  
Re-establish Cross Street as an important north- south 
route in the town centre providing more direct walking 
routes north from Pier Road.  High levels of noise pollution and NOx emissions 
across much of the site due to its proximity to the 
A206.  
Structure visual links between Pier Road and Erith Town 
Hall and between Pier Road and Christ Church.  Parts of the site have a high risk of surface water 
flooding.  
Rationalise parking, reducing its visual and physical 
impact.  Within an area of open space deficiency  
Improve the presence of Queen Street Baptist Church.  Re-provision of parking.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the site, could be considered.  
Gateway to the town centre: The site should act as the gateway to Erith town centre, which is currently 
poorly defined. The built environment should indicate that a town c entre lays beyond, including through 
landmark buildings framing Pier Road along the Queens Road roundabout.  
Layout: Blocks along Pier Road should have active ground floor uses and consistent building lines to create 
a sense of urban enclosure and place. The arrangement should ensure a legible route linking Pier Road to the pedestrian crossing on Queens Road. Views of heritage assets should be framed, with a view along the 
route to Erith T own Hall and beyond culminating with the listed Christ Church. The blocks to the south of 
the site should frame the Queen Street Baptist Church, an attractive historic building.  
Blocks, heights and massing: The arrangements of the blocks should create a strong consistent frontage to 
Pier Road whilst optimising the spaces to the rear, potentially with the use of perimeter blocks. Although 
the primary frontage is to Pier Road, blocks should not turn their backs from the rear of their sites and 
should create attractive frontage along Bexley Road and Queens Road. Massing should a rticulate the 
transition in scale and grain from sensitive areas such as Erith T own Hall.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
176  Streets: Retain Pier Road as the main street.  Streets are more legible and at human scale when they are 
broken up by side streets running perpendicular.  For example , there is potential for short pedestrian route 
running north/north- west from Pier Road towards the T own Hall and to reinstate Cross Street through 
ERI01 Erith Western Gateway  to create a new connection towards Riverside Gardens and the River 
Thames. Potential for a new route towards Queen Street Baptist Church would bring this attractive 
building within the urban grain.  
Uses: T own centre uses should be located on the ground floor, primarily addressing Pier Road  but also 
along Bexley Road and Queen Street w here appropriate, with residential accommodation above.  
Parking provision: The functional and visual impact of car parking should be minimised, for example by 
incorporating parking within the new block structure. Proposals should avoid using large portions of the 
site as surface car parking.  
Future -proof against flood risk: Mitigate flood risk, for example by locating living accommodation above 
the maximum future flood level. Utilise SUDs to mitigate flood risk adjacent to the site’s north- eastern 
corner.  
Partnership working: Work in partnership with ERI03  Pier Road East  to develop a consistency of character 
and a rational block structure that can straddle site boundaries. The sites should not come forward separately unless master planning or other work is presented to ensure that doing so would not represent 
piecemeal development.

were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the us e of the 
site, could be considered.  
River Thames: The site provides one of the few opportunities within the borough for residential 
development directly on the River Thames. The development should enhance this riverside frontage 
including provision of an e xtended Thames Path public footpath, allowing for potential future onwards 
extension towards Erith Marshes, and should provide increased overlooking onto the Thames Path. Block heights, layout, and orientation should maximise access to and outlook onto thi s blue infrastructure.  
Layout and heights and massing : A variety of building types should be used to create transitions in scale 
across streets and to address the patchwork of uses and existing context surrounding the site. T aller 
buildings with large win dows could front the River Thames, whilst to the south of the site reduced heights 
and a variation in typology could provide a good transition to and strong relationship with the existing terraced housing to the south of the site. The layout should also consider providing a buffer between the Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
183  new blocks and the industrial site to the east, including potential amenity space, parking, and non-
residential ground floor uses.  
Uses:  The site is appropriate for primarily residential use. Some suitable employment uses could be 
provided at ground floor in the eastern part of the site to create a buffer with the industrial site to the east.  
Streets:  There are several existing and historical routes within the site, which should be extended to form 
an internal movement  network and integrated with the wider movement network.  Wheatley T errace Road 
should be r einstated as the key east -west route, connecting back to the town centre and Pier Square 
through the neighbouring ERI05: Morrisons Erith , and through this site to create an important connection 
with Manor Road.  A direct link to Wharfside Close should be establish and Appold Street should be 
improved as the key north/south route.  The junction of Wheatley T errace Road and Appold Street could 
form a focal point and allow for views across the site towards the River Thames.  
Thames path:  The Thames Path should be extended across the entire northern edge of the site, 
accommodating its future continuation eastwards, whilst retaining a connection to the existing route along 
Manor Road in the interim.  
Parking: The site currently includes an area of surface car parking to the rear of the Morrisons store. The 
development must be informed by a parking demand survey. Working with the Highway Authority, the 
appropriate level of parking should be provided across this and the neighbouring ERI05 Morrisons Erith . 
Flood risk: Manage flood risk wherever possible, for example by locating living accommodation above the 
maximum future flood level. Utilise SUDS to mitigate flood risk.  
Partnership working: The site should be conceived of as part of the opportunity for an urban extension 
represented by the size of the neighbouring ERI 05 Morrisons Erith. Ideally these sites would be brought 
forward as a single development, but if land ownership issues do not allow for this then it is essential that 
partnership working is used to develop a consistency of character and a rational block structure that can 
straddle site boundaries. The movement network should seamlessly cross both sites . The sites should not 
come forward separately unless master planning or other work is presented to ensure that doing so would not represent piecemeal development.

Land use and capacity  
1. This site is allocated for residential- led, mixed -use town centre development.  The design -led approach for 
optimising site capacity suggests that a minimum of 421  new homes can be achieved on this site along with, as a 
minimum, the re -provision of the existing floor space for town centre uses.  
Development approach  
2. Development of this site should transform the area.  As well as meeting other policy requirements, proposals 
should contribute to the realisation of Pier Square as a vibrant public space.  Buildings fronting on to Pier 
Square should be designed to frame the space and ground floor uses should create activity.   Proposals should 
also establish a legible internal network of routes and should provide an improved vehicular link between 
Colebrook Street and James Watt Way.   Proposals should not preclude public transport routes through the site.  
T own centre parking should be provided at an appropriate amount and designed to minimise its functional and 
visual impact.  Development of this site should not result in harmful piecemeal development, either within the 
site or across the wider urban block.

186  Site and surroundings  
Morrisons Erith adjoins ERI04: Erith Riverside  to the east; and is situated within the Erith town centre 
boundary. It is characterised by low density commercial development; a supermarket served by a large car 
park with vehicular access to the public highway along the southern boundary. Except for two tower blocks 
further to the west, the surrounding building heights are predominantly 2 -4 storeys. Key riverside features 
to the north include two blocks of four -storey residential properties overlooking the river, and Erith Pier 
adjoining Pier Square public space. Erith station is approximately 820m to the east of the site, and there are 
several town centre bus stops  within t he immediate vicinity.

Integrating the devel opment with Pier Square, a key public 
realm focal point.  Need to re -provide significant retail capacity in a 
more urban, pedestrian -friendly format.  
Incorporating open space within the development to address 
deficiency of open space within the area.  Northern parts of the site fall within Flood Zone 3.  
Providing opportunities for views and connections to the 
River Thames  including improvements to Erith Pier  Major surface water sewer runs to the west of the 
allocation.  
Providing an improved vehicular route from the town centre, 
improving the current configuration which brings vehicles 
through the car park.  Existing parking provision provides a key source of 
parking for the town centre and may need to be re -
provided.  
Maximise opportunities to support the wildlife function the 
River Thames.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Howeve r, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the site, could be considered.  
Riverside development not on the riverside: The site is located close to the River Thames, but the river 
frontage is blocked by the adjacent Wharfside Close development of 3 and 4 storey townhouses and blocks. Block heights, layout, and orientation should be designed to provide views through and past 
Wharfsi de Close to maximise outlook on to the River Thames, without causing adverse impacts to amenity 
such as daylight.  
Define Pier Square: The adjacent public realm at Pier Square has been identified as a key focal point within the town and will enjoy extensive public realm improvements and investment creating a vibrant public Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
187  space .  The development should help to define this public space through built form and uses .  Frontage 
facing Pier Square should be designed to frame the space and ground floor uses should create activity .  A 
pedestrian- friendly north/south route should provide a physical and visual connection.  
Provide upgrades to Erith Pier : the pier is within the town centre boundary but will need improvements to 
the structure to allow town centre uses on the pier, which will contribute to the realisation of Pier Square 
as a vibrant public space . 
Site as urban extension: Such a large si te within the town centre and surrounded by fragmented sites 
presents the opportunity to be ambitious, creating a new piece of town with a new character. The extent of this opportunity should also be considered in terms of the potential across the site and  the neighbouring 
ERI05: Erith Riverside.  
Layout, heights and massing : The western edge of the site should have a strong placemaking ambition 
fronting Pier Square, replacing the existing car parking with an attractive frontage that establishes a strong 
relationship to the street. This block offers the potential to provide a large format retail offer in a streets -
based development. A variety of building types should be used to create transitions in scale across streets and to address the patchwork of uses and existing context surrounding the site.  
Uses: The site should be largely residential but with significant quantum of town centre uses on lower 
floors including the provision of a large format retail store on the western edge of the site fronting Pier 
Squ are. Within the core of the site, residential uses will be appropriate at ground floor, but fenestration and 
other design choices should create a sense of activity and reinforce the movement hierarchy.  
Streets: The very large size of the site and its curre nt lack of well -defined sense of place and setting offer 
the opportunity to create a ‘new piece of town’ . A new series of routes across and within the site should 
create a clear movement hierarchy that facilitates a variety of flows throughout the site as well as 
connections towards the River Thames and towards the town centre. A number of existing and historical 
routes should be reinstated, including Wheatley T errace Road as the key east -west route continuing 
through the neighbouring ERI04: Erith Riverside . North/south routes should also be created, to host a 
block structure and enhance the permeability of the site. One of these north/south routes should enhance 
the existing pedestrian route that connects to Pier Square and the Erith Pier.  
The site currentl y accommodates vehicular traffic moving from Bexley Road/Wharfside Close to James 
Watt Way via the car park. Working with the Highway Authority, the development must re -route that 
traffic, either along the extended Wheatley T errace Road or outside the site, potentially from Bexley 
Road/Wharfside Close along Colebrook Street directly to the roundabout with James Watt Way.  
Parking provision: The site is currently largely comprised of surface car parking which is an important 
parking resource not only for the store but also for the town centre, but which currently has a large 
negative visual impact on the area. The functional and visual impact of any re -provided parking should be 
minimised, for example by incorporating within the new block structure.  
Future -proof against flood risk: Manage flood risk wherever possible, for example by locating living 
accommodation above the maximum future flood level. Utilise SUDS to mitigate flood risk.  
Partnership working: Work in partnership with ERI04: Erith Riverside  to dev elop a consistency of 
character and a rational block structure that can straddle site boundaries. The movement network should seamlessly cross both sites, including an extended Wheatley T errace Road. The sites should not come 
forward separately unless mast er planning or other work is presented to ensure that doing so would not 
represent piecemeal development.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Improving the setting of the former Bexley 
Maternity Hospital (a locally listed building) 
and incorporating the building to anchor the 
development and provide a focal point.  A 15m ecological buffer will be required along the site’s northern 
boundary to pr otect Bursted Woods, a borough grade II SINC and 
ancient woodland. A smaller ecological buffer will also be required 
along the site’s southern boundary which adjoins another a grade II 
SINC.  
Improving access to the ancient woodland of 
Bursted Woods and re sponding positively to 
this significant green asset, drawing upon its 
character to inform development.  The site contains a GP surgery. This use is not considered to be 
surplus to requirements and its loss will be resisted. It will 
therefore need to be rein corporated as part of redeveloping the 
site.  
Creating a distinctive character across the site 
with the cover provided by the woodland and 
train line reducing the development’s impact 
on existing suburban form.  Due to the proximity and orientation of neigh bouring dwellings 
and the former Maternity hospital, the northern part of the site 
may be limited in terms of height.  
Intensifying an underutilised site that has 
access to good levels of public transport 
provision and shops.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design- led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is consi dered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy will be similar to the optimum capacity.  
Streets and public spaces:  Retain the current east to west street alignment that integrates the site with 
Lavernock Road, and which provides a long view of the ancient woodland at the end of the street vista. 
Create a high -quality public space in front of the former Bexley Maternity Hospital which responds in its 
width and length to the dimensions of the locally listed building and which reinforces it as a focal  point 
within the development. Create smaller secondary street spaces that run in a north/south alignment which 
lead towards the ancient woodland and which are terminated to the south by built form instead of the 
railway line. Ensure that street spaces are  well defined by built form and that parking is not a dominant 
street quality.  
Heritage: The locally listed former Maternity Hospital should anchor the development, in terms of its visual 
prominence and informing the broader design aesthetic across the sit e. The building itself should be 
retained and converted into a block of flats. The layout of the site should be designed with regard to the focal building, particularly in terms of using the heights, massing, and orientation of new blocks closest to 
the locally listed building to frame the heritage asset.  
Blocks and building heights: Convert the former Maternity Hospital into a block of flats. Explore ways of 
sympathetically integrating new development with the former Hospital building, such as by adding a set of 
north/south running wings that would reinforce its formal symmetrical qualities and create an internal Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
192  courtyard that could look onto the ancient woodland. Use a finer grain of development with lower heights 
between the former Hospital building and the established residential areas to the north- east.  Explore ways 
of delivering a significant amount of development across the more secluded southern half of the site, for 
instance by using north/south ‘finger block’ elements up to five  storeys in height with lower east/west 
interlinking blocks fronting the east/west route.  
Uses: Deliver residential accommodation across the site including within the former Bexley Maternity 
Hospital. The GP surgery should be retained and re -provided on th e ground floor as part of a mixed -use 
block. Consider locating this facility close to an entrance to the site.  
Integrate development with green infrastructure:  T o the north of the site, a buffer zone of at least 15m, 
consisting of semi -natural habitats, wi ll be needed to protect ancient woodland and support the ecological 
functioning of this SINC.  The design also needs to incorporate a tree lined ecological buffer zone along the southern boundary to support, restore and enhance the wildlife function of the strategic green wildlife 
corridor running along the rail side.

Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Creating a residential -led mixed use development in 
Bexleyheath town centre that  is within walking 
distance to Bexleyheath bus hub and in one of the  
best -connected  areas of the borough.  Residential development backs onto the site’s northern 
boundary and could suffer from overlooking and 
overshadowing.  
Helping to draw the town centre east wards  along 
Broadway towards the Civic Offices , creating a more 
positive east -west connection and furthering the 
improvements made by the neighbouring Eastside 
Quarter development.  The site to the south is currently under construction, with 
heig ht purposely employed to provide a visible landmark. 
Development of this site will be expected to be less high 
than the neighbouring development so that Eastside 
Quarter can serve as a point of emphasis.  
Enhancing and activating a prominent corner within 
the town centre and mending the urban realm by 
incorporating the small pieces of undeveloped land 
alongside Arnsberg Way.  The site is located within a Tier 2 Archaeological Priority 
Area (due to the proximity of the site to the old Roman road 
of Watling S treet).  
 The site suffers higher levels of noise and poorer areas of air 
quality to the south and west of the site.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the site, could be considered.  
Blocks and building heights:  Establish a consistent building line along Arnsberg Way and Broadway. Use 
architecture and massing to create a visual and functional emphasis at the corner and a vista at the end of Arnsberg Way that helps people navigate themselves into the town centre.  Massing should avoid excessive 
overshadowing of residential gardens to the north.  Use massing to create a perimeter block with a clear 
separation between ‘shoulder height’ and taller elements up to 8  storeys which sit within the context of the 
Eastside Quarter development.  Buildings should be designed to avoid prejudicing future development to 
the east of the site.  
Uses and streets: Provide town centre uses at ground and lower floors to create a stro ng connection 
between internal commercial spaces and the street.  Incorporate residential accommodation above and explore ways of creating a transition between the street and residential entrances to mitigate the impact of 
air pollution and noise levels upon communal residential entrance lobbies.  
Parking provision: Redevelopment should optimise the site including by redeveloping the multi -storey car 
park as a mixed -use building, potentially incorporating parking within the new block. Any solution to 
provide  required amounts of car parking should minimise the functional and visual impact of the car 
parking, and in particular proposals should avoid using large portions of the site as surface car parking.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

surface water flooding is prevalent.  
Improving the setting of the listed building neighbouring 
the site and providing active frontage onto the street.  Mature tree on the northern edge of the site will need  to 
be retained.  
 
Providing residential accommodation within walking 
distance to Bexleyheath town centre, the Bexleyheath 
bus hub, Bexleyheath station and Lion Road 
neighbourhood centre.  Residential neighbours to the south of the site with 
potential overl ooking issues.  
Reducing flood risk by improving surface water runoff.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design- led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the 
site, could be considered.  
Large residential opportunity within Bexleyheath: The site’s location adjacent to Bexleyheath town centre 
and on the town’s main road make it an appropriate opportunity for higher density residential 
development.  The southern part of the site is comprised of surface vehicle parking, which presents an 
opportunity to optimise the land use through in- fill of this car parking space with residential development.  
Layout: The sit e has potential frontage on to four different streets and therefore must play an important 
placemaking role. The primary frontage should be along the Broadway, the town’s main street, where the 
development should provide a much stronger presence than the c urrent building. The edge fronting the 
Broadway should include active frontages at ground level, bring forward the development to continue the building line established by neighbouring buildings (whilst respecting the mature tree), and consider 
heights up to six storeys. The secondary frontages at Lion Road and Heathfield Road should respect the 
amenity of existing residential properties.  
Streets: The site should have strong relationships with the adjacent streets, particularly the Broadway and 
Lion Road. W ithin the site, new routes should be created to form a movement hierarchy. The main vehicular 
routes should be formed by extending existing access points into the site, including an east/west route extending from the current entrance from Lion Road through to the road that provides access to the 
Bowling Alley multi- storey car park (the level change will need to be addressed), and a north/south route 
extending from the current entrance from Heathfield Road into the site, though not crossing through to the 
northern edge of the site. T ertiary routes can be created off of these two main routes to provide access to 
the blocks. Although the site should be ‘opened up’ , with the east/west route in particular enhancing 
permeability, the movement hierarchy should rein force the existing highway network surrounding the site 
as the main routes, with the internal routes primarily providing access.  
Blocks and heights : The large size of the site provides opportunities to use differentiations in heights and 
typologies to opti mise development potential, reinforce the movement hierarchy, frame public realm, and Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
198  create visual interest. T aller buildings are more appropriate towards the north of the site, whilst heights 
should be reduced towards the south and near the existing resi dential properties along Lion Road. 
Although six storey buildings are likely the limit on the Broadway frontage, blocks to the rear could extend 
to up to eight storeys before reducing in height towards the south. Similarly, linear and courtyard blocks 
are more appropriate towards the north, whilst towards the south typologies should transition to the 
surrounding lower density residential area, potentially including the use of stacked maisonettes giving way to terraced housing. The blocks must be carefully a rranged to avoid adverse impacts on the adjacent locally 
listed buildings and should seek to frame these buildings positively.  
Uses: The site should be largely residential. Although outside of the town centre boundary, limited 
commercial uses could be empl oyed on the ground floor to create an active frontage along the Broadway, 
reflecting that route’s role as the high street within Bexleyheath. The remainder of the site should be 
residential.  
Partnership working: Partnership working with surrounding landowners will be necessary to secure access 
arrangements, both for construction and use purposes, including for example the road that provides access 
to the Bowling Alley multi- storey car park.

consistency of massing and height.  
Facilitating new connections between 
surrounding streets and increasing local 
permeability between Broadway and Bexleyheath

western boundaries.  Development will need to ensure 
adequate levels of privacy and daylight are maintained to 
neighbouring properties.  
Responding positively to long views of the site 
and reinforc ing the presence of a new local route.   
Creating active street frontages within the street

Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design- led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is considered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy will be similar to the optimum capacity.  
Streets:  Create a new street across the site between Rowan Road to Stratton Road which is well defined by 
active building fro ntages. Consider creating a ‘slow street’ that would inhibit vehicular through movements.  
Buildings and heights:  Consider using a combination of building typologies with shallow footprints that 
would allow for a building line to define both sides of the new street. Use architecture and massing to 
create a visual emphasis at the corner of West Street and Rowan Road to help with visual wayfinding when 
approach the site from the town centre. Consider the use of a flatted block up to 4 storeys along the site’s  
eastern boundary with a core that could also front on to Bynon Avenue. Consider the use of a row of terraces along the site’s western edge that could echo a sense of vertical rhythm found in surrounding 
development.  
Uses:  Explore ways of incorporating opp ortunities for play within the street space and perhaps at the 
junction of Harlington Road and Stratton Road.

Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Optimising a vacant back -land plot , providing residential 
development within walking distance of Bexleyheath 
Station and Local Centre and in an area with moderate 
levels of public transport provision.  The site has a single point of access and egress from 
Belvedere Road.  This arrangement would make 
walking and cycling journeys longer if travelling 
towards Bexleyheath station.  
Increasing levels of permeability across the local area and 
shortening walking distances to surrounding amenities.  The railway line is a source of intermittent noise 
along the site’s northern boundary.  
Enhancing the biodiversity corridor which runs along the 
railway edge by expanding this green asset into the site.  Established residential plots back onto much of the 
site creating large stretches of inactive garden 
boundary fencing.  
Incorporating open space provision to address the area’s 
open space deficiency.   
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design -led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is considered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy will be similar to the optimum capacity.  
Streets and public spaces:  Consider creating a communal green within the southern half of the site which is 
protected from the elements by development and which is well defined by built form with active frontages. Establish a cross route from east to west for pedestrians and cyclists by creating a link through adj acent 
residential alleyway to Church Road.   Improve access arrangements onto Belvedere Road for vehicles, 
including securing speed reduction measures along Belvedere Road, such as raised table junctions and 
speed cushions.  
Blocks, buildings and heights: Co nsider creating a perimeter apartment block up to 4 storeys across the 
northern half of the site to make good use of this area’s regular proportions and less sensitive amenity boundary next to the railway, whilst ensuring the green corridor along the railw ay is enhanced .  Consider 
using a finer grain of development along site edges and fronting communal green spaces .  
Uses:  Provide residential development across the site and create an ecological buffer along the railway 
edge that could be brought into the development and incorporated into amenity space for the perimeter 
flatted block s.  Approximately one -third of the site should be provided as a green open space to address the 
area’s open space deficiency.  Bexley Draft Local Plan

2. Development of the site should transform the area by introducing a residential neighbourhood , with frontages 
set well back from the River Cray, creating a new riverside walk connecting the town centre with Crayford 
Meadows  (also known as Cr ayford Rough) , and introducing frontages along Roman Way.  Proposals should also 
provide connections between the areas to the north of the site into the town centre and to the station.  The 
development should look to enhance the area’s natural assets, part icularly the River Cray and Crayford 
Meadows .

210  Site and surroundings  
This medium-sized site (1.74ha) is located immediately outside the boundary of Crayford district town 
centre.  This brownfield site was formerly industrial but has since been cleared and is now comprised of 
hardstanding.  Although near  to both the town centre and Crayford station, the site is surrounded by built 
and natural barriers which lend it a sense of isolation.  One such barrier is the busy A207 (Roman 
Way)/Stadium Way part of Crayford’s one -way system , which is dominated by fast- moving vehicles and 
offers no facility for pedestrian crossing.  The River Cray is another barrier, cutting the site off from the 
residential neighbourhood to the north, although the long river frontage offers opportunities for quality outlook and improved river access, as well as being a significant ecological asset.  
Similarly, Crayford Meadow s (also known as Crayford Rough) to the west is designated Green Belt and 
Urban Open Space, which provides high -quality natural amenity, a significant ecological asset, as well as a 
link to the Grade I listed Hall Place and its gardens.  The industrial site to the south is currently in uses that 
are not highly polluting but do involve significant vehicle movement causing potential noise issues.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Developing a large site that delivers a 
significant amount of homes within walking 
distance of Crayford station and town 
centre, with access to moderate levels 
public transport provision.  Access to the site is given via Maxim Road with a brid ge crossing over 
the River Cray.  This single point of access is a constraint for vehicular 
traffic. 
Delivering development that fronts onto 
the River Cray, enhancing the ecological 
value of the riverbank and creating a 
welcoming route between the town centre 
and Crayford Meadows . The adjacent Crayford Meadows  is designated Green Belt, Urban 
Open Space an d metropolitan SINC, indicating its high amenity value 
and its regional ecological significance.  
Opening the River Wansunt culverted 
watercourse to ‘daylight’ the river and 
improve the amenity of the area.  An offset from any built structure to the River C ray, and River 
Wansunt culvert should be observed , in line with the detailed site 
assessment in Appendix B of the Bexley SFRA Level 2.  
Providing frontage along Roman Way, 
adding definition and a sense of enclosure 
to a street space currently defined by the 
presence of vehicular traffic.  This site is located predominantly in flood zone 3a.  The River Cray 
was relocated in the past further up the side of the natural valley.  As 
such it is situated at a higher level than much of Crayford town centre.  
This mea ns that if water spills over the right bank it will collect at the 
bottom of the valley, potentially resulting in deep, rapid onset 
flooding.  
Increasing local permeability between 
London Road and Stadium Way by 
establishing crossing points over the River 
Cray.  The industrial land to the south could harm amenity particularly in 
terms of noise caused by vehicular movement.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Development capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been established using a design-led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  Given the size of the site and character of the area, it is considered that 
the minimum capacity specified in the Policy wil l be similar to the optimum capacity.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
211  Integrate development with green and blue infrastructure: The design should be anchored by the two 
high- quality natural assets adjacent to the site; the River Cray and Crayford Meadows .  Block heights, 
layout, and orientation should maximise access to and outlook onto this green and blue infrastructure.  The 
site offers a long river frontage which should be enhanced through development, including enhancement of 
riverside habitat for wildlife and a new green, publicly ac cessible  route along the River Cray connecting the 
town centre to Crayford Meadows  and beyond.   
Canal -style development fronting , but set well back from,  the River Cray  would provide the green route 
with overlooking in an intimate setting.  Development should also front Crayford Meadows .  Design should 
maximise opportunities to support the wildlife function these natural assets provide.  The lack of a well -
defined local context indicates that the natural assets are likely the best inspiration for the desig n ethos .  
The opportunity to open  the Wansunt River culverted watercourse should be explored.  
Water management: The layout and design should respond to the flood risks from all sources, siting development in accordance with the sequential approach to mitig ate some flood risks.  Flood risk 
management should be addressed through design to reduce flood risks wherever possible, including siting all living accommodation above the maximum 1% AEP plus climate change flood level.  The south west 
corners of the site bound an area outside the modelled 1% AEP plus climate change extent suggesting this 
is the safest route for access and egress, but consideration of access and egress routes across the site to 
this point would be required.  
Layout and heights and massing : Blocks should be laid out and orientated to maximise access to and 
outlook onto the River Cray and Crayford Meadows .  Block heights should mitigate the impact on the 
spacious character of Crayford Meadows , which is designated as Green Belt and Urban Open S pace.  The 
layout should also consider providing a buffer between the new blocks and the industrial site to the south, 
potentially with amenity space or parking provision.  
Streets:  The site should be served by extending the established route from Maxim Road into a primary 
road.  North/south routes should be created by extending the closes along Wolsley Close in the residential 
development to the north; these routes would enhance per meability by creating connections across the 
River Cray and the bridges would enhance access to the Cray by providing spaces to view it from above.  Street layouts should also be future- proofed to allow further connections to the south if the adjacent 
indu strial site were to come forward for development, which would allow for uninterrupted connections 
from Maxim Road to the development at CRA0 3: Sainsbury’s Crayford .

should also improve and extend existing routes to establish a legible internal network that connects to the 
existing street network; one route should extend to a new p edestrian link across Crayford Road, which the 
developer should contribute to because it would improve onward access to the station and therefore allow for 
increased densities.  Town centre parking should be provided at an appropriate amount and designed to 
minimise its functional and visual impact.

214  Site and surroundings  
T ower Retail Park is a large brownfield site (3.42 ha) that is located within Crayford town centre.  The site is 
occupied by several retail warehouses arranged around a large surface level car park.   As a result, the site 
creates a large car dominated void  along much of Crayford Road, the town centre’s main thoroughfare.  
Opposite the site, new mixed -use development sits alongside Crayford T own Hall (a locally listed red brick 
building).  Parades of shops go on to define the western stretch of Crayford Road whilst a pocket of 
terraced houses gives form to its southern stretch.  
Industrial uses on industrial land sit behind the site and adjoin its northern and eastern boundaries.  
Crayford Station is close by and three bus routes (96, 428 and 492) stop directly  outside the site boundary.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Intensifying a large site within walking 
distance to Crayford station with access 
to moderate levels of public transport 
provision.  The western corner of the site is crossed by a 275k volt overhead 
power cable.  Development height will therefore be constrained across 
this area of the site.  
Introducing residential development 
within Crayford’s town centre boundary 
using the footprint of each retail 
warehouse as a discrete development 
block.  The site has a single point of vehicular access via Crayford Road and 
gives access to the neighbouring industrial area.  This through route 
will need to be maintained.  
Establishing active frontage a long 
Crayford Road and reducing the 
dominance of parked vehicles within the 
street scene.  Development will need to respond to the proximity of industrial uses 
along the site’s northern and eastern boundaries and mitigate for 
potential amenity issues through building design and layout.  
Using the existing pattern of trees across 
the car park to inform an alignment of new 
street spaces which would incorporate 
established planting.  The car park is known to be used almost to capacity during peak hours.  
Development would therefore be required to identify the extent to 
which additional parking would likely be required.  
Creating new local links across the site 
between Crayford Road and the River 
Cray and working with neighbouring sites 
to improving local permeabi lity towards 
Crayford station.  The primary vehicular access is from the Crayford one -way system 
which suffers from congestion and related noise and air pollution.  
Improving the setting of the locally listed 
clock tower and creating a more well-
defined public space of which the clock 
tower can be the focal point.  An 8m offset from any built structure to the River Wansunt culvert 
which runs under the site should be observed.  Refer to other guidance 
section below for additional information on flood risk.  
Opening the River Wansunt culverted 
watercourse to ‘daylight’ the river.  This site is located predominantly in flood zone 3a. The River Cray was 
relocated in the past further up the side of the natural valley.  As such it 
is situated at a hig her level than much of Crayford town centre.  This 
means that if water spills over the right bank it will collect at the 
bottom of the valley, potentially resulting in deep, rapid onset flooding.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
215  Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Deve lopment capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design- led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances 
were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the 
site, could be considered.  
Water management: The layout and design should respond to the flood risks from all sources, siting 
development in accordance with the sequential approach to mitigate some flood risks.  Flood risk 
management should be addressed through design to reduce flood risks wherever possible, including siting all living accommodation above the maximum 1% AEP plus climate change flood level.  The south west 
corners of the site bound  an area outside the modelled 1% AEP plus 70% climate change extent suggesting 
this is the safest route for access and egress, but consideration of access and egress routes across the site 
to this point would be required.  The  opportunity to open the Wansunt River culverted watercourse should 
be explored.  
Unlocking development:  Explore ways of providing retail parking in a more efficient manner, for instance 
through multi -storey or integrated within the centre of development bl ocks, to help free up site area for 
intensification.  
Streets: Consider creating a new primary street that incorporates the row of established trees closest to 
the current retail frontage.  Bend this new street towards Crayford T own Hall and establish a new  
pedestrian crossing across Crayford Road, establishing the potential for a future route towards Crayford 
Station via CRA03 Sainsbury’s Crayford.  
Block s tructure : Each retail warehouse could form the extents of a development block, allowing for a 
phased approach to redevelopment.  The car park could be intensified with two further blocks, establishing 
a consistent building line along Crayford Road.  
Height s and massing : A differentiation in height from 4 to 8 storeys could be used along Crayford Road, 
stepping up from Clock T ower to reinforce the presence of a new entrance to the site and link between the 
site and CRA03 Sainsbury’s Crayford.  
Uses:  T own centre uses should be located on the ground floor, primarily addressing Crayford Road with 
residential accommodation above.  The existing floor space of commercial, business and service uses on the 
site should be retained, although can be provided in a different configuration.  T own centre car parking 
could be intensified and incorporated within a new block structure, perhaps located as a buffer to neighbouring industrial uses.  
Public realm improvements: The development should help to establish a new material palette within 
Crayford.  The development should contribute to public realm improvements reflecting this palette on and 
off the site including higher quality paving materials and signage throughout the town centre.

216  Other guidance  
Car parking:  The development must be informed by a parking demand survey looking at demand across the 
town centre and the role that the site can play in meeting demand.  The appropriate amount of car parking 
should be informed through discussion with the Highway Authority.  
Archaeology:  The site falls within both a Tier 2 and a Tier 3 Archaeological Priority Area and exceeds 2ha, 
so the s ite would be viewed as a Large Major development within the Archaeological risk model.  The site is 
assessed as high risk on the GLAAS model.  An application would be required to be accompanied by an 
Archaeological Assessment/Statement of Archaeological Si gnificance.  
Heritage:  The Crayford Clock T ower, which is a Locally Listed Building is situated along the site frontage 
onto Crayford Road.  Development would be required to have due regard to the setting of this building by 
illustrating sensitivity to thi s designated heritage asset.  
Risk of flooding:  Mixed use development, where it contains residential development is classed as more 
vulnerable and the site is within Flood Zones 2 and 3a.  The application of the borough- wide sequential test 
has demonstrated  that residential development is acceptable within the Local Plan sustainable 
development locations.  In addition, the exception test has been applied .  Refer to Bexley SFRA Level 1 and 
Level 2, including the flood risk information sheet in appendix 2 of t he SFRA Level 2 Report: site ID AS58.  A 
site -specific flood risk assessment including drainage impact assessment, and detailed drainage strategy 
will be required to inform design.  The need for compensatory floodplain storage should be discussed with 
the LPA and the Environment Agency.  
Biodiversity:  An Ecological Impact Assessment will be required to inform design.  Refer to Bexley  Green 
Infrastructure Study  Chapter 10.  
Trees:  Quality trees should be identified at the start of outline design proposals so that layouts can take 
these, and other existing green infrastructure, into account early on and flag up any challenges in their 
retention.  Proposals will be required to undert ake an arboriculture assessment.  Also refer to the Bexley 
Green Infrastructure Study  (Chapter 9 on urban greening).  
Environmental quality:  Road noise affects parts of the site, and air pollution from vehicles  and from the 
adjacent industrial area .  Refer to Development Plan policies, and the Local Plan Transport Assessment 
Chapter 1 0 on Air Quality . 
Electricity transmission:  the following publications are available from the National Grid  –  
• A sense of place – design guidelines for development near high voltage overhead lines ; and  
• National Grid’s guidelines for developing near high voltage overhead lines .

Land use and capacity  
1. This site is allocated for residential- led, mixed -use town centre development.  The design -led approach for 
optimising site capacity suggests that a minimum of 448  new homes can be achieved on this site along with, as a 
minimum, the re -provision of the existing floor space for town centre uses.   
Development approach  
2. Development of this site should transform the area.  As well as meeting other policy requirements, proposals 
should establish a legible internal network of routes including new connections to Crayford Station, and the 
developer should contribute to new pedestrian crossings across Roman Way and Crayford Road to improve 
access to the site and therefore allow for increased densities.   Proposals should create a sense of arrival from 
the station and public open spaces should be provided within the site.  T own centre parking should be provided 
at an appropriate amount and designed to minimise its functional and visual impact.  Proposals should not 
result in harmful piecemeal development either within the site or across the larger urban block.

218  Site and surroundings  
This large brownfiel d site (2.76ha) is located within Crayford district town centre and is adjacent to 
Crayford station.  It is currently comprised of a large retail warehouse set far back from the street within 
the associated car parking.  A power line runs across the site.  
The existing use and arrangement fail to create the pedestrian- friendly, vibrant sense of place that is 
appropriate for such a well -connected town centre site.  The surrounding sites do not offer a well -defined 
character, except for the neighbouring T own H all Square development which introduced mixed -use, higher -
density development into Crayford, including six -storey blocks of flats and ground floors with retail and 
community uses.  
Opportunities and constraints  
Opportunities  Constraints  
Creating a new residential -led mixed -use 
quarter within Crayford town centre to 
better utilise a sparsely developed site.  Vehicular movements are facilitated by a single connection onto 
Stadium Way and, though most of the site has a PTAL of 2, a small 
portion does regist er as 1 (poor).  Without interventions to improve 
the local highway network and local levels of connectivity, 
development potential will likely be constrained.  
The creation of a significant amount of new 
development offers the opportunity to 
establish a d ominant new residential 
character to the north of Crayford station.  The site hosts two pylons,  and an overhead 275kV power cable runs 
between them.  The route of the overhead cable is a considerable 
constraint on development as clearance will need to be maintained to 
ensure safety.  
Improving accessibility levels north of the 
railway line by establishing new routes 
through the site between Crayford station, 
Crayford Road, the green belt, and the 
wider Crayford area.  ‘Big box’ retail warehousing occupies t he southern half of the site with 
the northern half of the site laid out as surface parking.  Phasing will 
be crucial to ensure that the store remains serviceable and retail 
activity can continue whist the site is unlocked for intensification.  
Creating a new sequence of public spaces, 
improving Crayford’s townscape and 
reducing the visual dominance of cars and 
the power line.  The site is located predominantly in flood zone 3a. The River Cray was 
relocated in the past further up the side of the natural valley.  As such 
it is situated at a higher level than much of Crayford town centre.  This 
means that if water spills over the right bank it will collect at the 
bottom of the valley, potentially resulting in deep, rapid onset 
flooding.   
Potential to open  the River Wansunt 
culverted watercourse to ‘daylight’ the 
river . An 8m offset from any built structure to the River Wansunt culvert 
should be observed.  The River Wansunt as a culvert poses a potential 
constraint as the alignment can potentially fa ll within the boundaries 
of the site allocation.  
 The site is prone to noise pollution from both Roman Way and the 
railway line with the flat sparely built out site allowing noise to travel 
far.  
Indicative design responses and development parameters  
Dev elopment capacity: What are considered to be optimum residential development capacities have been 
established using a design- led approach to site capacity based on the Mayor’s Good Quality Homes for All 
Londoners Consultation Draft SPG .  However, the location and size of the site suggest that if circumstances Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
219  were to change, a capacity higher than the minimum set in the Policy, which further optimises the use of the 
site , could be considered.  
Urban extension: Such a large site within the town centre and surrounded by fragmented sites presents 
the opportunity for a bold ambition to create a ne w piece of town in an ‘urban extension. ’  The site should 
be conceived as an opportunity to build a new place with a new character.  
Water management:  The layout and design should respond to the flood risks from all sources, siting 
development in accordance with the sequential approach to mitigate some flood risks.  Flood risk 
management should be addressed through design to reduce flood risks wherever possible, including siting all living accommodation above the maximum 1% AEP plus climate change flood level.  The south east 
corner of the site bounds an area of F lood Zone 1 and is outside the area of surface water flood risk 
suggesting this is the safest route for access and egress, but consideration of access and egress routes 
across the site to this point would be required.  The opportunity to open  the Wansunt River culverted 
watercourse should be explored.  
Mend the poor character: Development offers the opportunity to mend the poor character exhibited by 
the current arrangement and uses, with potential to create a strong new character.  The northern half of 
the site should have a strong placemaking ambition along Roman Way, replacing the ill -defined space with 
an attractive frontage that establishes a strong relationship to the street.  This block offers the potential to 
provide a large format retail offer in a streets -based development.  The other main frontage should be at 
the sout hern end of the site facing the station.  This block and associated public realm should provide a 
strong sense of arrival from the station.  This block should provide a legible connection from the station 
into the rest of the site and to the town beyond, c reating an ‘anchor’ between the station and town centre.  
The development should contribute to public realm improvements around Crayford Station and across the 
local highway network.  
A new street network: The very large size of the site and its current lac k of well -defined senses of place 
and setting offer the opportunity to create a ‘new piece of town. ’  Conceiving of the site as an urban 
extension, development should present strong frontages facing both the Roman Way to the north and the 
station to the so uth.  A new series of routes across and within the site should create a clear movement 
hierarchy that facilitates a variety of movement throughout the site as well as connections between the station, town centre and towards the Green Belt .  The development  should also improve the existing 
connection to the station provided from the site via the T own Street Hall Square development.  Street 
orientation should be arranged to reduce the visual impact of the overhead power lines within the new 
streetscape.  Stad ium Way should be reconfigured as a ‘green boulevard .’ 
Heights and massing:  The large size of the site provides opportunities to use differentiations in heights 
from four to eight storeys to optimise development potential, reinforce the movement hierarchy,  frame 
public realm, and create visual interest.  Block heights should consider the potential for views into Crayford 
Meadows , whilst conversely height and massing should be designed to mitigate any impact on the spacious 
character of this green belt area.   Ta l l er buildings must avoid the overhead power line.  
Uses:  The site should be largely residential but with significant quantum of town centre uses , particularly at 
the ground floor, including  the provision of a large retail store fronting Roman Way and other retail and 
commercial uses facing the station.  Within the core of the site and without  breaking the flow of town 
centre uses , residential uses may be appropriate at ground floor  if mitigated against flooding .  Fenestration 
and other design choices  therefore should create a sense of activity and reinforce the movement hierarchy.  Bexley Draft Local Plan
 
220  Parking provision: The functional and visual impact of car parking should be minimised, for example by 
incorporating parking within the new block structure.  Parking could be positioned as a buffer to 
neighbouring industrial uses.  Proposals should avoid using large portions of the site as surface car parking.
