ADOPTED JULY 2016
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 The North Northamptonshire Joint Core Strategy (JCS) is the strategic Part 1 
Local Plan for Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough. It outlines a 
big picture to be developed in more detail through the Part 2 Local Plans prepared by the 
District and Borough Councils and by Neighbourhood Plans prepared by Neighbourhood 
Planning Groups. The JCS is prepared by the Joint Planning Unit (JPU), reporting to the 
North Northamptonshire Joint Committee (JC) made up of elected representatives from the 
District, Borough and County Councils. Northamptonshire County Council is the minerals 
and waste planning authority. The Minerals and Waste Local Plan (adopted October 2014) 
forms part of the development plan.
Figure 1: Plan making in North Northamptonshire
1.2 The first Core Spatial Strategy (CSS) prepared by the JC was adopted in 2008 and 
covered the period to 2021. It has been reviewed to take account of progress and to plan 
forward to 2031. The review has also responded to the Government’s reforms to the planning 
system, including the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the revocation of 
Regional Plans. These have given greater scope for the JCS to respond to local needs and 
aspirations, although it must still be based on sound evidence and meet objectively assessed 
development needs and infrastructure requirements. The adopted JCS supersedes the 2008 
CSS in its entirety.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE

ADOPTED JULY 2016Figure 2: The review of the Joint Core Strategy
1.3 The review started in 2009. Early work involved a series of stakeholder workshops 
run in conjunction with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) 
and a Rural Workshop and Small Towns Workshop run with Action for Communities in 
Rural England (ACRE). Wider engagement  included consultation on an Issues Paper, which 
involved events in each of the towns and activities aimed at engaging young people. This 
included a Youth Conference organised with Groundwork North Northamptonshire.
1.4 A 10 week consultation was undertaken between August and October 2012 on 
an Emerging Plan which included draft policies and the strategic sites to deliver these. 
Further consultation was undertaken on strategic housing and employment sites and the 
development principles for these between August and October 2013. The Pre-Submission 
JCS was consulted on for 6 weeks in January-March 2015. Focused Changes were made to 
the Plan as a result of the consultation feedback and these were consulted on for 6 weeks 
during June-July 2015, following which, the Plan was submitted for examination. As part of 
the examination of the JCS, examination hearings took place in November 2015. Proposed 
main modifications to the JCS arising from the examination were consulted on for 6 weeks 
(February – March 2016), with the consultation feedback assisting the Inspector in finalising 
his report into the JCS. Reports on all previous consultation are available on the JPU web-
site www.nnjpu.org.uk.
1.5 Extensive technical work has been completed to ensure that the JCS is based on 
robust evidence1 that justifies the choices made. As well as the evidence base prepared for 
the 2008 CSS (much of which remains relevant) further studies have been completed on 
matters including population, transport, employment, housing, retailing, flood risk, strategic 
sites and the urban structure of settlements. The policies have also been subject to plan wide 
viability testing to ensure that the proposals are viable across the area. An Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan (IDP) has informed the Plan and has been published. This, together with 
reports on technical work undertaken by or for the JPU, is available on the JPU web-site (in 
the Publications section under Evidence Base). Links to other relevant studies are provided 
throughout this Plan.Early engagement & options development

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–20316
ADOPTED JULY 20161.6 A number of the strategic sites and Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) identified 
in Policies 23 and 29 (and on the Key Diagram) already have planning permission or have 
been identified in adopted plans.
1.7 The Plan takes forward many aspects of the 2008 CSS, including the emphasis on securing 
better infrastructure and services; the concentration of new development within the Growth 
Towns and connected settlements forming the urban spine of the area; and the vision for an 
enhanced framework of Green Infrastructure. Housing and employment targets, while lower than 
in the previous plan, remain high. This reflects the ambitions of the partner authorities and the 
major commitments that exist for development, particularly at the Sustainable Urban Extensions 
(SUEs). Although Government policy no longer identifies nationally important ‘Growth Areas’, 
North Northamptonshire remains well placed to play this role on the terms set out in this Plan.
1.8 While much remains the same, the review of the Core Strategy has resulted in a 
shift in approach on some issues. The most important changes are summarised below:
n A more locally distinctive vision  that sets out what the individual parts of North 
Northamptonshire will contribute to the area. This recognises two distinct functional 
sub-areas , with the northern area focused on Corby and Kettering and the southern 
area focused on Wellingborough and the ‘Four Towns’ area of East Northamptonshire;
n Increased protection for North Northamptonshire’s cultural and environmental 
assets , through a set of Core Policies at the start of the Plan that seek to protect and 
enhance assets (Policies 1 – 7);
n Stronger recognition of the importance of the natural environment and the 
opportunities it provides , with new special policy areas for the Nene and Ise Valleys and the 
Rockingham Forest to supplement the existing approach to Green Infrastructure, in particular 
recognising its role in enhancing connectivity between settlements (Policies 19 – 21);
n Greater emphasis on urban design principles and how places could change for 
the better , in particular to enhance design quality and emphasise the importance of 
connectivity to make it easier for people to get into town centres and out to surrounding 
countryside and ensure that new developments connect well to existing settlements 
(Policies 8 and 15);
n Up to date housing targets to meet the objectively assessed needs in North 
Northamptonshire  and to recognise the strategic opportunity to accommodate even 
more growth in Corby in line with the spatial strategy of the Plan (Policies 28 and 29);
n A more positive and flexible approach to economic development , with minimum 
job targets to deliver at least one job for each additional worker, plus additional growth 
in the southern area to tackle high levels of out-commuting and a historic jobs/worker 
imbalance in the Four Towns area. New policies are proposed on rural diversification and 
logistics (Policies 22 – 25);
n An enhanced role for Rushden as a Growth Town  in recognition of local ambitions and 
the potential of the town to deliver significant new homes and jobs. The Sustainable Urban 
Extension proposed to the east of the town (Policy 33) will play a major role in this, alongside 
the permitted retail and leisure development at Rushden Lakes (see paragraph 5.30);NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–20317
ADOPTED JULY 2016n An amended retail strategy  reflecting the role that Rushden Lakes2 will play in meeting 
the needs of residents in the southern area, and the need to adapt the offer in the town 
centres of Wellingborough and Rushden accordingly. The focus of investment in the 
northern area will be the town centres of Kettering and Corby;
n Identification of Strategic Sites to help deliver new homes, jobs and infrastructure . 
The Plan confirms support for strategic housing sites identified in previous plans and 
identifies the boundary of the SUE west of Corby (Policy 32) and the broad location of 
a SUE to the east of Rushden (Policy 33). A number of new strategic employment sites 
are identified and the area around the Rockingham Motor Racing Circuit (referred to as 
Rockingham Enterprise Area) is identified as having significant potential (Policy 27). The 
Plan sets out development principles for these sites to guide their development 
n Providing a framework for locally-driven plans in the rural areas , through a 
simplified settlement hierarchy (Policy 11) which provides more flexibility for local and 
neighbourhood plans to determine how much development is needed in local areas within 
the context of objectively assessed needs of the Housing Market Area. Strategic housing 
requirements are provided only for the four largest villages. A new policy (Policy 13) 
outlines when development might be acceptable as an exception to the normal policy 
of restraint in the countryside and a long term, exceptional opportunity is identified to 
consider a new village at Deenethorpe Airfield (Policy 14).
1.9 The following section of the Plan identifies the Vision and desired Outcomes for 
North Northamptonshire. The policies to help achieve these are arranged as follows:
n Section A  sets out Core Policies  that are applicable to most forms and scales of 
development. Under the overall theme of sustainable development (Policy 1), policies are 
set out to:
n Protect and enhance assets (Policies 2-7)
n Ensure high quality development (Policies 8, 9); and
n Secure necessary infrastructure and services (Policy 10).
n Section B  sets out Spatial Policies  to develop shaping principles in greater detail. These 
start with a spatial strategy based on:
n Establishing a strong network of settlements and rural areas (Policies 11-14)
n Improving connections to places within and beyond the area (Policies 15-18)
n Enhancing the framework of green infrastructure (Policies 19-21)
 This gives the context for subsequent policies on:
n Delivering Economic Prosperity (Policies 22-27); and
n Delivering Homes (Policies 28-31)
n Section C  sets out Development Principles for Strategic Sites  for six strategic sites/
locations that are important to delivering the Plan (Policies 32-38).
n Section D  provides the Monitoring Framework  through which the delivery of the Plan 
will be monitored and reviewed.2 This was permitted 
by the Secretary of 
State in June 2014 and 
is expected to open 
late in 2016. Rushden 
Lakes is a mixed retail, 
recreation and leisure 
scheme, including 
garden centre and retail 
units totalling no more 
than 32,511 square 
metres net sales area 
(of which no more than 
929sqm for convenience 
goods), together with an 
hotel and leisure club, 
restaurants and lakeside 
visitor centre.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE

THE CONTEXT FOR THE PLAN
1.10 The Plan takes into account other relevant strategies and programmes. This includes 
the requirements of the Northamptonshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan by recognising 
the importance of waste management infrastructure, and setting out a range of sustainable 
development measures. It has reflected the requirement to not sterilise mineral resources, 
particularly of allocated sites and maximise the use of recycled aggregates. The Plan also 
reflects the policy aims and key transport schemes of the Northamptonshire Transportation 
Plan (Local Transport Plan), as set out in policies 15-17 of the Plan and its supporting text. 
To inform the infrastructure requirements of the Plan, set out in the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan extensive dialogue has been undertaken with relevant agencies and reference has 
been made to the Strategic Economic Plans produced by Northamptonshire and South 
East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and the plans, amongst others, of the 
education and health authorities and utility companies.
1.11 The Plan and its accompanying Infrastructure Delivery Plan notes the move by the 
Police and Health providers to develop a network of community facilities close to where 
people live, and the potential for mixed use community centres that provide these facilities. 
This is particularly relevant to the facilities that should be provided within Sustainable 
Urban Extensions. Future education requirements and the aspiration of the education 
authority to build schools where and when needed have been reflected in the distribution of 
development, and have underpinned the strategy to provide Sustainable Urban Extensions 
of a sufficient scale to incorporate these facilities. 
1.12 An important component that has guided the preparation of the Plan is the 
requirement to apply a spatial planning dimension to the relevant Sustainable Community 
Strategies that have been prepared. These individual Strategies all contain a Vision and 
Objectives and deal with key inter-related themes such as:
n Being successful through sustainable growth and regeneration  – ensuring that 
physical and social infrastructure will be in place to match growth, improving and 
protecting countryside and buildings for future generations in addition to regenerating 
and improving town centres;
n Health and Wellbeing  – reducing health inequality, increasing life expectancy promoting 
social inclusion, sport and recreation and providing more access to healthy lifestyle 
options to improve health and wellbeing;
n Education and skills  – raising skills levels to ensure that workers have the right skills 
for a changing economy, addressing the skills shortage for 16-25 year olds through work  
based learning;
n Ensuring economic prosperity  – ensuring the availability of relevant and appropriate 
business skills and training opportunities; providing high quality infrastructure to support 
and encourage innovation and growth; build on the unique character and location;NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–20319
ADOPTED JULY 2016n Environment  – encouraging and promoting environmental protection, improving the 
environmental and visual quality of the area, managing resources effectively, sustainable 
transport for all;
n Strong and Safe Communities  – reducing and preventing crime as well as the fear of it  
by tackling violence, anti-social behaviour, re-offending and improving access to services 
and facilities.
1.13 The Spatial Vision and Outcomes in the Plan and the policies to deliver these take 
forward the themes and visions and objectives of the Sustainable Community Strategies 
that are outlined above and seek to deliver these priorities. Monitoring of the Plan will be 
fundamental to assessing its effectiveness in delivering these themes and the Monitoring 
Framework is set out in Section D.
1.14 The Plan and the studies and consultation that underpin it, recognise the spatial 
relationships between North Northamptonshire and adjoining areas. The development of 
the Plan has been informed by constructive, active and ongoing engagement with adjoining 
planning authorities and public bodies. This is necessary to ensure that the Joint Committee 
satisfies the requirements of the Duty to Cooperate and that the Plan addresses cross-
boundary strategic matters including Transport linkages, Green Infrastructure and health 
care provision. This work and engagement has re-confirmed North Northamptonshire 
as a functional Housing Market Area and established that neighbouring authorities in 
West Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire (also formerly part of the Milton Keynes South 
Midlands (MKSM) Growth Area) are still planning for significant growth, as are Peterborough 
and Huntingdonshire to the east (formerly part of the Peterborough/Cambridge/Stansted 
Growth Area). The Joint Core Strategy does not identify any housing or other development 
specifically related to meeting objectively assessed needs for adjoining areas and vice versa 
as it has been confirmed that this is not necessary before 2029. For the period post-2029, 
options outside of the West Northamptonshire boundary area may need to be tested 
alongside others for meeting Northampton’s longer term development  needs. Through 
the duty to co-operate and co-ordination of plan making, the respective local planning 
authorities will work together to positively address this issue in reviewing future Local Plans.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
10 ADOPTED JULY 2016Figure 3: Plan Area and adjoining Local Planning Authorities
THE PLAN PERIOD
1.15 This Plan is for the period 2011 to 2031 and addresses the objectively assessed need 
for homes, jobs, retail floorspace and other development over this period. It also recognises 
the strategic opportunity for higher levels of development at Corby as the area becomes a destination of choice for a growing number of people and businesses to live and invest in. 
1.16 The spatial strategy set out in the Plan will provide the basis for considering any 
future growth, with a continuing focus on the Growth Towns and the town centres in 
particular. The Plan (Policy 11) indicates that, subject to further assessment, the identified Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) have potential to continue to grow beyond 2031 (paragraph 5.9). This provides a continuing supply of housing and employment land. Potential further SUEs will be determined through a future review of the JCS. Subject to detailed assessment, the expansion of the principal SUEs set out in this Plan is likely to make the best use of investment in infrastructure and to support the viability of these developments. 
1.17 This approach gives a degree of certainty to developers and infrastructure providers 
but does not pre-judge the technical work and consultation that needs to inform decisions 
on significant growth beyond 2031 in a review of the JCS. The approach also gives flexibility to monitor and review the Plan, for example in the light of the balance achieved between new homes and the delivery of new jobs and infrastructure.

ADOPTED JULY 2016SPATIAL PORTRAIT OF NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
NATIONAL AND SUB-NATIONAL CONTEXT
2.1 North Northamptonshire is located on key strategic transport routes in the form 
of the A14 ‘Trans European Route’ (E24) providing linkages to the M1 and M6 as well as 
to the East Coast ports and the Midland Mainline railway with stations at Wellingborough, 
Kettering and Corby providing links south to London St Pancras (average journey time 
55 minutes from Wellingborough) with onward Eurostar trains, and north to Leicester, 
Nottingham and beyond (although services north from Corby are currently limited). The 
international airports shown on Figure 4 are all within 70 miles of North Northamptonshire 
and convenient rail/bus access is available from stations on the Midland Mainline at Luton 
airport and at the East Midlands Parkway.
2.2 North Northamptonshire was previously identified in National and Regional policy 
as part of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands (MKSM) Growth Area. This was one of four 
areas identified to help accommodate the economic success of London and the wider South 
East by delivering major growth in well-designed communities, supported by substantial 
investment in infrastructure and services. This designation reflected the area’s proximity and 
links to London and the South East, its economic potential (including its close relationship to 
the Oxford to Cambridge Arc) and the limited environmental/policy constraints compared 
much of the country (no designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or Green Belt). 
It also recognised the opportunity to use growth to support the regeneration of existing 
communities, in particular Corby.
2.3 Although the current Government has moved away from ‘top-down’ planning, the 
factors that marked North Northamptonshire out as part of a nationally important growth 
area have not changed. Whilst the requirement is to meet full objectively assessed needs, 
significant potential exists for new homes and jobs through existing planning commitments, 
in particular the Sustainable Urban Extensions at the main towns, provided it is supported 
by adequate investment in infrastructure. 
2.4 At the County level, the Northamptonshire Arc concept3 seeks to ensure a co-
ordinated approach to economic development, the environment and connectivity across 
Northamptonshire. In particular, it identifies connectivity issues and infrastructure deficit 
that, if not addressed, would prevent Northamptonshire from fulfilling its vision of sustainable 
growth. The Arc encompasses all the larger towns in the county including Northampton, 
Daventry and Towcester in the west and south (part of the West Northamptonshire 
administrative area), Kettering and Corby in the north and Wellingborough, Rushden, Oundle 
and Thrapston in the east. This potential is recognised in the Strategic Economic Plans 2 VISION AND OUTCOMES

2.5 The four largest towns, Corby (population 54,9274) Kettering (56,2265), 
Wellingborough (49,087) and Rushden (29,272) are located on a north-south spine, with a 
chain of smaller towns related to the A6 corridor including Higham Ferrers, Irthlingborough, 
Burton Latimer, Desborough and Rothwell. To the east of this urban spine is the town of 
Raunds (population 8,641) and the towns of Oundle (population 5,735) and Thrapston 
(6,239) which serve a large rural catchment.

ADOPTED JULY 20162.6 Outside these settlements, North Northamptonshire has over 100 villages. 
These range in scale from Rockingham with a population of 113 to Earls Barton with 5,387 
residents. The villages within or close to the Urban areas tend be more reliant on the towns 
for employment and services than is the case for more remote villages such as King’s Cliffe. 
Figure 5: Network of settlements in North Northamptonshire with populations of main towns 
(2011 C ensus)
 
2.7 The network of settlements provides a range of employment, services and facilities 
to serve the population of North Northamptonshire. For instance Kettering General Hospital 
provides acute care for the area, supplemented by local units in Corby and Wellingborough; 
and Tresham Institute provides further education from campuses in three of the Growth 
Towns. In terms of commuting and shopping patterns there are two distinct functional 
sub-areas in North Northamptonshire (see Figure 15 on page 71): the Northern area with 
Kettering and Corby as focal points; and the Southern area, focused on Wellingborough and 
Rushden, which has closer functional links with Northampton.

Ordinance Survey 100019331.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203114
ADOPTED JULY 20162.8 While the network of settlements meets many of the needs of residents, there 
are some significant deficiencies in the employment, services and facilities available for an 
area of over 318,000 population, which is planned to grow to at least 382,3006 by 2031 or 
394,000 if opportunities for additional growth at Corby are achieved. For example, North 
Northamptonshire:
n Has no university presence (the nearest being the University of Northampton);
n Has relatively few high-tech and knowledge-based businesses;
n Has a limited retail and leisure offer compared to neighbouring larger centres (although 
this is improving with a new cinema opened in Corby in Summer 2015 and the Rushden 
Lakes development due to open in 2017);
n Lacks a rapid public transit system to link existing urban areas and planned growth areas.
2.9 Deficiencies such as these, result in North Northamptonshire losing significant 
wealth and skilled people, including graduates moving away to work, or commuting to 
London, Milton Keynes or other centres. At the 2011 census, 31% of the area’s labour force 
was commuting to centres outside North Northamptonshire (compared to 24% in 2001). 
With a high dependency on car use, this puts significant additional traffic and congestion 
onto the local and strategic road network. This will increase if North Northamptonshire 
delivers housing growth without new jobs and an improvement in the range and quality of 
services and facilities to meet the needs and demands of local people.
2.10 Despite the growth in commuting, travel patterns in North Northamptonshire, 
are still very localised in nature, meaning the vast majority of trips are being taken within 
the boundaries of the area. There is a significant movement between the towns in North 
Northamptonshire and, notably towards Northampton. Car-use dominates as a transport 
mode (being used for 69%7 of trips to work) in comparison to less than 5% of trips being 
made by cycle or bus. Apart from the flagship X4 which links Milton Keynes, Northampton, 
Wellingborough, Kettering, Corby and Peterborough, bus connections from North 
Northamptonshire do not provide attractive alternatives to car use, particularly in the rural 
areas. The dominance of car-use contributes to problems of congestion on both strategic 
routes such as the A14 and A45, which is forecast to increase with planned growth and on the 
local road network, particularly in Kettering and Wellingborough town centres. Upgrading 
of the highway network, coupled with measures to manage demand for travel, support the 
use of electric vehicles and to secure modal shift (from car use to public transport, walking 
and cycling) are fundamental to support the delivery of sustainable growth. 
2 .11 Each settlement has its own distinctive character, reflecting its evolution. For 
example, many of the towns expanded significantly as centres for the boot and shoe industry 
or, in the case of Corby, for the steel industry. This has left a particular architectural legacy 
and urban structure of streets and buildings which is very different to the historic market 
town of Oundle and most of the villages. This character and urban structure has an important 
bearing on how settlements should develop in the future. The four largest towns of Corby, 
Kettering, Wellingborough and Rushden have reached the size where they have already built 
up to obvious physical barriers in a number of directions. The positioning of ring roads and 
other key infrastructure such as railway lines around settlements creates physical barriers 
to growth and to accessing the surrounding countryside. These barriers, together with the 
distance between the edge of the town and the centre, can present a number of challenges 
in creating new areas which integrate into the existing town and which support the town’s 
centre. In the smaller towns, the same issues exist and are often compounded by cul-de-sac 
developments which prevent new streets being easily connected to existing ones, making it 
more difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to reach the town centres.6 Forecasts by

ADOPTED JULY 20162.12 Monitoring of design quality has shown more recently approved development being 
of higher quality. However, data has also identified a correlation between the number of 
houses on site and design quality, with smaller schemes generally performing better than 
larger schemes. Overall, design quality in North Northamptonshire is improving over time, 
albeit it is more difficult to achieve on larger sites, which tend to incorporate mass market 
house types, and standard street layouts. Many schemes are still failing to create characterful 
places and streets are tending to be designed for traffic rather than for people.
2.13 While a key concern of the Plan is to maintain the character of the smaller towns 
and villages, while allowing for necessary development, in a number of the larger towns the 
emphasis is on securing investment and renewal to transform run-down areas, including 
parts of the town centres of all of the four largest towns. Corby has 11 of the 50 of the most 
deprived wards in Northamptonshire (2010 English Indices of Deprivation8), Wellingborough 
7 and Kettering 6. East Northamptonshire has fewer deprived wards, and ranks well 
nationally. Small pockets of deprivation also exist in rural areas where some people 
encounter difficulties in accessing jobs, services and facilities, due in part to the limited 
availability of public transport.
THE COUNTRYSIDE
2.14 The relationship between the network of settlements and the surrounding 
countryside is a distinctive feature of North Northamptonshire and one of its main 
attractions for new residents and businesses seeking a high quality environment. There is a 
marked contrast between the quiet rural character of much of the area, particularly in the 
Rural North of East Northamptonshire and the main settlements in the urban spine where 
the emphasis is on securing investment in growth and renewal.
2.15 The North Northamptonshire countryside incorporates many of North 
Northamptonshire’s environmental and cultural assets and is a diverse mix of landscapes, 
each with its own distinctive visual, historic and ecological character. The northern and 
southern boundaries of North Northamptonshire are framed by river valleys; the Welland, 
which occupies the northern boundary, and the Nene. The Nene changes in character as 
it moves through the area, from a more urbanised west and a concentration of sand and 
gravel extraction, to a more tranquil rural north. The Welland is bordered by a dramatic 
scarp edge from where there are wide views across open countryside to the north, whilst 
in the south wooded ridgelines are characteristic. Much of the northern half of the area lies 
within the Rockingham Forest; over 200 square miles of woodland, pasture and farmland 
in North Northamptonshire and Peterborough, within which the King’s Cliffe Hills and 
Valleys Landscape Character Area around King’s Cliffe is recognised for its tranquillity. The 
various Country Parks and sites of historic importance, including Grade 1 listed assets such 
as Rockingham Castle and Boughton House represent valuable leisure, tourism and cultural 
resources within the countryside.
2.16 Compared to most of the country, North Northamptonshire has a low biodiversity 
offer, with habitats fragmented or degraded as a result of settlement expansion, 
infrastructure developments and agriculture. Its biodiversity and geodiversity assets face 
continuing pressure from new development, recreational use, the wider impacts of climate 
change and the introduction of non-native invasive species. These issues are being tackled 
through innovative approaches to planning and managing key Green Infrastructure assets. 8 2010 English Indices of

ADOPTED JULY 20162.17 The Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area (NIA) was designated by the 
Government in March 20129 and extends from Daventry to Peterborough, including the 
River Nene and its main tributaries. NIAs are ecological networks established to reconnect 
wildlife habitats and helps species adapt to the challenges of climate change. At the heart of 
the NIA is the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits, a group of lakes and ponds along the Nene 
between Northampton and Thorpe Waterville, designated as a Special Protection Area 
(SPA) and Ramsar site due to its international importance for migratory birds. 
2.18 The Rockingham Forest is home to a new scheme to plant significant areas of 
woodland as a local response to climate change known as ‘Forest for Life Rockingham10’. 
Increased tree planting within the forest area can capture carbon, enhance the natural and 
cultural environment, reinforce ancient woodlands, link fragmented sites, create wildlife 
corridors and enhance biodiversity.

17 ADOPTED JULY 2016POPULATION
2.19 The population of North Northamptonshire increased by nearly 11% between 2001 
and 2011 from 285,600 to 316,80011. This compares to growth of 7.2% in the population of 
England. Corby has seen the largest percentage population increase (14.4%), followed by 
Kettering (13.7%) and East Northamptonshire (13.3%). Only Wellingborough (4%) has seen population growth below the national average of 7.2%. At the 2011 census the populations of the local authorities was as follows: Corby 61,300; East Northamptonshire 86,800; Kettering 93,500 and Wellingborough 75,400. 
2.20 Population growth has underpinned significant growth in households over the same 
period. Three of the North Northamptonshire authorities are within the top 20 authorities 
in the country with the highest growth in households
12 between 2001 and 2011 (Kettering 
16.8%, East Northamptonshire 15.2% and Corby 14.5%). At 6.7%, household growth at Wellingborough was below the national average of 7.9%.
2.21 The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2012-based population projections
13 
indicate that, if recent trends continue, the population of North Northamptonshire will 
grow from around 321,400 people in 2012 to 370,600 in 2031, an increase of 15.3%. For comparison, the population of England is projected to grow by 12.9% over this same period. The 2012 based projection assumes a lower birth rate and lower net in-migration than the population projections that underpin this Plan. The Plan is based on projections prepared by the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research (CCHPR) using previous ONS interim 2011-based projections adjusted and rolled forward to 2031
14. These project a North 
Northamptonshire population of 382,300 in 2031, representing a 20.2% increase over the plan period 2011-31 (or, for comparison with the latest ONS projections, 19.5% since 2012). 
2.22 The housing requirements set out in Policy 28 will accommodate the increase in 
households associated with the CCHPR projected level of population growth. The ‘strategic 
opportunity’ for additional housing at Corby would enable the population of North Northamptonshire to grow even more, with an increase of 78,000 people (a 24.5% increase) over the plan period to 2031 (23.8% since 2012).

18 ADOPTED JULY 20162.23 The age structure of the population is forecast to change over the plan period, 
with significant implications for the homes, jobs, services and facilities that are required. 
Figure 8 shows that the growth in working age population is relatively modest but that there will be significant expansions in 60+ age groups (the number of people over 75 is forecast to increase by 92%). This will increase the demand for specialised provision such as designated, sheltered and extra-care housing and will also increase pressure on health and social services. It also creates the potential for large scale downsizing from under-occupied homes. At the other end of the age range, there will be a significant growth in the number of children (27% increase in 0-14 age group). School places will need to be provided for this expanding population. 
Figure 8: Forecast change in age structure of North Northamptonshire population 2011-31
2.24 The CCHPR projections indicate that there will be a growth of over 30% in single 
person households, many of whom will consist of older people, and a 21% growth in couple 
households with no dependent children, together accounting for over 50% of household growth.

ADOPTED JULY 2016HOUSING
2.25 Whilst the economic recession has impacted on the delivery of North 
Northamptonshire’s ambitious growth agenda, particularly in relation to housing and 
jobs growth, it remains one of the fastest growing areas in the country delivering 19,000 
additional dwellings between 2001 and 2013. The dwelling stock in the Housing Market 
Area (HMA) grew by 13.3% between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, compared to 8.3% for 
England15. There are planning consents in place for over 20,000 dwellings, notably through 
the Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs). 
2.26 The majority of development has been focused at the towns of Corby, Kettering 
and Wellingborough; however, these settlements have not accommodated the amount 
of development that was planned in the 2008 CSS. This is due to the recession and 
ongoing viability issues holding up development of most of the SUEs. In contrast, rates of 
development at the Market Towns and within the Rural Area have been broadly met or 
exceeded those set within the CSS and there remains significant development pressure in 
these locations.
2.27 The 2012 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) notes that the ‘housing 
offer’ in North Northamptonshire is very broad, ranging from lower cost options based 
around Corby, to the higher value properties available in the high demand area of East 
Northamptonshire. The area’s housing market has been diversified through the growth of 
the private rented sector which appears to have responded to the increased requirement 
for smaller properties. Despite house prices being relatively low in the national context, 
affordability remains an important local issue, in part due to household incomes also being 
relatively low. 
2.28 Population trends referred to above have significant implications for the type of 
housing required. The SHMA indicates that for singles and couples, there is an increased 
requirement for 1 and 2 bed properties in an area with historically low supply of smaller 
homes. A small increase in the requirement for family housing is complicated by the 
projected large increase in lone parent households who have incomes typically a third of the 
average. The implication is that there is a need for more family housing that is affordable to 
lone parents
2.29 The home ownership sector has been less responsive to demographic trends and 
has continued to develop a high level of traditional and larger family housing. The social 
rented sector continues to play an important role in housing smaller households and both 
need and demand are likely to increase under the joint pressures of demographic change 
and welfare reform. 15 Growth in dwelling

ADOPTED JULY 2016ECONOMY
2.30  North Northamptonshire has under-performed against the ambitious job 
requirements of the 2008 CSS, which has increased the imbalance between housing and job 
provision. In the period 2001 to 2011, 16,640 new homes were built in the HMA but there 
was an estimated net increase of only 7,500 workplace jobs16. Data between 2011 and 2013 
showed that workplace jobs fell by a further 1,900. 
2.31 North Northamptonshire17 has around 0.85 jobs for each worker (economically 
active residents excluding those in full time education). It has become less self-reliant in 
terms of employment since 2001, with 69% of the labour force living and working in North 
Northamptonshire compared to 76% at the 2001 census. This is in part due to job losses 
during the recession, and population growth outstripping the creation of new jobs. 
2.32 Corby has the closest balance between jobs and workers (0.97 jobs: worker), 
which is reflected in the highest level of self-containment and commuting patterns (67% 
of the resident labour force also works in Corby and it is the only district in North 
Northamptonshire with a net in-flow of commuters) and the shortest average journeys to 
work (15.4 km). 
2.33 East Northamptonshire stands out as the district with the poorest balance 
between jobs and workers (0.70 jobs per worker across the district and only 0.62 in the 
Four Towns area). Out-commuting to jobs in larger centres such as Wellingborough and 
Northampton results in the district having the lowest level of self-containment in commuting 
patterns (36.1%), the greatest net out-flow of commuters (12,200) and the longest average 
commuting distances (16.5km). 
2.34 Kettering is the main employment centre in North Northamptonshire, and after 
Corby, has the second highest level of self-containment in commuting patterns (52.3%) and 
the second shortest average journeys to work (15.8km). 
2.35 Wellingborough has a balance between jobs and workers (0.91) that is second only to 
Corby but has the second highest level of net out-commuting after East Northamptonshire 
(only 45.5% of its resident labour force works in the Borough). This is due to the accessibility 
of larger centres of employment, in particular Northampton, with 19% of working residents 
of Wellingborough working in Northampton Borough. 
2.36 Broadly speaking there are two functional areas in North Northamptonshire, 
focused around Corby and Kettering in the North and Wellingborough and Rushden in 
the South. In addition to people living and working in North Northamptonshire, workers 
commute into and out of the area. Over 18,000 more workers commuted out of North 
Northamptonshire than commuted in. Northampton exerts a strong influence on the 
southern part of North Northamptonshire. 16 Source: Annual

2.37 The current economy is weighted towards lower-skilled and lower paid 
employment. Average workplace earnings are £430 per week, lower than £512 for England18.  
Fewer residents are qualified to degree level, compared to 27% for England as a whole. 
Such a skills shortage acts as a barrier to growth given the link between a highly skilled 
workforce and high productivity and GVA. 
2.38 Over a number of years Warehousing and Distribution (B8) has been the largest 
growth sector taking advantage of the excellent transport links, with sites closely related 
to the strategic road network and rail freight transfer points and is forecast to remain an 
important sector of the economy. East Northamptonshire has also benefitted from small 
and medium enterprises. The area has seen significant losses in manufacturing employment 
which in 1998 was the largest economic sector accounting for 1/3rd of all employment in 
North Northamptonshire. Corby was dependent on manufacturing for 50% of its jobs while 
in other districts manufacturing accounted for 30% of all employment. Between 1998 and 
2008, all districts lost manufacturing employment. The largest losses were in Corby and 
Wellingborough, which both lost around 5,000 manufacturing jobs, contributing to a net loss 
of jobs in these areas (Corby lost 800 workplace jobs and Wellingborough 1,600 between 
2001 and 2011). Between 2001 and 2011 East Northamptonshire and Kettering were the best 
performing local authorities in creating 4,300 and 5,600 workplace jobs respectively. 18 Annual Survey of

ADOPTED JULY 20162.39 22 wards within Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and East Northamptonshire have 
been designated by the government as Assisted Areas19 for the period 2014 to 2020. These 
comprise a mixture of urban and rural areas identified because they are less economically 
advantaged places that would benefit from additional support for development. Assisted 
Area status encourages business growth and offers eligibility for regional aid, but does not in 
itself confer any funding. 
2.40 The town centres in North Northamptonshire are relatively small and poorly ranked 
compared to neighbouring centres. Kettering is the largest and highest ranked20 retail centre 
in North Northamptonshire ranked 200th followed by Corby 365th and Wellingborough 
374th. Consequently, there is a loss of trade from North Northamptonshire to larger, higher 
ranked centres, in particular from Rushden and Wellingborough in the southern area which 
lose trade to Milton Keynes ranked 29th and Northampton 56th. Leicester (ranked 17th) and 
Peterborough (54th) also exert influences on North Northamptonshire.
2.41 The North Northamptonshire Retail Capacity update21 indicates that North 
Northamptonshire now retains around 61.5% of comparison retail spending, an increase 
from 50% in 2005. However, this increased retention has been driven by increased 
expenditure at out of centre and edge of centre retail parks rather than the town centres. Of 
the four main towns, only Corby has seen an increase in town centre expenditure as a result 
of the development of Willow Place. The approval of a major out of centre retail and leisure 
scheme at Rushden Lakes, will contribute towards retention of expenditure, particularly in 
the southern area but will impact on Wellingborough town centre in particular.
INFRASTRUCTURE
2.42 North Northamptonshire benefits from excellent strategic connections. The E24 
‘Trans European Route’ (also known as the A14) provides links to the M1 and M6 as well as 
the East Coast Ports. The Midland Main Line provides connections from Corby, Kettering 
and Wellingborough to London. International airports shown on Figure 4 are all within 70 
miles of North Northamptonshire. 
2.43 Whilst there remains a need for new infrastructure North Northamptonshire has 
seen significant infrastructure investment since the previous (2008) CSS. This investment has 
included the opening of Corby railway station and completion of the A43 Corby Link Road. 
Other improvements to key transport infrastructure are being delivered, notably between 
Junctions 7 and 9 of the A14, which was completed in 2015 and the electrification of the Midland 
Mainline between Bedford and Sheffield, benefitting Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough 
stations. Increased capacity across the transport network will improve efficiency and reliability 
whilst accommodating growth and supporting economic development. 
2.44 Anglian Water, through its Asset Management Plan (2010-2015) have assigned 
funding to enable the capacity of the Broadholme Sewerage Treatment works (which serves 
the majority of North Northamptonshire) to be upgraded as and when required by new 
development. In addition to this, progress is being made on the design work of a strategic 
sewer and pumping stations to link developments in Kettering to the Broadholme works 
(including the Kettering East urban extension). 20 Venuescore Retail

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203123
ADOPTED JULY 20162.45 North Northamptonshire has sought to meet the challenges of climate change by 
supporting the development of new environmental technologies. Kettering Borough has an 
operational wind farm at Burton Wold (17 turbines generating 36.1 MW of electricity) which 
also has consent for a solar farm. Consent has also been granted for the New Albion Wind 
Farm near Rushton which will produce 16.1 MW of energy. Cumulatively, it is anticipated 
these schemes have the potential to produce enough electricity to power 75% of the 
current homes in Kettering. Alongside these schemes, a number of solar schemes have been 
approved across the area. In East Northamptonshire, a solar farm is operational near Islip 
and a renewable energy park has been consented at Chelveston airfield, which includes an 
operational wind farm, and consents for a solar farm, an anaerobic digestion plant and bio-
oil electricity generators, with a capability to generate over 30 MW of energy.
2.46 Current market conditions both in North Northamptonshire and the wider East 
Midlands in relation to viability are challenging. This is having impacts on the standards that 
developments can achieve, and the levels of affordable housing and other contributions that can 
be provided. Viability conditions are, however, forecast to improve across the East Midlands. 
ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE JOINT CORE STRATEGY
2.47 A number of inter-related issues identified by this Spatial Portrait need to be 
addressed if sustainable growth is to be delivered in North Northamptonshire. These set 
the context for the overall vision and outcomes of this Plan. 
2.48 As an area North Northamptonshire has a number of key advantages that should 
support sustainable growth. These include:
n Its location at the heart of England with good regional, national and international 
transport  links;
n The attractive rural setting and generally high quality environment and quality of life;
n The network of settlements, each with its own distinctive character, providing accessible 
local services and facilities;
n The relative affordability of housing compared to any other area within an hour of London;
n The absence of major constraints to development and the substantial commitments that 
exist for employment and housing development. 
2.49 However, the area has a number of challenges and issues to address. These include:
n The lack of some key facilities and services, resulting in residents being reliant on larger 
centres outside North Northamptonshire. This is particularly the case in the southern area;
n Town centres that struggle to compete with larger neighbours and have lost trade to out 
of centre developments;
n The need to raise the quality of development and ensure that it connects to the existing 
settlement and contributes to making it more sustainable. This is a particular challenge 
where ring roads and modern cul-de-sac developments create barriers;
n Some run-down and deprived urban areas in need of regeneration and restructuring; 
n High levels of population and household growth that will need services and facilities. In 
particular, the needs of an ageing population and also to provide for a significant growth in 
the number of children;NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203124
ADOPTED JULY 2016n The ongoing need for affordable housing;
n Gaps in infrastructure service provision and need for new infrastructure to support 
growth;
n Dominance of car-use for even short journeys and the need to facilitate modal shift by 
providing attractive alternatives; 
n Limited biodiversity compared to other areas but significant environmental and heritage 
assets; 
n Imbalance between house building and job creation, resulting in increased out-commuting, 
particularly from the southern area;
n Difficulty in diversifying the economy into higher value sectors and underperformance 
against job targets, notably in Corby and Wellingborough despite a significant over-supply 
of committed employment sites; 
n Housing delivery at the Growth Towns that has fallen short of targets despite permissions 
being in place, with ongoing development pressure at the Market Towns and villages;
n The consequent need to unlock and bring forward the Sustainable Urban Extensions to 
underpin the sustainable growth of North Northamptonshire;
n Viability challenges in securing the highest possible standards of development and 
infrastructure provision. 
2.50 The vision and outcomes set out how the Plan aims to address these issues in order 
to deliver sustainable growth in a way that benefits existing as well as new communities 
and tackle environmental concerns, particularly around climate change. It incorporates the 
key principles, identified through ‘place-shaping’ workshops in 2009/10 (see paragraph 1.3). 
These are that North Northamptonshire should be planned in a way that:
1. Improves its self-reliance  in terms of both economic and social sustainability. This 
includes building up the network of settlements and the transport links between them so 
that together they can meet more of the needs of local people, thereby retaining people, 
wealth and skills in the area;
2. Increases its resilience  to environmental and economic global changes. This includes 
promoting a strong ‘green living’ agenda, incorporating enhancement of the green 
environment, promotion of environmental technologies, requiring the highest possible 
standards of design in new development and seeking patterns of development that allow 
people to choose healthy and environmentally friendly lifestyles including a shift away 
from car use; and
3. Reinforces its special urban-rural character , by enhancing the network of countryside 
and Green Infrastructure and maintains the separate and distinct character and identities 
of settlements by preventing coalescence. 
2.51 Ecosystem services are an aspect of sustainable development that cuts across all of 
the above principles. These are defined as the benefits that the natural environment provides 
to humans including the production of clean water and many raw materials used in economic 
activities, regulation of climate and flooding, soil formation, crop pollination, and cultural 
benefits such as aesthetic value and recreational opportunities. Changes in land use can 
alter ecosystems and reduce their capacity to provide these services, detrimentally affecting 
the resilience of an area. It is therefore important to recognise the full range of ecosystem 
services and to enhance their provision where possible to ensure a sustainable environment 
that can adapt to climate change and continues to provide multiple benefits to society. NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE

ADOPTED JULY 2016VISION & OUTCOMES
VISION
By 2031, North Northamptonshire will be a showpiece for modern green living and well 
managed sustainable development: a resilient area where local choices have increased 
the ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to global economic changes. 
The special mixed urban-rural character of North Northamptonshire will have been 
maintained through urban-focused growth supporting a strong network of vibrant and 
regenerated settlements, which each maintain their separate and distinct character 
within an enhanced green framework of living, working countryside.
North Northamptonshire will be outward looking, taking advantage of its excellent 
strategic transport connectivity to be a nationally important growth area and focus 
for inward investment. Plan led change will have made North Northamptonshire, its 
northern and southern sub-areas and individual settlements more self- reliant, with 
more choices available locally. Investment in infrastructure, services and facilities and 
growth in high quality jobs will have led to less need to travel and will have shaped 
places in a way that meets the needs and aspirations of local people. A strong focus on 
growing investment in tourism, leisure and green infrastructure will be balanced with 
the protection and enhancement of the area’s landscape character and its valuable built 
and natural environment.
North Northamptonshire will be an exemplar for construction based innovation and the 
delivery of low carbon growth. Its high quality environment and prosperous economy 
will ensure it has a stronger profile within the UK and Europe; widely recognised as a 
safe, healthy, affordable and attractive area for residents and visitors, and an excellent 
place for business to invest in.
Ecosystems will be protected and enhanced and provision of ecosystem services 
increased where demand exists. The Rockingham Forest will be re-invigorated through 
major new tree planting, providing carbon storage and a focus for tourism, recreation 
and sustainable wood fuel production. Restored and newly created habitats in the Nene 
Valley Nature Improvement Area, will have delivered improvements for both wildlife and 
people and a step change in nature conservation whilst recognising its tourism potential. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THIS OVERALL VISION
n Corby will be well on the way to doubling its population and will offer international 
class culture and sport facilities. Enterprise areas will have promoted the town as 
a base for businesses leading the way in high performance technologies, creative 
industries and the green economy. Smart and innovative regeneration and growth 
will have delivered a transformed, vibrant and growing Town Centre and sustainable 
urban extensions; together with a network of accessible natural green spaces forming 
the urban gateway to the wider Rockingham Forest.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203126
ADOPTED JULY 2016n East Northamptonshire will be the heartland of small and medium sized enterprises, 
based on regenerated and thriving market towns with an enhanced role for Rushden 
as the District’s Growth Town. Implementation of the consented development at 
Rushden Lakes will have provided a new out of centre retail and leisure offer serving 
residents in the southern area of North Northamptonshire and delivering significant 
environmental benefits in the Nene Valley. Diverse, sustainable villages and a living, 
working countryside will provide the backdrop for tourism, creative industries 
and low carbon businesses to locate at the meeting point of the Nene Valley and 
Rockingham Forest.
n Kettering will be the largest retail centre and its vibrant town centre, regarded for 
being characterful, distinctive and fun, will provide a focus for its surrounding market 
towns and villages. The town will be the focus for healthcare and will lead the way 
in renewable energy investment to strengthen the green economy. Its business 
community will capitalise on its excellent connectivity, including its position on the 
Trans-European (E24 route) A14 and on the electrified Midland Mainline rail route. 
n Wellingborough will be the gateway to North Northamptonshire for businesses 
looking for good rail connections to the south east and Europe, with a high profile 
office development centred on the railway station. Its historic core will be the 
heart of the community, serving the town and its prosperous satellite villages with a 
diversified retail, leisure and heritage offer. NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE

2.52 The Vision and Outcomes set out an ambitious agenda for ‘place-shaping’. Place 
Shaping refers to the ways in which local players collectively use their influence, powers, 
creativity and abilities to create attractive, prosperous and safe communities, places where 
people want to live, work and do business22. This needs to be addressed at all spatial scales; 
from the individual building right up to North Northamptonshire as a whole.
Figure 10 – The spatial scales relevant to Place Shaping
2.53 The Joint Core Strategy focuses on strategic place shaping issues, leaving Part 2 
Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans to flesh out the detail in response to local issues. 
However, Section A of this Plan sets out Core Policies that are applicable at all scales. They 
aim to safeguard and create good quality places that will support a high quality of life and a 
prosperous economy.
2.54 Section B takes forward place shaping principles in greater detail at the North 
Northamptonshire level and for the main towns. Section C sets out development principles 
for proposed Sustainable Urban Extensions at Corby and Rushden, and for a number of 
strategic employment sites. Table 2 sets out place shaping principles for the towns23. 22 Place-shaping. A

includes policies and proposals that will help to deliver the following elements of place shaping:
1. Establish a strong network of urban and rural areas  that make the area more self-
reliant, with Sustainable Urban Extensions as key building blocks for sustainable growth. 
2. Improve connections  to places within and beyond the area, with an emphasis on 
providing greater transport choice to reduce reliance on the private car. 
3. Enhance the framework of green infrastructure  that is an essential part of the 
character of the area and provides vital ecosystem services.

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE 
3.1 Sustainable development in North Northamptonshire is development that 
contributes to delivering the ‘Vision and Outcomes’ of the Plan and accords with its 
policies to balance the economic, social and environmental needs of the area. Sustainable 
communities are those that incorporate sustainable development. The goal of sustainable 
development is to enable all people to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of 
life, without compromising the quality of life for future generations. 
HOW THE PLAN LINKS TO NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT
3.2 In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)24 Corby 
Borough, Kettering Borough, Borough of Wellingborough and East Northamptonshire 
Councils (the Local Planning authorities) will work proactively to ensure planning is not a 
barrier to new development. This Joint Core Strategy provides a clear framework not just 
for planning decisions but also many other forms of investment decisions. 
3.3 The NPPF provides a comprehensive definition for ‘sustainable development’, 
in the context of the planning system. In practice, this requires that planning applications 
which accord with the policies in the Local Plan (In North Northamptonshire, the Part 1 
Local Plan in the form of the Joint Core Strategy and, where relevant, the Part 2 Local Plans 
and Neighbourhood Plans) will be approved without delay, unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise. 
3.4 The Councils will work proactively to ensure that the policies in the Local Plan and 
associated evidence base are kept up to date. Proposals will need to take account of local 
evidence. Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are 
out of date at the time of making the decision, then the relevant local planning authority 
should grant permission for sustainable development unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise taking into account whether:
n The proposal would conflict with the Spatial Vision and Outcomes set out in this plan;
n Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably 
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole; 
n Specific policies in the NPPF indicate that development should be restricted.
3.5 It is necessary to apply the Government’s policies regarding sustainable development 
in the North Northamptonshire context. SECTION A  – CORE POLICIES

SECTION A: CORE POLICIES
DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE 
CONTEXT
3.6 Sustainable development will be delivered through a place shaping approach, which 
is directed by the needs of communities and by the distinct character and structure of 
settlements. The Vision and Outcomes are taken forward in the policies of the plan, starting 
with a set of Core Policies addressing the following themes, which apply across the area and 
to all forms of development. These themes relate to:
n Protecting environmental and social assets for the benefit of present and future 
generations;
n Designing sustainable places to ensure that new developments look good, work well and 
contribute to meeting the challenges of climate change;
n Securing infrastructure and services to support prosperous, more self-reliant 
communities. 
3.7 Development is not sustainable unless it can be delivered. The NPPF requires 
that the costs of policy requirements such as requirements for affordable housing and 
infrastructure contributions should, when taking account of the normal cost of development 
and mitigation, provide competitive returns to a willing land owner and willing developer to 
enable the development to be deliverable.
3.8 The cumulative impact of the policies in this Plan has been assessed through a plan-
wide viability assessment25, taking account of emerging proposals for the introduction of 
the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) in some of the districts. A broad assessment has 
also been made of the viability of the principal SUEs26. These studies provide a snap-shot 
of viability issues shortly after an economic recession. They highlight the differences in 
viability across North Northamptonshire (with greater viability in the smaller towns and in 
the villages) and between different types of development (with smaller schemes that do not 
require significant infrastructure investment being more viable).
3.9 The viability assessments referred to above have informed the policies of this Plan. 
Where, notwithstanding this, site specific viability issues prevent a development meeting 
policy requirements, an independent viability assessment (funded by the developer) will be 
required. The local planning authority will work with the developer to address viability issues 
so that development is not inhibited unnecessarily. This may involve approaches such as the 
flexible application of affordable housing requirements or the deferment of infrastructure 
contributions. However it will not extend to permitting poor quality development to 
proceed without the necessary supporting infrastructure. 
POLICY REQUIREMENTS
3.10 The policies of this Plan act as an investment framework to guide the investment 
priorities of public bodies and infrastructure and service providers. They also set out what 
needs to be delivered by individual developments. Where policies require developments to 
contribute towards specific objectives, this may be through the design of the scheme; direct 
provision (on or off-site); and/or funding through CIL contributions (where adopted) or 
planning obligations. These contributions will be coordinated with any other funding sources 
which may be available. 26 SUE Viability

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESPOLICY 1  – PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT
When considering development proposals the Local Planning Authority will take a 
positive approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development 
contained in the National Planning Policy Framework. It will always work proactively 
with applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals can be approved 
wherever possible, and to secure development that improves the economic, social 
and environmental conditions in the area meeting the challenges of climate change and 
protecting and enhancing the provision of ecosystems services.
To be regarded as ‘sustainable’ within the context of North Northamptonshire, 
development should contribute to delivering the Plan Vision and Outcomes through 
compliance with the relevant policies of this Plan. Development that conflicts with 
policies of the Plan will be refused unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
Where a development is otherwise acceptable but an independent viability appraisal 
demonstrates that certain policy standards cannot be achieved, the Local Planning 
Authority will work with the applicant to consider alternative approaches to deliver the 
desired policy outcomes. 39

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION A: CORE POLICIESI. PROTECTING AND ENHANCING ASSETS
3.11 The scale of development planned across North Northamptonshire will place 
pressure on social and environmental assets. It is therefore important to protect, conserve 
and enhance the natural and local environment, protect valued landscapes, minimise 
impacts on biodiversity and enhance green networks, as well as ensuring development 
provides sufficient community services and facilities to meet the needs of the existing and 
future population. It will be important that the design of development respects its local and 
environmental context and that the infrastructure requirements arising from development 
are fully understood and planned for. 
HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
3.12 The historic environment is one of the Plan area’s most valued assets. It includes 
over 2800 designated heritage assets spread across the rural and urban landscapes of North 
Northamptonshire, and other distinctive characteristics including the views of church spires 
that are notable in the Nene Valley, and the distinctive building materials that characterise 
the settlements of North Northamptonshire, including the historic market towns of Oundle, 
Rothwell and Higham Ferrers and the towns of the county’s boot and shoe industry. It is 
an important element of the landscape of North Northamptonshire and contributes to 
the individual character and appearance of settlements. It reflects human interaction with 
geology, topography and the natural environment over time and includes buildings and 
structures, parks and gardens, and archaeological remains that are an important aspect of 
the area’s past. The historic environment can provide a range of other benefits including 
creating jobs, attracting business, enhancing tourism and is an important aspect in the 
achievement of sustainable development. 
3.13 Elements of the historic environment that hold significance are termed ‘heritage 
assets’ and include any building, monument, site, place, area or landscape positively identified 
as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions. Heritage 
assets are the valued components of the historic environment and include designated 
heritage assets and non-designated assets. 
DESIGNATED HERITAGE ASSETS
3.14 Designated heritage assets within North Northamptonshire include scheduled 
monuments, listed buildings, registered parks and gardens, and conservation areas. North 
Northamptonshire contains many heritage assets of national importance including Grade 
1 listed historic buildings and estates and their settings including Lyveden New Bield, 
Apethorpe Hall, Rockingham Castle, Kirby Hall and Boughton House. However, some of 
these assets are currently identified on the English Heritage ‘Heritage at Risk Register27’, 
which identifies listed buildings, important historic sites, places and landmarks that are at 
risk from neglect or decay. These currently include:
n Apethorpe Hall, Apethorpe;
n Ashton Mill, Oundle Road, Ashton;
n Lilford Hall, Lilford-cum-Wigsthorpe;
n Church of St Peter, Berrister Place, Raunds;
n Chester House, Higham Road, Irchester.27 Heritage at Risk

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESNON-DESIGNATED HERITAGE ASSETS
3.15 Whilst not having statutory status, non-designated heritage assets are identified as 
having a degree of significance that merits consideration in the determination of planning 
applications. Non-designated heritage assets are an important component of North 
Northamptonshire and are at risk from the impact of development, or the cumulative loss of 
structures. These locally identified heritage assets can include buildings of local architectural 
or historic interest, locally important archaeological sites, undeveloped areas of visual 
importance and parks and gardens of local interest. Industrial heritage, including that of the 
boot and shoe industry, modern built assets, including 21st century architecture, can also 
contribute towards a sense of place and identity, and it may be appropriate to preserve 
these as future historic assets through local listings. Local Lists provide a positive way for the 
Councils to identify non-designated heritage assets against consistent criteria. 
THE ROLE OF HERITAGE ASSETS IN DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
3.16 The conservation of heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance 
is a core planning principle in the NPPF. Great weight should be given to the conservation 
of designated assets with the greatest weight and protection being given to those of 
most importance (scheduled monuments and grade 1 and 2* listed buildings, parks and 
gardens). Any harm to a designated asset requires convincing justification. Where the harm 
is substantial, consent should be refused, unless outweighed by substantial public benefits 
or where the development would meet the tests for the conservation of the asset set out 
in the NPPF (para 133). Where the harm is less significant, this should be weighed against 
the public benefits, including securing the optimum viable use of the asset. In addition, and 
specifically in respect of listed buildings, the decision maker must have special regard to the 
desirability of preserving the building and its setting or any feature of special architectural or 
historic interest which it possesses28.
3.17 Heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource and effective conservation delivers 
wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits. Conservation is an active 
process of maintenance and managing change. It requires a flexible and thoughtful approach 
to get the best out of diverse assets.
3.18 In the case of buildings, the risks of neglect and decay are best addressed by 
ensuring that they remain in active use that is consistent with their conservation. Ensuring 
such heritage assets remain used and valued may require sympathetic changes to be made. 
Appropriate marketing will be required to demonstrate the redundancy of a heritage asset, 
and that an appropriate viable use cannot be found. Where loss of historic features is 
unavoidable and justified, provision should be made for recording and the production of a 
suitable archive and report. 28 S.66 of the Planning

SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.19 Heritage assets may be affected and harmed by direct physical change or by change in 
their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent and importance of the significance 
of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, is very important in understanding the 
potential impact and acceptability of development proposals. The NPPF defines setting as the 
surroundings in which the heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change 
as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Significance relates to the value of heritage asset to 
this and future generations due to its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, 
artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence but 
its setting, which may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, 
may affect the ability to appreciate the significance or may be neutral. 
3.20 It is important to create places that are sympathetic to the local character of the 
surrounding environment, achieved through the use of locally sourced materials where 
appropriate, which reflect the distinctive characteristics of the settlements in North 
Northamptonshire, and the creation of streetscapes that are visually sympathetic to the 
historic environment. It is expected that development will be of the highest standard of 
design in order to maintain and enhance the quality of the area or building, and be sensitive 
to its character and appearance. In considering applications for new development, the 
Councils will seek to ensure that the form, scale, design and materials of new buildings are 
complementary to the historic environment. Applications will need to be accompanied by 
a description of the significance of any heritage assets affected by the proposal and clear 
justification where any harm or loss of heritage asset is involved. 
POLICY 2  – HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT
The distinctive North Northamptonshire historic environment will be protected, 
preserved and, where appropriate, enhanced. Where a development would impact 
upon a heritage asset and/or its setting: 
a) Proposals should conserve and, where possible, enhance the heritage significance 
and setting of an asset or group of heritage assets in a manner commensurate to its 
significance;
b) Proposals should complement their surrounding historic environment through the 
form, scale, design and materials;
c) Proposals should protect and, where possible, enhance key views and vistas of 
heritage assets, including of the church spires along the Nene Valley and across North 
Northamptonshire; 
d)  Proposals should demonstrate an appreciation and understanding of the impact of 
development on heritage assets and their setting in order to minimise harm to these 
assets and their setting. Where loss of historic features or archaeological remains is 
unavoidable and justified, provision should be made for recording and the production 
of a suitable archive and report; 
e)  Where appropriate, flexible solutions to the re-use of buildings and conservation of 
other types of heritage assets at risk will be encouraged, especially, where this will 
result in their removal from the ‘at risk’ register.42

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESLANDSCAPE CHARACTER
3.21 The landscape29 is an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of 
the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors. Landscape is not purely a visual 
phenomenon and relies on a range of other dimensions including geology, landform, soils, 
ecology, archaeology, landscape history, land use, architecture and cultural associations. It 
provides the setting and context for development, and is also a key element of the urban/
rural character of North Northamptonshire, including the transition from settlements into 
the countryside. 
3.22 The landscape in North Northamptonshire has been influenced by a combination 
of human and physical influences. These landscapes, both man-made and natural, are what 
makes the area distinctive and there is a pressing need to conserve and enhance many of the 
features of importance landscape settings, as well as recognising the importance of views 
and vistas of these. 
3.23 Some landscapes are more sensitive to change than others. Development can 
impact on the landscape through its effects on the character and the quality of the landscape 
and the degree to which development will become a significant or defining feature in the 
landscape, including skyline (where additional development appears disproportionately 
dominant), and loss of sense of remoteness. Visual impacts concern the degree to which 
proposed development will become a feature in particular views (or sequences of views) and 
the impacts this has on people experiencing views.
3.24 The Northamptonshire Landscape Character Assessment (LCA), which forms part of 
the Northamptonshire Environmental Character Assessment30, identifies a range of landscape 
character types and 41 character areas across North Northamptonshire that sit within these, 
helping to identify what in a landscape sense gives a locality its own sense of place and what makes 
it different from its neighbouring areas. It recognises the broad floodplains of the Nene and Welland 
as key landscapes. The Assessment provides the basis for guiding, informing and understanding 
the ability of any location to accommodate change and to make positive proposals for conserving, 
enhancing or regenerating character as detailed proposals are developed. The LCA will be used 
in the determination of development proposals to ensure that the diverse character of the area’s 
landscape is respected, retained and, where possible, enhanced for future generations. 29 Definition from the

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.25 It is important that proposals understand and respond to the character of the 
landscape setting within which they are located. Where required by local validation 
requirements31, planning applications should include a landscape and visual impact 
assessment to ensure that these issues are addressed as proposals are being designed. 
Landscape mitigation measures can reduce, potentially remedy or offset against negative 
landscape impacts. These measures should be designed to suit the existing landscape 
character and needs of the locality, respecting and building on local landscape distinctiveness 
and helping to address any existing landscape issues. Landscape mitigation measures can 
include location of development within the site, retention of existing landscape features such 
as trees and hedgerows, restoring degraded landscape and restoring hedgerow patterns 
ground modelling, planting and the creation of new landscape features. 
3.26 The importance of ‘tranquillity’ has long been emphasised by the Campaign to 
Protect Rural England (CPRE) and in 2008 it commissioned researchers to create a national 
tranquillity map. The CPRE findings and Landscape Character Assessment both recognise 
the importance of the King’s Cliffe Hills and Valleys Landscape Character Area around King’s 
Cliffe. This area is at the core of the Rockingham Forest and is the only landscape area 
associated with the Wooded Limestone Hills and Valleys landscape character type within the 
county. 
3.27 This area is characterised as having significant wooded areas, with large areas 
designated as ancient woodland. It has villages of varying size, generally located on lower 
slopes adjacent to these watercourses. Outside these, the area is thinly settled with farms 
and individual dwellings. As a result of the sparse settlement pattern, the landscape retains a 
strong agricultural character, with arable farmland the predominant land use on the hills and 
valley slopes and pasture along the valley floor and close to woodlands. Although limited in 
number, country houses are important features in the landscape, and communication routes 
are principally confined to minor roads. These features combine to provide a peaceful and 
secluded local landscape. 
3.28 The sense of elevation and enclosure varies dramatically across the landscape. Some 
areas on the fringes of the area afford long distance views over the surrounding lowlands. 
Within valleys and deep undulations where significant woodlands screen long and middle 
distance views, and intimate human scale landscape is perceived. 
3.29 It is important to protect tranquillity in this area in particular from urban intrusion 
such as excessive levels of noise, light spillage and traffic and to ensure that development is of 
an appropriate density, and massing, consistent with its surroundings. Part 2 Local Plans may 
identify further areas of tranquillity based in areas which have remained relatively undisturbed 
by noise and are prized for their recreation and amenity value, based  on local evidence.31 The list of information 
that the local planning 
authorities require to be

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESPOLICY 3  – LANDSCAPE CHARACTER
Development should be located and designed in a way that is sensitive to its landscape 
setting, retaining and, where possible, enhancing the distinctive qualities of the landscape 
character area which it would affect. 
Development should: 
a) Conserve and, where possible, enhance the character and qualities of the local 
landscape through appropriate design and management;
b) Make provision for the retention and, where possible, enhancement of features of 
landscape importance;
c) Safeguard and, where possible, enhance important views and vistas including sky lines 
within the development layout;
d) Protect the landscape setting and contribute to maintaining the individual and distinct 
character, and separate identities of settlements by preventing coalescence;
e) Provide appropriate landscape mitigation and/or suitable off-site enhancements; and
f) Preserve tranquillity within the King’s Cliffe Hills and Valleys Landscape Character Area 
(as shown on the Policy Map) and other areas identified in Part 2 Local Plans by minimising 
light and noise pollution and minimising the visual and traffic impacts of development. 
BIODIVERSITY AND GEODIVERSITY
3.30 Biodiversity and geodiversity are crucial in supporting the full range of ecosystem 
services provided by the landscape and interaction of species and their habitats, with their 
non-living environments. Biodiversity in particular enhances environmental resilience 
to events like droughts and flooding. Protecting and enhancing biodiversity can play an 
important role in mitigating effects of climate change, for example through reducing flood 
risk and providing new habitats. 
3.31 North Northamptonshire’s biodiversity and geodiversity assets are facing increasing 
pressure from new development, recreational use, the wider impacts of climate change 
and the introduction of non-native invasive species. There is a pressing need not only to 
protect, enhance and manage the adaptability of existing sites but also to restore and create 
habitats at a landscape scale, especially where this would contribute to the wider green 
infrastructure network and enable wildlife to move more freely. Wildlife and geological sites 
will not be considered in isolation but in the context of the surrounding landscape character, 
ecological functionality and potential connectivity to other sites. 
3.32 Soils are an important asset in geodiversity, providing a growing medium for many 
resources including food and non-food crops. Soils should be protected from pollution and 
the best and most versatile agricultural land32 should be safeguarded, wherever possible.32 Agricultural Land

3.33 Within North Northamptonshire, the hierarchy of biological and geological sites 
includes those with international designations (the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special 
Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar Site, national designations including Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSI), and National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and local sites with statutory 
protection i.e. Local Nature Reserves (LNRs). Outside of North Northamptonshire, the 
Nene Washes SPA and Ramsar Site is located downstream from the Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Site on the Nene River.
NON-STATUTORY DESIGNATIONS
3.34 Sites designated at a local level (e.g. Local Wildlife Sites, Local Geological Sites, 
Pocket Parks) are also important parts of North Northamptonshire’s ecological network. 
These local sites contain a large proportion of the area’s natural resource and contribute to 
the connectivity and resilience of the ecological network and the landscape as a whole. 
3.35 Development will support the delivery of conservation at the landscape scale, 
helping to reverse fragmentation, increase habitat connectivity and create a coherent and 
resilient ecological network. This will include the recognition of the wider benefits of these 
habitats and species in the provision of ecosystem services. New development must take 
account of existing biodiversity resources on individual sites and contribute to the links 
between them. 
3.36 The mitigation hierarchy33 should be used to address potential harm to priority 
habitats34 or species, identified through ecological surveys in accordance with local validation 
requirements. Negative impacts to biodiversity should be avoided, and unavoidable impacts 
should be mitigated and/or minimised. Compensation schemes for residual impacts should 
only be used as a last resort when independent expert advice indicates that it has a high 
probability of success. Compensation schemes must be deliverable and enforceable and 
are unlikely to be appropriate for irreplaceable features such as ancient woodlands and 
grasslands and veteran trees or where significant harm35 is identified. Where avoidance of 
all impacts is not possible, the local planning authority will need to be satisfied that the 
development cannot reasonably be located on any alternative sites that would result in less 
or no harm. 
3.37 Development should, where possible secure a net gain in biodiversity (a sustained 
increase in abundance, quality and extent of species and habitats of national, regional or 
local importance36) through the maintenance, restoration and creation of priority habitats. 
Ecological networks will be strengthened by reversing habitat fragmentation and increasing 
habitat connectivity where possible by structuring and locating biodiversity gain in ways 
that enlarge and connect to existing biodiversity assets. The protection and recovery of 
priority species, linked to national and local targets will be supported and emphasis given to 
maintaining, restoring and creating priority and other natural and semi-natural habitats within 
and adjacent to development. Biodiversity gain should be appropriate to the scale, type and 
location of the development. Enhancements that add value to an existing habitat network 
and increase connectivity provide greater biodiversity benefits than those considered in 
isolation. 47

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESTHE NENE VALLEY
3.38 The Nene Valley has significant environmental assets of international and national 
importance. These include:
n The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA/Ramsar Site (designated April 2011), which 
includes wetland habitats along the Nene Valley, between Earls Barton and Thorpe 
Waterville (near Thrapston); and
n The Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area (NIA) (designated April 2012), which covers 
the River Nene, River Ise, Harper’s Brook and Willow Brook valleys.
3.39 The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits (extending for around 35 kilometres and 
covering around 1,370 hectares) is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for its 
international importance as wetland habitat for non-breeding waterbirds. The site is also 
protected under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance and is 
designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SPA itself is a composite site, 
is not uniform, and contains 20 separate blocks of land and water fragmented by various 
features, extending along the Nene Valley. The various blocks of the SPA have different 
sensitivities, some being more sensitive to development and recreational disturbance than 
others. The Nene Valley, and the SPA, runs through the local authority areas administered 
by South Northamptonshire Council and Northampton Borough (which in terms of strategic 
planning are part of West Northamptonshire), and the Borough Council of Wellingborough 
and East Northamptonshire Council (which are part of North Northamptonshire).  Natural 
England published a Site Improvement Plan for the SPA in December 2014, providing an 
overview of the issues affecting the interest features of the site, and outlining measures to 
secure their improvement37.  
3.40 The designation of the Nene Valley as a NIA has enabled Natural England, the 
Wildlife Trust, local planning authorities and other relevant stakeholders to be proactive in 
bringing forward specific projects to enhance the natural environment. The Nene Valley 
NIA partnership is working to reverse the decline in biodiversity and restore the ecological 
network within the NIA on a landscape scale. It aims to meet the ecological challenges of 
a growing population, changing climate and need to produce food and provides a critical 
opportunity to create a resilient, sustainable ecological network along the course of the River 
Nene and its major tributaries. The site improvement plan states that Natural England and 
others, working with landowners and managers, will all play a role in delivering the priority 
measures to improve the condition of the features of the site. The role of the document is 
to address both historical and current problems which are impacting on the site and is not 
just focussed on impacts generated from new development. The North Northamptonshire 
Joint Planning Unit (and the Borough Council of Wellingborough and East Northamptonshire 
Council) together with nature conservation bodies and other organisations are named as 
Delivery Bodies, to address the specified Priority and Issue of Public Access/Disturbance by 
means of managing recreational impacts through access and habitat management and advice. 
The Site Improvement Plan is also proposing the formation of a Joint Strategic Partnership, to 
bring together and coordinate the various delivery partners, including the Joint Planning Unit.37 Site Improvement

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.41 Due to its international importance, where development would have an effect on 
the SPA, a Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required, which may include the need 
for an Appropriate Assessment. For developers, early consultation with Natural England 
is needed regarding proposals that could affect the SPA, as detailed in the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits SPA SPD, including all new residential development proposed within 
3km of the designated site where such schemes involve a net gain in residential units38. 
A Habitats Regulations Assessment will consider the potential impacts of a development 
proposal against the conservation objectives of the SPA and ascertain whether it would 
affect the integrity of the SPA. Where the need for mitigation is identified, the necessary 
mitigation measures must then be identified and incorporated into the proposal. If the 
necessary mitigating measures cannot be identified and it cannot be ascertained that the 
proposal will not adversely affect the integrity of the SPA, the development will not be 
permitted. Where development proposals concern previously undeveloped farmland sites 
of 2 hectares or more, and any part of such sites are within 4km of the designated SPA, 
these sites should be subject to site specific wintering bird surveys to determine if the land 
is used by designated bird features and is therefore important supporting habitat. In such 
circumstances, for proposals where impacts on important supporting habitat may occur, 
planners and developers should consult Natural England to agree the need for, and scope 
of surveys . If the proposed development site hosts an important population of birds for 
which the European site is designated, the land should be retained, not subject to increased 
disturbance and should not be built on, if avoidance or mitigation measures cannot ensure 
no adverse effects on integrity of the SPA.
3.42 A detailed study39 to assess the impacts of visitor access in the SPA has been 
undertaken. This identifies that the collective effect of incremental increases of recreational 
pressure arising from developments, which individually may not have a significant effect, is a 
potential problem for the SPA. 
3.43 A strategic approach to the long term management of visitor pressure within 
the Nene Valley is needed to restore, maintain and protect the ecological interest of the 
SPA. The Joint Planning Unit is producing a Mitigation Strategy (target date for completion 
and subsequent adoption as an Addendum to the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special 
Protection Area Supplementary Planning Document, by June 2016),  to support policy 
implementation, identifying impact avoidance and mitigation measures, and addressing 
impacts associated with development arising from the JCS, including wider visitor, and 
recreational disturbance impacts. This will inform the development management process 
and decision making, in which new development in proximity to, or within the SPA (or other 
European Designated Sites) will need to demonstrate that there will be no significant adverse 
effects upon the integrity of the SPA and Ramsar site and the species for which the land is 
designated including the loss of supporting habitat. Any development that will lead to an 
increase in recreational activity on the SPA will be required to include the necessary mitigation 
including the development of, and implementation of habitat and access management plans, 
and which may take the form of a developer contribution to provide funding40 towards 
measures set out in the Mitigation Strategy. This will apply in relation to all new residential 
development within 3 km of the designated SPA site (where such schemes involve a net 
gain in residential units). When planning new development, dialogue will be encouraged 
between the Borough Council of Wellingborough, East Northamptonshire Council, Natural 
England, developers, the SPA owners, the Wildlife Trust, and other interested parties, in 
order to minimise disturbance to protected species, to advise on development design and 38 Natural England

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESPOLICY 4  – BIODIVERSITY AND GEODIVERSITY
A net gain in biodiversity will be sought and features of 
geological interest will be protected and enhanced through:
a) Protecting existing biodiversity and geodiversity assets 
by:
i. Refusing development proposals where significant 
harm to an asset cannot be avoided, mitigated or, 
as a last resort, compensated. The weight accorded 
to an asset will reflect its status in the hierarchy of 
biodiversity and geodiversity designations; 
ii. Protecting key assets for wildlife and geology, in 
particular the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special 
Protection Area and Ramsar Site, from unacceptable 
levels of access and managing pressures for access to 
and disturbance of sensitive habitats;
iii. Protecting the natural environment from adverse 
effects from noise, air and light pollution;
iv. Where appropriate requiring developments 
to provide or contribute to alternative green 
infrastructure (Policy 19); and 
v. Ensuring that habitats are managed in an ecologically 
appropriate manner.
b) Enhancing ecological networks by managing 
development and investment to:
i. Reverse the decline in biodiversity and restore the 
ecological network at a landscape scale in the Nene 
Valley Nature Improvement Area (NIA);
ii. Reverse habitat fragmentation and increase 
connectivity of habitats where possible by structuring 
and locating biodiversity gain in such a way as to 
enlarge and/or connect to existing biodiversity assets 
such as wildlife corridors;
iii. Preserve, restore and create priority and other 
natural and semi-natural habitats within and adjacent 
to development schemes.c) Supporting, through developer contributions or 
development design, the protection and recovery of 
priority habitats and species linked to national and local 
targets. Such measures could include the retention of, 
and provision of areas of open green space, and hard 
and soft landscaping to address habitat and visitor 
management. 
d) Developments that are likely to have an adverse 
impact, either alone or in-combination, on the Upper 
Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area or 
other European Designated Sites must satisfy the 
requirements of the Habitats Regulations, determining 
site specific impacts and avoiding or mitigating against 
impacts where identified. Mitigation may involve 
providing or contributing towards a combination of the 
following measures:
i. Access and visitor management measures within the 
SPA;
ii. Improvement of existing greenspace and recreational 
routes;
iii. Provision of alternative natural greenspace and 
recreational routes;
iv. Monitoring of the impacts of new development on 
European designated sites to inform the necessary 
mitigation requirements and future refinement of any 
mitigation measures.

3.46 An important part of North Northamptonshire’s resilience and self-reliance is 
ensuring that its water environment is protected, that there is sufficient water and waste 
water infrastructure and that the area is resilient to flood risk, particularly when the impact 
of future climate change is considered. 
PRINCIPAL RIVER CATCHMENT AREAS
3.47 Most of North Northamptonshire is located within the River Nene catchment. Part 
of the northern area falls within the River Welland catchment and part of the south-east is 
located within the Great Ouse catchment. 
3.48 The principal watercourses in North Northamptonshire are:
n The River Nene and its main tributaries (the River Ise, Harpers Brook, Alledge Brook, 
Slade Brook and Willow Brook); and
n The River Welland and its main tributary (the River Jordan). 
3.49 Development can have a significant impact on water resources, from putting 
additional strain on existing supplies, to affecting flood patterns by changing both the way 
that water flows across and percolates into land. It is essential to protect and enhance the 
quality and quantity of both ground and surface water, ensure necessary service provision, 
conserve water supplies and manage flood risk. 
DELIVERING IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER QUALITY
3.50 New developments will need to have the necessary means of water supply but this 
must not adversely affect the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area (SPA) 
or overall water quality within the catchment. 
3.51 The Water Framework Directive (WFD)41 requires Member States to achieve ‘good 
ecological status’ in all surface freshwater bodies between 2015 and 2027 and to ensure that 
in future there is no ‘deterioration’ of the ecological potential of the water environment. 
Different water bodies are categorised based on four elements - biology, chemical water 
quality, physical structure and water quality – which together determine the overall 
ecological potential of the surface water environment. The Anglian River Basin Management  
Plan42 details what actions need to be taken in order for the WFD requirements to be met in 
the area. Development with the potential to lead to river status deterioration or compromise 
the achievement of good ecological status as set out in the Anglian River Basin Management 
Plan should be accompanied by a suitable assessment and proposals for mitigation. 
3.52 There is a presumption against the use of non-mains foul drainage, except where it 
is proven that it is not reasonable to use mains drainage, taking into account cost, practicality 
and sustainability. 41 European Directive

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES43 See paras 101-
104 of the NPFF . The 
Sequential T est ensures 
that a sequential 
approach is followed to 
steer new development 
to areas with the lowest 
probability of flooding. 
44 T o view the LFRMS, 
see http://www.nnjpu.
org.ukMANAGING FLOOD RISK
3.53 Flood risk can arise from fluvial sources (rivers), through surface water flooding 
(usually arising when rainfall overwhelms drainage systems) and groundwater flooding 
(when the water table rises above the ground surface). The location of development can 
play a significant role in flood risk management. The use of the sequential approach43, in 
considering the locations of development, and also the specific uses within site boundaries 
can ensure that development is focused towards areas with lower probability of flooding. 
3.54 Flood risk management will require a collaborative approach between agencies 
that have roles and responsibilities relating to flood risk management. The Flood and Water 
Management Act 2010 (The Act) gives Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) a lead 
responsibility in relation to all local flooding issues (Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA)), 
notably the management of flood risk from surface run off, ordinary watercourses and 
groundwater, working in partnership with the Borough/District Councils, the Environment 
Agency (EA), water companies and other relevant parties. The responsibility for the 
assessment approval, adoption and maintenance of all surface water drainage systems will 
remain with the Local Planning Authorities, however, Northamptonshire County Council as 
the LLFA will provide the statutory consultee function. The water and sewerage companies 
are responsible for managing the risks of flooding from water and foul water or combined 
sewer systems. This new drainage consenting regime, also known as ‘Sustainable Drainage 
System’ (SuDS) approval, is due to be implemented during 2014. It will operate entirely 
separately from the planning system. The Northamptonshire Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy (LFRMS)44 sets out how NCC as LLFA and the partnership will work together and 
the activities to improve management of local flood risk. 
3.55 The Act also gives the EA a strategic overview of flood risk management. The EA 
are the lead authority for managing flood risk from reservoirs, main rivers and the sea, with 
an overview of all sources of flood risk. 
3.56 The North Northamptonshire Flood Risk Management Study (2012) (FRMS) Update 
indicates that it is not possible to protect all of North Northamptonshire to a uniform 
standard due to the wide range of flooding sources including from fluvial (rivers), surface 
water run-off and the under capacity of some drainage systems. As a result, dependent on 
location, some areas of existing development will be at greater risk of flooding than others. 
Therefore, flood risk management which combines traditional flood defences with more 
accurate flood warning and mitigation measures that incorporate the idea of resilience and 
resistance are now considered more appropriate than flood defences alone. 
3.57 The way in which developed, built up areas are drained is changing. Sustainable 
Drainage Systems are an important part of flood risk management, and are an essential 
component in the design of development. SuDS manage rainwater run off in a way that 
is similar to natural processes. It is important to identify the most natural position of SuD 
features early at the master planning stage. Consideration should also be given at this stage 
to the interplay between drainage and all aspects of land use, amenity and biodiversity to 
produce a holistic development proposal with integrated drainage. 53

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.58 Flood risk in North Northamptonshire will be managed through a positive approach 
that will increase the resilience of the area to risks arising from climate change. After taking 
into account the flood risk vulnerability of land uses, development must demonstrate 
through the application of the Sequential Test as set out in the NPPF, that there are no 
reasonably available sites in a lower flood risk zone or at a lower risk of flooding than the 
application site. Where necessary, the Exception Test set out in the NPPF should be applied. 
Development should be safe and not increase flood risk elsewhere. 
3.59  Developers should manage flood risk on site for a 1% (1 in 100) annual probability 
flood with an allowance for climate change without increasing risk to others. Piecemeal 
flood-mitigation measures should be avoided by implementing strategic flood risk 
management infrastructure projects through partnership schemes that will benefit the 
main towns of North Northamptonshire and the wider area downstream, taking climate 
change into account. Developers should demonstrate how their schemes are informed by 
local studies including the relevant Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRA’s), Surface Water 
Management Plans (SWMPs) and the Northamptonshire Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy (LFRMS), and where applicable, design to a higher standard of protection. 
3.60 As well as being relevant to site selection, developers should where appropriate 
apply the sequential approach to locating development within the site boundary. New 
development should be located in areas at the lowest probability of flooding so that the 
most vulnerable development45 is located in the lowest flood risk areas. 
STRATEGIC FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECTS
3.61 The LFRMS considers that a strategic approach to managing flood risk should be 
undertaken including the development of strategic flood storage on river floodplains 
upstream of urban areas . The Environment Agency supports this strategic approach. 
3.62 The Flood Risk Management Regulations (2009), which transpose the EU Flood 
Directive into UK legislation, set out the requirement for the EA to prepare a Flood Risk 
Management Plan (FRMP), which must be published by 2015. The plans will cover the same 
geographical area as the River Basin Management Plan and will be informed by the LFRMS, 
Surface Water Management Plans as well as carrying forward and updating CFMP actions. 
3.63  Flood storage measures will be required in the Nene corridor and the upstream 
catchments of the Slade Brook and River Ise and Willow Brook to enable future growth to 
be facilitated. These schemes include the Slade Brook flood storage reservoir at Glendon 
Hall and Weldon flood storage reservoir enlargement. 
3.64 In addition, there are small scale local improvements set out in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan that can have significant local benefits. Measures may include the creation of 
backwaters; the repositioning of bunds; tree planting, which can all reduce the impact of 
flood waters and improve water quality.  45 As defined in T able 2:

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES46 See Glossary 3.65 These strategic and local schemes will be funded through development where 
appropriate, in accordance with Policy 10 of this Plan. They offer opportunities for creating 
additional benefits for the local communities in addition to flood alleviation, which include 
the creation of green infrastructure46, recreational areas, wildlife habitats and corridors 
linking adjoining communities. Measures that maintain and improve the present standards of 
flood protection will be supported.
POLICY 5  – WATER ENVIRONMENT , RESOURCES AND 
FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
Development should contribute towards reducing the risk of flooding and to the 
protection and improvement of the quality of the water environment. This will be 
achieved through the following criteria: 
a) Development should, wherever possible, be avoided in high and medium flood 
risk areas through the application of a sequential approach considering all forms of 
flooding for the identification of sites and also the layout of development within site 
boundaries; 
b) Development should meet a minimum 1% (1 in 100) annual probability standard of 
flood protection with allowances for climate change unless local studies indicate a 
higher annual probability, both in relation to development and the measures required 
to reduce the impact of any additional run off generated by that development 
to demonstrate that there is no increased risk of flooding to existing, surrounding 
properties;
 
c) Development should be designed from the outset to incorporate Sustainable 
Drainage Systems wherever practicable, to reduce flood risk, improve water quality 
and promote environmental benefits;
d) Where appropriate, development should, subject to viability and feasibility, contribute 
to flood risk management in North Northamptonshire; 
e) Following any identified mitigation, development that would lead to deterioration or 
may compromise the ability of a water body or underlying groundwater to meet good 
status standards in the Anglian River Basin Management Plan (required by the Water 
Framework Directive) is unlikely to be permitted;
f)  Development will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that adequate 
and appropriate water supply and wastewater infrastructure is available (or will be 
prior to occupation).55

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESSECURING DEVELOPMENT OF BROWNFIELD LAND AND  
LAND AFFECTED BY CONTAMINATION
3.66 Ensuring that as much use as possible is made of suitable previously developed 
land (commonly referred to as brownfield land47) is a priority for North Northamptonshire. 
It is an important part of ensuring North Northamptonshire’s resilience, limiting the use of 
greenfield land, particularly of the best and most versatile agricultural quality, and ensuring 
the regeneration and restructuring of settlements. Brownfield sites do, however, often have 
ecological potential that should be considered under the provisions of Policy 4. 
3.67 Brownfield land may be subject to contamination from previous uses, which can pose 
risk to surface water, human health and the wider environment. North Northamptonshire’s 
groundwater is dominated by secondary aquifers, notably the Northampton sands formation 
although smaller areas which lie over the Lincolnshire Limestone are classified as a Principal 
aquifer. These aquifers are capable of supporting water supplies at a local scale and support 
surface water features. They are vulnerable to contaminants. The Environment Agency (EA) 
is the statutory body responsible for the management of groundwater resources. The EA 
has prepared guidance on groundwater protection  ‘Groundwater protection: principles and 
practice’ which sets out its approach to the management and protection of groundwater.
KEY LOCATIONS WITH AN IDENTIFIED HISTORY OR RISK OF CONTAMINATION
3.68 Certain parts of North Northamptonshire have a greater risk of ground 
contamination, arising predominantly from historic industrial processes, mineral extraction, 
landfill or intensive agricultural processes. These locations include:
n Corby, Gretton and Weldon – legacy of former steelworks and ironstone quarrying;
n Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Raunds – former tanning, in association with boot and shoe 
industries;
n Wellingborough, Kettering, Irthlingborough, Finedon and Islip – Former sites of blast 
furnaces and/or metal treatment facilities;
n Collyweston/King’s Cliffe – Slate quarries, former MOD uses and landfill sites. 
3.69 Contamination can also occur in other locations, including in the countryside (e.g. by 
inappropriate spreading of materials such as sludges, or as a result of contamination being 
moved from its original source). In addition, some areas may be affected by the natural or 
background occurrence or potentially hazardous substances, such as radon, methane or 
elevated concentrations of metallic elements. 
MANAGING CONTAMINATION 
3.70 A number of the potential development sites in North Northamptonshire are on 
brownfield land. Some sites are close to or include historic or current landfill sites. All new 
development must take into account the potential environmental impacts on people, buildings, 
land, air and water arising from the development itself and any former use of the site including, 
in particular, adverse effects arising from pollution. Consideration of these risks at an early 
stage is an important part of brownfield land regeneration. To assist the assessment of risk, the 
screening of sites that have potential to be affected by contamination should be undertaken. 
The results can be used to identify constraints that may be associated with land contamination. 47 Defined in NPPF (see 
glossary)56
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESIn enabling redevelopment of brownfield sites remediation may be necessary. The level of 
remediation required will be dependent on the proposed end use of the land. 
3.71 Where development is proposed on a site which is known or has the potential to 
be affected by contamination, a preliminary risk assessment should be undertaken by the 
developer and submitted to the local planning authority as the first stage in assessing the 
risk. Preliminary risk assessments and subsequent investigations should be carried out in 
accordance with the Environment Agency’s Contaminated Land Report (CLR 11) ‘Model 
Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination’, or any subsequent replacements.
3.72 Unless this initial assessment clearly demonstrates that the risk from contamination 
can be satisfactorily reduced to an acceptable level, further site investigations and risk 
assessment will be needed before the application can be determined. 
3.73 Remediation strategies should be proportionate to the proposed end use and should 
seek to ensure that there is no additional risk arising from the development. Remediation 
strategies are dependent on desktop/research based survey and potentially testing/site 
investigation and these will advise the necessary level of remediation. Prior to submitting 
SuDS proposals, developers should ensure that land is suitable for soakaways, and that 
the soakaways would provide effective drainage and protect vulnerable groundwater from 
contamination. 
3.74 Where pollution issues are likely to arise, intending developers should hold pre-
application discussions with the local planning authority, the relevant pollution control 
authority and stakeholders with a legitimate interest. 
3.75 In cases where planning permission is granted for development of a site on which the 
presence of contamination is known or suspected, the responsibility for safe development 
for the site rests with the developer and landowner. 
POLICY 6  – DEVELOPMENT ON BROWNFIELD LAND AND 
LAND AFFECTED BY CONTAMINATION
In allocating land for development and determining planning applications, the local planning 
authorities will seek to maximise the delivery of development through  the reuse of 
suitable previously developed land and buildings within the urban areas. 
Where development is situated on a site with known or high likelihood of contamination, 
remediation strategies to manage this contamination will be required. 
Subject to the Policies in this Plan, planning permission will be granted for development 
on land affected by contamination where it can be established by the proposed 
developer that the site can be safely and viably developed with no significant impact on 
either future users or on ground and surface waters. 57

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESCOMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES 
3.76 To increase the self-reliance of North Northamptonshire it will be important to 
ensure that the needs of the existing and future population are met. Development, notably 
the Sustainable Urban Extensions will generate population that require new services and 
facilities. 
3.77 Community services and facilities (sometimes referred to as Community assets) are 
those that provide for the health and wellbeing, social, educational, spiritual, recreational, 
leisure and cultural needs of the community. They play a vital role in promoting the 
sustainability of communities and contributing towards their self-reliance. Whilst the Growth 
Towns and Market Towns are the focus for facilities it will be important to provide services 
and facilities where they are appropriate to the needs of a community and to ensure the 
retention of premises and land for such uses. 
RETENTION, ENHANCEMENT AND NEW FACILITIES
3.78 The loss of services and facilities can have a significant impact on people’s quality of 
life and the overall viability of communities. With an increasing proportion of older people 
in the population, access to locally based services will become increasingly important, 
reflecting lower mobility levels. 
3.79  New development should retain, and, where possible, enhance existing community 
assets, services and facilities. It will be important that these are incorporated into the design 
of new development where possible. The co-location of community facilities achieved 
through measures such as the provision of multi-purpose community buildings is encouraged 
as this can represent an effective way of utilising existing assets to increase the provision of 
facilities and make them more viable. New services and facilities should be of an appropriate 
scale to meet the needs of the community where it is proposed. 
3.80 Open space, sports, arts and culture, recreation are essential elements of 
sustainable communities that contribute towards health, quality of life, sense of place and 
overall well-being. In addition they can add to an area’s uniqueness, making it a distinctive, 
stimulating and exceptional place in which to live and work. Spaces and facilities form part 
of the overall green infrastructure framework and within built up areas may also provide 
local linkages with town centres and urban neighbourhoods. The North Northamptonshire 
Strategic Sports Facilities Framework48 or more detailed local assessments identify the level 
of provision required to meet population growth in North Northamptonshire. It also sets 
out a range of key sports facilities that should be safeguarded and enhanced. The Cultural 
Investment Framework49 identifies the provision of cultural provision that is required to 
accompany growth in North Northamptonshire. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan sets out 
the necessary sport and cultural requirements.48 The North

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.81 Where development would result in the loss of a facility, applications should be 
accompanied by an assessment which sets out; the availability of alternative or replacement 
facilities; including whether the services that the facilities provided are being delivered by 
other means; whether the facility is still required, or why it is no longer needed by the 
community it serves, or whether there may be wider community benefits associated with 
the new proposal. The viability of facilities is also an important consideration and applications 
should also be accompanied by marketing information to demonstrate why the existing 
use is not viable. This viability information should include details of previous use, accounts 
and marketing information demonstrating that the premises has been marketed for use 
as a community facility for a reasonable length of time and that no suitable user has been 
found/or is likely to be found. In considering the loss of a community facility, and the level of 
information required to justify this, the planning authority will take into account whether its 
disposal is part of a wider estate reorganisation programme to ensure the continued delivery 
of public services and related infrastructure, such as those being undertaken by the NHS.
ASSETS OF COMMUNITY VALUE 
3.82 Through mechanisms such as the new Community Rights to Challenge and Build, 
voluntary groups, neighbourhood forums, parish councils and other community organisations 
should consider opportunities to develop or establish new community facilities. Under the 
Localism Act 2011, the Community Right to Bid has given local groups the right to nominate 
a building or land for listing by the local planning authority as an Asset of Community Value 
(ACV). When such a listed asset is to be sold, local community groups will have a chance 
to make a bid to buy it on the open market as a six month moratorium would be in place, 
preventing the sale taking place to other buyers during this period. Local authorities should 
encourage and support viable local initiatives to establish new community projects.
ACCESS TO NATURAL GREENSPACES AND WOODLANDS
3.83 Open space can take many forms, from formal sports pitches to green spaces within 
a development, linear corridors and country parks. It can provide health and recreation 
benefits to people living and working nearby, have an ecological value and contribute 
towards green infrastructure. 
3.84 Natural greenspaces are places where human control and activities are not intensive 
so that a feeling of naturalness is allowed to predominate. Natural England has provided 
guidance on accessibility standards for natural areas. The Accessible Natural Greenspace 
Standard (ANGSt) recommends that everyone should have a publicly accessible area of 
natural greenspace of:
n At least 2ha in size, no more than 300m from home;
n At least one 20ha site within 2km from home;
n One accessible 100ha site within 5 km of home; and
n One accessible 500ha site within 10km of home. 59

SECTION A: CORE POLICIES3.85 There are currently no accessible 500ha sites in North Northamptonshire, a key 
greenspace deficit although there are plans alongside the Rushden Lakes development to 
open up and connect existing greenspace areas to create one contiguous natural greenspace 
area of around 500ha. Sites larger than 100ha are mainly open access woodlands of the 
Rockingham Forest and wetland areas in the Nene Valley. 
3.86 The Woodland Trust has adopted a woodland access standard that aspires 
to everyone having access to a wood within easy reach of their homes. Whilst access is 
important it does need to be in appropriate locations and not override ecological values in 
sensitive areas. Across North Northamptonshire access to woodland is variable but access 
within 2ha of people’s homes ranges from 0.2% to 15.4% of the population50.
The recommended woodland access standards are: 
n A wood of at least 2ha within 500m of their home; and
n A wood of at least 20ha within 4km of their home.
3.87 The North Northamptonshire Green Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies 
a number of areas in North Northamptonshire that currently have poor or no access to 
significant (more than 20ha) accessible natural greenspace. 
3.88 Public open space and other green spaces provide a major component of broader 
‘community assets’. Individual areas of open space will be designated for protection through 
Part 2 Local Plans or neighbourhood plans. Evidence in support of a designation will be 
obtained with reference to:
n Up to date quantitative and qualitative local needs assessments of open space, sport and 
recreation facilities, including the identification of high quality areas; 
n Assets of community value listings;
n Parish/Community Plans. 
3.89 Green areas identified through local assessments as being of particular importance 
to the community may also be designated for special protection as Local Green Space (LGS) 
through Part 2 Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans. The preparation of action plans to 
protect and strengthen the features that make LGS distinctive and of value should also be 
considered. 50 The Woodland

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESII. ENSURING HIGH QUALITY DEVELOPMENT
4.1 A key element of the Place Shaping agenda that underpins the Plan is the importance 
of good design, both at proposal and settlement level. Good design is critical in ensuring 
that proposals create sustainable, connected, characterful and healthy places, which people 
will enjoy for years to come. In order to create sustainable places, all development will be 
assessed against the North Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles set out in Policy 8, 
which provides a checklist of the key issues that need to be considered by development in 
delivering the highest possible quality of development sought by the Plan. These principles 
seek to ensure that development proposals support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, 
which, where possible, make physical activity easy to do and create inclusive places and 
spaces that support community engagement. The specific Place Shaping principles for the 
key settlements in North Northamptonshire are set out in Table 2 of the spatial policies 
section of the Plan. 
4.2 As well as shaping development proposals, these principles should be used to 
help structure discussions between local communities, the local planning authority, the 
developer and other stakeholders. The principles should also be addressed in a Design 
and Access Statement where required by local validation requirements to accompany a 
planning application. Whilst smaller schemes may not require design and access statements 
it is important that these developments respond to their local context, and the North 
Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles should be used to shape these schemes. 
CONNECTIVITY
4.3 The Urban Structure Study51 (USS) found that many town centres are not as 
accessible as they could be, being disconnected from their immediate residential areas, 
transport interchanges or local open spaces. Blockages and barriers can include a street 
network with dead end streets and infrastructure such as railways and main roads. New 
development should provide connections to the maximum number of local streets and 
avoid dead ends to allow it to integrate into the wider settlement and connect to existing 
services and facilities, making legible routes, so places are easy for people to find their 
way around. Connectivity is a critical element in place shaping since well-connected towns 
and neighbourhoods can enhance land values; make local shops and facilities more viable; 
encourage people’s safety and security by improving surveillance; encourage more walking 
and cycling, leading to health benefits; enable areas to be better served by bus; and reduce 
vehicle emissions through fewer car trips. 
4.4 The importance of accessibility and permeability was also emphasised in the New 
Urbanisms New Citizens Study52 which examined, amongst other sites, completed schemes 
in North Northamptonshire. This sets out the importance of having local facilities within 
walking distance, but noted that if there are barriers, such as major roads, that need to be 
crossed to access these facilities this can be a significant issue for parents, children and young 
people as well as elderly people. It also emphasises the importance of centrally locating 
facilities in communities to ensure that all residents have easy and safe access to these. 51 North

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESCLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY 
4.5 Development needs to respond to climate change through its design, considering 
measures such as sustainable travel, landscape, planting for biodiversity, and sustainable 
drainage. It will also be important to consider the impacts on the wider natural environment. 
Where development will impact through air and light pollution, especially on designated sites53, 
it will only be permitted where measures can be put in place to minimise or eliminate impacts 
to a level that provides a high standard of protection for health and environmental quality. 
4.6 Incorporating ecologically sensitive design and features for biodiversity within 
a development scheme (Biodiversity by Design)54 can achieve significant improvements 
for biodiversity. By addressing ecological and green infrastructure aspects early on, 
design aspects such as site layout, including wildlife corridors can be tailored to provide 
enhancements and improvements for biodiversity that may not be possible later on within 
the design process. Measures to encourage biodiversity can include green roofs, planting 
and landscaping, the use of native species, setting up bird and bat boxes and sustainable 
drainage systems. 
CHARACTER
4.7 Character can be defined as the combination of qualities or features, which 
distinguish one place from another. As such, it is insufficient to examine any single aspect 
of place in isolation, and ‘character’ must be considered at all scales, from settlement to 
building. The USS and Building for Life Assessments have consistently identified that new 
developments often have a weak sense of character and identity. This is frequently the result 
of using standard responses to a range of design elements, such as public realm, landscaping 
or building typologies, resulting in developments which neither comprehensively respond to 
the established surrounding character, nor are sufficiently distinctive in themselves. 
4.8 Development should respect and enhance local character by ensuring that it 
responds to its topography, wider context, the landscape setting within which it is located, 
and the local streetscape and local building materials. This does not preclude innovative 
designs that can raise quality and can use materials and techniques that exceed the 
sustainability standards as set out in Policy 9. 
4.9 A design-led approach is considered to be the most appropriate approach to 
determining densities on a site by site basis having regard to the objective of securing the 
efficient use of land and the particular characteristics of a site and the area in which it is located. 53 As set out in

4.10 Development should ensure that new places are designed to be safe and healthy, 
responding to the needs of people of all ages, both within the proposed site, and in 
surrounding existing places. Designing places where people can be active, have places to 
meet and play, seeking to design out crime55 and ensuring that appropriate community and 
fire safety design considerations are incorporated within new development schemes will 
contribute towards the long-term sustainability and resilience of developments. Another 
important aspect is ensuring community safety and cohesion. Measures to assist with 
counter terrorism, community safety and security will need to be incorporated into the 
design of buildings and spaces, particularly public spaces that are likely to attract crowds. 
ASSESSING DESIGN QUALITY
4.11 There is a significant amount of national and local guidance relating to good design. 
Building for Life (BfL) 1256 published in 2012 and recognised as the industry standard is a 
toolkit helping developers and local authorities assess residential development and to assist 
in developing well designed schemes. It is based on a traffic light system, where the more 
green light answers to questions, the better the scheme is judged to be. ‘Reds’ are to be 
avoided and ambers minimised. Developments which achieve 9 or more greens are eligible 
for ‘Built for Life’ status, and those achieving all 12 can be recognised as ‘Outstanding’.  BfL 
12 has informed the North Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles. 
4.12 The quality of development can be reviewed by an independent panel of 
professionals through an Accredited Design Review. In North Northamptonshire this is 
provided by OPUN, the regional architecture centre alongside the National panel operated 
by Design Council/CABE. Significant projects should be referred to design review at an 
early stage. In addition, local design ‘surgeries’ are provided in North Northamptonshire 
to assess major (10 + houses/1000sqm + commercial) or sensitive schemes, preferably at 
pre-application stage. These surgeries use a development team approach, typically with 
representatives of the police, highways, urban design and other professionals, as required, 
and will assess schemes using the Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles and Building 
for Life 12 for residential schemes. 56 http://www.

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIESPOLICY 8  – NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE PLACE SHAPING PRINCIPLES
Development should: 
a) Create connected places by ensuring that it:
i. Connects to the maximum number of local streets, 
avoiding dead ends, to allow it to integrate into the 
wider settlement and to connect to existing services 
and facilities;
ii. Integrates well with existing cycle, pedestrian, 
public transport and vehicular movement networks 
and links to these routes in the most direct and 
legible way possible, to achieve logical routes;
iii. Improves or creates open green spaces which tie 
into the wider network of public green spaces and 
routes to allow for movement across the settlement 
through its green infrastructure;
iv. Provides direct routes to local facilities within 
or outside the site to create more walkable 
neighbourhoods; and
b) Make safe and pleasant streets and spaces by: 
i. Prioritising the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and 
public transport users and resisting developments 
that would prejudice highway safety;
ii. Ensuring a satisfactory means of access and 
provision for parking, servicing and manoeuvring in 
accordance with adopted standards;
iii. Ensuring that streets and spaces are continuously 
enclosed by buildings, or by strong landscaping with 
well-defined public and private space;
iv. Ensuring that streets and spaces, are overlooked, 
active, feel safe and promote inclusive access;
v. Creating legible places which make it easy for 
people to find their way around; and
vi. Contributing, towards enhancements to the existing 
public realm such as tree planting to add to the 
character and quality of the main streets and to 
encourage walking and cycling.
c) Ensure adaptable, diverse and flexible places by:
i. Creating varied and distinctive neighbourhoods 
which provide for local needs through a mix of uses, 
unit sizes and tenures; and
ii. Mixing land use and densities within settlements and 
ensuring that people can move easily between and 
through them by non-car modes;d) Create a distinctive local character by:
i. Responding to the site’s immediate and wider 
context and local character to create new streets, 
spaces and buildings which draw on the best of that 
local character without stifling innovation; 
ii. Responding to the local topography and the overall 
form, character and landscape setting of the 
settlement; and
iii. The creative use of the public realm through the use 
of measures such as incidental play spaces, bespoke 
street furniture and memorable features. 
e) Ensure quality of life and safer and healthier 
communities by: 
i. Protecting amenity by not resulting in an 
unacceptable impact on the amenities of future 
occupiers, neighbouring properties or the wider 
area, by reason of noise, vibration, smell, light or 
other pollution, loss of light or overlooking; 
ii. Preventing both new and existing development 
from contributing to or being adversely affected by 
unacceptable levels of soil, air, light, water or noise 
pollution or land instability; 
iii. Incorporate ecologically sensitive design and 
features for biodiversity to deliver ‘Biodiversity by 
Design’;
iv. Seeking to design out antisocial behaviour and crime 
and reduce the fear of crime through the creation 
of safe environments that benefit from natural 
surveillance, defensible spaces and other security 
measures having regard to the principles of the 
‘Secured by Design’;
v. Proportionate and appropriate community and fire 
safety measures; and
vi. Incorporating flexible and resilient designs for 
buildings and their settings, including access to 
amenity space.65

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESSUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS
4.13 The Building Regulations set national standards on key aspects of sustainable design 
including the reduction in carbon emissions and the efficient use of water. Those relating to 
carbon have been progressively strengthened in response to legally binding targets for the 
UK to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 26% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
4.14 The local planning authorities have secured significant sustainable design measures 
in developments permitted under Policy 14 of the 2008 CSS. It is important that these 
proposals are implemented as agreed unless there has been a material change in their 
technical feasibility or economic viability.
4.15 Following a comprehensive review designed to reduce cost burdens and complexity57, 
the Government has decided that, in future, technical standards relating to housing will be 
consolidated into the Building Regulations and accompanying Approved Documents. Energy 
efficiency and carbon compliance for individual homes will be covered in this way, with no 
provision for local variation. However, National Planning Practice Guidance emphasises the 
role of planning in reducing energy use through building orientation and form. In respect of 
water use, the Government proposes that an optional higher level of water efficiency of 110 
litres/person/day (105 litres within the home and 5 litres external use) will be allowed in areas 
of water stress. This equates to the requirements set out in CSH level 3 and compares to 
the current Building Regulation level of 125 l/p/d. North Northamptonshire is classified by the 
Environment Agency as an area of water stress58.
4.16 The Planning and Energy Act 2008 allows local planning authorities to specify in 
their local plans the minimum contribution to the building’s energy needs from on-site 
renewables and from low carbon energy sources. Such an approach (often referred to as 
the Merton Rule) can lock in an amount of carbon reduction to on site activities and may 
reduce energy costs to the occupiers of a development. Policy 14 relating to the opportunity 
for an exemplar new village at Deenethorpe Airfield requires a bespoke energy strategy 
for renewable and low carbon sources to provide at least 80% of energy requirements on 
site. Policies 32,  33 and 38 relating to SUEs at Corby, Rushden and Rothwell require the 
preparation of bespoke energy strategies. In addition, Part 2 Local Plans may set out targets 
for on-site energy generation from renewables and from low carbon energy sources, in the 
context of local priorities and the viability of development within the area. Existing planning 
conditions relating to renewable or low carbon sources of energy generation should be met 
unless it can be demonstrated that there has been a material change in technical feasibility 
or economic viability.
4.17 Policy 9 recognises that sustainability standards need to be applied flexibly to ensure 
that developments are viable. It encourages and promotes high standards of sustainable 
design and requires applicants to demonstrate how issues have been addressed, where 
appropriate, through Design and Access Statements. Further details will be set out in the 
North Northamptonshire Place Shaping Supplementary Planning Document. 58 Using current usage 
and climate change 
scenarios an indicative 
stress situation for each 
water authority has 
been arrived at. This is 
not related to the water 
company’s ability to 
supply its customers or 
on public water supply.

 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES4.18 Compliance with agreed standards should be demonstrated through the submission 
of a pre-assessment at planning stage, with planning conditions used to secure Design Stage/
Post-Construction reviews. 
4.19 Developers are encouraged to exceed the minimum standards set out in this Plan 
and Building Regulations. In particular, the scale of consented developments and new 
proposals in this plan, including the Sustainable Urban Extensions and Strategic Employment 
Sites, provides opportunities for use of decentralised and renewable or low-carbon energy 
or a need to safeguard their potential future use. 
4.20 While sustainable design and construction cannot make development acceptable on 
land in an unsustainable location, the provision of exemplary standards of sustainable design 
will be an important material consideration in determining planning applications. Sustainable 
design technologies are becoming cheaper and some of the most fundamental aspects can 
be tackled at limited cost through a passive approach at the initial design stage, for instance 
building orientation and building form. Notwithstanding this, it is recognised that sustainable 
design measures in excess of minimum requirements may impact upon the viability of a 
development and will need to be considered as part of the overall package of planning 
benefits offered by a proposal.
POLICY 9  – SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS
Development should incorporate measures to ensure high standards of resource and 
energy efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions. All residential development should 
incorporate measures to limit use to no more than 105 litres/person/day and external 
water use of no more than 5 litres/person/day or alternative national standard applying 
to areas of water stress. 
Design and access statements must demonstrate how sustainable design principles have 
been addressed. In particular: 
1. Subject to economic viability, developments of 1000+ square metres of non-
residential floorspace should, as a minimum meet BREEAM very good or equivalent 
nationally recognised standards; 
2. The layout and design of sites, buildings and associated landscaping should:
a. Maximise the use of passive solar design to address heating and cooling; and
b. Where technically feasible, enable access to or provision of decentralised energy 
networks, or safeguard future opportunities to do so without major disruption.67

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESIII. SECURING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES
PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
4.21 Improved infrastructure is necessary to cater for a growing population and to also 
deal with existing deficiencies. The phasing and delivery of the necessary infrastructure, 
in co-ordination with proposed growth for the area, is essential to achieving sustainable 
communities and protecting and enhancing North Northamptonshire’s environmental 
assets. Generally infrastructure can be divided into three types, and all three are required to 
deliver sustainable communities that function effectively: 
n Physical  – These are necessary to connect homes and workplaces to the wider 
environment such as transport, waste, utilities to meet the day to day needs; 
n Green  – To provide green spaces and habitat to allow ecosystems to function alongside 
development and includes land and water; and 
n Social  – To ensure that the communities can function effectively and covers a wide range 
of assets such as education, healthcare, sport facilities, libraries.
4.22 New development should be located and designed to minimise its demand on 
infrastructure. Design, layout and location of development can minimise the need for, or 
make more efficient use of some items of infrastructure. For example, improving water 
efficiency within homes and businesses reduces demand on potable water and sewerage 
infrastructure, the increase in provision of regular bus services can achieve modal shift, 
with fewer cars on the road that can ease congestion and help minimise costly highways 
improvements. Undertaking these small steps can develop better quality places and 
potentially release funds to support the delivery of critical infrastructure. The co-location 
of facilities achieved through measures such as the provision of multi-purpose community 
buildings or the location of services within the same building or site can in some instances 
help to increase the efficiency and viability of service provision.
4.23 Any necessary Infrastructure will need to be delivered in an appropriate timescale 
that is agreed with infrastructure providers and the local planning authorities. In the case 
of larger developments, this will be linked to specific trigger points that are set out in S106 
agreements or through planning conditions. In addition where a Community Infrastructure 
Levy (CIL) is adopted this will be collected from the type of development set out in the 
schedule and spent on infrastructure to support the area, within the scope of the regulations. 
It will be important that development proposals fully consider the wider cumulative impacts 
on infrastructure of the scheme, alongside other committed and planned development. Key 
infrastructure requirements are identified in the policies of this plan and in the Monitoring 
and Implementation Framework in Section D. 
4.24 The implementation of this Plan will require a co-ordinated approach to the 
activities of key delivery agencies including South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership 
(SEMLEP) and Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership (NEP) and service providers to 
ensure that new development is phased and supported by necessary infrastructure provision. 
Opportunities to secure funding both through public and private means must be maximised. 
An Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been prepared to identify the key infrastructure 
required to support the Plan, potential funding sources and broad phasing to be delivered 
alongside the proposed development in North Northamptonshire to 2031.68
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION A: CORE POLICIES4.25 North Northamptonshire’s commitment to sustainable growth and close 
working with infrastructure providers has led to significant investment in a number of key 
infrastructure projects, notably strategic projects such as the A14 J7-J9 improvements, Corby 
Train Station, the A43 Corby Link Road and committed funding for Broadholme Sewage 
Treatment Works improvements from Anglian Water. Despite this, a number of elements of 
the existing infrastructure in the plan area are already at or close to capacity. 
4.26 The ongoing development in North Northamptonshire, including the delivery and 
implementation of the SUEs will need to be supported by improvements to the physical, 
social and green and blue infrastructure, which will affect the rate that development can 
be brought forward. This includes the roads, sewers, utilities, waste management facilities, 
broadband and public transport services needed for development to work, and the facilities 
such as schools, libraries, leisure centres, museums, green infrastructure, health and social 
care infrastructure and open spaces that make sustainable communities.
4.27 Funding for infrastructure will come from a variety of different sources such as 
planning obligations or the CIL where adopted. Contributions will either be direct provision, 
through development design or cumulatively with other developments.
4.28 The demand for some of this infrastructure will be influenced by the success of 
policies and initiatives to encourage ‘greener’ lifestyles for instance encouraging modal shift 
and reducing car trips generated by a development or reducing water use. It is essential 
that development is phased to ensure that sufficient infrastructure is in place. In relation 
to water quality it is important that development does not go ahead unless the required 
sewage and water infrastructure is in place to accommodate the required sewage to ensure 
that there will not be locally significant effects or adverse effects on Natura 2000 sites. In 
North Northamptonshire, this relates to the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA. 
4.29 Next Generation Access (NGA)59 or fibre-based broadband is becoming an essential 
part of modern life as people and businesses increasingly use and rely on a much faster 
broadband internet connection to enhance their quality of life and business performance. 
It will support business transformation and growth, and will enable more people to work 
from home and remotely; it will reduce the need to travel; enrich children’s schooling and 
increasingly provide access to public services, health care and on-line learning.
4.30 The availability of superfast broadband is increasingly influencing where businesses 
choose to locate or expand and where people choose to buy homes. All new premises 
should be able to access Next Generation Access broadband technology and the need to 
retrofit new properties should be avoided. Developers should anticipate future needs and 
secure an appropriate broadband supplier to design and deploy the broadband network 
(alongside other utilities) at the outset. Alternatively, if there is no commercial interest from 
any telecommunications provider to serve the development at the time of build, developers 
should seek advice from broadband providers on the layout, design and specification of 
ducting and other required infrastructure, both external and internal to premises, in advance 
of provision to ensure that it meets industry standards for telecommunications to enable a 
future supply. Developers may wish to consider efficiency opportunities for the provision of 
ducting alongside other utilities, including beneath carriageways and footways.59 Next Generation 
Access (NGA) is 
a network which 
enables the provision 
of broadband internet 
services capable of 
much higher speeds and 
enhanced data transfer 
capabilities than can be 
delivered over a (current 
generation) wired copper 
network. In the UK, 
Ofcom has defined this 
as a maximum download 
speed that is greater 
than 24Mbps (2010). 
NGA broadband consists 
wholly or partially of 
optical fibre elements 
and can be referred to as 
‘fibre-based’ broadband.69

SECTION A: CORE POLICIESPOLICY 10  – PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
Development must be supported by the timely delivery of infrastructure, services and 
facilities necessary to meet the needs arising from the development and to support the 
development of North Northamptonshire. 
To achieve this:
a) A combination of funding sources will be sought to deliver the infrastructure 
required by this plan. Developers will either make direct provision or will contribute 
towards the provision of infrastructure required by the development either alone or 
cumulatively with other developments; 
b) Development should seek to minimise increases in the demand for infrastructure and 
services including through measures to encourage a reduction in car use, measures to 
limit the need for additional/expanded water and waste infrastructure and to create 
safe, healthy environments;
c) Planning permission will only be granted if it can be demonstrated that there is or will 
be sufficient infrastructure capacity provided within an agreed timescale to support 
and meet all the requirements arising from the proposed development;
d) The local planning authorities will work with developers and infrastructure/service 
providers to identify viable solutions to delivering infrastructure, where appropriate 
through phasing conditions, the use of interim measures and the provision of co-
located facilities; 
e) Next Generation Access broadband should be provided to serve all areas by 
partnering with a telecommunications provider or providing on-site infrastructure to 
enable the premises to be directly served.70

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESSPATIAL STRATEGY
5.1 The Spatial Strategy defines the role that the Urban Areas (Growth Towns and 
Market Towns) and Rural Areas (Villages and Countryside) will play in building a more 
sustainable, self-reliant North Northamptonshire in a way that maintains the area’s 
distinctive mixed urban-rural character. It provides the framework for more detailed Part 
2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans. The amount and distribution of new development, 
the part to be played by the town centres, and the provisions for infrastructure set out in 
this plan are determined largely by the roles that places are to play (summarised in Table 1) 
and the opportunities to use development to change places for the better (summarised in 
Table 2).
5.2 The revocation of the Regional Plan has allowed the Spatial Strategy for North 
Northamptonshire to be reviewed, taking greater account of local needs, opportunities and 
aspirations for development and positive change. Links with London and the wider South-East 
remain important to the future of the area, for all the reasons that previously warranted it being 
identified as a nationally important Growth Area. However, the new Plan takes greater account 
of North Northamptonshire’s relationship with neighbouring areas, in particular Northampton. 
It supports the County Council’s ‘Northamptonshire Arc’ concept of an integrated approach to 
economic development, the environment and connectivity across the county. 
5.3 The Plan seeks to increase the self-reliance of North Northamptonshire at all 
spatial scales: from the Housing Market Area as a whole; to the Northern and Southern 
functional sub-areas; and down to individual settlements. The general approach will be to 
meet needs as locally as possible, recognising that ‘higher-order’ facilities serving more than 
one settlement should be in the most accessible location (by a choice of means of transport) 
for the population served. The plan also provides a framework for the component parts of 
North Northamptonshire to cooperate in securing a greater range of facilities and services 
to compete more effectively with neighbouring areas. This will involve building on existing 
strengths and supporting distinctive roles for places as referred to in the vision.SECTION B  – SPATIAL POLICIES

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES
5.4 Section A of this plan explains how the spatial strategy has evolved. The spatial 
strategy encompassed in the Vision and Outcomes for North Northamptonshire is amplified 
into the following key spatial themes that underpin this plan:
 
A. Establishing a strong network of urban and rural areas  that make North 
Northamptonshire more self-reliant in terms of access to jobs, shops, leisure, arts and 
culture, affordable homes and services such as education and training, with an emphasis 
on Sustainable Urban Extensions as key ‘building blocks’ for sustainable growth;
B. Setting out place-shaping principles  for the main settlements to ensure that 
development and investment reinforce the best of local character and, where possible, 
change places for the better. This includes the objective to maintain the character of 
settlements by avoiding coalescence;
C. Ensuring that the settlements are well-connected  within and to each other and to places 
outside North Northamptonshire, with an emphasis on providing greater transport 
choice to support a modal shift away from reliance on use of the private car. This will 
mean planning communities in a way that makes public transport, walking and cycling 
attractive alternatives to car use for many people and ensuring that new development 
connects to the existing settlements; 
D. Enhancing the green infrastructure framework  of countryside, open spaces, 
waterways and other natural, historic and recreation assets including the Nene and 
Ise Valleys and the Rockingham Forest. These are promoted for their importance for 
biodiversity, leisure, tourism and green economic uses and as an important element in 
maintaining the urban-rural character of the area. 
These spatial themes are amplified below and provide the context for subsequent policies on:
E. Delivering economic prosperity  through the identification and provision of high quality 
employment sites and the enhancement of the local skills base, enabling the provision of 
more and better jobs for a growing population; 
F. Delivering homes  to accommodate significant population growth and inward investment, 
meeting the objectively assessed needs of the housing market area and planning positively 
for still higher levels of growth at Corby;
G. An infrastructure  strategy to secure the services and facilities required in support of 
sustainable communities.72

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES1. THE NETWORK OF URBAN AND RURAL AREAS 
SETTLEMENT ROLES
5.5 The roles of settlements in North Northamptonshire are set out in Table 1 on page 74. 
Infrastructure investment and the distribution of new homes, jobs, shops and other types of 
development will contribute to creating a well-connected network of settlements that together 
meet most of the needs of residents in North Northamptonshire. The focus will be on:
n Co-ordinated regeneration and growth in jobs, housing, leisure, retail and services at the 
Growth Towns of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and Rushden;
n A scale of development related to existing commitments, infrastructure capacity, 
regeneration needs and local character at the Market Towns, allowing them to provide a 
strong service role for their local community and wider rural hinterland;
n Supporting villages as focal points for community infrastructure and development to meet 
locally identified needs, where these cannot be met more sustainably at nearby larger 
settlements;
n Maintaining a living, working countryside and improving the area’s self-reliance by 
supporting opportunities to diversify the rural economy while conserving and enhancing 
the natural environment and maintaining distinctive and separate settlements by 
preventing coalescence. 
5.6 The Plan recognises the different opportunities and aspirations that exist in the 
north and south of the plan area:
n The north will deliver the bulk of new homes and jobs, with a strong focus on the 
Growth Towns of Corby and Kettering, where growth in population will be supported 
by expanded town centres and facilities to provide a counter-point to Northampton and 
other larger centres; 
n In the south, the Growth Towns of Wellingborough and Rushden will deliver significant 
growth, in particular in employment to reduce reliance on out-commuting. The permitted 
Rushden Lakes development will provide a major new retail and leisure development 
serving the southern area, allowing it and North Northamptonshire as a whole to become 
more self-reliant.
5.7 Distinctive and separate settlements will be maintained in North Northamptonshire. 
Part 2 Local Plans can identify areas of particular sensitivity to coalescence that should 
be protected strategically using measures such as strategic gaps to maintain the separate 
identities of settlements.
5.8 Within the southern area, the close geographic and functional links between 
settlements will be strengthened by the development of Wellingborough East and Rushden 
Lakes. Joint work on Part 2 Local Plans and/or strategic master planning is encouraged 
to ensure that development and infrastructure are coordinated in this area, including 
maximising accessibility to Rushden Lakes and the Nene Valley by non-car modes and 
identifying areas of countryside to be protected, and where possible enhanced, to avoid 
coalescence between settlements. 73

SUSTAINABLE URBAN EXTENSIONS
5.9 Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) are key building blocks for growth in North 
Northamptonshire during and beyond the plan period to 2031. These large mixed-use 
developments are an opportunity to create well planned and managed new neighbourhoods 
that integrate physically and socially with the existing towns. The principal SUEs shown 
in Figure 16 include between 2,500 and 5,500 dwellings together with employment and 
supporting infrastructure and services. These SUEs are committed through planning 
permissions except for:
n West Corby SUE, which was agreed as a broad location in the 2008 CSS. Policy 32 now 
allocates this land for a mixed-use development including around 4,000 new homes and 
sets out development principles to guide the preparation and consideration of a planning 
application; and
n Rushden East SUE, which is a new proposal including around 2,500 dwellings and 
associated jobs and facilities, reflecting the status of Rushden as a Growth Town. Policy 33 
identifies the broad location for this SUE, together with the key issues and development 
principles that need to be addressed as this is taken forward through master-planning.LEGEND

5.10 Concentrating resources on a limited number of sites is designed to ensure that 
major growth is implemented effectively, bringing forward infrastructure quickly and 
minimising disruption to existing and new communities. The local planning authorities are 
working with the landowners and developers to ensure that the SUEs are implemented 
as soon as possible. Priors Hall (North East Corby) and Kettering East are underway and 
the consented SUE at Wellingborough East is due to commence in 2015. The SUEs will be 
delivered during and beyond the plan period to 2031. Further growth will be considered 
through a future review of the Plan. Subject to detailed assessment, the expansion of the 
principal SUEs identified in Figure 16 is likely to make best use of infrastructure investment 
and support the viability of these developments.
5.11 The scale of consented and planned SUEs in North Northamptonshire provides 
a major opportunity to take forward the Government’s Garden City/Suburb agenda. The 
SUEs, as part of the towns, should individually and collectively address the principles set out 
in the Governments Locally-led Garden Cities Prospectus60, which are consistent with the

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESTHE RURAL AREAS
5.12 The villages vary greatly in character, size and function and it is important for plans 
to be responsive to local circumstances. The strategy is for development at villages to be 
limited to meeting locally arising needs unless meeting those needs would harm the form, 
character or setting of the village, result in coalescence or could not be served with suitable 
infrastructure. In these cases that need would be more sustainably met at a nearby larger 
settlement. Part 2 Local Plans may identify a more detailed rural settlement hierarchy based 
on local evidence in order to guide planning decisions and Neighbourhood Plans.
5.13 ‘Local needs’ in the rural areas both for affordable and market housing will generally 
relate to a village/parish or a group of villages/parishes where there is a strong functional 
relationship such as smaller villages relying on the school and shops in a larger village, and 
in turn helping to support those rural services. The need for rural development will be 
appraised with reference to Neighbourhood Plans, surveys and other community initiatives. 
These should distinguish the need for development to sustain thriving and sustainable rural 
communities from the more general demand for development in the rural area.
5.14 Local housing needs will be identified through site specific assessments agreed with 
the local planning authority. Evidence provided by applicants may be a material consideration 
where it demonstrates how a proposal will address issues such as a community’s need for 
affordable housing, the need to support viable local services or to enable a local business 
to prosper. In line with an urban focused strategy it is reasonable to expect some needs 
arising in the rural area close to a Growth Town or Market Town to be met at these larger 
settlements. This is particularly the case for villages that are located within a 5 km61 cycling 
distance of a Growth Town or Market Town to which they are linked by frequent public 
transport services62.
5.15 The four largest villages (Earls Barton, Finedon, Irchester and Wollaston) are 
significantly bigger than any other villages. They have populations in the range 3,500 to 
5,400 (2011 Census), compared to the next largest villages of Mawsley and Broughton at 
around 2,200 residents. This scale is likely to give rise to a strategically significant level of 
locally arising housing need over the period to 2031. Table 5 sets out a housing requirement 
for these four largest villages in order to provide a strategic steer for Part 2 Local Plans 
and Neighbourhood Plans. These villages are situated close to the Growth Towns of 
Wellingborough and/or Rushden, which are the most sustainable locations for residential 
development in the south of the plan area. In order to focus growth at these towns and to 
protect the character of the villages, additional housing development above the requirements 
identified in Table 5, other than small scale infilling in accordance with Policy 11, will be 
resisted unless agreed through the Part 2 Local Plan or Neighbourhood Plans.
5.16 An exceptional opportunity has been identified to create an exemplar new village 
community at Deenethorpe Airfield. This will be assessed against Policy 14 and if acceptable, 
will be treated as a ‘windfall’ in addition to the housing and employment targets for East 
Northamptonshire. 61 CTC 2013 Average

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESINFILLING AND VILLAGE BOUNDARIES
5.17 Criterion 2b of Policy 11 refers to small scale infill development being permitted on 
suitable sites within villages. This refers to the development of vacant and under-developed 
land within the main built up areas of the village on land which is bounded by existing 
built curtilages on at least two sides, such as the filling in of a small gap in an otherwise 
substantially built up frontage. 
5.18 In order to clarify the application of the criteria 2b and 2c of Policy 11, Part 2 Local 
Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans may define village boundaries or more detailed village 
boundary criteria, taking account of the character of the village. Village boundaries can 
provide a tool to plan positively for growth and to prevent ad-hoc encroachment into open 
countryside, particularly for villages located close to larger settlements where coalescence 
is a concern. Alternatively, where greater flexibility is warranted, Local or Neighbourhood 
Plans may set out policy criteria to clarify when a site will be treated as lying ‘within’ a village 
for the purposes of Policy 11.

village and its proximity to larger settlements. 
The plan sets out housing requirements for the largest villages of Earls Barton, 
Finedon, Irchester and Wollaston, where the scale of development arising from local 
needs will be of strategic significance. Part 2 Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans 
should identify the best locations for accommodating these development needs and 
may test higher levels of growth.
Development within villages that have only a limited range of services and facilities is 
likely to be limited to small scale infill development and ‘rural exceptions’ affordable 
housing schemes, unless Local or Neighbourhood Plans identify growth as a means of 
sustaining or improving the range of services in the village.
Part 2 Local Plans may identify villages that have a sensitive character or conservation 
interest, in which new development will be strictly managed. Opportunities for 
development to meet specific local needs may be identified through Neighbourhood 
Plans or the Community Right to Build.
Strong development management will be required to ensure that development

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 11  – THE NETWORK OF URBAN AND RURAL AREAS
Development will be distributed to strengthen the network of settlements in accordance with the roles in Table 1 and to 
support delivery of the place-shaping principles set out in Table 2. The special mixed urban/rural character of North 
Northamptonshire with its distinctive and separate settlements will be maintained through the avoidance of coalescence. 
1. THE URBAN AREAS
a) The Growth Towns will be the focus for infrastructure 
investment and higher order facilities to support major 
employment, housing, retail and leisure development;
b) The Market Towns will provide a strong service role 
for their local communities and surrounding rural 
areas with growth in homes and jobs to support 
regeneration and local services, at a scale appropriate 
to the character and infrastructure of the town;
c) Provision will be made for new housing as set out in 
Policy 28. Any proposals for significant additional 
growth should be tested and supported through Part 2 
Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans;
d) The Sustainable Urban Extensions shown on the Key 
Diagram provide strategic locations for housing and 
employment development within and beyond the plan 
period. If it is necessary to identify additional sites to 
maintain a 5 year deliverable supply of housing land in 
a district in accordance with Policy 28, these should be 
identified at the Growth Town followed, if necessary 
and relevant, by the Market Towns within that district. 2. THE RURAL AREAS
a) Development in the rural areas will be limited to that 
required to support a prosperous rural economy or to 
meet a locally arising need, which cannot be met more 
sustainably at a nearby larger settlement;
b) Small scale infill development will be permitted on 
suitable sites within Villages where this would not 
materially harm the character of the settlement and 
residential amenity or exceed the capacity of local 
infrastructure and services. Part 2 Local Plans and/
or Neighbourhood Plans may identify sites within or 
adjoining Villages to help meet locally identified needs or 
may designate sensitive areas where infill development 
will be resisted or subject to special control;
c) Local and Neighbourhood Plans will identify sites 
within or adjoining the villages to meet the rural 
housing requirements identified in Table 5. Other 
than small scale infilling or ‘rural exceptions’ schemes, 
development above these requirements will be 
resisted unless agreed through the Part 2 Local Plan or 
Neighbourhood Plans to meet a particular local need 
or opportunity;
d) Rural diversification and the appropriate re-use of rural 
buildings will be supported in accordance with Policy 
25. Renewable energy developments will be considered 
under Policy 26. Other forms of development will 
be resisted in the open countryside unless there are 
special circumstances as set out in Policy 13 or national 
policy;
e) The strategic opportunity for an exemplar sustainable 
new village community at Deenethorpe Airfield will be 
explored in accordance with Policy 14.79

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPLACE SHAPING PRINCIPLES FOR THE URBAN AREAS
5.19 Policy 8 sets out North Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles, many of which 
are drawn from the Urban Structure Study. This study considered the framework of streets 
and open spaces and how they function together in each of the Growth Towns and Market 
Towns. It identified a number of broad principles that should shape development proposals 
and investment decisions in order to make North Northamptonshire’s towns: vibrant places 
where it is easy and pleasant to get around, where people can access what they need or 
where they work easily, where people choose to walk, cycle or take public transport rather 
than to drive and where each town retains its local distinctiveness and has a strong, positive 
sense of place.
5.20 These principles are that the towns should:
1. Be well connected places  – to the centre, 
through the suburbs and to the countryside 
edge using street and green space connections;
2. Have a mix of uses  – with services and jobs 
located where people can get to them easily, 
including by foot, bicycle and public transport;
3. Provide Streets for All  – designed to be safe, 
pleasant, lively and characterful.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES5.21 These principles are outlined in more detail in Table 2. Together with the other policies 
of the Plan, notably Policy 15 these provide a set of guiding principles to help shape places over 
and beyond the plan period, ensuring that individual developments, public investment and Part 
2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans cumulatively contribute to creating more sustainable 
places. Table 2 should therefore be taken into account in preparing these plans and considering 
individual development proposals. Although the principles set out have been developed in 
relation to the towns, they are also relevant to many villages in North Northamptonshire. 
Policy 8 and the Place Shaping Principles will be further amplified through the preparation of 
the North Northamptonshire Place Shaping Supplementary Planning Document.
TABLE 2: PLACE SHAPING PRINCIPLES FOR NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE TOWNS
1. WELL CONNECTED PLACES
Improve access to the centre
1a. Radial routes should be the priority for investment, as the most connected streets, to improve them for pedestrians, cyclists and public 
transport to create high quality streets from the edge to centre of the town.
1b. Where possible, land uses along radial and main streets should be intensified, with built form to line the streets to create activity and 
footfall.
Improve access through the suburbs
1c. The wider network of streets should be linked to the radial routes in the most direct and clear way possible. 
1d. Street networks should be as connected as possible to encourage walking, cycling and public transport and make places easier to get 
through.
1e. New development should be well connected with adjacent street networks and facilitate future development to do likewise. Cul-de-
sacs should be used sparingly, and should be short.
1f. New development, and local investment should explore scope in existing neighbourhoods to link up cul-de-sacs to provide more 
connected streets.
Improve access at the edge
1g. Barriers created by major roads within and at the edge of the towns should be tackled through measures to allow safe, direct and 
convenient crossing points for pedestrians and cyclists and landscaping or built form to make it obvious to road users where people 
will be crossing.
1h. New development adjacent to barriers should allow for access across the barrier, even if it cannot be achieved within the scope of the 
development itself, so that future streets could link across it. 
Improve access using connected green networks
1i. Routes to the rural edge should link up with other green infrastructure routes, footpaths and cycle ways. 
1j. Green Infrastructure routes should be used to create additional pleasant linkages through towns to the edges.
1k. New developments should wherever possible connect to and expand the wider network of green routes, including the provision of 
new open spaces and/or ‘Green Streets’ within or outside the development site itself.81

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESTABLE 2: PLACE SHAPING PRINCIPLES FOR NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE TOWNS
2. MIX OF USES
2a. New or redeveloped local centres, schools and other civic uses should be located on the most accessible streets, and their location 
within the site should relate to the wider town. This may involve creating more than one entrance point.
2b. T o maximise integration, the mix of uses within a development should take account of the needs of residents/businesses within the 
scheme and its relationship to the wider urban structure of the settlement including the location of the site in relation to existing services 
and facilities in the town.
2c. Employment should be provided, where possible, within mixed use areas including the provision of open space and, where possible, 
housing. A variety of unit sizes should be provided to allow for more routes through and more variety and activity. 
2d. Where the need for very large buildings (for example large B8 warehouses) makes a mix of uses difficult to achieve, the development 
should allow staff to get to work by non-car modes and its design should seek to create an active, human-scale street scene by placing 
more active uses (such as offices) at the edge of building and/or wrapping the facades with smaller units. 
2e. The provision of new open space should relate both to accessibility through it, and the local characteristics of open spaces, with the 
potential for fewer larger spaces on some sites.
2f. Non-residential areas should still seek to create a connected street network so that they form part of the overall town network, even 
though the urban blocks may need to be larger.
2g. New development should create ‘walkable neighbourhoods’ where street layouts are configured to allow people to access a range of 
facilities. 
3. STREETS FOR ALL
3a. The Local Planning Authorities may work with the County Council to develop corridor management plans to ensure that incremental 
improvements form part of a comprehensive plan for the whole route. These could improve key radial routes to encourage walking, 
cycling and public transport, with lower speeds along high quality, characterful streets.
3b. New developments should connect to existing, well-used routes in obvious and direct ways along well overlooked public spaces and 
streets.
3c. The design of new streets should contribute to a network that supports local pedestrian, cyclist and public transport movement. They 
should be safe and attractive places, with appropriate vehicle speeds and reflecting the best of local character. Where possible they 
should incorporate tree planting and street furniture.
3d. Streets should be well overlooked and active. New development should provide front doors at the front. Commercial developments 
should front the street, with car parking behind.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESTOWN CENTRES AND TOWN CENTRE USES
5.22 The town centres in North Northamptonshire are the focus of retail, leisure 
and cultural facilities and provide significant employment. They are the hearts of their 
communities and serve the surrounding rural area.
5.23 A key outcome sought by this plan is stronger, more self-reliant towns with thriving 
centres. This is supported by national policy, which requires planning authorities to plan 
positively to meet the needs of main town centre uses63 in full, adopting a ‘town centre first’ 
sequential approach.
THE EXISTING NETWORK AND HIERARCHY OF CENTRES
5.24 Kettering is the largest centre within North Northamptonshire in terms of 
comparison shopping floorspace, and expenditure, followed (in order) by Wellingborough, 
Corby and Rushden. However, the town centres are small compared to those in neighbouring 
settlements such as Northampton, Leicester and Peterborough. 
5.25 The SUEs will include district/local centres of an appropriate scale with 
convenience shops and facilities such as medical centres and schools to meet the day-
to-day needs of residents. They will not provide significant convenience and comparison 
shopping provision or other facilities serving a wider area, which would be better located 
in the town centres. 
5.26 The latest survey of shopping patterns64 indicates that residents are spending more 
of their money in North Northamptonshire but that there is still a significant leakage of 
comparison spending, particularly from the southern area. The share of retained spending 
on comparison shopping is up from 50% in 2005 to 62% in 2011. This compares to 87% of 
convenience spending retained in the area. Despite the fact that an increasing amount of 
comparison spending is being retained, of the town centres, only Corby has seen its share 
grow, with gains elsewhere being a result of out-of-centre developments. 
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR TOWN CENTRES
5.27 The Government has highlighted the challenges facing town centres in the face of 
pressures from out-of-town shopping and the growth of on-line retailing. It believes that, for 
town centres to prosper, they need to be social places with a vibrant evening economy and 
to offer something that neither shopping centres or the internet can match. 
5.28 The Government-commissioned Portas Review65 concluded that, to remain 
successful, town centres must diversify with a range of uses beyond their traditional 
retail roles. Cultural and tourism facilities should be retained and improved and new 
facilities incorporated within town centres and regeneration schemes through a variety of 
mechanisms: including art, indoor sport and leisure, heritage, libraries, green infrastructure, 
and bars and restaurants. Opportunities to provide housing within the town centres will be 
an important element of regeneration. 
5.29 In response to this the Government is introducing a package of support for high streets 
addressing the burdens of business rates, parking enforcement and planning restrictions, and 
supporting community-led renewal and business improvement districts and local markets.63 NPPF defines main town 
centre uses as: Retail 
development (including 
warehouse clubs and 
factory outlet centres); 
leisure, entertainment 
facilities the more 
intensive sport and 
recreation uses (including 
cinemas, restaurants, 
drive-through restaurants, 
bars and pubs, night-clubs, 
casinos, health and fitness 
centres, indoor bowling 
centres, and bingo halls); 
offices; and arts, culture 
and tourism development 
(including theatres, 
museums, galleries and 
concert halls, hotels and 
conference facilities).

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESRUSHDEN LAKES
5.30 North Northamptonshire will soon have an additional focus of retail and leisure 
uses in the form of the out of centre Rushden Lakes development. This was permitted by 
the Secretary of State in June 2014 and is expected to open in Spring 2017. Rushden Lakes 
is a mixed retail, recreation and leisure scheme, including garden centre and retail units 
totalling no more than 32,511 square metres net sales area (of which no more than 929 
sq m for convenience goods), together with a hotel and leisure club, restaurants and lakeside 
visitor centre. This development will enhance the retail and leisure facilities available to 
local residents in the southern area, helping to retain a higher proportion of spending and 
contributing to the goal of greater self-reliance. It will also provide opportunities for tourism 
based businesses, including those in town centres, to benefit from increased visitors to 
North Northamptonshire.
 
RETAIL STRATEGY
5.31 The planned expansion of housing and population in North Northamptonshire 
means that, even with the growth in on-line retailing, there is forecast to be an increase in 
spending available to support shops, restaurants and other businesses.
5.32 A qualitative need has been identified for the provision of a medium-sized foodstore 
(around 2,000sqm net) to serve the Rothwell/Desborough area and a quantitative need for 
around 4,500sqm of convenience goods floorspace in the southern area by 203166. 
5.33 It is expected that the Rushden Lakes development will account for most, if not 
all, of the forecast additional comparison goods spending in the southern area and will 
also divert some trade from existing shopping locations. The greatest impact will be upon 
Wellingborough town centre, which is forecast to lose around 12% of its comparison shopping 
turnover67. In the northern area, the forecast growth in spending after 2021 presents the 
opportunity for the town centres of Kettering and Corby to expand and improve their retail 
offer. In order to attract this investment they need to compete effectively with out-of-town 
developments and neighbouring larger centres.
5.34 In view of the scale of the consented Rushden Lakes scheme, Policy 12 does not 
identify a specific comparison retail floorspace requirement for Rushden or Wellingborough 
town centres. The retail capacity update indicates that growth in spending on comparison 
goods could support some additional floorspace after 2026 but that this is dependent upon 
the performance of the Rushden Lakes scheme. The need for additional retail floorspace 
in the southern area will therefore be monitored and reviewed when the Rushden Lakes 
development has commenced trading and trading patterns have ‘bedded down’. In the 
meantime, the emphasis will be on consolidating and developing a retail, leisure/culture and 
housing offer that allows Rushden and Wellingborough town centres to operate successfully 
alongside Rushden Lakes. These changes will be plan-led through the relevant Part 2 Local 
Plans.66 North

ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES5.35 Policy 12 identifies a minimum floorspace requirement for Kettering and Corby, 
giving them an equal share of the capacity forecast to arise from population growth in the 
northern area over the period to 2031. This reflects the fact that Kettering is currently the 
largest retail centre but that Corby is accommodating a greater share of planned population 
growth. These objectively assessed requirements will be met within the town centres 
through the implementation of the adopted Kettering Town Centre Area Action Plan and 
the Corby Town Centre Masterplan, or any subsequent plans prepared by the local planning 
authorities. These requirements are forecast to arise after 2021 but proposals for earlier 
development or development in excess of the minimum requirements will be supported in 
the town centres where this will allow them to strengthen their position relative to other 
retail centres.
5.36 Retail investment alone will not be sufficient to sustain and regenerate the town 
centres. Part 2 Local Plans will identify the extent of the town centres and, within them, 
the primary shopping areas where retention of retail uses is most important. They will set 
out policies and proposals to accommodate new uses including additional housing, and to 
create the conditions in which businesses can prosper. This includes the identification of 
development sites, an enhanced public realm, improved access and adequate car parking. 
Alongside these planning initiatives the partner Councils will work with local communities 
and businesses to take forward Government initiatives to support the town centres.85

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 12  – TOWN CENTRES AND TOWN CENTRE USES
The vitality and viability of the town centres in North Northamptonshire will be 
supported by:
a) Securing and maintaining a vibrant mix of retail, employment, leisure and cultural 
facilities and supporting the provision of additional residential uses on appropriate 
sites including the re-use of vacant space above shops. Part 2 Local Plans will 
identify the extent of the Town Centres, sites to accommodate town centre uses, 
and Primary shopping Areas. Within Primary Shopping Areas Proposals for change 
of use or redevelopment will be permitted if the proposal adds to the attractiveness 
of the centre and does not lead to the predominance of A1 retail use being critically 
undermined;
b) Enhancing the public realm and improving access to the town centres for pedestrians, 
cyclists and public transport users and supporting proposals to provide convenient, 
safe and secure car parking;
c) Maintaining and regenerating Kettering and Corby town centres as the focus of higher 
order facilities and retail investment serving growing communities in the north. This 
will include a minimum increase of 12,500sqm net comparison shopping floorspace in 
each of Corby and Kettering town centres by 2031;
d) Adapting and diversifying Wellingborough and Rushden town centres to operate 
successfully alongside the permitted out of centre retail and leisure development 
at Rushden Lakes, which will provide up to 32,511sqm net retail sales area serving 
growing communities in the southern area;
e) Supporting the provision of a medium-sized foodstore to serve the Desborough/ 
Rothwell area and an additional 4,100sqm of convenience goods floorspace in the 
southern area by 2031;
f) Supporting development of town centre uses in the town centres of the Market Towns 
where this is of a scale and nature consistent with the character of the settlement and 
the role of Market Towns in providing mainly convenience shopping and local services. 
Part 2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans may identify additional development 
opportunities where these do not undermine the focus of retail development at the 
town centres of the Growth Towns; and
g) Applying the sequential and impact tests68 set out in the NPPF to the assessment of 
retail development and other town centre uses that are proposed outside the defined 
town centre areas (other than small scale rural development and the creation of local 
centres to meet the day to day needs of residents in the SUEs).68 See paras 26 and 27

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESRURAL EXCEPTIONS
5.37 The spatial strategy seeks to focus development towards the urban areas to 
ensure that the character of the rural area is maintained and reinforced, and that the 
open countryside is strongly protected. However, there may be special circumstances 
where development is acceptable in the rural area that is not identified in Part 2 Local or 
Neighbourhood Plans. These developments may be justified to meet locally identified needs 
for employment and services or to provide affordable housing in the rural area on sites 
adjoining established settlements. 
5.38 The rural exceptions mechanism secures a subsidy for affordable housing by allowing 
development to take place where permission would not otherwise be granted, and where, 
consequently, land values are low relative to normal development sites. It is expected that 
rural exception housing sites will be small in scale and normally be developed solely for 
affordable housing. In those cases where an element of market housing is required to cross-
subsidise the delivery of affordable housing, the scale should be the minimum required to 
secure a viable scheme. This will need to be justified through a viability assessment which 
demonstrates that the land value is reasonable having regard to the planning status of the 
land as open countryside. Any market housing should itself be tailored to meeting local 
needs such as accommodation for older people who wish to remain within their local 
community, or live/work units for activities which are particularly suited to a rural area. 
Where affordable housing is provided under the provisions of Policy 13 this must remain 
affordable in perpetuity and be consistent with the requirements set out in the relevant 
Local Authority Housing Strategies. 
5.39 The effective involvement of local communities is an essential prerequisite for the 
consideration of schemes to meet local housing needs, especially where the provision of 
market housing is proposed. 87

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESDWELLINGS IN THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE
5.40 This Plan seeks to avoid new isolated new homes in the countryside unless there 
are special circumstances as set out in the NPPF. One of the special circumstances in which 
isolated residential development may be justified is when accommodation is required to 
enable agricultural, forestry and certain other full-time workers to live at, or in the immediate 
vicinity of, their place of work to support the vitality and viability of the rural economy. It 
will often be as convenient and more sustainable for such workers to live in nearby towns or 
villages, or suitable existing dwellings. However, there will be some cases where the nature 
and demands of the work concerned make it essential for one or more people engaged in 
the enterprise to live at, or very close to the site of their work. 
5.41 There are specific functional, financial and viability tests which need to be satisfactorily 
met in order for an isolated rural workers’ dwelling to be acceptable. These are:
n A clearly established functional need for the development, and demonstration that this 
could not be fulfilled by another existing dwelling or accommodation in the area suitable 
for occupation by the workers concerned;
n The rural enterprise concerned has been established for at least three years, has been 
profitable for at least one year and is currently financially sound with a clear prospect of 
remaining so; and
n The size and scale of the proposed dwelling is commensurate with the established 
functional requirements.
5.42 The NPPF indicates that, exceptionally, the development of a dwelling in the 
countryside may also be acceptable if it is of an exceptional quality or due to the innovative 
design of the dwelling. It indicates that such a design should:
n Be truly outstanding or innovative, helping to raise standards of design more generally in 
rural areas;
n Reflect the highest standards in architecture;
n Significantly enhance its immediate setting; and
n Be sensitive to the defining characteristics of the local area.
 
5.43 Within North Northamptonshire, this will only be the case where proposals provide 
innovative standards of sustainable design, in excess of those set out in Policy 9 and national 
regulations, and make an outstanding contribution to the character of the landscape, 
promoting and reinforcing local distinctiveness. These matters require rigorous assessment 
given the protection afforded to the open countryside. Promoters of such schemes should 
therefore seek early advice through an accredited design review to provide an independent 
assessment of the proposal. 88

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 13  – RURAL EXCEPTIONS
As an exception to the spatial strategy set out in Policy 11, new development may be 
permitted in the rural area as set out below:
1. Development adjoining established settlements, beyond their existing built up area or 
defined boundary, where the proposal satisfies all of the following criteria: 
a) The form and scale of the development should be clearly justified by evidence that it 
meets an identified need arising within a village or network of villages through a local 
needs survey; 
b) Sites should be well-related to a settlement that offers services and employment to 
meet the day to day needs of occupants of the development; 
c) Development should enable access to local services and facilities by foot, cycle or 
public transport;
d) The scale and nature of the development will not exceed identified needs and must 
be appropriate to the surroundings, minimise impacts on the environment and be 
supported by existing or new infrastructure. Rural Exception Housing schemes 
should be purely affordable housing unless an element of market housing is essential 
to enable the delivery of the development. In such cases, the scale of market housing 
will be the minimum necessary to make the scheme viable and should be tailored to 
meeting specific locally identified housing needs;
e) Occupation of affordable units within the development will be controlled through a 
legal agreement or conditions to ensure that it remains available and affordable in 
perpetuity to meet local needs.
2. In open countryside, away from established settlements, permission will not normally 
be granted for new built residential development, with the exception of :
a) Individual dwellings of exceptional quality or innovative design as set out in paragraphs 
5.42 and 5. 43; and  
b) Dwellings for rural workers at or near their place of work in the countryside, provided 
that:
i. The dwelling is required to enable someone who is in full time employment in 
agricultural, forestry or similar rural businesses to meet the essential need of the 
enterprise concerned; and
ii. It can be demonstrated the functional, financial and viability tests in paragraph 5.41   
have been met.89

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESDEENETHORPE AIRFIELD AREA OF OPPORTUNITY
5.44 The Rural North of East Northamptonshire69 has a special rural character, with a 
dispersed settlement pattern incorporating attractive villages and the historic market towns 
of Thrapston and Oundle. This Plan sets out how these existing settlements will contribute 
to meeting objectively assessed needs for housing, jobs, services and facilities, taking 
account of the need to protect the character of the settlements and surrounding countryside 
and to ensure that most new development is focused on the Growth Towns as the most  
sustainable places.
5.45 A potential exceptional opportunity has been identified to enable the Rural North 
to accommodate additional development through the creation of an exemplar new ‘Garden 
Village’ of around 1,250 dwellings and associated employment and facilities homes at 
Deenethorpe Airfield. This would be in addition to growth delivered through an urban-
focused spatial strategy elsewhere in North Northamptonshire (including the housing 
provision set out in Policies 28 and 29).
5.46 Deenethorpe Airfield is located between Corby (3.5km to Priors Hall centre, 8km 
to the town centre) and Oundle (9km). Development of the new ‘Garden Village’ would 
enable the provision of dedicated pedestrian and cycle connections between Deenethorpe, 
Upper Benefield and the North East Corby sustainable urban extension (Priors Hall and 
Weldon Park). The airfield and its surroundings are in the single ownership of the historic 
Deene Estate. It contains extensive areas of previously developed land including parts of the 
main runway from the WWII USAAF bomber base. It has no designated areas of landscape, 
heritage or biodiversity value, but is surrounded by an attractive landscape, of farmland, 
containing historic villages and a number of designated heritage assets such as the Deene 
Park Registered Park and Garden. The airfield is located close to the A427 (and public 
transport services between Corby and Oundle) and development could potentially improve 
the highway network by providing a link between this road and the A43. 
5.47 The opportunity to consider the creation of a new village is considered a special 
opportunity arising in this location because of the commitment of the Deene Estate to 
use its landholdings and long term stewardship of the development to deliver an exemplar 
settlement, built to the highest possible standards of design and sustainability, with generous 
green space and a mix of homes, jobs, community facilities and services to create a balanced 
and cohesive community that is well integrated with the existing network of settlements. 
In particular, the single historic ownership of the site will enable substantial investment in 
infrastructure and community facilities early in the scheme.
5.48 Policy 14 sets out criteria against which this development opportunity can be 
refined and tested through the preparation of a masterplan. The onus is upon the Deene 
Estate (Brudenell family), in its role as promoter and intended long term steward of the 
Deenethorpe Airfield proposal, to satisfactorily demonstrate how the scheme would be an 
exemplar development.69 The Rural North is

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESCROSS-BOUNDARY WORKING
5.49 Any development at Deenethorpe Airfield should be complementary to the delivery 
of growth planned at Corby, particularly the SUEs, and must protect the setting of the village 
of Weldon from further coalescence. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the proposal to:
n Provide a distinct offer as a genuinely ‘exemplar’ sustainable rural community;
n Include an extensive belt of countryside around the new village that will be protected and 
enhanced for the foreseeable future;
n Demonstrate that the delivery of necessary transport infrastructure and the provision 
of public transport, health, education and other local services is properly co-ordinated 
across administrative boundaries.
DELIVERING A MIXED AND BALANCED COMMUNITY
5.50 The new development must deliver a mixed and balanced community through 
the provision of a wide choice of high quality market and affordable homes to meet the 
needs of different groups including families and older people and those wishing to build 
their own homes. A housing strategy will be prepared to identify the mix of house sizes, 
types and tenures required to meet this objective. Only around 12% of the dwelling stock 
in the Rural North, Oundle and Thrapston area is affordable housing and there are very few 
shared ownership properties. The new village must help to address this deficit through the 
provision of affordable housing in accordance with Policy 30, to include intermediate tenures 
such as shared ownership. In addition specialist housing for older people and opportunities 
for self-built/custom-built housing should be provided. 
DEVELOPING A MASTERPLAN FOR DEENETHORPE AIRFIELD
5.51 Policy 14 sets out the exemplar standards and provisions that will need to be achieved 
in order for the proposed village to be supported. Based on this Policy, the site promoters 
will work with the local planning authority and relevant Parish Councils (in particular, Deene 
and Deenethorpe, Benefield and Weldon) to prepare a masterplan for the new village, in 
consultation with local communities and other stakeholders including Corby Borough Council. 
This should take forward the vision for a sustainable ‘garden village’ of a character and scale in 
keeping with East Northamptonshire’s attractive small towns and villages, but which provides 
an exemplar of 21st Century standards of design, construction and community facilities. 
5.52 The masterplan will consider infrastructure requirements and any necessary matters 
of avoiding, mitigating or as a last resort compensating for environmental impacts. This will 
include consideration of how the proposal will contribute to the wider network of settlements, 
providing a focus for rural services and connecting to and supporting services and facilities in 
nearby towns. Consideration of environmental impacts will include assessment and justification 
of any impact on the significance of heritage assets and their setting.
5.53 The masterplan will include a delivery strategy to identify how and when the 
development will be implemented to the exemplary standards that are being proposed and 
with the required infrastructure and services. The mechanisms identified in the delivery 
strategy must provide a high degree of certainty that the exemplary standards and provisions 
set out in the masterplan will be achieved on the ground. This will include design coding, 
provisions for long term management and stewardship and opportunities for community 
governance, and the outline heads of terms for a legal agreement to deliver planned 
infrastructure and services.91

POLICY 14  – DEENETHORPE AIRFIELD AREA OF 
OPPORTUNITY
The opportunity to create a new ‘Garden village’ of around 1,250 dwellings and 
associated employment and facilities at Deenethorpe Airfield will be assessed through 
the preparation of a masterplan and delivery strategy subject to public consultation 
and agreed with the local planning authority. The masterplan will assess environmental 
impacts, including upon heritage assets, and will identify phasing and funding 
requirements and a delivery strategy for the timely provision of infrastructure. For 
such a proposal to be supported, the masterplan will need to demonstrate how the 
proposal will avoid, minimise and where necessary mitigate or compensate any adverse 
environmental impacts, and how it will meet all of the following criteria:
a) Create a model for sustainable rural living, with exemplary standards of design, 
construction and community facilities, made possible by the long term commitment 
of the Deene Estate, including through the use of pre-set design codes;
b) Provide for the new village as a whole to be carbon neutral through:
i. Buildings utilising contemporary construction techniques and exemplary 
construction standards and including systems to reduce their energy demand;
ii. A bespoke energy strategy including the production of heat and electricity 
from renewable and low carbon sources to provide at least 80% of energy 
requirements  on site;
iii. Investing in tree planting in the Rockingham Forest.
c) Make effective use of previously developed land to restore despoiled landscape and 
remove the existing aviation activity and open storage uses;
d) Support the rural economy through:
i. The provision of land and buildings for owner occupiers of small and medium 
sized enterprises and service providers to build to their requirements within the 
design  code;
ii. Ensuring extra land will be made available under 10 year options to allow successful 
enterprises to expand;
iii. Installation of super-fast broadband for all businesses and community facilities and 
also for all dwellings to support home working;
iv. Use of mechanisms to deliver apprenticeships and training opportunities in 
association with the construction phases for the new village;
v. Provision of community food production to serve local businesses.92

i. Providing nursery and primary education within the new village and identify how 
secondary education will be provided in a way that complements provision in 
neighbouring communities;
ii. The provision of appropriate health care facilities;
iii. Provision of local shops and services including a range of spaces for the  
community use.
f) Develop a balanced and mixed community, and address affordable housing needs 
through:
i. Providing affordable housing including rented and shared ownership accommodation;
ii. Specialist provision to meet the needs of an ageing population;
iii. Opportunities for bespoke individual and community custom-build projects 
including self-build housing subject to the design code. 
g) Maximise integrated transport choice and connections to services and facilities in 
neighbouring settlements through the preparation and implementation of a Travel 
Plan to achieve modal shift, including provisions for:
i. A network of dedicated pedestrian and cycle links throughout the new village, with 
direct and clearly defined connections to neighbouring towns and villages;
ii. A road network that allows the village to be served by public transport with the 
minimum possible diversion of services from the A427 to deliver viable public 
transport services to Corby and Oundle at the earliest possible opportunity;
iii. Improving the highway network with a link between the A427 and A43;
iv. Comprehensive infrastructure and incentives to facilitate the use of electric 
vehicles.
h) Provide a sustainable waste water treatment facility that meets the requirements 
of the Water Framework Directive and secure improvements in water quality and 
surface water management.
i) Strengthen the Green Infrastructure (GI), to enhance the landscape, prevent 
coalescence with neighbouring villages, support biodiversity, provide accessible 
opportunities for recreation and contribute to the Rockingham Forest for Life and 
wider Green Infrastructure links to nearby settlements through:
i. Provision of parks, allotments and large private gardens;
ii. Pro vision of significant areas of connected GI including new woodland, woodland 
pasture, agricultural meadows, open space and creative nature conservation 
including re-connecting the ancient semi natural woodlands of Weldon Park Wood 
to Langley Copse;
iii. Creating an extensive walking, cycling and riding network with the new GI across 
the Deene Estate and into the wider area of the Rockingham Forest. 
j) Help achieve good ecological status on the Willow Brook, in accordance to the 
requirements of the Water Framework Directive, through contributing to protection 
and enhancement of its river quality elements and protecting ground water.
k) Establish appropriate liaison and governance solutions by identifying the ways in 
which inclusive and continuous engagement, joint working and long term stewardship 
can be secured to deliver on the unique and exceptional garden village development.93

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES2. CONNECTIONS WITHIN AND BEYOND NORTH 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
6.1 Good transport and communication connections underpin a strong network of 
settlements and are essential to the economic prosperity of North Northamptonshire, the 
quality of life of local people and enhancing the urban structure of settlements. This Plan 
addresses connectivity at the following levels:
n Neighbourhood connectivity  – Improving connections, particularly for pedestrians and 
cyclists, between and around local neighbourhoods and villages and between settlements 
and the adjoining countryside;
n Local connectivity  – Improving connections to their most accessible town centre 
from urban neighbourhoods and from the urban fringes and rural hinterlands of North 
Northamptonshire;
n Area connectivity  – Connecting key places in North Northamptonshire; and
n Strategic connectivity  – Connecting North Northamptonshire at a national and  
regional level. 
6.2 This Plan has been informed by the Northamptonshire Transportation Plan70 (the 
Local Transport Plan prepared by the County Council) which sets out the strategic aims and 
goals for transportation in Northamptonshire. The Transportation Plan comprises a suite 
of documents which include a series of thematic ‘daughter’ documents that provide more 
detail on specific strategies and policy for specific themes and areas.
ACHIEVING MODAL SHIFT AND REDUCING THE NEED TO TRAVEL
6.3 The growth identified in the Plan will cause a significant increase in the demand for 
travel, particularly along the A14, A45 and A43 and on roads in towns, some of which are 
already congested at peak times. To alleviate the effects of growth on the transport network 
it will be necessary to increase levels of modal shift away from the private car towards other 
forms of travel including public transport, cycling and walking. The Plan takes forward the 
requirements of the Northamptonshire Transportation Plan by supporting the introduction 
of effective and attractive sustainable transport options that will encourage lasting modal 
shift in North Northamptonshire in order to deliver the following targets by 2031:
n A reduction of 5% in single occupancy car journeys to work from the existing built up 
areas of the Growth and Market towns; and
n A reduction of 20% in single occupancy car journeys to work from new developments 
compared to adjoining wards. 
6.4 These targets are considered to be challenging but realistic. New, large 
developments, in particular the Sustainable Urban Extensions provide the greatest scope for 
achieving modal shift because it is possible to design-in appropriate measures from the start. 
In contrast, it is much more difficult to achieve the same scale of change in existing areas, 
where a 5% target is considered more appropriate. In applying these targets to individual 
settlements and sites, account will be taken of local circumstances including existing levels 
of car use, the scale of development, the accessibility of the site and the viability of the 
development to sustain sustainable transport measures. 70 http://www.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES6.5 Reducing the need to travel and securing modal shift is dependent upon joint 
working between public and private sectors to design and implement an extensive range of 
measures in order to reduce the need to travel and, in particular, the need to travel by car. 
6.6 In all matters of land use planning, priority will be given to sustainable means of 
transport with consideration given to user groups in accordance with the following user 
priority order: pedestrian – cyclist – public transport – private vehicle. Reducing design 
speeds on residential roads, where appropriate and economically viable can support 
sustainable modes of transport. Planning policies will contribute to securing modal shift by:
n Increasing the ‘self-sufficiency’ of the area and individual settlements by maximising 
opportunities to access employment, services and facilities as locally as possible;
n Ensuring that new developments are well connected to existing towns, services and 
facilities and that, where feasible, they contain an appropriate mix of land-uses; 
n Improving travel options for public transport, cycling and walking; requiring development 
to be designed around easy access to these modes including the provision of new services 
and facilities and prioritised routes within existing urban areas;
n Improving the quality of parking in town centres, so it is convenient safe and secure, but 
where convenient and attractive alternatives to car use exist, or can be created managing 
parking supply at key destinations such as town centres and major retail and employment 
areas, in order to reduce congestion and level the playing field between the car and other 
travel options; 
n Promoting the transfer of road based freight transport to rail and water where it is 
feasible to do so; and
n Promoting high speed electronic communications within all developments, allowing 
businesses to communicate effectively without travel and providing the opportunity for 
residents to work at home and more locally. 
6.7 The County Council’s current parking standards for non-residential developments 
can be found within the Parking Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2003) and 
for residential development within the Northamptonshire Place and Movement Guide 
(December 2008). This guidance is currently being reviewed and it is anticipated that new 
parking standards will be adopted in Autumn 2016. The Northamptonshire Parking Strategy 
(January 2013)71 sets out that all developments will be assessed against these standards in 
order to determine the maximum parking requirement. Policy 8 requires the provision of 
parking in accordance with adopted standards and more detail will be provided in the Place 
Shaping SPD. 
6.8 The funding and investment framework provided by the Plan will be critical to the 
successful delivery of a modal shift over its lifetime. The Sustainable Urban Extensions 
provide a major opportunity to forge new travel patterns and habits for new and existing 
communities. Alternatives to car use will need to be championed here and elsewhere 
through marketing, the use of technology such as smartcards and seed-funding or kick start 
funding of public transport, alongside the hard infrastructure provision. 71 http://www.

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESWELL CONNECTED TOWNS, VILLAGES & NEIGHBOURHOODS:
THE CONNECTIVITY FRAMEWORK
6.9 A key ingredient of successful places is their ‘connectivity’. This section deals with 
physical connectivity; the ability of new developments to be integrated with the existing/
established built up area and ensuring that facilities can be easily accessed. Digital connectivity 
is also an important part of supporting economic growth and reducing the need to travel as set 
out in Policy 10. The Urban Structure Study72 (USS) examines the scope for greater sustainable 
movement through the towns. The way settlements are designed and laid out has a dramatic 
effect on travel, which in turn affects the climate. Cars and lorries generate about a third of 
Northamptonshire’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Reducing the need to travel by car is 
best tackled through well-planned places where shops and services are located in the most 
accessible places and where streets, squares and open spaces are pleasant, safe and direct so 
that walking, cycling and public transport are an automatic choice.
6.10 Better connectivity to the town centres will support their economic performance; 
improved links through suburban areas will support more travel by foot, bike and public 
transport; and enhanced connectivity to the rural area will improve access to the countryside 
and strengthen the urban-rural links which are a vital part of North Northamptonshire’s 
character. 
THE USS INDICATES THAT PLACES SHOULD:
n Be well connected to the centre and to the countryside;
n Include a mix of land uses; and
n Provide ‘Streets for All’, which are designed to be safe, pleasant, lively and characterful.
CONNECTIVITY ACROSS MAJOR ROADS
6.11 The USS and work undertaken by Highways England73 has identified particular issues 
with development located alongside ring roads which often comprise dual carriageways 
with speed limits of 40-60 mph and very little frontage development. These routes can 
be intimidating to non-motorised users, creating a barrier to pedestrian movement. 
Furthermore, the design also limits opportunities for other modes of transport along them. 
In particular, these routes have sometimes been built without footways or provision for 
cycling.
6.12 It is imperative that opportunities are taken, particularly where major development 
is being planned along or beyond such roads, to re-address the balance between place and 
movement and enhance connectivity across such routes. There is a strong preference for 
this to be achieved through the use of at-grade crossings along desire lines to ensure safer 
crossing points, combined with measures to improve the visual appearance of the road, 
reduce traffic speeds and enhance the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. These objectives 
will, however, need to be balanced against any demonstrable and detrimental impacts on the 
capacity of the road and the surrounding highway network and on the safety and technical 
and economic viability of solutions. 72 http://www.nnjpu.org.

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES6.13 The USS also identifies the need to improve key radial routes, which provide 
the most direct access to the town centres. Improvements to these routes are likely to 
occur incrementally, as changes associated with development or local improvements are 
implemented. Corridor management plans can provide a mechanism for ensuring that 
incremental improvements form part of a comprehensive plan for the whole route, designed 
to improve pedestrian and cycle access and their overall quality and character through 
measures to lower speeds, encourage tree planting and provide active frontages. The local 
planning authorities may develop these plans in consultation with the County Council. 
6.14 Enhanced connectivity can also be achieved through areas of open space, which can 
provide pleasant routes through towns and villages. Routes are, however, often fragmented 
and opportunities to link these areas will be pursued, in accordance with Policy 19. Where 
there is little scope to achieve this, other local streets should be improved with public realm 
enhancements to make them much greener. These ‘green streets’ will help to link open green 
spaces with additional street tree and shrub planting and reduced vehicular speeds that create 
a safer environment with greater emphasis on pedestrian and cycle movement. An example 
of this is the Greenway route which aims to provide a strategic cycling and walking route 
between Northampton and Peterborough and across the river valley of the Nene. 
POLICY 15  – WELL-CONNECTED TOWNS, VILLAGES  
AND NEIGHBOURHOODS
Connectivity will be strengthened within and around settlements by managing 
development and investment to:
a) Improve access from the edge of towns to their centres by focusing activity and 
investment on the main radial routes and rebalancing design towards pedestrians, 
cyclists and public transport; 
b) Create safe, direct and convenient crossing points on those major roads that present 
a barrier to movement, where feasible;
c) Design development to give priority to sustainable means of transport, 
including measures to contribute towards meeting the modal shift targets in the 
Northamptonshire Transportation Plan;
d) Improve local integration by ensuring well-connected street networks, very limited 
use of cul-de-sacs (which should be short in length) and low design speeds for 
residential roads to allow cycling on street and pedestrian priority;
e) Extend the existing Green Infrastructure network into new development and 
linking existing open spaces together through the provision of either new Green 
Infrastructure or ‘Green Streets’. 97

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESCONNECTING THE NETWORK OF SETTLEMENTS:
THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT
6.15 Enhanced public transport provision, both in terms of frequency and speed 
is fundamental to alleviating the impacts of development in North Northamptonshire 
and strengthening the network of settlements. Improving public transport links across 
North Northamptonshire will assist in mitigating any adverse impacts of development 
upon traffic flows along the key transport corridors such as the A14, A45 and A43. The 
Northamptonshire Bus Strategy outlines that to accommodate the levels of growth set out 
in the Plan the number of passengers will need to increase by around 50% from a 2012 
base figure. The Strategy identifies a range of inter urban services that should be enhanced 
which provide linkages between the Growth Towns and across the County and beyond 
together with minimum levels of provision at the Market Towns and within the rural area, 
proportionate to population. 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE ARC TRANSIT NETWORK
6.16 The Northamptonshire Arc74 concept seeks to increase connections between 
Corby, Kettering, Rushden and Wellingborough to Northampton and Daventry. Detailed 
local studies and investigations co-ordinated by the County Council indicate that a new 
rapid-transit alternative is needed to help meet the forecast increase in demand for travel 
and manage its impact on the transport network. 
6.17 The proposal is to develop and implement a strategy for a high quality 
Northamptonshire Arc Transit Network (NAT) utilising the latest technology (such as 
active demand management and real time information) to provide an attractive, practical, 
affordable and low carbon alternative to the private car not only for urban travel, but also 
for inter-urban journeys. This will link the urban spine of North Northamptonshire (the four 
Growth towns), with Northampton and Daventry. 
6.18 The NAT will incorporate bus based rapid transit links, which will be introduced 
between the town centres, major employment sites and major new developments such as 
the Sustainable Urban Extensions where commercially feasible. This will help to transform 
internal connectivity and improve access to transport hubs and the strategic network. This 
is a long term objective and it is likely that the network would be implemented in phases 
within and beyond the period of this Plan. 74 http://www.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESLOCAL HIGHWAYS IMPROVEMENTS
6.19 Planned improvements to the A509 between the A45 at Wellingborough and A14 at 
Kettering will reduce congestion along this route and enhance transport links between the two 
towns. The proposals (known as the Isham bypass and Isham to Wellingborough improvement) 
will bypass the settlements of Isham and Great Harrowden and bring traffic relief to these 
villages. Funding towards the Isham bypass has been secured through the Northamptonshire 
Growth deal, and the scheme is scheduled for completion by 2019 which will support the 
delivery of the Wellingborough North SUE. Implementation of this scheme, together with 
the completed A43 Corby Link Road, will mean that there will be few settlements still lying 
on North Northamptonshire’s principal road network. It is not therefore proposed to build 
further village bypasses or other roads in North Northamptonshire unless improvements are 
needed due to the proximity to major new development. 
6.20 The provision of a link road between Rothwell North and the A6 bypass and the 
Wellingborough Eastern Distributor Road, providing a link between the A509 and the A45, 
will be brought forward as part of the Sustainable Urban Extensions at those towns. Similarly, 
the A427 Weldon Relief Road will be facilitated by proposed development at Weldon Park, 
which forms part of the North-East Corby Sustainable Urban Extension. 
6.21 Funding has been secured for Phase 2 of the Corby Northern Orbital Road, 
which will serve development to the north east of Corby and facilitate development at 
Rockingham Enterprise Area as set out in Policy 27. Funding has also been committed by the 
Government75 to improve the A45 Chowns Mill roundabout. As well as being essential to 
North Northamptonshire’s strategic connections (see Policy 17), this scheme will facilitate 
the development of the Rushden East SUE (Policy 33).
6.22 The provision of a distributor road to the east of Kettering, linking the A43 Northern 
Bypass and a new junction on the A14 (Weekley-Warkton Avenue) will be brought forward 
as part of the proposed Kettering East Sustainable Urban Extension. As well as providing 
this connection (to the A43), enabling access to/from the north of the site it also provides 
substantial relief to the villages of Weekley and Warkton. Transport modelling indicates that 
this road will be required prior to the completion of 2,700 dwellings, in order to improve 
access to the Sustainable Urban Extension and provide some traffic relief to Kettering 
town centre, villages to the east and the A14. Development proposals should safeguard the 
potential for this distributor road. The development of the road will need to incorporate 
measures to mitigate its impact on the Grade 1 registered Park and Garden. These measures 
could include detailed alignment and specifications, including lighting, and provision for the 
replanting of the avenue.
MULTI MODAL INTERCHANGES 
6.23 The Northamptonshire Transportation Plan and its Bus and Rail Strategy daughter 
documents emphasise the importance of improving and developing bus interchanges in 
the Growth Towns and ensuring that the railway stations are improved and enhanced. 
Significant improvements are proposed at both Kettering and Wellingborough Rail Stations, 
which will act as focal points for major committed development around the stations and 
are important components to ensure the economic prosperity of North Northamptonshire. 
The development of multi modal interchanges and increased access to stations by walking 
and cycling is supported as part of the wider package of station improvements. 75 Department of

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 16  – CONNECTING THE NETWORK OF 
SETTLEMENTS
Connections between the towns in the Northamptonshire Arc will be strengthened and 
links between the Market Towns and the train stations improved. This will be achieved 
through managing development and investment to: 
a) Prioritise enhanced public transport provision, including the Northamptonshire Arc 
Transit Network and its phased implementation for the introduction of rapid transit 
links between the town centres, major employment sites and Sustainable Urban 
Extensions where feasible; 
b) Improve and develop centrally located bus interchanges at Corby, Kettering, 
Wellingborough and Rushden;
c) Develop multi modal interchanges at the railway stations to include facilities for 
service information, good access by foot and bicycle, provision for buses and taxis, 
and secure parking facilities; and
d) Provide road infrastructure required to facilitate development, strengthen 
connections between settlements and/or, relieve existing communities from traffic, 
including but not limited to the following improvements:
i. A43/A14 including the Weekley/Warkton Avenue as part of the Kettering East 
sustainable urban extension; 
ii. Rothwell North/A6 as part of the Rothwell North sustainable urban extension; 
iii. A509/A45 Wellingborough Eastern Distributor Road as part of the Wellingborough

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE’S STRATEGIC CONNECTIONS 
6.24 Whilst improved self-reliance is a key aim of this Plan, North Northamptonshire 
will not meet all of the needs of local people. In particular, health and higher education 
facilities; retail and leisure services at surrounding large towns and cities; and employment 
opportunities will continue to draw people out of North Northamptonshire. Investment 
in strategic transport infrastructure to ensure that people and goods can move around is 
crucial to the future success and functioning of North Northamptonshire and its ability to 
attract and accommodate growth. North Northamptonshire’s key strategic connections 
include the A14, A45 and A43 highway corridors and the Midland Main Line railway. 
6.25 North Northamptonshire needs to be accessible for inward investors and 
local businesses need to be able to compete both in national and international markets. 
Arrival gateways to the area, and particularly to the Growth Towns utilising employment 
opportunities around the Stations, will be critical in presenting a competitive image for the 
area. Additionally, strategic transport routes, both road and rail, need to provide a high 
quality service without congestion or overcrowding. 
IMPROVING STRATEGIC CONNECTIONS 
6.26 Improvements to North Northamptonshire’s strategic connections will incorporate 
enhancements to increase the capacity of roads, including the creation of new roads, 
widening of existing roads and junction improvements alongside improvements to bus and 
rail services. 
6.27 Extensive technical work has been undertaken with Highways England (HE) who is 
responsible for the Trunk Road network,  (the A14, and A45) and the County Council who 
are responsible for all other roads, to determine the cumulative highway impacts of future 
developments, including any requirements for highways infrastructure to mitigate these 
impacts and to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place for the timely delivery of 
these.
6.28 The Joint Planning Unit is working closely with the County Council, Highways 
England, adjoining local authorities Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership (NEP) 
and South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (SEMLEP). This work will ensure 
consistency between the JCS and priority schemes identified in strategic economic plans, in 
order to support the funding and delivery of transport priorities required for the sustainable 
growth of North Northamptonshire within its wider context. 
6.29 North Northamptonshire is dependent on investment beyond its boundaries to 
improve its connectivity. A key initiative for Northamptonshire and a major infrastructure 
gap in the national strategic road network is the interchange between the M1, M6 and A14 
at Junction 19 of the M1. Relieving congestion at this junction and improving journey time 
reliability is critical to the logistics sector and the national economy. Work on this scheme, 
known as ‘the M1 J19 Improvement’ commenced in January 2014 and is scheduled to be 
completed by Autumn 2016. The comprehensive upgrading of the A14 between Huntingdon 
and Cambridge (including the new Huntingdon southern bypass) is supported as part 
of the strengthening of the A14 as a trans-european network route that serves North 
Northamptonshire. 101

overview.pdf6.30 Policy 17 lists schemes included in the Northamptonshire Transportation Plan 
(Major Roads Strategy76). Many of these schemes are important to area connectivity, and 
strengthening connections between places in North Northamptonshire and beyond. Widening 
of the A14 between junctions 7 and 9 of the A14 around Kettering, a key priority for North 
Northamptonshire, was completed in 2015.  
6.31 There is also a need for junction improvements at Junctions 9 and 10 of the A14. As 
part of the Kettering East development the provision of a new junction to the east of A14 
junction 10 (known as Junction 10a) is required, which will replace the east facing slip roads 
at Junction 10 and support the future growth of Kettering. The Government has committed 
funding for this scheme as part of its Roads Investment Strategy77. 
6.32 The A43 provides a key connection between North and West Northamptonshire. 
The County Council has already programmed dualling from Northampton as far as 
the Holcot/Sywell roundabout.  While it may not be possible to complete the dualling 
all the way to the A14 within the plan period, substantial progress will be necessary if 
slow journey speeds are not to become an impediment to the economy, and further 
phases of the dualling will be strongly supported. Essential improvements to the A45 include 
improvements to the Nene Valley Way between the M1 and Wellingborough and a number of 
A45 junctions between the A509 Wilby Way and B663 at Raunds, notably Chowns Mill have been 
identified as priority junctions requiring improvement. Funding to upgrade Chowns Mill has been 
committed by the Government in its Road Investment Strategy78. These improvements form part 
of a wider package of improvements for the A43/A45 artery. The dualling of the A45 between 
Stanwick and Thrapston has been identified in the Northamptonshire Transportation Plan and 
the Road Investment Strategy identifies this as a scheme to be developed for the next road 
period (2020/1-2024/25). This remains an important local priority for North Northamptonshire, 
and measures to secure funding will be strongly supported. 
THE ROLE OF RAIL 
6.33 The re-opening of Corby Station to provide a rail link to the town has been a significant 
part of the Corby growth and regeneration strategy. The Northamptonshire Rail Strategy 
identifies a range of priorities to enhance rail provision within North Northamptonshire 
including the electrification of the Midland Main Line which has commenced and is due to 
be completed from Bedford to Corby by 2017 and northward from Kettering to Leicester 
by 2019. The partner councils in North Northamptonshire will continue to seek improved 
north and south bound services. This includes enhanced north bound services from Corby 
to Oakham, Melton Mowbray, and beyond to Derby and Nottingham.
6.34 The potential for provision of mainline services to new rail stations at Desborough 
and Irchester will be considered at a later date and the feasibility should be investigated. The 
Rail Strategy sets out that to succeed, any new station will need to demonstrate a positive 
business case, have a realistic chance of obtaining funding and have benefits to the local 
community which outweigh any localised disturbances in terms of additional road traffic 
generation or other negative impacts. 
 
6.35 Whilst the proposed HS2 rail network does not pass through North 
Northamptonshire it will be important that current services on the Midland Main Line are 
maintained and potential opportunities to access HS2 routes from the Midland Main Line 
and exploit additional network capacity to reduce journey times and increase frequencies 
are supported. 76 http://www.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 17  – NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE’S STRATEGIC 
CONNECTIONS
North Northamptonshire’s strategic connections with surrounding areas will be 
strengthened and enhanced by managing development and investment to ensure that 
they are to the standard necessary to fulfil the role expected of them. New development 
that would prejudice their role will not be permitted. 
The priorities for further work and investment within North Northamptonshire in the 
period to 2031 are: 
a) Rail (Midland Main Line)  Upgrading of the rail infrastructure to increase capacity 
for passengers and rail freight, including:
i. Electrification and line speed improvements northbound, including from Corby, 
and southbound from all stations to London St Pancras International and Europe; 
ii. Station improvements, the provision of additional capacity and improved frequency 
of services calling at Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough; 
iii. Ensuring continuation of through services to Leicester, Derby and Nottingham and 
connecting with HS2 for onwards northbound travel; and
iv. Investigation of the longer term potential for railway stations at Irchester (to serve 
Irchester, Higham Ferrers and Rushden) and Desborough (to serve Desborough 
and Rothwell).
b) Bus Services
i. A sub-regional bus network with priorities for investment being Bedford to Market 
Harborough, linking the towns in the urban spine with the Midland Main Line 
stations; and Peterborough to Northampton providing a direct strategic link along 
the A605/A45 spine;
ii. Express coach services linking North Northamptonshire to the West Midlands and 
East Anglia along the A14; and
iii. Real Time information at key boarding stops to give passengers details as to the 
expected likely arrival times of buses. 
c) Road Network
i. A14 Kettering Bypass improvements between junctions 7 and 9; 
ii. A14 improvements at A509 junction 9 and A6 junction 10 including the provision of 
Junction 10a to serve the Kettering East SUE;
iii. A45 improvements including the A45/A6 Chowns Mill junction and dualling 
between Stanwick and Thrapston;
iv. A509 between A14 Kettering and A45 Wellingborough (including Isham Bypass and 
Isham to Wellingborough improvement); and

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESHGV PARKING
6.36 Lorry parking facilities need to be available to serve strategic routes and freight 
attractors within the Plan area to assist in achieving the efficient, safe and secure movement 
of freight and reduce crime related to Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) parked in unsecured 
locations. 
THE NEED FOR HGV PARKING 
6.37 The Northamptonshire HGV Parking Study79 considered the need for HGV parking 
facilities to meet strategic needs and to address existing local needs associated with major 
freight generators, particularly in the logistics sector. The Study identified a substantial gap 
between the availability of formal lorry parking facilities and demand and concluded that 
up to three lorry parks are required in Northamptonshire. The A14, A45 and A43 strategic 
corridors provide the preferred locations for new, designated truck stops and at least one 
facility should be located on both the A14 and A45 routes, each with provision for a minimum 
of 200 lorries. Research undertaken as part of the Study also indicated that 75% of drivers 
would be willing to travel 2km from these strategic corridors to find suitable parking facilities 
and that 25% would not be willing to leave their intended route. Shorter distances will also 
reduce the negative impacts arising from HGV movements. The Study concluded that truck 
stops may also be provided in other locations where a need can be demonstrated, including 
sites close to major freight attractors such as concentrations of distribution and industrial 
activities. It is important that access routes for HGVs avoid residential areas. 
6.38 Subsequently, a detailed assessment of potential HGV parking sites along the A14 
corridor has been undertaken and planning permission has been granted (2012) for a 24 
hour, secure HGV parking facility with 204 spaces at junction 3 of the A14 near Rothwell. 
This provision will meet a significant proportion of the identified strategic need along the 
A14 corridor in North Northamptonshire. 
REVIEWING THE NEED FOR HGV PARKING 
6.39 The need for HGV parking should be regularly reviewed to ensure that contributory 
factors that can impact on need such as changes in the provision of HGV parking facilities, 
the level of freight transferred from road to rail and additional freight generators are fully 
understood. Planning applications for new facilities or impacting on existing facilities should 
be accompanied by robust assessments of need, which should include an objective survey of 
market demand for the facility. 
6.40 Strategic distribution businesses (also referred to as logistics) within North 
Northamptonshire attract significant HGV traffic and generate a need for HGV parking 
facilities, both overnight and for drivers awaiting their collection or delivery time slot. 
Where new developments are likely to create a demand for such provision or exacerbate an 
existing problem the local planning authority may require the applicant to make suitable on-
site provision or provide a financial contribution towards an appropriate facility.79 http://www.nnjpu.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESENSURING SAFE AND SECURE HGV PROVISION
6.41 Lorry parks must include effective measures to create a safe and secure 
environment which restricts opportunities for crime to be committed. Proposals should 
incorporate ‘Secured by Design’ principles and applicants are encouraged to seek ‘Park 
Mark’ accreditation by Northamptonshire Police. 
6.42 In order for a new truck stop to be acceptable in open countryside, the applicant 
must demonstrate that the need for the facility outweighs the need to protect the intrinsic 
character and beauty of the countryside in accordance with national policies and this Plan. 
Should sites be granted planning permission in an open countryside location, a restoration 
plan, which sets out how the site will be restored to its previous use in the event that the 
HGV parking operation ceases, will need to be agreed with the local planning authority. 
POLICY 18  – HGV PARKING
A net increase in HGV parking will be sought to address an existing shortfall and to meet 
the needs arising from new employment development by: 
a) Resisting the loss of lorry parks unless it can be demonstrated that:
i.  The facility is no longer required; or
ii. An alternative use of the site is beneficial and replacement lorry parking will be 
provided in an appropriate location before the existing use ceases. 
b) Ensuring that where developments are likely to lead to an associated demand for lorry 
parking which is not already provided for by an appropriate facility, they contribute 
towards the provision of formal lorry parking facilities which could include lorry 
stacking areas within the proposed development or financial contributions towards 
extending or providing an appropriate facility.
c) Granting planning permission for HGV parking facilities where it can be demonstrated 
that the proposal:
i. Is supported by robust, up-to-date evidence of need;
ii. Is of a size that is viable and makes a significant contribution to meeting the 
identified need;
iii. Is located within 2kms of the trunk road network or a major freight attractor and 
can be directly accessed avoiding existing residential areas;
iv. Is designed and laid out to a high standard and incorporates ‘Secured by Design’ 
principles;
v. Will provide a level of on-site facilities for lorry drivers appropriate to the size of 
the scheme, with any ancillary uses being of a type and scale appropriate to the 
main use of the site as a truck stop; 
vi. Incorporates suitable arrangements for the management and maintenance of the 
facility; and
vii. Where located in the open countryside, incorporates a restoration plan agreed by 
the local planning authority for the after-use of the site to be implemented in the 
event of the cessation of the use of the site for HGV parking operations.105

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES3. THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK
7.1 The green infrastructure framework, including blue infrastructure comprising the 
network of rivers and lakes, provides a range of ecosystem services (see paragraph 2.51) 
and is vital in maintaining the rural/urban character of North Northamptonshire. The focus 
is on the strategic corridors of the Rivers Nene and Ise, and the Rockingham Forest area and 
includes the open countryside around urban areas, which is important to maintain distinct 
and separate settlements. In some instances there is limited connectivity to access the 
natural greenspace from the main towns and opportunities need to be taken to link urban 
parks and woodland into the wider countryside. 
7.2 The network also provides opportunities to enhance tourism in North 
Northamptonshire, while ensuring that its most sensitive assets are protected. The special 
policy areas of the Nene and Ise Valleys and Rockingham Forest will be important in 
stimulating sustainable economic growth through tourism and rural diversification. 
7.3 The special policy areas will be a focus for promoting:
n Recreation and tourism
n Public access
n Environmental education
n Biodiversity
n Water management
n Climate change mitigation
n Green economic uses
n Sustainable land management.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
7.4 Green infrastructure (GI) is a strategically planned and delivered network comprising 
the broadest range of high quality green spaces and other environmental features. It should 
be designed and managed as a multifunctional resource capable of delivering ecosystem 
services and quality of life benefits. For example GI supports healthier lifestyles, manages 
flood water, improves air quality and helps to mitigate the effects of climate change. Green 
infrastructure should thread through and surround the built environment and connect the 
urban area to its wider rural hinterland.
7.5 Green infrastructure networks have been identified at both strategic (i.e. sub-
regional) and local scales across Northamptonshire80. The sub-regional network consists of a 
series of interlinked corridors which broadly follow the main river valleys and tributaries and 
extend beyond the boundary of North Northamptonshire. These corridors connect areas 
of particular natural heritage, greenspace, biodiversity or other environmental interest. The 
sub-regional corridors are priority areas for investment and enhancement.
7.6 The sub-regional GI network is complemented by local GI corridors. These cover a 
variety of land uses and provide opportunities for projects and investment at a smaller, more 
local scale. Increasing the range of uses within each local corridor will improve benefits at the 
community level. The local corridor locations are indicative: their alignment and extent can 
be defined further through more detailed studies, including Sustainable Urban Extension, 
Masterplans, Part 2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans. 80 Northamptonshire

7.7 The development proposed in North Northamptonshire presents an opportunity to 
contribute to the green infrastructure network. Natural England encourages the integration 
of green infrastructure at the outset of development so that the greatest benefits will be 
gained. Development located within the GI network will be expected to contribute towards 
its enhancement. The JPU and local planning authorities will liaise with adjoining authorities 
to ensure that green infrastructure corridors are harmonised and enhanced across 
administrative boundaries and recognised in the development of specific proposals. 107

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES7.8 The Green Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies key green infrastructure projects 
planned or underway in North Northamptonshire. These projects are primarily a response 
to growth and development, which will increase the number of visitors to nature reserves 
and other natural areas. Creating new green infrastructure is one way to mitigate this 
pressure. Where not managed appropriately, visitor pressure can damage the features that 
made a site special and attractive to visit in the first place. The projects will help to reduce 
recreational impacts in key sensitive locations, notably within the Upper Nene Valley Special 
Protection Area (SPA). Many also address local deficiencies in access to natural green space 
(see Policy 7). Projects will be delivered by a wide range of partners, who must be prepared 
to take ownership of and commit to taking forward specific projects. 
7.9 The Northamptonshire Local Nature Partnership is strengthening leadership on 
landscape and other environmental matters, and raising awareness of the services and 
benefits a healthy natural environment brings to economic, social and ecological wellbeing. 
The designation of the Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area (NIA) is helping to develop 
the next phase of environmental improvements to enhance and reconnect nature across the 
Nene Valley landscape. 
POLICY 19  – THE DELIVERY OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
The special mixed urban and rural character of North Northamptonshire will be 
maintained and enhanced by:
a) Managing development and investment to secure a net gain in green infrastructure 
through:
i. Establishing multi-functional greenspaces within the GI network;
ii. Providing, where opportunities exist, new wildlife habitats, facilities and routes to 
enhance assets and the linkages between them;
iii. Supporting the strategic green infrastructure priorities of
1. The Nene and Ise Valleys (Policy 20)
2. The Rockingham Forest (Policy 21). 
b) Safeguarding identified sub-regional green infrastructure corridors by:
i. Not permitting development that compromises their integrity and therefore that 
of the overall green infrastructure network;
ii. Using developer contributions to facilitate improvements to their quality and 
robustness;
iii. Investing in enhancement and restoration where opportunities exist.
c) Contributing towards the enhancement or ongoing management of local green 
infrastructure corridors by prioritising green infrastructure investment in areas where 
net gains can be made to the range of functions, particularly those that improve access 
between the towns and their surrounding countryside and remedy local deficiencies 
in open space provision and quality; 
d) Requiring, where appropriate, project level Habitats Regulations Assessments, to 
ensure the protection of European designated sites such as the Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits Special Protection Area and Ramsar Site.108

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESNENE/ISE VALLEYS
7.10 The Nene and Ise Valleys are the green and blue threads linking North 
Northamptonshire’s urban centres with its countryside and containing many of its key 
environmental and green infrastructure assets. The Valleys include the settlements of:
n Wellingborough, Irthlingborough, Ringstead, Thrapston and Oundle (Nene Valley);
n Desborough/Rothwell, Geddington, Kettering and Burton Latimer (Ise Valley).
7.11 This special policy area offers opportunities to use and enjoy the rivers and lakes, 
increase waterway-based tourism including provision of marinas, moorings and boat hire, 
strengthen biodiversity conservation and management, create new and improve existing 
green infrastructure, enhance connections between settlements and create a sense of place 
in and around the river valleys. 
7.12 Rushden Lakes will form a major new green and blue infrastructure resource, 
allowing the public to access and enjoy wildlife and other assets along the Nene Valley. The 
management proposals associated with the development will support the linking up via 
the North Northamptonshire Greenway (cycle and footway) of various established nature 
reserves along the Nene Valley, and through Wellingborough East and Chester Farm to 
Wellingborough railway station. It will also link to the adjacent Stanwick Lakes site, producing 
a total area under nature conservation management of about 500 hectares. The Rushden 
Lakes development will also incorporate a visitor centre from which conservation activities 
will be based.
7.13 The Nene Valley and Ise Valleys have a diversity of attractions like historic mills, 
tourist attractions including Wicksteed Park, water based country parks, nature reserves 
and traditional market towns alongside larger towns of Kettering and Wellingborough. Some 
such as Stanwick Lakes and Oundle have become destinations in their own right. Others 
have the potential to be better appreciated and provide tourism opportunities. 
7.14 The Nene Valley Strategic Plan81 identifies specific economic opportunities at each 
settlement in the Nene Valley. The riverside towns provide the main opportunities for 
tourism. The vision in the Strategic Plan is of a gradual transition from more formal activities 
in the urban centres to informal, dispersed activities in the rural area. The preparation of 
Town-River Plans for the urban areas as recommended in the Nene Valley Strategic Plan, or 
the inclusion of guidance within Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans to develop 
the potential of the towns as gateways to the river and the wider valleys, could help to 
identify site opportunities and proposals to improve visual and physical linkages with the 
waterways, including floodplain re-naturalisation and de-culverting within the urban area.
7.15 Increased visitor pressure must be managed to conserve the area’s environmental 
assets particularly within and around the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA. Certain 
locations within the SPA are more easily accessible, particularly close to the urbanised 
areas. Some of these areas are able to support higher levels of visitors than other areas 
as they contain suitable infrastructure to support visitors, whilst ensuring that biodiversity 
is protected. Development within the Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area (NIA) is 
expected to take account of the natural environment early in the design process and that 
ecological connection through and around the development site to the wider habitat 
networks is delivered. 81 River Nene Regional

subsequent level of visitor access. A study undertaken to understand the impacts of visitor 
access in the SPA emphasises that within the SPA, visitor activity should be focussed on 
existing key sites such as Stanwick Lakes, and opportunities exist to enhance provision at 
other locations outside the SPA. Away from the ‘honeypots’ access should be more low 
key, with measures put in place to ensure access levels remain low, particularly at the most 
sensitive sites.
POLICY 20  – THE NENE AND ISE VALLEYS
The Nene and Ise Valleys will be priorities for investment in green infrastructure to 
strengthen biodiversity and landscape character, support a prosperous local economy, 
provide leisure and recreational opportunities and support the revitalisation of towns 
and the protection and enhancement of their surrounding countryside. Proposals should 
ensure the integrity of European designated sites such as the Upper Nene Valley Gravel 
Pits SPA are protected. This will be achieved by managing development and investment to: 
a)  Improve visual and physical linkages between the rivers and waterways and adjacent 
settlements by creating and maximising vistas to the valley/water and ensuring 
development, public realm and access are orientated to the valley/water; 
b) Develop the tourism potential of Wellingborough, Thrapston and Oundle as gateways 
to the rivers and the wider valleys as focal points for the provision of waterside 
facilities; 
c) Prioritise the protection and enhancement of existing visitor attractions and facilities 
with appropriate infrastructure to ensure that these remain the focal points for 
visitors, in order to take the pressure off more sensitive locations;
d) Support new green infrastructure and heritage based attractions of a type and 
scale that can be accommodated by existing or new infrastructure and which strike 
an appropriate balance between visitor numbers and biodiversity, landscape, local 
amenity and heritage interests;
e) Provide a focus for improved navigation and enhanced waterways along the River Nene; 
f) Improve strategic recreation trails along the length of the Nene Valley and developing 
these in the Ise Valley; 
g) Identify opportunities and proposals for floodplain and river re-naturalisation,  
de-culverting within urban areas and river habitat improvements. 110

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESROCKINGHAM FOREST 
7.17 To address the issue of woodland fragmentation across North Northamptonshire and 
to align with the many other benefits of increasing tree planting, the Rockingham Forest area 
has been identified as a special policy area. In addition the Rockingham Forest was selected 
by Defra as one of only five climate change projects nationally, to support the UK Low 
Carbon Transition Plan and the Government’s Carbon Plan to pilot a Carbon Sink Forestry 
Project. The Forestry Commission, Woodland Trust and other key partners established the 
Rockingham Forest for Life (Forest for Life: Rockingham) project, which aims to:
n Protect, enhance and increase existing ancient woodland through linkages and buffering;
n Reinstate woodland on previously wooded sites;
n Capture carbon dioxide by creating 40 hectares of new woodland each year;
n Community engagement with local woodlands; and
n Reinvigorate traditional woodland activities and food from the forest.
7.18 The project encompasses the community, land owning and business sectors. It seeks 
to secure private sector investment to provide additional funding and encourage the planting 
of sites that would not otherwise come forward. To date, significant tree planting through 
the project has already taken place, with over 29,000 trees planted on 12.6 ha at two sites82 
in the Rockingham Forest north of Kettering. The planting has used a mix of native trees 
to provide a range of environmental and landscape benefits. Alongside the creation of new 
woodland, the protection and buffering of ancient woodland will be important. 
7.19 In addition to carbon capture, the establishment of new woodland will provide many 
other benefits associated with the creation of green infrastructure including reinforcing 
green infrastructure corridors, aid surface water management and improve landscape, urban 
and village settings. It also has the potential to play a major role in climate change adaption 
by increasing connectivity and enhancing existing and create new wildlife corridors. 
7.20 The Rockingham Forest provides a range of tourism and recreational opportunities 
largely focussed around green infrastructure and heritage. The development of additional 
tourism facilities, including the provision of additional accommodation will need to be 
balanced with the need to protect and enhance environmental assets and ecosystem 
services as set out in Policies 1-4 and infrastructure capacity. It will be important that 
new tree planting is appropriately sited and uses suitable species to ensure the successful 
enhancement of the forest.82 2013 15,000 trees 
were planted on 6.6 ha 
of woodland in Weekley 
Hall Wood, March 2014

The Rockingham Forest will be regenerated to increase carbon storage, strengthen 
biodiversity, landscape character and green infrastructure, support a prosperous rural 
economy and provide appropriate leisure and recreational opportunities. This will be 
achieved through: 
a) 40ha a year of new tree planting appropriately sited and using suitable species secured 
through direct input of landowners, local communities and businesses, supported by 
funding mechanisms including development contributions;
b) Linking fragmented habitats and protecting and reinforcing ancient woodland, 
particularly in and around urban areas supported through landscaping associated with 
development proposals;
c) Supporting rural economic development in accordance with Policy 25, with a focus 
on woodland based activities including sustainable food and fuel production;
d) Protecting or enhancing tourism and recreation attractions and supporting new green 
infrastructure and heritage attractions of a type and scale that can be accommodated 
by existing or new infrastructure and which strike an appropriate balance between 
visitor numbers and biodiversity, landscape, local amenity and heritage interests;
e) Enhancing green links in accordance with Policy 19 to enable residents of towns and

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES4. DELIVERING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
8.1 The Plan aims to make North Northamptonshire more self-reliant by achieving a 
sustainable balance between local jobs and workers and a more prosperous and diverse 
economy. It does so by:
1. Planning for enough jobs to match the forecast growth in labour force plus an additional 
number in the southern area to reduce further reliance on out-commuting. This results in 
a challenging target for 31,100 net additional jobs alongside the strategic opportunity for 
40,000 new homes over the period 2011-31;
2. Ensuring that the right amount and type of employment land is available in locations that 
balance the demands of the market with the capacity of infrastructure and the need to 
protect, and where possible enhance the environment. This includes:
a. Safeguarding existing and committed employment sites which are of the right quality 
and suitably located in relation to infrastructure and neighbouring uses. This will include 
safeguarding employment land allocations for a range of uses in support of a balanced 
economy; 
b. Providing for additional sites in sustainable locations, particularly to meet the needs of 
small and medium sized businesses and identified growth sectors;
3. Supporting the enhancement of skills in the local workforce through improved 
opportunities for education and training to provide a more dynamic and flexible labour 
market and providing the infrastructure required to support skills delivery at all ages;
4. Promoting the provision of infrastructure and services needed to provide a competitive 
business environment, including transport and electronic communications infrastructure 
notably enhanced broadband provision (see Policies 10 and 25);
5. Promoting the regeneration of the town centres as a focus of employment provision (see 
Policy 12), with the permitted Rushden Lakes development providing additional retail and 
leisure jobs in the south of the area; 
6. Promoting the diversification of the rural economy, in particular by supporting the 
retention and development of local services and community facilities in villages; the 
development of rural economic activities; and supporting farm diversification including 
the conversion of existing farm buildings and infrastructure for employment and other 
commercial developments such as tourism related development. 
These themes are developed further on the next page and in Policy 23 which deals with the 
spatial distribution of economic development.113

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESJOBS/WORKER BALANCE 
8.2 The Plan aims to ensure that, as a minimum, North Northamptonshire delivers 
enough new jobs for the labour force arising from planned population growth, plus additional 
jobs in the southern area to help reduce levels of out-commuting. 
8.3 The 2011 Census indicates that around 69% of the employed labour force living in 
North Northamptonshire also works in North Northamptonshire. This has fallen from 76% 
at the 2001 census, reflecting the fact that housing growth has outstripped employment 
growth, which has under-performed against ambitious jobs targets, in part due to the 
recession. 
8.4 The Employment Background Paper83 indicates that in 2011, over 18,000 more 
workers commuted out of North Northamptonshire, than commuted in, with the largest 
flows to Northampton. This is a significant pool of labour that could take up jobs closer to 
home within North Northamptonshire. 
8.5 To maintain the existing  balance between labour force and employment opportunities 
within North Northamptonshire, it will be necessary to create a minimum of 24,200  net jobs 
across all sectors of the economy by 203184. However, in order to reduce reliance on out-
commuting in accordance with the Vision and Outcomes of the Plan, Policy 23 sets a target 
of creating 31,100 jobs. This is a significant challenge when compared to the recent economic 
performance of the area, particularly in Wellingborough and Corby, which have lost jobs over 
a longer time period, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Achieving these job targets will 
require partnership working between the public and private sectors and close working with 
Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership (NEP) and the South East Midlands Local Enterprise 
Partnership (SEMLEP) to ensure that priorities are aligned and that barriers to delivery and 
measures to resolve these are identified. The balance between new jobs and the additional 
labour-force arising from new homes will be monitored to ensure that future reviews of the 
JCS and Part 2 Local Plans will be able to respond if the economy is not delivering the required 
jobs, or if jobs growth outstrips the growth in labour force.  
EMPLOYMENT LAND 
8.6 A major part of the strategy for generating new and better jobs and creating a 
stronger and more sustainable economy, will be the provision of the right amount and type 
of employment land in locations that balance the demands of the market with the need to 
protect, conserve and where possible enhance North Northamptonshire’s environmental 
assets. ‘Employment land’ in this instance refers to those uses falling within class B of the Use 
Classes Order including offices (B1) manufacturing (B2) and warehousing and distribution (B8) 
known in this Plan as Logistics. Driven partly by population growth, a significant proportion of 
new jobs (at least 35%) are likely be generated in other areas of the economy, including retail, 
leisure and professional and public services. These are referred to as ‘non B jobs’.83 See

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES8.7 North Northamptonshire has an over-supply of committed employment land85, 
particularly in the B1 sector86. Nevertheless, to provide choice and flexibility to support the 
delivery of employment, the Plan has identified a number of additional high quality strategic 
employment sites. An important constraint to economic growth is the lack of available 
sites to support the expansion of existing businesses. The provision of smaller parcels of 
land within larger, strategic sites can help to support the expansion of existing businesses, 
and their retention in North Northamptonshire. A number of B1 sites are located in key 
locations, notably around the railway stations at Kettering and Wellingborough, and within 
the Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs). The delivery of B1 sites around the stations is a key 
priority of the Plan, and will be an important element of delivering high quality employment. 
8.8 Existing employment sites also provide an important part of the employment land 
supply. Older employment areas provide opportunities to regenerate and improve the 
structure of settlements as well as retaining mixed use areas within towns allowing for 
journeys to work by foot or bicycle. Where there is an existing over-supply of committed 
employment land, the partner local planning authorities will undertake employment 
land reviews to inform Part 2 Local Plans to ensure that where sites are safeguarded for 
employment use, there is a reasonable prospect of the site being brought forward for that 
use. Proposals for alternative uses should be treated on their merits having regard to market 
signals and the relative need for different land uses to support sustainable local communities. 
SECTORAL STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
8.9 Extensive work has been undertaken to identify sectoral strengths that can be 
used to stimulate economic growth. Capitalising on these opportunities will be important 
to ensure that North Northamptonshire provides new, high quality jobs in sectors that are 
attractive to the market. It will be important that these opportunities are appropriately 
located (Policies 24, 26 and 27 provide specific locational guidance), and consistent with the 
need to protect environmental assets and recognise infrastructure capacity. The evidence 
base has identified particular sectoral strengths and opportunities in: 
n Logistics: Storage and distribution associated with B8 activities. These can include 
National and Regional distribution centres for ‘blue chip’ companies. B8 logistics can 
provide a significant amount of office floorspace, and deliver higher value employment 
through providing higher paid jobs such as managerial positions; 
n High performance technologies, particularly related to motorsport: These include 
engineering, manufacturing, the application of lightweight materials and composites, 
testing, research and design, construction and electronics;
n Renewable and low carbon energy and green technologies including wind, solar, biomass 
and other technologies, and associated research and development, food production and 
food production benefits. 85 Sites with planning

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESSKILLS
8.10 As well as the identification of priority sectors and sites, notably the redevelopment 
of Tresham campus at Wellingborough, the enhancement of skills in the workforce is crucial 
to attract inward investment and supporting the development of businesses. Opportunities 
for training schemes as part of new development will be encouraged, including initiatives 
to maximise local employment and training in the construction industry and to up-skill 
the logistics sector. Such initiatives are usually reliant on joined up working between a 
number of organisations in the identification and delivery of skills, training and recruitment 
programmes associated with development projects. Developer contributions and training 
and employment agreements will be encouraged to achieve this and, where possible, 
develop wider training infrastructure.
POLICY 22  – DELIVERING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
A stronger more sustainable economy that will deliver a net increase of 31,100 jobs will 
be sought through:
a) Ensuring that sufficient high quality sites are identified to support the delivery of 
the job targets in Table 3 (see Policy 23), recognising opportunities provided by the 
priority sectors of Renewable and Low Carbon Energy and Green Technologies, High 
Performance Technologies and Logistics;
b) Prioritising the enhancement of existing employment sites and the regeneration of 
previously developed land;
c) Safeguarding existing and committed employment sites for employment use unless it 
can be demonstrated by an applicant that there is no reasonable prospect of the site 
being used for that purpose and that an alternative use would:
n Not be detrimental to the mix of uses within a Sustainable Urban Extension; and/
or
n Resolve existing conflicts between land uses; 
d) Supporting proposals that encourage a co-ordinated approach to skills and training 
provision and promote sector specific training. Training and employment agreements 
will be encouraged to facilitate increased opportunities for the local workforce;
e) Safeguarding and enhancing North Northamptonshire’s tourism and cultural assets 
and supporting proposals to expand the tourism industry in sustainable ways.116

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESDISTRIBUTION OF JOBS
8.11 The job targets set out in Policy 23 are based on the size of the labour force arising 
from planned levels of housing. Additional jobs are identified for the southern area to reduce 
reliance on out-commuting. 
8.12 Population growth and town centre regeneration will be important in bringing 
forward non B-class jobs for instance in public services to support a growing population. 
The permitted retail and leisure scheme at Rushden Lakes, which replaced a previous 
predominantly B1 development proposal, will deliver ‘non B’ jobs in leisure and support 
tourism potential within the southern area. The Sustainable Urban Extensions shown on the 
Key Diagram are key elements of the employment strategy for North Northamptonshire 
and can provide a range of employment. Land supply analysis demonstrates that North 
Northamptonshire has a significant over supply of B1 land compared to market demand, 
and a requirement for additional B8 land has been identified within Kettering Borough. The 
Plan identifies strategic sites at A14 Junctions 9 and 10, to meet this shortfall, and recognises 
the important role of logistics to the economy. The Plan also identifies additional strategic 
employment sites to ensure that there are a range of high quality employment sites that are 
attractive to the market to provide sufficient choice and flexibility.
DELIVERING A MIX OF EMPLOYMENT 
8.13 Progress in delivering jobs will be monitored against an indicative sectoral split 
required to achieve a more balanced economy87. However, given the challenges that 
North Northamptonshire has faced in delivering economic growth, the Plan does not seek 
to be overly prescriptive by sub-dividing employment targets into different use-classes. 
Instead it has identified economic sectors that are well placed to deliver economic growth 
in North Northamptonshire (see paragraph 8.9) and a range of high quality strategic sites 
to help achieve this. 
8.14 The town centres, and committed sites around the railway stations are the 
preferred location for new office development followed by other areas with good transport 
connections. However, in view of the need to bring about economic growth as quickly 
as possible, certain types of business (such as research and development) may find more 
commercially attractive locations within the Sustainable Urban Extensions or on other 
prominent strategic sites at the edge of towns. These will need to be in locations that are, or 
can be made, highly accessible by a range of modes of transport. 
8.15 Quantifying future employment demand is not an exact science. To stimulate jobs 
growth and to ensure that enough land is identified to ensure balanced economic growth, this 
Plan identifies a number of high quality strategic employment sites, many of which already 
have planning permission that should be prioritised for inward investment and infrastructure 
provision and brought forward to support jobs growth in North Northamptonshire.
8.16 It is important to ensure that wherever possible, the scale and mix of development 
at these committed sites is brought forward in line with consented schemes and approved 
master plans to contribute towards the delivery of balanced employment across North 
Northamptonshire. Proposals to change the mix of employment uses will need to satisfy the 
policies of this Plan and demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the consented 
scale and mix of employment being brought forward. The use of Local Development Orders 
and other mechanisms to bring forward the delivery of these sites should be considered.  87 Based on Scenarios

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESThe list of sites is not exhaustive and proposals that deliver jobs growth and economic 
prosperity will be positively considered subject to compliance with the plan. It will be 
important that the quantity and quality of existing and committed employment sites is 
regularly reviewed to ensure that a supply of high quality sites is maintained to deliver the 
minimum jobs targets and that previously developed land is put to beneficial use if no longer 
required for employment uses. 
8.17 Where there is an identified shortfall of land against the employment targets set out 
in Policy 23, (having regard to the forecast provision of non B-class jobs), additional sites 
will be allocated through Part 2 Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans. This will be a material 
consideration in determining planning applications for employment development. 
POLICY 23  – DISTRIBUTION OF NEW JOBS
In order to achieve a sustainable balance between local jobs and workers and a more 
diverse economy:
a) The quantity and quality of existing and committed employment sites will be reviewed 
against the job creation targets set out below: 
TABLE 3: JOB CREATION TARGETS
NET JOB GROWTH (IN ALL SECTORS) 2011-31
Corby 9,700
East Northamptonshire 7,200

b) Employment development of a scale and mix identified within commitments and 
approved master plans will be supported at the SUEs and strategic sites identified 
on the Key Diagram. These sites will act as the focus for the provision of high quality 
employment in North Northamptonshire. The use of Local Development Orders and 
other innovative mechanisms to facilitate delivery of these sites will be supported;
c) The town centres and areas around the railway stations at the Growth Towns will 
be the preferred locations for new office development with additional office sites at 
areas with good public transport connections; 
d) Where, taking account of the forecast growth in non-B class jobs, there is an identified 
shortfall in supply of deliverable sites to meet the jobs targets in Table 3, additional 
sites will be allocated in Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans with priority 
given to sites within or adjoining the Growth Towns in locations that are capable of 
being accessed by a choice of means of transport; 
e) Within the rural areas, new employment of an appropriate scale and type will be 
supported consistent with Policy 25. 118

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESLOGISTICS
THE ROLE OF LOGISTICS IN THE NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE ECONOMY 
8.18 North Northamptonshire’s central location and excellent strategic road connections 
has made it a centre for the logistics (B8) industry with a substantial increase in the stock 
of buildings over the last 10 years. Technical studies and market analysis have identified that 
this sector remains strong and that failure to meet this demand in North Northamptonshire 
through the provision of suitable sites will lead to activity being displaced away from the 
area and opportunities to capture investment, unlock other uses and the potential for 
high quality investment will be lost. A number of logistics sites are committed in North 
Northamptonshire and identified as strategic employment sites on the Key Diagram. 
8.19 This Plan recognises the opportunities provided by the logistics sector, notably 
its importance to the economy and creation of significant office based jobs (B1 sector) as 
ancillary uses. The early delivery of B8 units on strategic sites can pump prime developments, 
and contribute to the early delivery of infrastructure to act as a catalyst for delivering smaller 
employment units suitable for small and medium sized enterprises (see paragraph 8.7). 
In considering proposals for strategic distribution (see paragraph 8.20) in locations where 
there is also a market demand for smaller units, the local planning authorities will seek to 
negotiate a mix of unit sizes and employment uses, with a proportion of new floorspace 
in units of less than 9,300sqm GFA. Proposals should be accompanied by information on 
market conditions, including the potential occupier market and the likely occupier property 
requirements taking into account an assessment of demand and supply. A delivery strategy 
should be provided by the applicant to demonstrate how these additional employment uses 
will be brought forward alongside the main B8 element of the scheme.
8.20 There are significant differences in the types of B8 development and subsequent 
operational requirements. Recent research88 has indicated that operators are increasingly 
requiring larger sites that are known as ‘Strategic distribution’ to serve the national 
warehouse and distribution market. For the purposes of this Plan, these are sites with 
individual units of over 100,000 square feet (9,300 square metres). 
8.21 The benefits of accommodating this strong sector of the economy must be balanced 
against the impacts that B8 developments, in particular large scale strategic distribution, 
have in terms of their significant land-take, HGV movements on the strategic and local road 
network (with associated parking requirements and damage to roads), alongside the visual, 
landscape and amenity impacts. 88 Research for Lambert

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESSECURING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF LOGISTICS DEVELOPMENT 
8.22 Policy 24 seeks to address these issues by maximising and safeguarding the potential 
for rail freight and supporting the development of Freight Consolidation Centres, where 
part loads are consolidated and delivered to the target area resulting in fewer journeys89. 
The Policy seeks to minimise the environmental impacts of logistics developments through 
sensitive design to reduce the impact on the landscape, townscape and wider setting and by 
achieving the highest possible standards of design and environmental performance. The use 
of green roofs, and the design and appearance of buildings can significantly reduce adverse 
impacts. Developments should contribute towards promoting and enhancing the wider green 
infrastructure network. There are considerable opportunities to integrate renewable energy 
generation, sustainable drainage systems (SuDs) and rainwater harvesting at design stage. 
POLICY 24  – LOGISTICS
Proposals for logistics, including large scale strategic distribution will be supported 
where they comply with the spatial strategy, facilitate the delivery of a mix of jobs and 
are of the highest viable standards of design and sustainability. Proposals will need to 
satisfy all of the following criteria:
a) Subject to market demand and viability, strategic distribution developments (involving 
individual units of 9,300sqm or more floorspace) should also include the provision of a 
proportion of floorspace in the form of smaller employment units; 
b)  Have good access to the strategic road network with priority given to the 
development of freight consolidation centres and sites which can be served by rail 
freight and operate as inter-modal terminals. Long term opportunities to provide 
facilities for transferring freight delivery to rail will be safeguarded;
c) Have good access to local labour supply and be accessible to the local workforce 
through public transport, walking and cycling;
d) Achieve the highest possible standards of design and environmental performance 
through maximising the use of sustainable design and construction techniques; 
e) Be in locations which allow 24 hour operations with acceptable environmental, 
community and landscape impact;
f) Provide sufficient infrastructure to mitigate highways impacts;
g) Address the local operational requirements of HGV parking arising from the 
development or demonstrate that suitable adequate alternative accessible parking is 
available. 89 The Northamptonshire 
Transportation Plan notes 
that research from Freight 
Consolidation Centres 
already in operation 
suggests that they can 
reduce journeys by about 
80% and cut carbon 
emissions from freight by 
over 50%.120

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESRURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION
8.23 Whilst the urban-focused spatial strategy in this Plan seeks to focus the majority 
of economic activity to the urban areas, primarily to the Growth towns, the rural areas 
have played, and will continue to play, an important role in North Northamptonshire’s 
economy. Providing sustainable new employment opportunities within the rural areas that 
respect its quality and character can increase self-reliance and help reduce the decline 
of traditional rural employment. The Market Towns and larger villages provide the most 
sustainable locations for rural economic development. Opportunities for farm diversification 
and conversion of redundant buildings for employment and other commercial uses such 
as tourism uses will be supported and encouraged where appropriate. Locations within 
established rural communities or closely related to these will provide the optimum 
opportunities for sustainable rural businesses to flourish.
8.24 It is important that the necessary infrastructure required to support rural economic 
development is developed including enhanced broadband provision (Policy 10). Policy 
25 seeks to ensure the economic sustainability of rural communities, whilst avoiding 
urbanisation through excessive levels of traffic, noise and light pollution or through the 
significant adverse visual impact of large commercial buildings or open storage in the 
landscape. This is important in maintaining the attractive mixed rural/urban character of 
North Northamptonshire. 
PRIORITIES FOR THE RURAL AREAS
8.25 A range of businesses and operations require a rural location and in some instances 
may need to be located within the open countryside away from established communities, 
mostly due to their environmental impacts or functional requirements. Such uses may 
include:
n Development associated with agriculture/forestry, e.g. agricultural or forestry workers 
dwellings, storage/livestock barns;
n Development associated with existing/established rural businesses where expansion is 
compatible with the rural character;
n Renewable energy schemes (see Policy 26);
n Minerals extraction/waste disposal.
8.26 Agriculture, horticulture and forestry play an important and varied role in supporting 
the rural economy, including the maintenance and management of the countryside and most 
valued landscapes. It is important that farmers are able to diversify into new agricultural and 
commercial ventures in order to ensure a farm’s viability and to maximise opportunities to 
strengthen the rural economy, whilst maintaining the character of the rural landscape.
8.27 The Nene Valley Strategic Plan90 (see paragraph 7.14) sets out that in addition to 
farming, forestry and expenditure related to the waterways and natural reserves, there 
are other opportunities for economic activity related to the rural environment. These 
other ‘land based’ businesses such as niche food, craft and a small number of eco-tourism 
businesses also contribute to the visitor economy. The Nene Valley Plan considers that there 
is scope to expand this activity and sets out a range of activities that can be supported across 
North Northamptonshire. 90 Nene Valley Strategic

b) The provision and expansion of tourist and visitor facilities, recognising that 
locations with access to local services and facilities by foot, cycle or public 
transport provide the greatest opportunity for sustainable rural development;
c) Commercial opportunities related to food, craft and ecotourism, and Green 
Infrastructure projects;
d) The enhancement of local supply networks, linking businesses and consumers, that 
support the shift to a low carbon economy and to support local rural producers 
and businesses.
 
2. Sustainable rural  diversification activities should seek to complement and support 
the ongoing viability of the existing business. Where proposals involve the re-use of 
rural buildings, a mix of uses will be supported, including small scale business, tourism 
activities, tourist accommodation, and live/work units. 122

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESRENEWABLE AND LOW CARBON ENERGY
8.28 Green Industries are a sectoral priority to support economic growth in North 
Northamptonshire and play an important role in securing resilience to climate change and 
long term energy security. The Government is committed to meeting the target for the 
UK to achieve 15% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 202091. It has set 
out a positive framework92 for low carbon and renewable energy development, where the 
technology is viable and where adverse environmental, economic and social impacts are 
addressed satisfactorily. 
8.29 A key factor in North Northamptonshire becoming more self-reliant and resilient 
is ensuring that it generates a significant proportion of its own energy requirements from 
renewable sources. North Northamptonshire has delivered significant renewable energy 
provision in recent years, notably at Burton Wold wind farm near Kettering and Chelveston 
Energy Park in East Northamptonshire, alongside the recent development of a number of 
solar farms across the area. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL IN NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
8.30 A Renewable Energy Study93 has identified that on shore wind provides the largest 
potential renewable resource for North Northamptonshire with the greatest wind energy 
potential in the rural parts of the North Northamptonshire area although, heat pumps, solar 
photovoltaics (PV) and solar thermal also have significant potential across the area.
8.31 The rural parts of North Northamptonshire are also identified as having notable 
potential for the generation of energy from plant biomass in particular from energy crops 
and agricultural arisings. There are also many sites which have the potential for small scale 
hydro power, particularly along the Nene and Welland valleys. Although the combined 
potential for hydro power is relatively small, opportunities to exploit this potential are 
supported and should be considered where major new developments are planned nearby to 
these opportunities. 
8.32 Resource opportunities from biofuels and renewables will have to be balanced with 
food production needs. Such land-uses should avoid the use of the best and most versatile 
agricultural land where possible, and incorporate opportunities to increase biodiversity. 
ENERGY PARKS
8.33 The co-location of renewable and low carbon technologies in ‘Energy Park’ 
developments has the potential to strengthen the development of green industries in North 
Northamptonshire and support a sustainable and stable supply of energy. 
8.34 The potential for such developments is greatest in locations where energy 
generators are already in operation; the necessary infrastructure exists or can be provided; 
they are close to existing or proposed major users of energy; and where adverse impacts of 
development can be satisfactorily mitigated. The Kettering Energy Park (locally referred to 
as ‘Land at Burton Wold’) is considered to be the main area of opportunity in this regard.91 The EU Renewable 
Energy Directive 
(2009/28/EC) requires 
the UK to produce 15% 
of energy consumption 
from renewable sources 
by 2020.

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES8.35 Kettering Borough Council has been proactive in contributing to national 
requirements for renewable energy, increasing the provision of energy from decentralised 
and renewable sources.  The largest example of this is at Burton Wold, an operational 
wind farm located at J10 of the A14.  This site already has 19 wind turbines (ranging from 
1.6MW to 2MW each) and planning consent for two solar photovoltaic farms, which will 
generate 19.5MW and 11 MW of power respectively. Policy 26 identifies land at Burton Wold 
as a suitable ‘Energy Park’ location to serve existing and planned development including 
the Kettering East SUE and complimentary employment uses. Its precise extent  and  mix 
of uses is to be determined through a Masterplan prepared in consultation with the local 
community and stakeholders for agreement with the local planning authority.  The impacts 
of development at this location will be evaluated in greater detail through the consideration 
of any planning applications.
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING PROPOSALS
8.36 The development of larger scale renewable and low carbon energy schemes can 
have a range of positive and negative effects on nearby communities. They can provide 
landowners with the opportunity for rural diversification, deliver local jobs and provide 
opportunities for enhanced community facilities and other benefits. However, equally these 
can also have negative effects including their impact on landscapes and the use of agricultural 
land, amongst others. These impacts will vary dependent on the scale and location of 
proposed development and the type of renewable and low carbon and renewable energy 
technology deployed. National guidance on assessing proposals is provided in the Planning 
Practice Guidance on Renewable and Low Carbon Energy94 and the local planning authorities 
may produce SPDs providing further guidance such as the Wind and Solar Energy SPD 
adopted by East Northamptonshire Council in September 201495. In considering locations 
local planning authorities will need to ensure they take into account the requirements of the 
technology and its potential impacts on the local environment, including cumulative impacts. 
Policy 26 requires that proposals for renewable and low carbon energy generation are 
sensitively located, recognising that some landscapes can accommodate such developments 
with fewer negative impacts.
8.37 When considering planning applications for low carbon and renewable energy, an 
assessment will need to be provided which takes account of possible impacts of the proposal. 
These can include impacts on landscape, townscape, the highways network, heritage assets 
and their settings and areas of nature conservation interests. Proposals should be designed 
and operated to the highest environmental standards to minimise impacts on the amenity of 
the area, in respect of visual intrusion, noise, dust, odour and traffic generation. 
8.38 Landscape and visual impact assessments must consider the potential cumulative 
impact of the development. Cumulative landscape impact refers to the effects of a proposed 
development on the fabric, character and quality of the landscape and is concerned with 
the extent to which developments begin to collectively change the overall character and 
perception of a particular landscape.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES8.39 If adverse impacts are identified and they are proven to be unavoidable, the proposal 
will be required to demonstrate that these have been minimised as far as possible. Where 
residual environmental effects remain after avoidance and minimisation, the level of harm 
and extent to which adverse impacts remain will be weighed against the public benefits of the 
proposal. In accordance with the NPPF and NPPG, applicants are encouraged to undertake 
inclusive and constructive engagement with local communities to ensure awareness of 
proposals affecting their locality.
ENERGY DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE
8.40 Western Power Distribution is the distribution network operator for the 
East Midlands and are responsible for the distribution of electricity across North 
Northamptonshire. They have advised that there are no technical constraints to importing 
energy into North Northamptonshire but limited capacity exists to feed any excess of 
locally generated electricity into the grid. This is the main barrier to large scale expansion of 
renewable energy generating capacity. 
8.41 Balancing supply and demand will be important in North Northamptonshire. This 
can be achieved through a mix of development and detailed design measures to ensure that 
necessary infrastructure is in place to link to a specific demand. Alternative solutions could 
be delivered through matching generation and demand locally or the use of ‘constraints 
agreements’ whereby energy generators can be temporarily excluded from the grid if 
capacity problems arise. 
DECENTRALISED ENERGY NETWORKS
8.42 Decentralised energy involves the generation and distribution of energy closer to 
the locations where energy is consumed. By locating energy generation close to where 
the energy is used, decentralised energy networks offer the potential for waste heat to 
be captured and distributed to buildings or industrial processes which need it, therefore 
increasing the efficiency of the power generation. 
8.43 District Heating, where heat is created and delivered to a network of buildings 
across a network of pipes can represent a more effective way of generating and delivering 
heat than the use of individual heating schemes in every building. There can be a central 
heat source or a variety of sources creating the heat to be distributed. This can include but 
is not limited to waste heat from industrial processes or heat from heat pumps. The East 
Midlands study identified Priority Areas for district heating where there was high existing 
heat demand, a significant heat demand from ‘anchor load’ sites and potential for future heat 
demand. Priority areas were identified in Kettering town centre and Corby Civic Hub. 
8.44 Greater economies of scale can be achieved on larger developments which would 
make the initial outlay to incorporate local/decentralised energy networks a more feasible 
and viable possibility. There is also the opportunity for Renewable Heat Incentive payment 
to be received if biomass, heat pumps or other forms of renewable heat is used to generate 
the heat for the district heating network.125

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 26  – RENEWABLE AND LOW CARBON ENERGY
Proposals for sensitively located renewable and low carbon energy generation will be 
supported where it can be demonstrated that the proposal meets all of the following 
criteria:
a) The landscape impact of the development is minimised and mitigated against;
b) The development links to a specific demand through a decentralised energy network 
or where this is not possible, the necessary infrastructure is provided to supply power 
to the National Grid; 
c) The siting of development avoids harm to the significance of a heritage asset and its 
setting in accordance with the provisions of the NPPF;
d) The siting of development does not significantly adversely affect the amenity of 
existing, or proposed, residential dwellings and/or businesses, either in isolation 
or cumulatively, by reason of noise, odour intrusion, dust, traffic generation, visual 
impact or shadow flicker;
e) The development does not result in an adverse impact on the capacity and safety of 
the highways network and of public rights of way;
f) The development includes a managed programme of measures to mitigate against any 
adverse impacts on the built and natural environment resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of any equipment/infrastructure;
g) The development does not create a significant adverse cumulative noise or visual 
impact when considered in conjunction with other developments planned within 
North Northamptonshire and adjoining local authority areas;
h) The development retains and enhances on-site biodiversity and supports the 
enlargement of, and/or connection to, existing biodiversity assets such as wildlife 
corridors, where possible;
i) Proposals for Solar Photovoltaic farms avoid the best and most versatile 
agricultural  land.126

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESProvision will be made for the removal of apparatus and reinstatement of the site to an 
acceptable condition, should the scheme become redundant and/or at the end of the 
permitted period for time limited planning permissions. 
Land at Burton Wold is identified for an Energy Park to add to the range of renewable 
energy technologies already present. The development will serve as a decentralised 
energy network which will link the energy production to existing and new developments. 
Proposals within the Energy Park should meet criteria a) to i) above and should also be 
in accordance with a comprehensive masterplan which will be prepared in consultation 
with the local community and stakeholders and agreed by the local planning authority; 
This will: 
1. Define development boundaries and also the renewable/low carbon technologies and 
land uses to be developed on the site;
2. Make provision for a mix of complimentary employment uses to facilitate development 
of local knowledge,expertise and research and development;
3. Demonstrate how the proposal will contribute towards meeting the energy needs 
of existing and planned development, including East Kettering SUE, strategic 
development at Junction 10 of the A14 and employment uses associated with the site;
4. Create a model for zero carbon energy through the installation of exemplary energy 
efficiency standards in buildings which use energy produced on-site in their operation.127

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESROCKINGHAM MOTOR RACING CIRCUIT ENTERPRISE AREA
8.45 The proposed Rockingham Motor Racing Circuit Enterprise Area lies on the north 
eastern edge of Corby adjacent to the Priors Hall (part of the North East Corby Sustainable 
Urban Extension). The 300 ha area straddles the administrative boundaries of Corby and 
East Northamptonshire councils. Despite the proximity of urban Corby and the surrounding 
settlements of Gretton, Weldon and Deene, the land is distinct from its surroundings, due to 
the large scale infrastructure, buildings and road network. 
8.46 The significant potential of this area has been recognised in a number of technical 
studies including  the Rockingham Development Framework (RDF96) endorsed by Corby 
and East Northamptonshire Councils in 2011, and in the Northamptonshire Enterprise 
Partnership’s 2015 bid for the designation of an Enterprise Zone. The partners (including 
the two local planning authorities) are continuing to promote the economic potential of the 
area. Policy 27 provides a positive planning framework to help achieve this.
8.47 Policy 27 provides flexibility for a range of employment uses to come forward in 
response to market demands. Significant opportunities exist to deliver high performance 
technologies and future vehicle technologies by attracting motorsport/automotive sector 
businesses capitalising on the opportunity provided by the motor racing circuit. The 
Enterprise Area is also well placed to support other priority economic sectors including 
logistics and food and drink.  
8.48 The development of the Enterprise Area to its full potential is a long term 
opportunity that will be delivered during and beyond the plan period and consequently the 
Plan is not reliant on the delivery of the site to meet its minimum jobs targets. The local 
planning authorities will encourage the preparation of a comprehensive masterplan for the 
Enterprise Area, incorporating the place-shaping principles set out in Policy 27. Proposals 
for development of individual parcels of land should demonstrate how they relate/ connect 
to the wider area, contributing to the delivery of the place-shaping principles and ensuring 
that they do not prejudice the delivery of other development within the Enterprise Area.
8.49 The previous heavy industrial land uses of most of the Enterprise Area have left large 
areas where ground conditions in the form of made ground and contamination will constrain 
detailed development proposals. These local environmental issues will need to be resolved 
as development proposals are brought forward in accordance with the requirements of 
Policy 6. The Enterprise Area also contains a variety of protected species and proposals will 
need to fully consider potential impact in accordance with relevant legislation and Policy 4.
8.50 There is high quality landscape to the north of the Enterprise Area and designated 
heritage assets to the east of the eastern boundary include the Grade I listed Kirby Hall. 
Weldon Lodge (Grade II) is located on the edge of the development site on Gretton Road. 
Applicants will be required to provide appropriate mitigation measures, in accordance 
with the relevant policies, to protect and enhance these assets and ensure high quality 
developments. These include controlling noise levels, defining an appropriate maximum 
height of buildings and introducing well-considered landscaping in accordance with a 
Landscape Strategy. 96 Rockingham

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES8.51 Establishing strong connected green infrastructure both for provision of natural 
habitat, pedestrian and cycle movement and SUDS is essential. This should link the Willow 
Brook corridor with the Gretton Brook Corridor so that the area does not form a barrier 
to north-south movement, both for people working there, and for long-term future 
connections. Applicants should provide a landscape and open space strategy which sits 
parallel with a cycling/walking plan.  This should identify the open spaces, their functions and 
character, how they link together, and the approach to their design.
8.52 Large scale water attenuation features, possibly focussed along the Willow Brook 
close to the lowest point of the site are needed to accept and intercept site run-off. Whilst 
the location and combination of these features fits with a green corridor running along the 
alignment of Willow Brook, the land-take and the topography of the corridor will require 
engineering. It is critical to maximise opportunities for improving the quality of the Willow 
Brook, to fulfil the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. 
8.53 Good walking and cycling connections to the Enterprise Area that link it to Priors 
Hall and the Town Centre will be important. The Willow Brook  GI corridor should form 
the basis of this. Careful design of this corridor will be required to ensure that the route is 
perceived as safe for pedestrians and cyclists and is well used. 
8.54 It will be important that development is phased and focused in certain areas of the 
Enterprise Area, together with provision of appropriate temporary and other employment 
uses to build and maintain development momentum and contribute towards infrastructure 
delivery. Whilst the site has significant potential in the short, medium and long term 
it is important that development is phased in relation to the provision of on and off site 
infrastructure and mitigation of contaminated land constraints. 
8.55 The full development of the site will rely on the completion of the Northern Orbital 
Route, to allow for appropriate access to the whole of the Enterprise Area. This road 
performs an important role as part of a wider traffic route for the northern edge of Corby, 
as well as providing a spine through the Enterprise Area. It is important that this route is safe 
and pleasant for walking and cycling, where possible including the provision of large trees to 
line and identify this route. Road infrastructure off-site will need to be improved in order for 
large scale development to be accommodated.129

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 27  – ROCKINGHAM ENTERPRISE AREA
The Enterprise Area identified on the Policies Map will be a focus for employment  
development within and beyond the plan period. Development proposals must include 
a land remediation strategy for the decontamination of the site and should demonstrate 
how, subject to viability, the proposal will contribute towards infrastructure 
requirements for the Enterprise Area such as phase 2 of the Northern Orbital Road. 
Development proposals will be supported where they will  deliver a mix of high quality 
employment, particularly in priority employment sectors.  Proposals should demonstrate 
how they relate to the wider area and contribute to delivering the following place 
shaping principles:
a) The creation of a landscaped spine to the development along the route of the 
Northern Orbital Road, which allows for pedestrian and cycle movements;
b) Clear definition of public and private space, with frontages facing onto the main 
routes where feasible, and high quality public realm and landscape treatment to help 
create a strong and identifiable image for the area;
c) The establishment of a strong green infrastructure corridor along the Willow Brook, 
which connects to the Gretton Brook. The corridor will act as a natural habitat, whilst 
at the same time forming a pedestrian and cycling route through the development, 
linking Corby town centre and Priors Hall;
d) The creation of a landscape/green infrastructure corridor along the Gretton Brook 
which provides an opportunity for wildlife connections into the plantation as well as 
along the stream course itself;
e) Ensuring that the development protects, and where possible, enhances the setting of 
Weldon Lodge and heritage assets and setting at Kirby Hall;
f) Provision of a small local centre within the site to provide small scale service or 
convenience shopping facilities to cater for employees within the area.130

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES5. DELIVERING HOMES
9.1 The NPPF emphasises that local planning authorities should plan to boost 
significantly the supply of housing. It requires an evidence-based approach to identifying and 
meeting the full, objectively assessed needs for market and affordable housing in the housing 
market area, as far as is consistent with the policies in the NPPF.
9.2 The North Northamptonshire Housing Market Area (HMA) has accommodated 
significant new housing in the past, in part due to the policy driven growth agenda promoted 
through the former Milton Keynes and South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy. Despite the 
recession, around 19,000 new homes were built between 2001 and 201397. The dwelling 
stock in the HMA grew by 13.3% between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, compared to 8.3% 
for England98. The vision is for the area to maintain this momentum of growth, with well 
managed sustainable development delivered, in large part, through Sustainable Urban 
Extensions (SUEs) at the main towns (see Policy 29).
9.3 DCLG household projections take account of past rates of growth and provide the 
starting point in considering how much housing is needed to satisfy demands (both locally 
generated and from inward migration) over the period to 2031. An extension of the latest 
DCLG (2011 based) interim household projections suggests that, if trends continue, there 
will be an additional 31,000 households in the HMA between 2011 and 2031. However, 
these official projections are likely to reflect the impact of the recession and other factors in 
suppressing rates of household formation and may also underestimate levels of in-migration 
to Corby. Demographic modelling99, applying adjustments for these factors, gives a higher 
projection of 33,850 additional households in the period 2011-31. 
9.4 Assuming that around 3% of the dwelling stock is vacant at any point in time100, the 
adjusted household projections give rise to a need for 34,900 net additional homes in the 
HMA over the period 2011-31, which has been rounded up to a plan requirement of 35,000 
dwellings. This represents an ambitious but realistic scale of housing delivery, which aligns 
with an equally ambitious employment strategy to deliver 31,100 jobs in the HMA (see Policy 
22). It is more than twice the amount of housing required by natural change in the existing 
population101.
9.5 Delivering this scale of housing growth will maintain North Northamptonshire as a 
nationally important growth area and a necessary focal point for infrastructure and economic 
investment. It complements the plans of neighbouring authorities, who are all intending to 
meet their own objectively assessed housing requirements and in some cases are, like North 
Northamptonshire, catering for significant in-migration.
9.6 The apportionment of this HMA total between the districts is set out in Policy 
28. The local planning authorities will maintain a deliverable 5 year supply of housing land 
against the requirement set out in Policy 28, with appropriate buffers as required by the 
NPPF. Annex A provides a snap-shot of housing land supply at 2016, which will be monitored 
and updated through the AMR. In order to provide an early warning if the supply of housing 
land is running short relative to NPPF requirements, monitoring will be undertaken against 
the Policy 28 requirement plus an additional 25% buffer. If not available, this would trigger 
corrective action by the Local Planning Authority in order to boost supply.97 North

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.7 In addition to these objectively assessed housing needs, the Plan incorporates a 
strategic opportunity for a further 5,000 dwellings at Corby, as the town works towards 
doubling its population to support ongoing regeneration. This would increase the HMA total to 40,000 dwellings, over 30% more than were delivered in the previous 20 years. Demographic modelling suggests that this is achievable if the town continues to attract levels of inward migration significantly in excess of DCLG projections. The Plan provides the conditions for this strategic opportunity to be realised, including the allocation of land for a SUE at West Corby, supporting regeneration of the town centre and development of major new employment, and ensuring that infrastructure plans accommodate the full growth ambition for the town.
9.8 The minimum housing requirements identified in Policy 28 represent an increase 
on the 2011 housing stock of 35% for Corby Borough (52% if the identified strategic 
opportunity is delivered); 24% for East Northamptonshire District (including 700 dwellings forming part of the Priors Hall SUE at Corby); 25% for Kettering Borough and 21% for the Borough of Wellingborough. This is shown in Figure 19. The distribution of growth to individual settlements is addressed in Policy 29.

9.9 The housing requirements in Policy 28 assume significantly higher levels of in-
migration into Corby than the adjusted household projections suggest. Some of this enhanced 
growth will arise from demand that would otherwise be directed at Kettering Borough, resulting in a lower than projected rate of growth in that Borough.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF NEW HOMES 
9.10 The distribution of the housing requirements between settlements is set out 
in Policy 29 and Table 5. This reflects their role in the settlement hierarchy (Table 1) and 
identified opportunities and constraints. Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans will 
identify sites to deliver the housing requirements for the Growth Towns, Market Towns and 
named Villages set out in Table 5. These plans may assess higher levels of housing provision 
at individual settlements where this meets identified local needs and aspirations or, in the 
case of Growth Towns and Market Towns, would meet a shortfall in deliverable sites at 
another settlement within the same Part 2 Local Plan area (district or, in the case of East 
Northamptonshire, the Four Towns and RNOT areas).102 The figures for

at the settlement level there remains a shortfall in supply in some locations relative to the 
requirements in Table 5. This will be addressed in Part 2 Local Plans.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.13 In accordance with Policy 11, high priority will be given to the reuse of suitable 
previously developed (‘brownfield’) sites within the Growth Towns and Market Towns, 
particularly where these can be served by public transport. Development of these sites 
should contribute to the delivery of the place shaping principles set out in Table 2.
9.14 However, the supply of suitable previously developed land is limited compared to 
the identified housing requirements. The delivery of the Plan is therefore largely reliant upon 
the timely delivery of the Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) and other strategic housing 
sites (these are defined as including at least 500 dwellings) shown on the Key Diagram. The 
importance of the SUEs to the spatial strategy for North Northamptonshire is explained 
further at paragraphs 5.9 to 5.10.
9.15 With the exception of the West Corby SUE, the Rushden East SUE (see paragraph 
5.9) and the Rothwell North SUE, all of the sites shown on the Key Diagram are committed 
through planning permissions or resolutions to grant planning permission subject to the 
completion of necessary legal agreements. The boundaries shown for committed sites are 
the planning application boundaries. The extent of built development during the plan period 
may differ from the boundaries shown, as at Wellingborough North where only the initial 
phases of the development to the West of the A509 are expected to come forward by 2031. 
The broad location for the Rushden East SUE is an area of search which will be refined 
through master planning to define the extent of the development.
9.16 Land at Rothwell North shown on the Policies Map is allocated for a SUE by Policy 
38. The site boundary relates to a current planning application for 700 dwellings, employment 
land and other facilities. Site assessment work has indicated that there is potential for a 
larger site area which could accommodate additional dwellings. This additional land will be 
considered in the Part 2 Local Plan prepared by Kettering Borough Council.
9.17 The local planning authorities will work with landowners, developers and other 
parties to overcome any constraints to delivery of the SUEs and other strategic sites shown 
on the Key Diagram. Progress will be monitored through the North Northamptonshire 
Authorities Monitoring Report. If the SUEs and other  sites are not developed quickly enough 
to maintain a deliverable 5 year supply of housing land103 against the requirements set out 
in Policy 28, the local planning authorities will identify additional sources of housing104, with 
the priority being the Growth Towns and Market Towns. Additional sites should be capable 
of quick delivery, make appropriate contributions to infrastructure and help to deliver the 
place shaping principles set out in Table 2.
9.18 In the event of the SUE/s in a district/borough delivering less than 75% of projected 
housing completions in three consecutive years (based on the trajectories set out in 
Appendix 4), the Joint Committee will undertake a partial review of the JCS to ensure that 
the objectively assessed need for housing in the Housing Market Area is met. The local 
planning authorities will consider using compulsory purchase powers or de-allocating sites/
not renewing planning permissions where the failure to develop is due to a landowner or 
developer being unwilling to progress a viable scheme. 103 Monitoring trigger at

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.19 In addition to the strategy of focusing development at the Growth Towns, followed by 
the Market Towns, the Plan supports development to meet local needs and aspirations in the 
rural areas. This will be evaluated locally through Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood 
Plans. However, these are not comprehensive in their coverage and it is necessary for the 
JCS to provide a strategic steer on the contribution that the Rural Areas will make to the 
supply of housing in North Northamptonshire. Table 5 uses information provided by the 
local planning authorities on the scale of housing expected to take place in the Rural Areas, 
based on local needs surveys and/or assessment of development opportunities. Where this 
local information is not available, Table 5 uses an estimate of the supply of housing from 
committed sites and a continuation of past rates of ‘windfall’ development such as housing 
development on small infill sites within villages and the conversion of rural buildings. Table 
5 sets out the baseline level of growth that should be planned for in the Rural Areas of each 
district/borough to contribute to meeting locally arising needs. 
9.20 The rural housing requirements identified in Table 5 should be accommodated 
in Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans through allocating land in the most 
sustainable locations available and/or a windfall allowance (where there is compelling 
evidence that this will continue to provide a reliable source of supply). Part 2 Local Plans 
and/or Neighbourhood Plans may test higher levels of growth to address local needs 
and opportunities. The distribution of housing between villages will respond to local 
circumstances and needs and ensure that housing is located where it will enhance the vitality 
of rural communities. Isolated homes in the countryside will be resisted unless there are 
special circumstance as set out in the NPPF and Policy 13, including the essential need for a 
rural worker to live permanently at or near their place of work. 
9.21 Based on evidence of local needs, Table 5 sets out housing requirements for the four 
largest villages of Earls Barton, Finedon, Irchester and Wollaston, where the scale of locally 
arising housing need will be of strategic significance over the plan period (see paragraph 5.15). 
Additional housing development above the requirements identified in Table 5, other than small 
scale infilling in accordance with Policy 11 or rural exceptions in accordance with Policy 13, will 
be resisted unless agreed through the Part 2 Local Plan and/or Neighbourhood Plans.
 
9.22 The Rural Exceptions approach set out in Policy 13 provides scope for further rural 
housing to meet specific local needs. The Plan also recognises a strategic opportunity for an 
exemplar sustainable new village community to provide additional homes, jobs and services 
in the Rural North at Deenethorpe Airfield. This is to be explored against the criteria set 
out in Policy 14. If considered acceptable, the new village would be treated as a strategic 
opportunity over and above the minimum housing requirements for East Northamptonshire. 136

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 29  – DISTRIBUTION OF NEW HOMES
New housing will be accommodated in line with the Spatial Strategy with a strong focus 
at the Growth Towns as the most sustainable locations for development, followed by 
the Market Towns. Provision will be made for new housing as set out in Table 5.
The re-use of suitable previously developed land and buildings in the Growth Towns 
and the Market Towns will be encouraged. Further development requirements will be 
focused on the delivery of the Sustainable Urban Extensions and other strategic housing 
sites identified on the Key Diagram. 
The local planning authorities will work proactively with landowners, developers and 
other partners to ensure the timely delivery of the Sustainable Urban Extensions and 
other strategic housing sites shown on the Key Diagram. Progress will be monitored 
in the North Northamptonshire Authorities’ Monitoring Report. Where necessary to 
maintain a deliverable 5 year supply of housing sites for a district/borough, the relevant 
local planning authority will identify additional sources of housing at the Growth Town, 
followed if necessary and relevant by the Market Towns within that district/borough. 
The Strategic Opportunity identified in Policy 28 for an additional 5,000 dwellings at 
Corby will only be delivered through the successful implementation of the Sustainable 
Urban Extensions at that town. It is not transferable to other settlements.
Other than small scale infilling (Policy 11) or rural exceptions schemes (Policy 13), levels 
of housing development in excess of the identified requirements for the named Villages 
and Rural Areas will only be permitted where tested and supported through Part 2 
Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans. These plans should also identify the phasing of 
individual housing sites in the rural areas to ensure that development opportunities are 
not exhausted early in the plan period.

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESHOUSING MIX AND TENURE
9.23 In order to create sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, the housing 
requirements set out in policies 28 and 29 should deliver a mix of housing based on current 
and future demographic trends, market trends and the needs of different groups in the 
community. Policy 30 sets out the overall approach that will be taken in considering the 
size and tenure of new housing and in encouraging development to meet the needs of 
particular groups. Part 2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans may identify more specific 
requirements for particular locations.
9.24 Policy 30 is based on latest update of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
(SHMA) toolkit105. This uses the demographic modelling undertaken by the Cambridge 
Centre for Housing and Planning Research106 and applies local data for incomes and housing 
costs to identify the basic housing requirements of households. It provides the basis for 
developers, housing providers, the local planning authorities and neighbourhood planning 
groups to identify the mix of housing that will best meet identified housing needs and 
demands in particular localities and help to create a more balanced housing market.
MIX
9.25 The 2015 SHMA toolkit update identifies the size of dwellings (minimum number of 
bedrooms) that are needed to accommodate the projected composition of new households. 
The ‘need’ is for predominantly smaller dwellings in both the affordable107 and market 
housing sectors. Around 70% of new households are forecast to be of a size that ‘need’ 1 or 
2 bedrooms, 30% will need 3 bedrooms and very few will need 4 or more bedrooms.
9.26 This demographic evidence of ‘need’ does not take account of the aspiration of 
many households to have a spare bedroom, for example to provide a home office, give a 
young family the opportunity to expand or to enable older people to have a carer to stay. 
It may not always be possible to provide this additional space in the affordable housing 
sector in view of restrictions imposed on eligibility for welfare benefits. However, in the 
market sector there is likely to be a preference by consumers and providers for an additional 
bedroom. This flexibility will be supported provided that developments provide a significant 
proportion (generally at least 70%) of small and medium sized properties (1-3 bedrooms), 
which will provide the more affordable market housing options to meet identified needs. 
Proposals for higher proportion of larger (4+ bedroom) dwellings should be supported by 
evidence in relation to the existing housing stock (see paragraph 9.28) and the local housing 
market (ensuring that market demand can be met as far as possible at a cost that does not 
exclude local households). 
9.27 As well as providing flexibility to accommodate some of the demand for larger 
dwellings, Policy 30 requires account to be taken of the composition of the existing dwelling 
stock in the neighbourhood/ward and the role that a development can play in filling any gaps 
in the provision of housing for different types of household. For instance an area where 
the housing stock is dominated by small (1 and 2) bedroom dwellings, it may benefit from 
the provision of some larger family housing. An over-concentration of single house types 
or tenures will be resisted where this would impact adversely on local infrastructure and 
amenities. The aim to provide a balanced dwelling stock also applies within the SUEs and 
other strategic developments where a broad mix of house sizes will be sought.105 Interactive T oolkits

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.28 The SHMA toolkit highlights the issue of ‘under-occupation’, whereby either through 
choice or necessity, households live in properties with more bedrooms than they theoretically 
need. It forecasts that 12,200 older households (aged 65+) will be ‘under-occupying’ their 
homes by 2031. Policy 30 encourages the provision of attractive housing opportunities to 
allow these households to down-size to smaller accommodation. This includes the provision of 
special forms of housing for older people (see paragraphs 9.41 and 9.42).
9.29 Another aspect of size is the floorspace provided within individual dwellings. It is 
important that dwellings are fit for purpose, with enough space for basic furnishings, storage 
and activities. This links to accessibility standards (see paragraphs 9.43 to 9.46) as homes 
designed for people with mobility needs arising from frailty, disability or ageing will tend to 
require more generous space for circulation. 
9.30 Following a comprehensive review of housing standards, the Government has 
introduced a nationally described space standard for new housing, which offers a consistent 
set of requirements with regard to the internal area of new homes. These standards will be 
applied in North Northamptonshire. 
9.31 A key asset of North Northamptonshire, particularly in comparison to more 
urbanised areas, is the space that exists to give new residents a high quality of life with 
adaptable living space within their homes and adequate amenity space outside. Of a sample 
of housing developments permitted in North Northamptonshire in the period 2011-14, most 
individual dwellings meet or exceed the proposed national space standard. This, and the 
viability assessment of the Plan, indicates that the proposed space standards are viable within 
North Northamptonshire. However, the sample identified dwellings permitted in all of the 
districts/boroughs that are smaller than the proposed national standards. These are unlikely 
to provide a high quality living environment, contrary to the objective of the Plan (Outcome 
10) for an enhanced quality of life for residents. Policy 30 confirms that the national space 
standards will be applied within North Northamptonshire.140

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESTENURE
9.32 At the 2011 census108, 82.2% of households in North Northamptonshire occupied 
market sector housing (68.1% owner occupation and 14.1% private rent); 0.7% were in 
shared-ownership housing; and 15.7% were in social rented housing109. A broad 80:20 split 
between new market and affordable housing would therefore maintain the existing balance 
of the housing stock. However, this would not meet forecast needs. The 2015 SHMA toolkit 
update indicates that, based on average house prices and household incomes, only 55.7% 
of new households in North Northamptonshire will be able to afford market housing. The 
remaining 44.3% are forecast to require affordable housing, including social and affordable 
rent and intermediate forms of tenure such as shared-ownership. Forecasts vary between 
the districts as shown in Table 6.

9.33 The extent to which the needs for different housing tenures, identified in Table 
6, are accommodated in specific development schemes will depend on the viability of 
development and the mix of housing available in the locality. 
9.34 Affordable housing needs will be met as far as possible through public and private 
sector investment. Public funding is constrained and a significant element of new affordable 
housing will need to be provided as part of private sector developments and through the 
‘exceptions’ approach set out in Policy 13.
9.35 The NPPF is clear that the scale of policy burdens, including affordable housing 
requirements, should not put the implementation of the Plan at serious risk. The viability 
appraisal undertaken during the preparation of this Plan111 identifies how the viability 
of developments differs significantly according to their scale and location, necessitating a 
flexible approach to affordable housing requirements. Smaller developments are likely to 
have lower infrastructure costs and be able to support higher levels of affordable housing 
than larger schemes. The areas with highest development values (Oundle and many of 
the villages) can support higher levels of affordable housing than the Growth Towns and 
remaining Market Towns. 108 Census T able 3.2

SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.36 The viability assessment reflected conditions shortly after a recession, using 
standardised assumptions on factors such as land values and development costs. In 
reality these vary between sites/developers and will change over the lifetime of the Plan. 
In practice, developers have been able to bring forward viable schemes with up to 30% 
affordable housing in some of the Growth Towns. The committed SUEs, with their major 
infrastructure costs, are committed to deliver up to 20% affordable housing. Policy 30 sets 
an aspirational figure over the plan period. This takes account of scheme-based evidence, 
together with the viability appraisal and the evidence of housing needs, to set out a flexible 
approach to affordable housing recognising that up front infrastructure costs of the SUEs 
may affect affordable housing delivery in the early phases, but this is likely to improve 
over the lifetime of the plan. This approach is aimed at maximising the contribution that 
individual developments make to meeting the needs set out in Table 6, without making 
otherwise acceptable schemes unviable and reflects the fact that viability and the definition 
of affordable housing may change over the plan period.
9.37 Policy 30 seeks the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing in 
developments having regard to the viability of the development scheme and the objective 
of creating inclusive and mixed communities. Where a robust viability assessment indicates 
that a development cannot meet the Policy 30 targets in full, the local planning authority will 
negotiate with the developer to agree an appropriate scale of provision. Where the scale of 
infrastructure provision at larger sites necessitates a lower percentage of affordable housing 
in the early phases of the development, provisions should be made to provide additional 
affordable housing as viability improves over time.
9.38 The viability appraisal suggests that residential developments as small as 5 
dwelllings in the Rural Areas could contribute to affordable housing provision. However, 
National Planning Practice Guidance indicates that contributions should not be sought from 
developments of 10 or fewer dwellings. Subject to viability, affordable housing will therefore 
be sought on developments of 11 or more dwellings (net) or where the combined GFA of 
dwellings will exceed 1,000sqm in the rural areas (including all villages) and developments of 
15 or more dwellings (net) or where the combined GFA of dwellings will exceed 1,500sqm) in 
urban areas (Growth Towns and Market Towns). In considering development proposals that 
fall below these thresholds, account will be taken of whether the site forms part of a larger 
development opportunity. In such cases, a proportionate element of affordable housing may 
be sought on the smaller scheme and any subsequent linked development schemes. 
9.39 The presumption is that affordable housing will be provided on the application 
site and be located and designed to integrate with market sector housing. However, 
exceptionally, off-site provision or a financial contribution of broadly equivalent value may 
be negotiated where this will contribute to urban regeneration and/or contribute to creating 
mixed and inclusive communities. 
9.40 Where an identified local affordable housing need cannot be met by applying Policy 
30 targets to identified housing sites, it may be necessary to identify affordable housing 
allocations in Part 2 Local Plans and/or Neighbourhood Plans or to consider ‘exceptions’ 
sites as set out in Policy 13. 142
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESMEETING SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS
OLDER PEOPLE
9.41 The SHMA 2015 update highlights the growth in older (65+ age group) households 
as the most pressing housing need facing North Northamptonshire. There is projected to be 
a growth of around 20,100 of these households between 2011 and 2031, representing 60% 
of the total household growth for North Northamptonshire. The largest projected growth is 
East Northants at 79%.
9.42 The provision of suitable and attractive homes for these households in both the 
market and affordable housing sectors is important in enabling older people to remain in 
their own homes as long as possible and in providing attractive housing options (of which 
bungalows are the preference of many households) to enable older people to downsize 
to accommodation that is more suited to their needs, freeing up ‘under-occupied’ family 
housing. The SHMA toolkit forecasts the following requirements for special forms of housing 
for older people: 
a. 1,300 households requiring Designated housing, such as private sector retirement 
bungalows and apartments, that include the following features:
n Fully adapted accommodation;
n Integrated alarm with staff response when required;
n Facilitation of mutual support; and
n Opportunities for social activities.
 
b. 600 households requiring Sheltered or Supported housing, which is as Designated 
Housing above but providing personal support to residents as required;
c. 1,100 households requiring Extra Care housing, which crosses the boundary between high-
level support needs and high-level care needs, with a larger proportion in the latter category. 
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING
9.43 Related, but not exclusive, to housing for older people is the issue of accessible 
housing designed for people with particular mobility needs. Following the Housing Standards 
Review, the Government intends to amend the Building Regulations to provide optional 
levels of accessibility, with criteria for age friendly, accessible and adaptable housing. Local 
planning authorities will be able to adopt levels of accessibility, above the current minimum 
Building Regulation standards, to meet local needs, according to local circumstances and 
subject to viability testing. 
9.44 Three tiers of accessibility are proposed:
n Accessibility Category 1 (Mandatory minimum – the current Building Regulation standard);
n Accessibility Category 2 (Optional – equivalent to Lifetime Homes standard);
n Accessibility Category 3 (Optional – wheelchair user dwellings).143

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIES9.45 As indicated above, North Northamptonshire has an ageing population. The number 
of people over 75 is forecast to increase by 92% between 2011 and 2031, which will increase 
the need for Accessibility Category 2 and Category 3 housing. Northamptonshire County 
Council’s Planning Obligations Framework112 refers to the importance of meeting Lifetime 
Homes standards in strengthening local communities and reducing the need for residential 
care by allowing vulnerable people to remain in their homes. 
9.46 In order to meet these identified needs Policy 30 indicates that all new dwellings 
should meet Category 2 of the proposed national accessibility standards (equivalent to 
Lifetime Homes). Achieving Category 3 accessibility is more costly. Part 2 Local Plans and/ 
or Neighbourhood Plans may identify, on the basis of local evidence, the proportion of new 
development that needs to comply with this category 3 taking account of:
n The likely future need for people with disabilities; 
n Whether particular sizes and types of houses are needed to meet specifically evidenced 
needs; 
n The accessibility and adaptability of existing stock; 
n Overall impact on viability.
CUSTOM-BUILD HOUSING
9.47 Custom Build housing typically involves individuals commissioning the construction 
of a new house from a builder or physically building a house for themselves as a ‘self-build’ 
project. It also includes community-led housing projects comprising mostly affordable 
homes for the benefit of the community, either individually or in cooperation with a builder 
or housing provider.
9.48 Custom Built housing may be a more affordable route to home ownership and an 
opportunity for individuals to own bespoke and sustainably designed homes. It can offer 
opportunities to smaller builders and contractors, create local jobs and contribute to the 
local economy. The custom build industry currently provides around 10,000 homes per year 
across the UK and the Government is committed to doubling this over the next decade, 
making custom build a mainstream option for future home owners113.
9.49 The Government has made information and finance available to support custom 
built schemes, introduced an exemption from CIL for people building their own homes, and 
is consulting on a new ‘Right to Build’ to make it easier for people to find suitable building 
plots. It has given local communities powers to promote Custom-Built housing through 
Neighbourhood Development Orders and Community Right to Build Orders.
9.50 Proposals for individual and community custom-build developments which accord 
with the spatial strategy set out in Policy 11 will be supported and SUEs and other strategic 
developments should make available serviced building plots to facilitate this sector of the 
market. Policy 13 explains the circumstances in which new homes may be allowed outside 
settlement boundaries, as an exception to rural restraint policies. Based on evidence 
of local demand, Part 2 Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans may identify specific sites 
to enable custom built housing to play a greater role in the delivery of housing in North 
Northamptonshire.112 Creating Sustainable

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESPOLICY 30  – HOUSING MIX AND TENURE
Housing development should provide a mix of dwelling sizes and tenures to cater for current and forecast accommodation 
needs and to assist in the creation of sustainable mixed and inclusive communities. In particular:
a) The mix of house types within a development should reflect:
i. The need to accommodate smaller households with an emphasis on the provision of small and medium sized 
dwellings (1-3 bedrooms) including, where appropriate, dwellings designed for older people;
ii. The existing housing stock within the settlement or neighbourhood/ward in order to address any gaps in provision and to 
avoid an over-concentration of a single type of housing where this would adversely affect the character or infrastructure 
of the area.
b) The internal floor area of new dwellings must meet the National Space Standards as a minimum in order to provide 
residents with adequate space for basic furnishings, storage and activities. In both affordable and market sectors, adaptable 
housing designs will be encouraged in order to provide flexible internal layouts and to allow for cost-effective alterations 
(including extensions) as demands and lifestyles change;
c) New dwellings must meet Category 2 of the proposed National Accessibility Standards as a minimum and the local 
planning authority will negotiate for a proportion of Category 3 (wheel-chair accessible) housing based on evidence of 
local needs;
d) On private sector developments of 15 or more dwellings (net) or where the combined GFA of dwellings will exceed 
1,500sqm in the Growth Towns and Market Towns and 11 or more dwellings (net) or where the combined GFA of 
dwellings will exceed 1,000sqm elsewhere, the local planning authority will seek the provision of affordable housing in 
line with the following targets:
n Sustainable Urban Extensions  20% of total dwellings in phases to be developed by March 2026, with provision 
to be made for a review of the viable level of affordable housing in later phases.
n Growth Towns and Market Towns  excluding Oundle 30% of total dwellings

9.51 It is important to provide for the housing needs of a range of specific groups, 
including Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Show People. The National Planning Policy for 
Travellers Sites (March 2012)114 requires Local Planning Authorities to plan positively for the 
needs of travellers, to robustly assess needs and to identify criteria to guide land supply 
where there is an identified need. 
THE NEED FOR ACCOMMODATION 
9.52 The 2011 Northamptonshire Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment 
(GTA A)115 updates the 2008 assessment. The Update considered a range of Gypsy and 
Traveller groups in North Northamptonshire including English Gypsies, Irish Travellers, New 
Travellers and Travelling Show People across a range of tenure types. The study quantifies 
the accommodation and housing related support needs of Gypsies and Travellers in North 
Northamptonshire for the period 2012-2022, which are set out in Table 7 below. The Study 
will be updated to ensure that a robust evidence base is maintained.

9.53 The GTAA explains that at 2011 there was an overall requirement over the period 
to 2022 of some 30 residential pitches (in addition to new ones already planned) 4 transit 
pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 6 plots for Travelling Show People. Since the 
publication of the study, additional sites have been brought forward alongside commitments 
within the individual Boroughs/Districts to meet a significant proportion of this need. Where 
necessary, the individual Boroughs/Districts will positively bring forward and allocate sites in 
Part 2 Local Plans, to accommodate the identified need, and support the delivery of private 
site provision using the criteria in Policy 31. In order to satisfy the requirements of the Duty 
to Cooperate they will also maintain a positive dialogue with adjoining authorities regarding 
Gypsy and Traveller provision.
9.54 The priority in North Northamptonshire should be to bring forward residential 
pitches in the short term. If transit pitches are provided before the shortfall in residential 
pitches is met, there is a risk that they will effectively be used as permanent/residential sites 
with all the ensuing management issues that would arise.
9.55 On-going monitoring of site provision and vacant pitches should be undertaken by 
the Local Planning Authorities alongside discussions with Gypsies and Travellers to ensure 114 https://www.gov.uk/

 SECTION B: SPATIAL POLICIESthat any additional need that may arise over the plan period is identified and can be taken into 
account when needs assessments are updated, and planning applications are determined. 
LOCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW SITES
9.56 Policy 31 sets out criteria to guide the consideration of locations for new sites 
and ensure that a balance can be achieved between the health and safety implications of 
a new site’s location and its impact on the settled community. The settled community and 
neighbouring potential Gypsy and Traveller sites should also be involved in the consultation 
from an early stage. There may be scope for expanding existing sites to meet some of the 
need; however, the preference is for smaller sites, which tend to be easier to manage.
9.57 All sites should be closely linked to an existing settlement, having a functional 
relationship to ensure reasonable access to services and facilities. A key consideration for 
the location of transit sites is access to the primary road network. Consideration will be 
given to the identification of sites116 which are suitable for mixed residential and business use 
in recognition of the benefits that such sites offer in terms of supporting traditional lifestyles 
and reducing the need for travel to work journeys. 
POLICY 31  – GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS AND TRAVELLING 
SHOW PEOPLE
Local Planning Authorities will protect existing lawful sites, plots and pitches for Gypsies 
and Travellers. Sufficient sites for gypsy and traveller, and travelling show people 
accommodation will be identified in line with a robust evidence base. Where  necessary, 
part 2 Local Plans will allocate further sites for accommodation for gypsies, travellers 
and travelling show people.
New site allocations and applications for planning permission should satisfy all of the 
following criteria:
a) the site is closely linked to an existing settlement with an adequate range of services 
and facilities;
b) the site, or the cumulative impact of the site, in combination with existing or planned 
sites, will not have an unacceptable impact on local infrastructure;
c) the site provides a suitable level of residential amenity for the proposed residents; 
d) the site is served (or can be served) by an adequate water supply and appropriate 
means of sewage disposal;
e) there is satisfactory access and adequate space for operational needs including the 
parking, turning and servicing of vehicles;
f) the health and well-being of occupants is not put at risk including through unsafe 
access to the site, poor air quality and unacceptable noise or unacceptable flood risk 
and contaminated land;
g) the size of the site and number of pitches does not dominate the nearest settled 
community;
h) the proposed development does not have a significant adverse impact on the character 
of the landscape and takes account of the Landscape Character Assessment of the area. 
Appropriate landscaping and treatment to boundaries shall be provided to mitigate 
impact. 116 A transit site is 
intended for short-term 
use by Gypsies and 
Travellers in transit. 
The site is normally 
permanent, while its 
residents are temporary 
and a maximum period of 
stay would be imposed.147

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031INTRODUCTION
This section of the Plan sets out the policy requirements for six sites allocated in the Plan 
and for the Rushden East Sustainable Urban Extension, for which a broad strategic location 
is identified. Each of the six allocated sites is accompanied by a map which shows the 
boundary of the site and which illustrates a number of place-shaping requirements.  The 
map should be read in conjunction with the Policy and supporting text. The precise location 
of the place-shaping requirements illustrated on the map, such as vehicular access points 
and pedestrian links, will be determined through the planning application process.   
WEST CORBY SUSTAINABLE URBAN EXTENSION 
SITE DESCRIPTION 
10.1 The site of approximately 290 ha is separated from the urban area of Corby by the 
A6003 Uppingham Road and is bounded to the north, west and south by agricultural land. It 
forms a plateau between the slopes of the Welland Valley to the north and Harper’s Brook 
to the south and is essentially in agricultural use with several blocks of woodland.
 
KEY OBJECTIVES
10.2 The development should deliver:
n A high quality, sustainable urban extension which is permeable and well-connected and 
integrated with the town of Corby and the countryside;
n A distinct and cohesive community with an enhanced quality of life for all residents;
n High quality landscape treatment to enhance the character of the development and 
ensure that it is satisfactorily assimilated into the surrounding countryside and protects 
and, where possible, enhances the setting of heritage assets; 
n A broad balance and range of dwelling sizes, types and tenures to meet the needs of Corby; 
n A wide range of local employment and training opportunities that benefit the population 
of the urban extension and the wider area; 
n Infrastructure to mitigate the impact of the development on the surrounding highway network; 
n Services and community facilities that meet local needs arising from the development;
n Small scale retail development that meets local needs but does not compete with the 
town centre of Corby; 
n A network of connected green spaces which link to the wider green infrastructure 
framework and provide for the conservation, appropriate management and enhancement 
of important environmental assets, including biodiversity and archaeology within the 
ancient woodlands, and the creation of wildlife corridors and areas for formal and informal 
recreation;SECTION C  – DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITES

 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESn Low carbon growth through the attainment of high standards, where viable, of energy 
and water efficiency; renewable energy provision; sustainable construction; and recycling; 
n A modal shift away from car use and towards more sustainable forms of transport; and
n Flood mitigation measures, including additional modelling of watercourses and 
consideration of surface water. 
PLACE-SHAPING REQUIREMENTS
10.3 Access arrangements:  Multiple pedestrian and cycle access points will be required 
to connect with the town centre, neighbouring communities and wider countryside. 
Vehicular access should be taken from the A6003 with a northern link road to the A427 
across land outside of the allocated area but owned by the site promoter.
10.4 Highway capacity:  Together with the allocated employment site at Kettering 
North, the development is likely to increase traffic queues on the approaches to junction 7 
of the A14. This will require further investigation and mitigation measures, where necessary. 
Enhancements will also be required at road junctions in the vicinity of the site and at junctions 
within Corby itself as appropriate.

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.5 Improving connectivity:  The A6003 acts as a major barrier to east-west 
movement between the urban extension and Corby, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists. 
A transport and movement strategy will need to be developed to ensure that West Corby 
is well-connected to neighbouring developments, the town centre and the countryside. The 
character of the A6003 will need to change so that safe and convenient links can be created 
across the road. Measures to improve connectivity must not compromise the road’s function 
as a primary route. 
10.6 Proposals will need to include the introduction of high quality and frequent bus 
services into the site in line with the Northamptonshire Bus Strategy and identify how these 
will be delivered. 
10.7 Within the urban extension there should be a neighbourhood centre with attractive 
bus waiting facilities and a network of local centres at key junctions that benefit from passing 
trade and are well connected to surrounding residential and employment areas via safe and 
convenient routes. The centres should act as focal points for the community and incorporate 
retail development, local services and facilities and small-scale business floorspace uses 
(including, for example, offices, studios, workshops and live-work units), where these are 
compatible with the residential environment. The centres are also likely to be suitable locations 
for the secondary school and four primary schools needed to serve the urban extension.
10.8 Green infrastructure:  West Corby is located in a strategic position with the 
Harper’s Brook Sub-Regional Green Infrastructure Corridor (see Figure 17) to the north and 
the Stoke Albany-Little Oakley Local Green Infrastructure Corridor to the south. Swinawe 
Woods and Ash Coppice at the southern end of the site are Local Wildlife Sites and, more 
significantly, areas of ancient woodland. Swinawe Barn plantation to the east of these woods 
has been identified as a Potential Wildlife site whilst other potentially important habitats 
and features include watercourses, ponds, hedgerows and trees. King’s Wood Local Nature 
Reserve (LNR), a further area of ancient woodland, is located to the east of the A6003. 
10.9 A strategy will need to be developed to deliver a connected and accessible network 
of green infrastructure which:
n Includes sustainable drainage infrastructure to serve the development;
n Acts as a wildlife corridor. The ancient woodlands form irreplaceable ecosystems which 
should be retained, enhanced and sympathetically managed for nature conservation, and 
also their archaeological interest, and protected from direct and indirect detrimental 
impacts including disturbance, noise, artificial lighting, dust effects and contamination. 
Areas of buffer planting should be provided adjacent to the ancient woodlands. Other 
potentially important habitats and features need to be evaluated and safeguarded and 
enhanced where possible and appropriate to do so. Areas of woodland should be linked 
using the existing hedgerow network and watercourses and planting will be required to 
create a green, accessible corridor which will permeate the development. The ecological 
assessment should consider the impact of development on King’s Wood and visual and 
physical links to the LNR;150
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESn Enhances recreational opportunities: The green infrastructure network should 
incorporate footpaths, cycleways and areas of formal and informal recreation. A bridleway 
(GS14) crosses the site from the A6003 to Great Cattage Wood. This will need to be 
integrated into the urban extension and opportunities to extend the bridleway network 
should be developed;
n Ensure that the green infrastructure network is integrated with the wider countryside and 
supports opportunities to deliver improvements to connectivity between West Corby 
and the Harper’s Brook Sub-Regional Green Infrastructure Corridor and Stoke Albany-
Little Oakley Local Green Infrastructure Corridor. 
10.10  Strategic landscaping and Heritage Assets:  Rockingham Castle and the Grade 
II* Registered Park and Garden are located north of the A427 together with Conservation 
Areas and listed buildings at East Carlton, Middleton and Cottingham. Heritage assets in the 
village of Pipewell to the south-west of the allocated site include the scheduled Cistercian 
Abbey, a Conservation Area and listed buildings. 
10.11  Preparation of the masterplan will require consideration of the location and height 
of development and the landscape structure. Proposals should provide for the protection 
of the rural setting of the heritage assets; the assimilation of the urban extension into the 
countryside; green infrastructure links into the sub-regional and local green infrastructure 
corridors and the wider countryside; and the mitigation of the potential impact of the 
proposed egg farm to the north of the urban extension (see the next page). 
10.12  The land between the allocated site and the A427 may be a suitable location for 
a future extension to West Corby. The masterplan should provide for the integration of 
this land into the urban extension and its possible development beyond the Plan period. 
However, the impact of development in this area on designated heritage assets north of 
the A427 will need to be assessed and mitigated, where necessary. The potential impact of 
the northern link road to the A427, which forms part of the proposals for the initial urban 
extension, will need to be included in this assessment.
10.13  Within the site there are areas of potential archaeological interest which should be 
investigated and, where appropriate, should influence the layout of the masterplan. Built 
features on the site (Middleton Lodge Farm and Beanfield Lawns Farm Cottages) are not 
listed but should be assessed to determine their heritage significance and ensure that they 
are able to be incorporated into the development, where feasible.
10.14  Water main s and Sewerage : Significant off-site sewerage and enhancements to 
the existing foul sewerage network will be required. There will be a need for improvements 
to the water supply network.  Several water mains along the eastern edge of the site run 
parallel to the A6003 and a further main runs westwards from the water towers adjacent to 
the northeast corner of the site. The site layout should be designed to take this into account. 
This existing infrastructure is protected by easements and should not be built over or 
located in private gardens where access for maintenance and repair could be restricted. The 
mains should be located in highways or public open space.  There are also 11kv overhead 
electricity cables on poles crossing the site. The water mains adjacent to the A6003 prevent 
built development directly fronting onto the road. Creating a sense of enclosure will need to 
be addressed creatively, ensuring that there are views from the road through landscaping or 
other place shaping features (such as public art) to buildings which front towards the A6003. 151

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.15  Density:  To make efficient use of land it is envisaged that the overall net density 
will be 35 dwellings per hectare. This will vary across the site with lower densities on the 
countryside edge and higher densities at places with good public transport accessibility 
such as around major nodes along good quality public transport corridors and around local/
neighbourhood centres. 
10.16  Housing mix: To ensure social diversity and a cohesive community, proposals 
should provide for the seamless integration (‘pepper-potting’) of a mix of housing sizes, 
types and tenures including starter homes, family housing and housing for the elderly. 
10.17  Character areas: The development should be designed as a number of character 
areas, each with a distinctive treatment and developed in response to the site and its context 
to create a locally specific development that will contribute to a clear identity which gives 
residents a sense of place and belonging. New street patterns should be connected with 
limited use of cul-de-sacs; a clear street hierarchy; and mixed uses and civic uses on the 
most connected streets. There is an expectation that comprehensive ‘design coding’ of 
development will be used to support the masterplan.
10.18  Pollution:  The A6003 is a potential source of noise pollution. The need for 
mitigation measures should be assessed and implemented, where necessary. In addition, 
there is an extant planning permission for a major egg production farm on land directly 
adjoining the north-west boundary of the site. An assessment of the potential impact of the 
egg farm will need to be undertaken.
10.19  Minerals Safeguarding Area: Part of the site is within a Minerals Safeguarding 
Area as defined in the Northamptonshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan. An assessment will 
need to be undertaken to determine the economic importance of these deposits and the 
viability of prior extraction. 
POLICY 32  – WEST CORBY SUSTAINABLE URBAN 
EXTENSION
Land at West Corby, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for a mixed-use 
sustainable urban extension. The development should include:
a) The phased delivery of around 4,500 dwellings to include the seamless integration of 
housing sizes, types and tenures; 
b) A wide range of employment opportunities that provide for at least 2,500 jobs in 
different sectors of the economy and include provision for small/medium size flexible 
units that can be used for B1 (business) and B2 (general industry) uses; 
c) Primary and secondary education facilities to meet the needs of the development; and
d) Retail, leisure, social, cultural, green infrastructure, community and health facilities to 
meet the day to day needs of the development without adversely affecting the town 
centre of Corby.152
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESA comprehensive masterplan for the whole development should be agreed by the local 
planning authority. The masterplan will make provision for the above requirements and;
e) Provide for development to commence adjacent to the existing town to avoid the 
creation of isolated areas of development;
f) Demonstrate that proposals will be implemented in a comprehensive manner linked 
to the delivery of infrastructure;
g) Detail the location of vehicular access points at safe and convenient locations along 
the A6003 and the A427;
h) Provide infrastructure to mitigate the impact on the surrounding highway network;
i) Provide for the comprehensive integration and connectivity of all of the land 
between the northern boundary of the site and the A427 to facilitate possible further 
development beyond the Plan period (post 2031) subject to a technical assessment, 
including the impact on heritage assets; 
j) Include an integrated transport network that is focused on walking, cycling and 
excellent public transport and provides convenient, permeable and safe routes 
that connect homes to destinations within the urban extension and link West 
Corby to adjoining neighbourhoods, the town centre, adjoining settlements and the 
countryside. 
k) Include a connected and accessible network of high quality landscaping and green 
infrastructure which integrates the development into the countryside; enhances the 
character and ecological value of the site; provides buffers to protect and enhance 
ancient woodland; protects the setting of heritage assets; includes sustainable 
drainage infrastructure to serve the development; and incorporate open space for 
play, sport and recreation to meet the needs of the urban extension. Provision should 
be made for the effective management of landscape features and the new landscaping 
and green infrastructure; 
l) Provide an energy strategy to ensure that the highest viable amount of heat and energy used 
within the development is generated on-site from renewable or low-carbon sources; and
m) Include mitigation measures, where necessary, to ensure that the development will not 
be adversely affected by the permitted egg farm or by the A6003 Uppingham Road.153

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031RUSHDEN EAST SUSTAINABLE URBAN EXTENSION 
10.20  In order to provide for significant expansion at Rushden in accordance with its status 
as a Growth Town, a broad strategic location for a Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) has 
been identified to the east of the A6 as shown in Figure 23 below. This land is considered to 
be the most sustainable option for the future development of Rushden and provides a major 
opportunity for a high quality, cohesive and distinctive Sustainable Urban Extension. It is a 
broad area of search and detailed boundaries will be determined through a master-planning 
process. Whilst the A6 bypass currently forms a significant barrier between the proposed 
urban extension and Rushden and Higham Ferrers, a range of solutions will be examined 
in order to create a development which is permeable and well-connected to the adjacent 
urban areas and the facilities these offer. 
 
Figure 23: Broad Location of Rushden East Sustainable Urban Extension
KEY CONSTRAINTS
10.21  The broad location contains several farm holdings and is predominantly in agricultural 
use. Other land uses include nurseries, allotments, scrapyard and some isolated dwellings. 
Rushden East is being actively promoted by several key landowners and developers. Whilst it is 
recognised that land assembly and planning processes could result in a significant lead-in time, 
the local planning authority will promote and encourage the early development of the SUE. 
10.22  The A6 bypass creates a physical barrier between the SUE and Rushden and Higham 
Ferrers town centres and means that gaining east-west connections with these on foot and 
by cycle will need to be addressed. The A6 bypass is part of the principal road network and 
as such has high traffic flows and is designed for speeds of 60 mph and 70 mph with few 
access points along it. In order to improve connectivity to create a sustainable development, 
the character of the road would need to change, and the implications of this impact on the 
surrounding highway network will need to be tested. 154
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITES10.23  Initial transport modelling work has shown that development will increase traffic 
flows and congestion on the A6 and A45, particularly at the Chowns Mill junction, which is 
already at capacity, and along the rest of the A45 corridor. Funding to upgrade Chowns Mill 
has been committed by the Government in its Road Investment Strategy (December 2014). 
A transport and movement strategy will be required to demonstrate how connectivity 
will be achieved. This will include details of how residents will access key services and 
employment destinations by public transport, building on existing services including the 
hopper bus service funded by the Rushden and Higham Ferrers town councils. Development 
east of the A6 would require a bus service looping through the site.
10.24  The Spire of St Mary’s Church in Higham Ferrers can be seen from the A6, and 
views continue eastwards of the A6. Further assessment of how development may impact 
on the setting of the church and other heritage assets should be undertaken, including an 
assessment of the archaeological potential of the broad location.
 
10.25  It will be necessary to consider the impacts on the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits 
Special Protection Area (SPA), and to provide adequate alternative open space on-site to 
mitigate an increase in visitor impacts. Account will need to be taken of the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area Supplementary Planning Document and of the 
Northamptonshire Biodiversity Supplementary Planning document. 
PLACE-SHAPING REQUIREMENTS
10.26  Providing new jobs will be just as important as new homes to help redress the 
balance of jobs to homes in Rushden as a whole. The SUE will need to support job creation, 
entrepreneurship and innovation. A range of different job opportunities will be available 
through dedicated business, a local centre and opportunities for working and starting 
business at home. It will meet the day to day community needs of residents on site but also 
contribute to enhancing adjacent urban areas.
10.27  There will be high quality ‘destination’ open space on site as well as other natural 
and formal green spaces and there will also be new green infrastructure connections to 
the wider Greenway network. The existing landscape character and built, historic and 
natural environment assets within and surrounding the site will inform the nature of the 
built development, including the treatment of the edges to sensitively manage the change 
from town to country and avoid coalescence with the villages of Caldecott, Chelveston and 
Newton Bromswold. 
10.28  The development will be well connected to adjacent urban areas, especially the 
centres for pedestrians and cyclists and by public transport and car. Where Hayden Road 
meets the A6, there will be a central access opportunity to the town. The character and the 
environment of the A6 will be significantly changed between and in the vicinity of Newton 
Road and John Clarke Way to ensure a well-connected and high quality environment for 
people living at Rushden East whilst enabling relevant development and commercial 
opportunities such as a neighbourhood centre.155

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.29  The site itself will include a connected grid of streets, fronted by buildings, 
reminiscent of the urban structure of the Victorian and Edwardian streets in the town. A 
main street will run through the development linking the roundabouts at Newton Road and 
John Clarke Way. The local centre, or neighbourhood centre(s), will be located at accessible 
intersections to capture passing trade and contain a mix of uses including consideration of 
siting of primary schools. New homes will provide for a balanced and mixed community 
including family housing, affordable homes and specialist homes for the older population. 
10.30  Sustainable drainage systems to manage surface water and existing watercourses 
should be accommodated in the development of the site. Other site specific constraints 
will need to be addressed in order for development to take place. Examples may include 
noise attenuation measures necessary as a consequence of the proximity to the A6 and 
contamination associated with uses such as the scrapyard to the south of Alexandra Road. 
10.31  East Northamptonshire Council will work with the site promoters to prepare a 
Master Plan for the SUE, in consultation with the local community and other stakeholders. 
The Master Plan will guide the preparation of the Part 2 Local Plan covering Rushden, 
or the preparation of a planning application. The Master Plan will be an important tool 
in demonstrating how the site can be brought forward in a comprehensive manner in 
accordance with the JCS. It will illustrate the form and disposition of the development and 
establish the strategy towards matters such as land use, transport and movement, access, 
sustainable construction standards, open space and design. It will consider infrastructure 
requirements in greater detail and any necessary matters of avoiding, mitigating or 
compensating for environmental impacts. It will be fully informed by the views of the local 
community and interested parties and will include design principles that could be used to 
help guide future detailed design or adopted as a design code. 
 
10.32  The Master Plan will also include a delivery strategy to identify how and when the 
development will be implemented; any matters to be resolved such as land assembly and 
preparation; infrastructure requirements and delivery; development phasing to ensure that 
where possible, housing provision is linked to the development of land for employment; 
and the likely need for development contributions taking into consideration the Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Regulations. It will also identify the likely need for public sector 
intervention, by which agency and when. 156

Land to the East of Rushden is identified as the 
broad location for a sustainable urban extension to 
include around 2,500 dwellings and provision for 
an appropriate level of job opportunities, ancillary 
facilities, services and open space. 
Rushden East will be a sustainable and attractive 
development that helps meet the long-term 
aspirations for economic growth; offers a high 
quality of life for new and existing residents and 
enhances the image of the town as a whole. It 
will be a new distinctive neighbourhood with its 
own separate identity but well-connected and 
integrated with the town as a whole. 
A masterplan will be prepared in consultation with 
the local community and stakeholders and agreed 
by the local planning authority. The masterplan 
will define development boundaries and policy 
expectations for inclusion in the Part 2 Local Plan 
covering Rushden or the preparation of a planning 
application for development of the Sustainable 
Urban Extension.
In order to avoid piece-meal development, the 
preparation and agreement of the masterplan is a 
prerequisite before any planning applications are 
granted planning permission. Any such planning 
applications will need to take into account 
the requirements of the Habitats Regulations 
Assessment legislation. Any development proposals 
must be consistent with the masterplan and must 
not in any way prejudice the implementation of the 
whole development.The masterplan should meet the policy requirements set out in 
this Plan, including the need to be informed by a project level 
Habitats Regulations Assessment (to ensure the protection of 
the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area), and 
incorporate the following specific local requirements: 
ECONOMIC :
a) Around 2,000-2,500 homes including affordable homes and 
homes for the older population. 
b) Good connections by all modes across the A6 to the rest 
of Rushden and to Higham Ferrers, in particular the town 
centres and other key service and employment destinations.
c) A mix of employment opportunities that will make a significant 
contribution to delivering an enhanced balance between new 
homes and jobs in Rushden, including offices and industrial 
premises as well as local centre, small-scale business space and 
dwellings suitable for home working or business start-ups. 
d) The opportunity for further development beyond the current 
scale of development through safeguarding land and access 
opportunities.
ENVIRONMENTAL:
e) A sensitively designed environment responding to the existing 
landscape character and features, including how the edge of 
the site is treated. 
f) A permeable and well-connected grid of streets and new links 
to connect with the wider Greenway network. 
g) Appropriate green space, and other mitigation measures 
as may be required to mitigate impacts on the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area, This should include 
the provision of a new and attractive destination open space. 
h) Green spaces with the imaginative use of water to both 
manage drainage and make them more attractive.
i) A clear physical separation from the villages of Caldecott, 
Chelveston and Newton Bromswold but with footpaths and

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031LAND AT COCKERELL ROAD, CORBY
SITE DESCRIPTION
 
10.33  The site of approximately 9.5ha consists of land formerly used as part of the 
British Steel Plant. Cockerell Road adjoins the eastern boundary whilst Courier Road, 
which provides access to the Phoenix Parkway retail park, is located to the south. Phoenix 
Parkway, which forms part of the principal road network, adjoins the north-east boundary 
of the site. To the west there is a railway line with residential development beyond. 
 
KEY OBJECTIVES
10.34  The site should deliver: 
n Employment and training opportunities;
n A high quality, landscaped business park;
n Infrastructure needed to support the development;
n Opportunities for non-car based travel; 
n A net gain in green infrastructure and biodiversity; and
n A development that is of the highest quality of design; supports low carbon growth through the 
attainment of high standards of energy efficiency, renewable energy provision and sustainable 
construction; and reduces the risk of flooding in accordance with policies in the Plan.

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITES10.35  Access arrangements: The principal vehicular access should be from Cockerell Road. 
The internal road system should be designed to facilitate low speeds to encourage walking and 
cycling with buildings that front onto Cockerell Road and internal roads within the development.
10.36  Highway capacity:  Whilst the highway capacity in Corby is reasonably good, 
further investigation is required to determine the need for local capacity enhancements 
arising from the development. 
10.37  Improving connectivity:  Connectivity over the railway line should be enhanced 
and improvements should be provided on Courier Road and Phoenix Parkway to create 
a well-connected place that increases opportunities for walking and cycling to the nearby 
retail park and to the wider area. Measures should include safe links between the site and 
the proposed off-road pedestrian/cycle route link along Phoenix Parkway which will connect 
the urban extension at Priors Hall with the town centre.
10.38  Contributions will be sought towards the improvement of public transport provision 
in the area to increase the frequency of bus services and associated infrastructure. 
10.39  Strategic landscaping and green infrastructure:  The site is located within the Nene 
Valley Nature Improvement Area (see Policy 4) and adjacent to a reptile reserve on the adjoining 
railway embankment. An ecological assessment will be required which should pay particular 
attention to the possible use of the site by invertebrates, ground-nesting birds, reptiles and 
amphibians, including Great Crested Newts. The development will need to avoid adversely affecting 
the reptile reserve and proposals will be encouraged to contribute towards its enhancement. 
10.40  The Willow Brook, situated at the northern end of the site, is designated a ‘main 
river’. Proposals should include the protection and enhancement of existing watercourses, 
and must not impede access to the main river for the purposes of maintenance and 
improvement. Proposals should include an avenue of trees or feature planting which can 
contribute towards green infrastructure, sustainable drainage, connectivity between 
habitats; and climate change mitigation.
10.41  Sewerage:  Localised sewerage upgrades may be required depending on the nature, 
size and density of the employment uses proposed. A contribution to a strategic main 
scheme will also be required. Sewers cross this site, therefore the site layout should be 
designed to take this into account. This existing infrastructure is protected by easements 
and should not be built over or located in private gardens where access for maintenance and 
repair could be restricted. The sewers should be located in highways or public open space.
10.42  Other considerations:  A contaminated land survey will be required and any 
consequent remediation works that are identified must be implemented. The impact of 
noise and, if appropriate, light disturbance arising from the development on the neighbouring 
residential area to the west of the railway will need to be assessed and any necessary 
mitigation measures will need to be provided. An intermediate pressure gas main is located 
on Phoenix Parkway adjacent to the north east site boundary.159

10.45  Access: Vehicular access should be from Northampton Road (B645). 
10.46  Highway capacity improvements:  The development is expected to increase 
congestion on the A45 during peak periods, particularly at the A6 Chowns Mill roundabout. 
Additional pressure on town centre junctions within Rushden and Higham Ferrers is also 
anticipated. 
10.47  Connectivity improvements: To encourage a modal shift away from the car it will 
be essential to improve access for pedestrians and cyclists to neighbouring residential areas; 
the town centres of Rushden and Higham Ferrers; Rushden Lakes; and other retail outlets at 
Crown Park close to the A45/Northampton Road junction. Ensuring that the site is well served 
by public transport, particularly the northernmost part will be challenging and measures to 
achieve this will need to be developed through a transport and movement strategy.
10.48  Along the easternmost flank of the site there is a public footpath (UK 10) which 
provides an established connection between the urban area and the Nene Valley sub-regional 
corridor. A link between the site and this public footpath should be provided to enhance access 
both to the countryside and to the residential development to the east of the site.

SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.49 Strategic landscaping and green infrastructure:  The site is within the 
designated Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area (see Policy 4) where the aim is to 
improve ecological connectivity and enlarge existing biodiversity assets. It is located within 
the Rushden-Souldrop Local Green Infrastructure Corridor and in close proximity to the 
Nene Valley Sub-Regional Green Infrastructure Corridor and Upper Nene Valley Gravel 
Pits Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar site. There are Potential Wildlife Sites (PWS) 
directly north-east of the site and hedgerows and trees within the development area which 
form potentially important habitats and landscape features. 
10.50  A strategy will be required to deliver a connected and accessible green infrastructure 
network which reinforces the location of the site within the Rushden-Souldrop Local Green 
Infrastructure Corridor. Proposals should: 
n Include sustainable drainage infrastructure to serve the development;
n Enhance the value of the site as a wildlife corridor. The green infrastructure should link 
Northampton Road with the PWS to the north-east and the SPA site beyond. There are 
likely to be some species that are able to cross the A45 and the green infrastructure 
should therefore provide natural habitat similar to that within the neighbouring SPA; 
n Be informed and accompanied by a project level Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) 
to ensure the protection of the SPA. This HRA should take account of the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area Supplementary Planning Document, and the 
need for a noise impact assessment to establish careful working practices (for example, 
minimisation of winter working close to the SPA, careful positioning of security lighting, 
and the use of standard noise control measures such as the damping of pile hammers, use 
of close board fencing, etc.);
n Enhance opportunities for informal recreation and connectivity between Northampton 
Road and the Nene Valley. However, when developing improvements it will be important 
to ensure that the potential impact on the SPA is fully considered; and
n Deliver high quality strategic landscaping to enhance the character of the development 
and reduce its visual impact. Proposals should provide for the retention, where possible, 
and reinforcement of important landscape features and incorporate these into the 
network of green infrastructure. 
10.51  Flood risk management: The northernmost part of the site is within EA Flood 
Zone 2. This will necessitate appropriate application of the national sequential test for 
flooding and consideration of flood risk management on site.
10.52  Built form:  Key landmark buildings should be provided in the south-west part of the 
site, including the A45/Northampton Road junction, to create a significant gateway feature to 
Rushden and Higham Ferrers and to provide attractive street frontages. The scale and design 
of development in the north-east part of the site should complement the high quality gateway 
development to the south-west. New development will be required to demonstrate that 
appropriate consideration has been given to its height, scale, massing and form. In particular 
the north-eastern part of the site, which is more elevated, will be required to demonstrate 
how its design and relationship with the surroundings have been taken into account in 
mitigating the visual impact of any future development. The site masterplan should include high 
quality strategic landscaping to help screen development in this part of the site.
10.53  Residential amenity: There are several dwellings adjacent to the site. Ensuring that 
the amenity of residents is not diminished significantly will be an important consideration. 
This may be delivered through measures such as noise attenuation. 162

need to be undertaken of the viability and need to undertake prior extraction of the mineral 
resource in accordance with the adopted Northamptonshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan.
10.55  Gas main:  A high pressure gas main traverses the site, running much of its length 
from northeast to southwest. The easement standards associated with this will need to be 
defined and incorporated into the development. 
10.56  Sewerage and water infrastructure:  There may be a requirement to upgrade 
the local sewerage system dependent on the nature, size and density of employment uses 
proposed. A contribution to a strategic water main scheme will also be required.
POLICY 35  – LAND AT NENE VALLEY FARM,  
 NORTHAMPTON ROAD, RUSHDEN
Land at Nene Valley Farm, Rushden, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for a mix 
of B1 (business) and B2 (general industry) employment uses together with a place of 
worship, open space and other employment uses where these are compatible with the 
intended primary uses.
A comprehensive masterplan and project level Habitats Regulation Assessment, to be 
agreed by the local planning authority, should make provision for the above requirements 
and:
a) Provide for vehicular access into the site solely from Northampton Road;
b) Incorporate appropriate measures to ensure that there is adequate capacity in the 
surrounding highway network to accommodate traffic generated by the development;
c) Include measures to enable the avoidance of significant adverse effects on the 
integrity of the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area;
d) Provide a network of high quality landscaping and a substantial, publicly accessible, 
green infrastructure corridor which enhances connectivity between Northampton 
Road and the River Nene Sub-Regional Corridor and provides natural habitat for 
species within the surrounding area; 
e) Encourage modal shift through the provision of safe and convenient links for 
pedestrian and cyclists to the wider area and enhanced public transport; 
 
f) Include a high quality, landmark building(s) in the south-west part of the site including  
the A45/Northampton Road/Crown Way roundabout as a gateway to Rushden and 
Higham Ferrers; 
g) Demonstrate how the height, scale, massing and form of development, particularly in

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031LAND AT KETTERING NORTH
SITE DESCRIPTION 
10.57  The site of approximately 75ha is located on the north side of Kettering adjacent 
to the A4300 (Weekley Wood Lane) and directly east of the Kettering Business Park. The 
allocation provides a major opportunity to develop employment uses within a high quality 
woodland setting. 
KEY OBJECTIVES
10.58  The development should deliver:
n Employment and training opportunities to help build a more diverse, dynamic and self 
reliant economy;
n Improvements to the road network made necessary by the development;
n Opportunities for non-car based travel through the provision of public transport which 
is commercially sustainable in the long term; improved walking and cycling connections 
with the existing urban area and to existing bridleways; and a network of walking, cycling 
and equestrian infrastructure within the development, a connected network of green 
infrastructure which enhances biodiversity assets, recreational opportunities and links to 
the surrounding area; 
n High quality landscape treatment to assimilate the development into the countryside; 
create a high quality environment, mitigate the impact on heritage assets; and enhance 
the setting of Boughton House and Boughton House Registered Park and Garden;
n Low carbon growth through the attainment of high standards of energy and water 
efficiency; renewable energy provision; sustainable construction; and recycling; and

10.59  Access: The site could be accessed from the A43 via the existing Kettering Business 
Park. There is also an opportunity to provide access off the A4300 (Weekley Wood Lane).
10.60  Highway capacity: Together with the planned West Corby urban extension, the 
development is likely to increase traffic queues on the approaches to junction 7 of the A14. 
This will require further investigation and mitigation measures, where necessary. 
10.61  Improving connectivity:  Weekley Wood Lane forms a significant barrier for 
pedestrians and cyclists whilst the woodland to the south of the Lane further separates 
the site from Kettering. Despite a reduction in traffic along this section of road following 
the construction of the Corby Link Road, the planned Weekley-Warkton Avenue and 
development at Kettering East will increase traffic flows during the Plan period. A strategy 
will need to be developed to ensure that Kettering North is well-connected to the adjoining 
Business Park, the town centre and residential areas to the south of the A4300.

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.62  Despite these constraints there are opportunities to improve connectivity. These 
improvements should include safe and convenient pedestrian and cycle links across Weekley 
Wood Lane and to the services and facilities on the adjoining Business Park. The woodland south 
of Weekley Wood Lane is in the ownership of the site promoter; proposals should enhance 
the safety and quality of links through this woodland to the residential area beyond and identify 
further opportunities to enhance connectivity towards the town centre. Appropriate measures 
to help reduce traffic speed along Weekley Wood Lane would be required.
10.63  Ensuring that the site is well served by public transport will be challenging. The 
adjoining Business Park is served by buses travelling between Kettering and Corby. 
Opportunities to either extend these routes into Kettering North or provide a new, 
convenient service into the development will need to be explored. Whilst bus stops are 
provided on the A43, the level of pedestrian permeability is poor, and pedestrian crossing 
facilities should be made more convenient. 
10.64  Green infrastructure:  Kettering North is located in close proximity to the Ise 
Valley Sub-regional Green Infrastructure Corridor (see Figure 17). Much of the woodland on 
the site and directly to the north is designated as a Local Wildlife Site and forms an important 
feature in the landscape. Part of the land has also been identified as a Potential Wildlife Site 
(PWS) with further PWSs located on adjacent land. Other potentially important habitats and 
features include hedgerows and trees, areas of semi-improved grassland and ditches. 
10.65  A Mitigation Strategy will be required to deliver a connected and accessible green 
infrastructure network which: 
n Includes sustainable drainage infrastructure to serve the development;
n Acts as a wildlife corridor. Existing woodland and other important habitats and features 
must be retained, where possible, and enhanced in a way that protects the Local Wildlife 
Sites from additional recreational pressure and drainage/run-off from development. The 
strategy should assess the opportunities in and around the development for other types 
of habitat creation, such as grasslands and wetlands, and the role of the PWSs in delivering 
off-site mitigation and contributing towards the green infrastructure network; 
n Enhances recreational opportunities. Proposals should provide for the extension of 
the circular walk planned as part of the development of the adjoining North Kettering 
Business Park; and include a bridleway around the perimeter of the site to enhance the 
existing network and increase opportunities for horse riders; and
n Ensures that the green infrastructure network is integrated with the wider countryside 
and supports opportunities to deliver improvements to connectivity between Kettering 
and the Ise Valley corridor. 
10.66  Strategic landscaping and Heritage Assets:  High quality strategic landscaping 
must enhance the character of the development and ensure that it is integrated into the 
surrounding countryside. The eastern-most part of the site is particularly significant in terms 
of short, medium and long distance views from the Grade 1 listed Boughton House and 
parts of the associated Grade 1 Registered Park and Garden along the tree-lined Broad 
Walk Avenue. There are also glimpsed views into the site from the villages of Weekley and 
Warkton which both include a conservation area and listed buildings. 166
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITES10.67  It will be vital to maintain the setting of these assets and detailed consideration 
must be given to the location and height of buildings and landscape structure. This must 
include consideration of the wider historic landscape character of the site and surrounding 
countryside and the need to respect and restore landscape features. 
10.68  The Broad Walk Avenue frames long distance views from Boughton House and 
the Registered Park towards the horizon and hedgerow along the eastern boundary of the 
development site. The views must be maintained, continuing the sense of openness and the 
impression of a ‘view to infinity’. The development provides an important opportunity to 
re-establish a tree-lined avenue with strips of grassed land either side which once crossed 
the Broad Walk Avenue at a right angle along the eastern edge of the site (referred to as the 
‘lost’ corridor – see 10.69 below). This approach could also mitigate any visual impact on the 
heritage assets at Weekley and Warkton. 
10.69  West of the lost corridor a substantial area of woodland could further serve to 
separate new development from the sensitive eastern edge of the site with a grass ride 
extending westwards across this woodland area, continuing the long distance views along the 
Broad Walk Avenue with further screening between the edge of the Avenue and proposed 
development to the west. 
10.70  Built form:  The woodland setting of the site should provide inspiration for the 
development of contemporary, innovative buildings. Examples might include the use of 
timber, green walls and green roofs. Capitalising on the views of the landscape from within 
the buildings will provide a further opportunity to create an excellent place. 
10.71  Renewable energy: The opportunity to provide combined heat and power using 
the neighbouring estate woodlands should be fully explored as part of a strategy to minimise 
carbon emissions. 
10.72  Residential amenity:  There are dwellings adjacent to the south-west corner of the 
site area. The amenity of residents will need to be protected in accordance with Policy 8 
(North Northamptonshire Place Making Principles).
10.73  Other considerations:  Whilst the site is screened from the A4300, the road 
represents a potential source of noise pollution and the need for attenuation measures will 
need to be assessed and, where necessary, agreed and implemented.167

Kettering at junction 9 of the A14. The site incorporates two distinct parcels of land shown 
on the map on the next page. Parcel A lies north of Isham Road and adjacent to Pytchley 
Golf Course. It is the highest point of the site, being on the ridge line. The village of Pytchley 
is located to the south-west of parcel A. Parcel B, adjacent to the A509, slopes from west to 
east. The Midland Mainline railway forms the eastern site boundary with the River Ise and 
the town of Burton Latimer beyond. The village of Isham is located to the south. Directly 
north of the A14 there is a business park and a retail/leisure park. 
KEY OBJECTIVES
10.75  The development should deliver:

10.73  Land uses: Parcel B will primarily focus on the delivery of B8 (logistics) development 
whilst Parcel A will provide opportunities for B1 (office) and B2 (general industrial) of a 
smaller scale including the potential for a public service hub.
10.74  Access:  Vehicular access to parcels A and B should be from Isham Rd and the A509 
respectively. 
10.75  Highway capacity:  The development will result in the need for mitigation 
measures to enhance the capacity of the A14 junction. In addition, the site should contribute 
cumulatively to capacity enhancements needed in Kettering town centre. 
 
10.76  Improving connectivity:  The A14 acts as a major barrier and restricts connectivity 
for pedestrians and cyclists between the site and the urban area of Kettering. To encourage a 
modal shift away from the car a strategy will be developed to ensure that Kettering South is 
well connected to Kettering and Burton Latimer in a safe and direct manner. Proposals should 
include opportunities for improved public transport with a permeable network of roads 
and paths provided on parcel B. Enhancements to the A509 radial route will be required to 
facilitate improved access into Kettering and enable existing out of town retail and business 
areas directly north of the A14 to serve the development. In addition, a mix of uses within 
the site of an appropriate scale to meet the working-day needs of people would enhance the

enhance the character of the development and minimise visual impact on the surrounding 
area, including the market town of Burton Latimer and the villages of Isham and Pytchley. 
Limitations on the scale and height of buildings may also be necessary. The prominent and 
visually sensitive location of parcel A requires buildings and landscaping to be of a high quality 
of design to reflect the highly visible gateway location of the site. Built development on parcel 
A should be focused at the eastern end close to the A14 junction and landmark buildings 
should be incorporated into the masterplan to emphasise the importance of the site as a 
gateway to Kettering. Strategic landscaping should be provided in the west of the parcel at 
the earliest opportunity to provide a transition into open countryside and reduce the visual 
impact of the development. Proposals on parcel B should include strategic landscaping along 
the southern boundary at the earliest opportunity to limit the visual impact on Isham and 
should incorporate measures to screen the A14. 
10.78  Kettering South is located adjacent to the Ise Valley Sub-Regional Green Infrastructure 
Corridor and within the Rothwell-Wicksteed Park Local Green Infrastructure Corridor (see 
Figure 17). Whilst the site does not include designated wildlife sites, parcel B is within the 
Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area, where the aim is to improve ecological connectivity 
and enlarge biodiversity assets. Adjacent to the site there are several designated wildlife sites 
including Southfield Farm Marsh Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which lies to the north 
east of parcel B and is of national importance for its wet grassland and mire habitats. 
10.79  Adjacent to parcel B there are also several Potential Wildlife Sites (PWS) along the 
River Ise and the brook that forms the southern boundary of the site. The north-east corner 
of parcel B contains a former Local Wildlife Site (Southfield Pasture) of wet grassland which 
may offer potential for habitat re-creation. Directly south of parcel A and west of parcel 
B there is a further PWS at Pytchley Lodge. Other important features include the small 
woodland in the north-west corner of parcel B, hedgerows, trees and water features.
10.80  A strategy will be required as part of the masterplan to deliver a connected and 
accessible green infrastructure network which: 
n Acts as a wildlife corridor. Important habitats and features should be retained, where 
possible, and enhanced. Links to neighbouring wildlife sites, including PWSs, should 
be provided to enhance ecological connectivity. The creation of new habitat along the 
eastern boundary of parcel B could contribute to an enhanced habitat corridor along the 
River Ise. Habitat creation in this area may also serve a dual role by acting as a flood 
attenuation and storage area; 
n Enhances recreational opportunities. Proposals should provide opportunities for 
informal recreation and include footpath and cycleway links that enhance connectivity 
with Kettering, Burton Latimer and the Ise Valley and Rothwell–Wicksteed Park green 
infrastructure corridors; 
n Provides strategic landscaping to enhance the character of the development and minimise 
visual impact on the surrounding area; and 
n Includes sustainable drainage infrastructure to serve the development. 171

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.81  Flood Risk: A significant proportion of parcel B, adjacent to the River Ise, is within 
flood zones 2 and 3. Proposals need to accord with Policy 5 of the Plan relating to flood risk 
management. 
10.82  Archaeology:  Within the site there are areas of potential archaeological interest 
which should be investigated and, where appropriate, should influence the layout of the 
masterplan.
10.83  Noise:  The impact of noise on the development due to the proximity of the site 
to the railway and principal road network will need to be assessed and mitigated, where 
necessary. 
10.84  Minerals:  Much of the site is within a Minerals Safeguarding Area as defined 
in the Northamptonshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan. An assessment will need to be 
undertaken to determine the economic importance of these deposits and the viability of 
prior extraction. 
10.85  Water and Sewerage:  Localised sewerage upgrades may be required depending 
on the nature, size and density of the employment uses proposed. A contribution to a

 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESPOLICY 37  –  LAND AT KETTERING SOUTH
Land at Kettering South, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for employment uses. Whilst Parcels A and B can 
come forward independently, as market demands dictate proposals should be supported by a comprehensive masterplan 
demonstrating how the development of parcels A and B will be coordinated to deliver a mix of employment uses, 
supporting infrastructure and connectivity between the parcels based on the following criteria:
DEVELOPMENT OF PARCEL A 
SHOULD:
a) Provide small employment units primarily 
for B1 (office) and B2 (general industrial) 
uses including the potential for a public 
service hub;
b) Focus built development in the east of 
the parcel close to junction 9 of the A14. 
Proposals should be of a high quality 
of design, providing distinctiveness and 
character at this highly visible gateway 
location;
c) Ensure that proposals incorporate 
sustainability measures such as green 
roofs, renewable energy generation, 
sustainable drainage systems and 
rainwater harvesting;
d) Provide a connected network of 
high quality landscaping and green 
infrastructure to enhance the character of 
the development and to provide amenity 
and ecological benefits. This will include 
strategic landscaping in the west of the 
parcel at the earliest opportunity to 
provide a transition into open countryside 
and reduce the visual impact from 
neighbouring settlements; and
e) Include vehicular access from Isham Road. DEVELOPMENT OF PARCEL B  
SHOULD:
f) Focus on the delivery of B8 (logistics) development and ancillary B1 
(office) and B2 (general industrial) uses;
g) Ensure that development within the site boundary is directed to 
areas of lowest risk of flooding, consistent with the sequential test, 
and that extensive flood mitigation measures are provided to the 
east of the site. Built development on areas of Flood Zones 2 and 3 
will only be acceptable subject to technical modelling and solutions 
being agreed with the Environment Agency, which demonstrate that 
flood risk has been satisfactorily addressed;
h) Be of a high standard of design with buildings arranged to limit the 
visual impact on Isham and designed to incorporate sustainability 
measures such as green roofs, renewable energy generation, 
sustainable drainage systems and rainwater harvesting;
i) Provide a connected network of high quality landscaping which 
minimises visual impact. Proposals should include the delivery of 
strategic landscaping at the southern edge of the development at the 
earliest opportunity to limit the visual impact on Isham;
j) Provide an accessible network of green infrastructure which includes 
opportunities provided by the Ise-Valley corridor to integrate the 
development into the countryside, enhance the character and ecological 
value of the development, including buffering the adjacent Site of Special 
Scientific Interest, and create accessible, usable green space; 
k) Safeguard the route of the Isham bypass and provide vehicular 
access from the A509; and 
l) Include a permeable network of roads and paths.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARCELS A AND B SHOULD TOGETHER:
m) Contribute towards off-site highway works to accommodate traffic arising from the development and ensure that the 
impact on neighbouring settlements is minimised; and
n) Provide strong connectivity to the urban area of Kettering and links to neighbouring settlements and countryside. 
Proposals should include significant walking and cycling infrastructure provision to, and through, the site and an 
improved public transport service.173

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031POLICY 38 – ROTHWELL NORTH SUSTAINABLE URBAN EXTENSION
SITE DESCRIPTION
10.86  The site of the Rothwell North SUE is located on agricultural land measuring 
approximately 33.7 ha to the north of Rothwell.  The site is bounded to the west by the A6, 
to the north by the Rothwell Gullet Local Nature Reserve, and to the south by the existing 
urban area of Rothwell.  The B576 Rothwell to Desborough road divides the SUE into two 
parcels, the largest of which is to the west of the B576.  The site is relatively flat in character, 
before the land falls away northwards to the River Ise and the outskirts of Desborough.
KEY OBJECTIVES
10.87   The site should deliver:
n A Sustainable Urban Extension which provides around 700 dwellings, 3 hectares gross of 
B1 and B2 employment land adjacent to the A6 and a local centre, comprising shops and 
community facilities;
n Development in a number of distinct character areas, responding to the site and its 
context;
n Enhanced and new green infrastructure, with a buffer separating development from the 
Rothwell Gullet Local Nature Reserve;
n Improved connectivity into Rothwell town centre, Desborough and to the wider area, 
safeguarding opportunities for future development to be equally well connected;
n A strategic link road between the A6 and B576, to help relieve congestion in Rothwell 
town centre; and
n Space for the Montsaye Academy to expand.

ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITES10.88  Access arrangements: New junctions should be provided with the A6 and B576 
highways, with a strategic link road (SLR) between the two. The SLR will provide both for the 
movement of vehicles, and a residential street for local access, walking and cycling. Multiple 
pedestrian and cycle links should be provided to link the site with the town, and in particular 
the town centre, as well as the wider area including improved pedestrian and cycle links to 
Desborough.  The creation of the new A6 junction should take place at an early stage in the 
development to prevent traffic congestion on existing routes. 
10.89  Highway capacity: The increase in traffic resulting from the development 
will impact on junction 3 of the A14 and within Rothwell and, as a result, the site should 
contribute to essential highway improvements required, as advised by Highways England and 
NCC Highways.
10.90  Improving connectivity: The development should provide a well-connected grid 
of streets, integrated with the surrounding area to provide strong links to the town centre, 
to the open countryside, and to Desborough and the Ise Valley, particularly for pedestrians 
and cyclists. The development should safeguard opportunities for new connections to 
the Montsaye Academy and to potential future development to the south and to the east 
(including the possibility, in the longer term, for an additional east-west link to the north of 
the town centre).  
10.91  Strategic landscaping and green infrastructure:  The masterplan should ensure 
that substantial new green spaces are strategically planned to deliver multi-functional spaces 
which maximise biodiversity, recreational value and connectivity. The Landscape Strategy 
should make provision for strategic planting and greening at the entire northern edge of the 
development, to prevent visual coalescence with Desborough.
10.92  Biodiversity:  Development should not adversely impact on Rothwell Gullet Local 
Wildlife Site or Rothwell Meadow Local Wildlife Site, both located on the northern boundary 
of the site. The Green Infrastructure provision should include a multi-functional open space 
which acts as a buffer between the development and these Local Wildlife Sites.
10.93  Density:  The development should include a range of residential densities, which 
respond to the nature of the site and its surroundings and create different character areas 
within the development, whilst ensuring the efficient use of land. Development which abuts 
existing residential development should reflect the character of these areas in terms of built 
density and heights.
10.94  Housing mix:  The development should provide a good mix of house types, sizes 
and tenures to meet the needs of all ages and sectors of society, in accordance with Policy 
30 of this Plan and the most up to date Strategic Housing Market Assessment or equivalent 
local needs assessment. Affordable housing should be distributed throughout the site in 
small clusters and will be indistinguishable from other units in quality and appearance.175

JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
SECTION C: DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES FOR STRATEGIC SITESNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203110.95  Public realm improvements:  Rothwell town centre currently suffers from 
congestion with high numbers of vehicles travelling through the town, particularly at peak 
times. The development should contribute towards funding a public realm improvement/ 
traffic calming scheme in Rothwell town centre. This is required to mitigate the impact of 
the development, reducing the dominance of the car and improving the environment for 
pedestrians and cyclists.
10.96  Surface Water Management and Flooding:  Development should ensure that 
there is no detrimental impact on the water quality of existing watercourses, and that the 
development does not lead to flooding within the site or elsewhere. Development proposals 
should be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment and Strategic Surface Water Drainage 
Scheme. The SUE must incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) to manage surface 
water, reduce flood risk and protect water resources and natural habitats.
10.97  Community facilities:  Development should make provision for on-site open space, 
recreation and community facilities and contributions to off-site provision to improve the 
quality and accessibility of open space, green infrastructure, leisure and the wider public realm.
10.98  Schools:  Secondary school provision is located at Montsaye Academy. To 
accommodate planned growth it is necessary to ensure sufficient land is available around the 
school for the provision of outdoor sports facilities and to future-proof the school to ensure 
capacity for any subsequent growth.  The SUE should provide 2.13 ha of land for educational 
purposes at Monsaye Academy and contribute towards the development of existing schools.176

strong links to the town centre, to the open countryside, and to Desborough and the 
Ise Valley, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists;
g) Future potential for new connections to the Montsaye Academy and to potential 
future development to the south and to the east;
h) A contribution to public realm/traffic calming, reducing the amount of through traffic 
in Rothwell Town Centre  and reducing the dominance of the car and improving the 
shopping environment for pedestrians;
i) A range of residential densities to reflect the different character areas within the site 
and the nature of surrounding land-uses;  
j) A sustainable urban drainage system;
k) Physical improvements or financial contributions towards enhancement of the 
existing community centre in Well Lane or new provision of a community centre;
l) Provision of an additional 2.13 hectares of land for educational purposes to the west

SECTION D: MONITORING & IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORKNORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–203111.1  This Plan and the supporting Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) are based on robust 
evidence of the objectively assessed needs for housing, employment and other development 
over the period to 2031 and the required improvements to infrastructure and services. 
The Plan provides a clear framework for development in order that investment and action 
can be co-ordinated and geared to efficient and effective delivery. Its implementation will 
require concerted action by a range of organisations. These include parties from the public 
sector including the Borough and District Councils, Northamptonshire County Council, the 
relevant Local Enterprise Partnerships, departments and agencies of Central Government 
(for example Highways England) in addition to developers and businesses in the private 
sector. It is only by working together in a co-ordinated way that the vision for the area can 
be delivered. 
11.2 The development outlined in this Plan will generate infrastructure requirements 
whilst also increasing pressure on existing infrastructure and services, some of which is 
already at or near to capacity. Ensuring that all new development proposals address their 
impact appropriately and deliver solutions that allow North Northamptonshire to grow in a 
sustainable manner is essential to the proper planning of the area. 
KEY INFRASTRUCTURE 
11.3 The delivery of the spatial strategy will require specific items of infrastructure. 
To identify these requirements the IDP has assessed with stakeholders the quantum and 
distribution of development and identified the infrastructure requirements to ensure the 
needs of development are supported and delivered in a sustainable way.
11.4 The IDP provides information on the strategic and local infrastructure required, 
when it is required, the estimated costs and where the funding may come from and the level 
of funding gap that exists at that time.
11. 5 The Strategic Economic Plans prepared by the LEPs identify the key strategic 
infrastructure projects listed in Table 8 on the next page. These schemes are important  to 
the delivery of the JCS and progress will be monitored as part of the Monitoring Framework. SECTION D  – MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

11.6 Further infrastructure that is required to deliver this Plan is detailed in the IDP 
and covers physical, green and social infrastructure. The nature of infrastructure provision 
and funding will mean that a review of the IDP will be required as part of the Authorities 
Monitoring Report to reflect changes in investment programmes and further evidence base. 
This will also allow for flexibility if some infrastructure is not forthcoming and to consider 
ways that it could be delivered differently or might be mitigated.
MONITORING THE JCS
11.7 Monitoring provides the basis for identifying whether or not the implementation 
of policy is delivering the vision and outcomes of the JCS. The Monitoring Framework set 
out in Table 9 has been developed to record and assess the implementation of JCS policies. 
It uses a series of indicators to show the outputs and wider outcomes of development and 
how the area is changing over the plan period. Responsibility for the monitoring of Part 2 
Local Plans lies with the respective local planning authority.     180
ADOPTED JULY 2016NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031
 SECTION D: MONITORING & IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK11.8 The critical areas of the Plan that will be monitored include:
n The completion of serviced employment floorspace, the creation of jobs and the 
availability of land for employment use in the future;
n Housing completions by location and type and the availability of land for housing in the 
future;
n The delivery of floorspace to support retail, community and healthcare land use;
n The delivery of major infrastructure projects and provision of financial contribution 
towards such schemes;
n The protection, enhancement and creation of assets in the natural environment.
11.9 The Monitoring Framework sets out the performance indicators and targets that 
will form the basis for monitoring the Plan. It provides the following information in respect of 
each of the outcomes in the JCS:
n The indicator – what we are measuring;
n Who is responsible for delivery;
n The target – what is to be achieved and by when;
n The source – i.e. if it is local or national;
n Triggers to establish significant discrepancies between actual policy implementation and 
established policy targets;
n Contingency measures that may be considered if a trigger is identified.
11.10  If monitoring identifies that  a policy is not working, key policy targets are not being 
met or the context has changed (for example the performance and nature of the economy), 
the JPU and partner local planning authorities will take remedial action, which may include:
n Identifying the reasons for under-performance against targets and discussing with 
partners and stakeholders;
n Reviewing the evidence base for availability and deliverability of housing/employment land;
n Working with developers and landowners of existing committed or allocated sites to 
produce a viable and suitable schemes;
n Seeking to identify additional sources of finance or alternative programmes for the 
delivery of infrastructure;
n Discuss with partners and service providers potential solutions to better address issues 
within the design of schemes.
11.11  If these actions fail to re-align delivery of outputs and outcomes then it may be 
necessary to consider a review of targets; consider changes to the allocation of employment/ 
housing land; or consider a review of this Plan, or Part 2  Local Plans. Where necessary to aid 
implementation, Supplementary Planning Documents or further guidance may be produced 
to provide further detail on specific policy areas. 
11.12  The Authorities’ Monitoring Report (AMR) will report annually on the extent to 
which policies set out in the JCS and Part 2 Local Plans are being achieved and targets are 
being met. As well as linking with spatial outcomes and policies, indicators in the AMR also 
link to the Sustainability Appraisal objectives in order to identify the significant effects of 
policy implementation. It will also highlight progress in preparing Part 2 Local Plans against 
the milestones set out in the Local Development Scheme (LDS) and activity in related areas 
such as the implementation of CIL.181

ADOPTED JULY 2016 APPENDIX 2: GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONSAPPENDIX 2  – GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS
DISCLAIMER
The Glossary is a guide to planning terminology used in this 
Plan, where definitions are not provided in the supporting 
text. It is not a statement of policy or  an interpretation of 
the law. Some of the definitions are drawn from the Glossary 
in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).
Accessibility:  The extent to which employment, goods and 
services are made easily available to people, either through 
close proximity, or through providing the required physical links 
to enable people to go to locations where they are available.
Affordable Housing:  This includes social rented, affordable 
rented, and intermediate housing, provided to eligible 
households whose needs are not met by the market. 
Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local 
house prices. Affordable housing should include provisions to 
remain at an affordable price for future eligible households 
or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable 
housing provision. See NPPF definition for further detail.
Allocation:  Land identified in a statutory development plan 
as appropriate for a specific land use.
Ancient Woodlands:  These are defined as areas where 
there is believed to have been continuous woodland 
cover since at least 1600 AD. It can include both ancient 
semi-natural and ancient replanted woodlands. They are 
irreplaceable habitats.
B1 Business Use:  Offices (other than those that fall within 
Use Class A2), research and development, light industry (in 
the Town and Country Planning Use Classes Order 1987 
and its subsequent amendments).
B2 General industrial Use:  Use for the carrying out of an 
industrial process other than one falling in Class B1 (in the 
Town and Country Planning Use Classes Order 1987 and its 
subsequent amendments).
B8 Storage and Distribution:   Use for Storage and 
distribution including wholesale warehouses, distribution 
centres and repositories, (in the Town and Country Planning 
Use Classes Order 1987 and its subsequent amendments). 
This use is often referred to as Logistics .
Biodiversity:  The variety of plants, animals and other living 
things in a particular area or region. It encompasses habitat 
diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity.BREEAM (Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method):  An Environmental 
Assessment Method used to assess the environmental 
performance of both new and existing buildings.
Brownfield Land:  A general term used to describe land 
which has been previously developed or built upon. See 
Previously Developed Land .
Climate Change:  Long term changes in temperature, 
precipitation, wind, and all other aspects of the Earths’ 
climate. 
Comparison Retailing: The provision of items not obtained 
on a frequent basis. These include clothing, footwear, 
household and recreational goods.
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL):  A planning 
charge, introduced by the Planning Act 2008 as a tool for 
local authorities in England and Wales to help deliver 
infrastructure to support the development of their area. 
This allows Local Authorities to raise funds from developers 
undertaking new building projects in their area. 
Community Right to Build Order:  An Order made by 
the local planning authority, under the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990, that grants planning permission for a site-
specific development proposal or classes of development.
Connectivity:  How places are linked with each other and 
how easy they are to move through.
Convenience Retailing:  The provision of everyday essential 
items, including food, drinks, newspapers/magazines and 
confectionary.
D2 Assembly and leisure:  Town and Country Planning 
(Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) includes cinemas, 
music and concert halls, bingo and dance halls (but not night 
clubs), swimming baths, skating rinks, gymnasiums or area 
for indoor or outdoor sports and recreations (except for 
motor sports, or where firearms are used).
Defensible Space:  An environment whose physical 
characteristics allow inhabitants themselves to become 
key agents in ensuring their security. There is a hierarchy 
of space in the built environment ranging from totally public 
through to totally private and defensible space.  Clearly 
defining public and private space, allowing for the functions 
of those spaces, means that the spaces are more secure, 
controlled and understood.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031206
ADOPTED JULY 2016  APPENDIX 2: GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONSDeveloper Contributions:  Contributions made by a 
developer to remedy the impact of development, either by 
paying money for work to be carried out or services to be 
provided, or by directly providing facilities or works either 
on or off-site.
Development Plan Documents (DPDs):  In North 
Northamptonshire, these are Joint Core Strategy and Site 
Specific Plans, which together provide the Local Plans for 
the Districts and Boroughs in North Northamptonshire. 
The Local Plan, together with any Neighbourhood Plans, 
forms the Statutory Development Plan for an area, which is 
the starting point for considering planning applications (see 
Figure 1). 
District Centre:  A centre that provides a broad diversity of 
retail uses and a number of facilities to serve the community, 
such as a group of shops including a supermarket or 
superstore and a range of non-retail services such as banks, 
building societies, and restaurants, as well as local public 
facilities such as a library and healthcare provision.
Ecosystem services:  The benefits people obtain from 
ecosystems such as food, water, flood and disease control 
and recreation (see paragraph 2.51).
Environment Agency:  This is a Public Body that is 
responsible for protecting and improving the environment 
of England and Wales, and for protecting communities from 
the risk of flooding and managing water resources. They are 
consulted throughout the plan making and decision making 
process in order to promote sustainable development.
Evidence Base:  The information and data gathered by local 
authorities to justify the ‘soundness’ of the policy approach 
set out in Local Plans, including physical, economic, and 
social characteristics of an area. It includes consultation 
responses and the finding of technical studies.
Examination:  Once the JCS has been consulted upon, the 
document must be submitted to Government to test its 
soundness. A Planning Inspector leads the Examination and 
carries out the tests of soundness, hearing the issues and 
arguments surrounding the Plan. 
Five Year Housing Supply: The NPPF requires local planning 
authorities to identify and update annually a supply of specific 
deliverable sites sufficient to provide five years’ worth of 
housing against their housing requirements with an additional 
buffer (moved forward from later in the plan period) to ensure 
choice and competition in the market for land.Flood Risk Attenuation:  Measures such as tanks and surface 
ponds that are designed to reduce or prevent water entering 
an area, sewers and rivers during periods of heavy rainfall.
Flood Plain:  Generally low lying areas adjacent to a 
watercourse, where water flows in times of flood or would 
flow but for the presence of flood defences.
Flood Zone 1:  An area with low probability of flooding. 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a less than 1 in 
1000 annual probability of river or sea flooding.
Flood Zone 2: An area with low probability of flooding. 
This zone comprises land assessed as having between a 1 
in 100 and 1 in 1000 annual probability of river flooding or 
between a 1 in 200 and 1 in 1000 annual probability of sea 
flooding.
Flood Zone 3a:  An area with a high probability of flooding. 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or 
greater annual probability of river flooding or a 1 in 200 or 
greater annual probability of flooding from the sea.
Flood Zone 3b: This is an area referred to as the functional 
floodplain. This zone comprises land where water has to 
flow or be stored in times of flood.

produced by each Council and sets out the key housing 
priorities that the individual Council feels needs to 
be addressed in order to meet the housing needs and 
aspirations of the local population.
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP):  The IDP identifies the 
necessary social, physical and green infrastructure required 
to support the new development proposed in the Joint 
Core Strategy for North Northamptonshire up 2031. The 
document will be subject to monitoring and regular review.
Lifetime Homes: The Lifetime Homes standard is a 
set of 16 design criteria that provide a model for building 
accessible and adaptable homes. Following a review of 
housing standards, the Government intends to incorporate 
revised accessibility standards into the Building regulations 
(see paragraph 9.45 – 9.46).Listed Buildings:  Buildings of special architectural or 
historic interest. Listed buildings are graded 1, 2 or 2* with 
grade 1 being the highest. English Heritage is responsible for

local area, drawn up by the local planning authority in 
consultation with the community. In law this is described 
as the Development Plan Documents adopted under the 
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. 
Local Strategic Partnership:  This is a partnership 
that brings together organisations from public, private, 
community and voluntary sector in a local authority area, so 
that different initiatives and services support each other and 
work together. The partnership is responsible for producing 
a Sustainable Community Strategy/Vision, setting out their 
local priorities and the key actions that may need to be taken 
to achieve these, in order to enhance the social, economic

designated by Member States for birds, and Special Areas for 
Conservation (SACs), for species and habitats. See Habitat 
Regulations Assessment/Appropriate Assessment .
Natural Surveillance:  The placement of physical features, 
activities, and people in a way that maximises visibility. It allows 
people to overlook and watch public or semi-public spaces 
either from surrounding buildings/ areas or by having enough 
people in them. This involves ensuring that public spaces 
are open and well lit, are overlooked by active windows and 
doors, and have a diversity of uses to ensure they are busy.
Nature Improvement Area (NIA): An inter-connected 
network of wildlife habitats intended to to re-establish 
thriving wildlife populations and help species respond to 
the challenges of climate change. The Nene Valley NIA 
designated by the Government in 2012 (see paragraph 2.17).
Neighbourhood Plans: A plan prepared by a parish council 
or Neighbourhood Forum for a particular neighbourhood 
area, made under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase 
Act 2004.Non B Employment Uses: Uses falling outside Class B of 
the Town and Country Planning Use Classes Order 1987 
and its subsequent amendments. Such uses include retail,

Planning Obligation:  A legally enforceable obligation entered 
into under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990 to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal.
Previously Developed Land (PDL):  The NPPF defines 
PDL as land which is or was occupied by a permanent 
structure, including the curtilage of the developed land 
(although it should not be assumed that the whole of the 
curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed 
surface infrastructure. This excludes: land that is or has 
been occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings; land 
that has been developed for minerals extraction or waste 
disposal by landfill purposes where provision for restoration 
has been made through development control procedures; 
land in built-up areas such as private residential gardens, 
parks, recreation grounds and allotments; and land that 
was previously-developed but where the remains of the 
permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended 
into the landscape in the process. PDL is still commonly 
referred to as brownfield land.
Primary Shopping Area:  Defined area where retail 
development is concentrated (generally comprising the 
primary and those secondary frontages which are adjoining 
and closely related to the primary shopping frontages).

ADOPTED JULY 2016 APPENDIX 2: GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONSRenewable and Low Carbon Energy: This includes 
energy for heating and cooling as well as generating 
electricity. Renewable energy covers those energy flows 
that occur naturally and repeatedly in the environment-from 
the wind, the fall of water, the movement of the oceans, 
from the sun and also from biomass and deep geothermal 
heat. Low carbon technologies are those that can help 
reduce emissions, as compared to the conventional use of 
fossil fuels.
River Nene Regional Park (RNRP):  An independent 
community interest company creating a green infrastructure 
network of environmental projects along the River Nene.
Rural Exception Sites:   Small sites used for affordable 
housing in perpetuity where sites would not normally be 
used for housing. Rural exception sites seek to address 
the needs of the local community by accommodating 
households who are either current residents or have an 
existing family or employment connection. Small numbers of 
market homes may be allowed at the discretion of the local 
planning authority, for example where essential to enable 
the delivery of affordable units without grant funding.
Section 106 Agreement/Contribution:  Refers to Section 
106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and is a 
legally-binding agreement or planning obligation with a 
landowner in association with the granting of planning 
permission.  These agreements are a way of delivering 
or addressing matters that are necessary to make a 
development acceptable in planning terms. 
Sequential Test:  In the context of flood risk, it is a 
test to help steer new development to areas with the 
lowest probability of flooding. In the context of proposed 
development, the NPPF requires  local planning authorities 
to apply a sequential test to planning applications for main 
town centre uses that are not in an existing centre and are 
not in accordance with an up to date Local Plan.
Site of Specific Scientific Interest (SSSI):  A site or area 
designated as being important due to its wildlife plants or 
flowers and/or unusual or typical geological features. SSSIs 
are identified by Natural England and have protected status 
under Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. 
Soundness (tests of): Criteria which the Core Strategy 
must meet if it is to be found sound by the Planning 
Inspectorate (see paragraph 1.20).Spatial Planning:  Spatial planning goes beyond older style 
traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate 
policies for the development and use of land with other 
policies and programmes which influence the nature of 
places and how they function.
Special Protection Area (SPA):  Areas which have been 
identified as being of international importance for the 
breeding, feeding, wintering or the migration of rare and 
vulnerable species of birds found within European Union 
countries. They are European designated sites, classified 
under the Birds Directive.
South East Midlands Local Economic Partnership 
(SEMLEP): see Local Enterprise Partnership .
Strategic Economic Plans:  These are investment and 
growth strategies produced by the LEPs operating in this 
area, that is, the NEP and the SEMLEP.
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA):  Assessment 
of all forms of flood risk from groundwater, surface water, 
impounded water bodies, sewer, river and tidal sources, 
taking into account future climate change predictions. This 
allows local planning authorities to use this information to 
locate future development primarily in low flood risk areas 
(Level 1 SFRA).
For areas that have a higher risk of flooding, the SFRA 
examines the capacity of the existing flood prevention 
infrastructure (i.e. drainage) and identifies all the measures 
that any potential development may need to take to ensure 
that it will be safe and will not increase flood risk to third 
parties (Level 2 SFRA).
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
(SHLAA):  A technical study which assesses the amount and 
nature of land which could be made available for housing 
development.  It is part of the evidence base that will inform 
the plan making process.
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA): A 
technical study which assesses housing need and demand 
across a defined market area and which is used to inform 
housing and planning policies. In this case, the defined 
market area is the North Northamptonshire Housing 
Market Area (HMA). 
Strategic Sites: For the purpose of this Plan, these are 
defined as 500+ dwellings or 5ha+ of employment land.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  
JOINT CORE STRATEGY 2011–2031210
ADOPTED JULY 2016  APPENDIX 2: GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONSSubmission:  Once the JCS has been the subject of final 
consultation, it must be submitted to Government so that 
it can be tested for soundness. See Examination . The Pre-
Submission version of the JCS is effectively a draft of what 
the submitted document will look like.
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD):  Documents 
which add further detail to the policies in the Local 
Plan. They can be used to provide further guidance for 
development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such 
as design. Supplementary planning documents are capable 
of being a material consideration.
Sustainability Appraisal (SA): This examines the impacts 
of the JCS strategies/policies against a large number of 
economic, social and environmental sustainability objectives. 
It also provides an indication of what measures may need 
to be taken to minimise/eliminate any adverse impacts 
and promote sustainable development. The Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act requires an SA to be undertaken 
for all Development Plan Documents/Local Plans throughout 
the plan making process.
Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS): This sets 
the overall strategic direction and long-term vision for the 
economic, social and environmental wellbeing of a local 
area – typically 10 to 20 years – in a way that contributes to 
sustainable development in the UK. It is prepared by a Local 
Strategic Partnership (LSP), which is made up of public, 
private and voluntary sector organisations. It identifies the 
key long terms priorities for the area and how the LSP could 
work together to address these.
Sustainable Development:  At the heart of sustainable 
development is the idea of ensuring a better quality of life 
for everyone, now and for future generations A widely 
used definition was drawn up by the World Commission on 
Environment and Development in 1987 which stated that it 
was… “Development which meets the needs of the present, 
without compromising the ability of future generations to 
meet their own needs”.
Sustainable Transport Modes:  Any efficient, safe and 
accessible means of transport with overall low impact on the 
environment, including walking and cycling, low and ultra- 
low emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport.Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS):  These are 
designed to manage excess rainwater where it falls rather 
than the traditional approach of channeling it through drains. 
Examples include ponds, reed beds, drainage channels and 
porous driveways.
Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs):   Substantial mixed 
use developments including employment, local facilities and 
at least 500 new homes, which provide  well planned and 
managed new neighbourhoods that integrate physically and 
socially with the existing towns. Principal SUEs are those 
that include between 2,500 and 5,500 dwellings. 
Town Centre: Area defined on the local authority’s 
proposal map, including the primary shopping area and areas 
predominantly occupied by main town centre uses within or 
adjacent to the primary shopping area. 
Urban Structure Study (USS): An analysis of the form 
and function of the framework of streets and open spaces in 
the 12 towns in North Northamptonshire. This has informed 
the policies of the JCS and will form the basis of a North 
Northamptonshire place Shaping SPD.
Windfall Sites:  Sites which have not been specifically 
identified as available in the Local Plan process. They 
normally comprise previously developed sites that have 
unexpectedly become available.NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE

ADOPTED JULY 2016 APPENDIX 4: THE ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING LAND SUPPLY RELATIVE  
TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF JOINT CORE STRATEGY POLICY 28APPENDIX 4 – THE ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING LAND SUPPLY RELATIVE 
TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF JOINT CORE STRATEGY POLICY 28
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 
requires all local authorities to identify and update annually 
a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide five 
years’ worth of housing against their housing requirements, 
with an additional buffer of either 5% or 20% depending on 
the record of delivery.
1.2 This Appendix sets out a forward-looking 
assessment of housing land supply for each of the districts 
and boroughs from April 2016. This assessment is made 
against the housing requirements established in Policy 28 
of the JCS, using the ‘Sedgefield’ approach to any historic 
under-provision. These assessments are made relative to 
both 5% and 20% buffers for completeness (pursuant to 
NPPF para 47).
1.3 The assessment of sources of supply for each 
district/borough uses information compiled for the 2014/15 
Authorities’ Monitoring Report (AMR) (see EXAM 7 - 
Assessment of Housing Land Supply 2016-2021).  The 
projected housing supply for the North Northamptonshire 
Housing Market Area as a whole is presented at Annex A. 
1.4 The housing land supply position is kept under 
review by the local planning authorities to inform 
consideration of planning applications, and will be updated 
annually through the Authorities’ Monitoring Report (AMR) 
prepared by the JPU.2. CORBY BOROUGH COUNCIL:
