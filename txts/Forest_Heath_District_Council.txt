31. Introduction
1.1 The Core Strategy was adopted in 2010. This Single Issue Review (SIR) of Core 
Strategy Policy CS7 was prompted by a successful High Court challenge. This 
resulted in the majority of Policy CS7 and elements of CS1, CS13 and para  
3.12.2 being revoked from the Adopted Core Strategy. Appendix A  lists those 
parts of Policy CS7 which were quashed, and the consequential amendments to 
Policies CS1 and CS13. The SIR will replace Core Strategy Policy CS7 in its 
entirety and as such no chan ges to Policies CS1, CS13 or paragraph 3.12.1 are 
required.  
2. Changes to the Core Strategy
2.1 This section sets out the specific changes to the adopted Core Strategy 
(2010) Policy CS7 and supporting text. It should be read in conjunction 
with the adopted Core  Strategy.

3.6 Housing Provision and distribution  
Undertaking an objective assessment of local housing needs  
3.6.1 National policy and guidance makes it clear that local planning authorities 
should undertake t heir own assessment of their housing needs and set an 
appropriate housing provision target to meet these needs. The NPPF obliges the 
local planning authority to set this target through a collaborative approach, and 
imposes a duty to cooperate with other au thorities.  
Housing Requirement  
3.6.2 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) prepared in January  2016, 
indicated an objectively assessed need (OAN) for 340 dwellings per annum for 
Forest Heath in the period 2011 to 2031, or 6800 homes in total.  
3.6.3 In August 2016 an update was prepared by the Cambridgeshire Research 
Group (and endorsed by Peter Brett Associates ) to support Forest Heath 
District Council in objectively assessing and evidencing development 
needs for market and affordable housing. Taking account of the latest 
available evidence, the identified future quantity of housing needed 
remains at 6800 homes over the period 2011 -2031, or 340 homes a  year. 
Housing provision: homes already built and additional homes required  
3.6.4 Housing co mpletions from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2017 total 1655 
dwellings. Sites with planning permission at 31 March 2017 total 1523 
dwellings. Taking account of what has already been built or planned for 
shows that the number we need to plan for is lower than th e overall OAN 
of 6800 dwellings. This is shown in Table 1 below:

3.6.5 It is also important to note that further housing will also come from 
unallocated sites, known as ‘windfalls’. These are developments that are 
not formally allocated, but which comply with national and local planning 
policies, for example: redevelopment of sites and buildings, new uses for 
buildings, and developing sites that contain fewer than 10 units, including 
infill plots in the towns, key service centres, and primary and secondary  
villages.  
Housing distribution  
3.3.6 As the most sustainable places in the district to live it is intended that our 
towns, key service centres and primary villages should continue to fulfil  
their roles meeting local need, and supporting rural sustainability  in 
accordance with Core Strategy Policy CS1, and the  NPPF.  
3.6.7 The key issues taken into account in identifying a suitable distribution 
strategy for the district included evidence  of: 
the need for the distribution of growth to accord with national
and local policy, in particular the spatial  strategy  set out within
Core Strategy Policy  CS1;
the high number of environmental constraints in the district, and the
need to accord with Policy C S2 and other primary legislation in respect
of landscape, biodiversity and geodiversity  interests;
the availability of suitable sites in the council’s Strategic Housing
Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) to meet the  distribution;
outcomes of and recommen dations made by the SIR Sustainability
Appraisal and Habitats Regulations  Assessments;
known infrastructure constraints, issues and  opportunities;
the consultation comments received to earlier consultations on the
Single Issue  Review;
ongoing discussions with statutory consultees including Natural
England, The Environment Agency, Anglian Water, Historic England,
Suffolk County Council and neighbouring  authorities.
3.6.8 Specific constraints and opportunities have influenced the housing 
distribution in eac h settlement. Opportunities and constraints on 
development are identified and detailed for each of the towns, key service 
centres and primary villages in the Site Allocations Local Plan.

which will include a review of the spatial strategy, including settlement 
boundaries, to take account of any change in circumstances.
