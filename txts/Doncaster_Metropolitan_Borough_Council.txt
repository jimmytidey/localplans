 
 Document Summary . 
 
Purpose  The Local Plan sets out policies and proposals to meet Doncaster’s needs for housing, 
employment and other development: how much is required, where it should go and 
when it should happen.  Together with the Government’s National Planning Policy 
Framework1 (NPPF), the Plan aims to deliver positive sustainable economic, social 
and environmental development.  Planning law  requires that applic ations for planning 
permission must be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless 
material considerations, such as the NPPF, indicate otherwise.  Doncaster’s 
Development Plan will include this Local Plan, the adopted Barnsley, Doncaster and 
Rotherham Joint Waste Plan and any made Neighbourhood Plans prepared by local 
communities.  
Plan Period  2015 -2035  
Base Date  1 April 2015   (This is the date the Plan Period started – but some of the information in 
the Local Plan for land requirement and supply (e.g. planning permissions) is as at 1 
April 2018).  
Settlement 
Hierarchy  Growth distributed and managed according to a 6 Level Settlement Hierarchy:  
 Doncaster Main Urban Area  
 10 Service Towns & Larger Villages  
 Countryside   7 Main Towns  
 40 Define d Villages  
 Green Belt   
Key 
Proposals  The key proposals in this Plan include:  
 Major new employment sites (total of 470 Hectares) to support ‘Doncaster Main 
Urban Area’ and 7 Main Towns; but also at locations attractive to the market 
associated with the St rategic Transport Network.  
 Ensuring the maintenance of a rolling 5 year supply of deliverable housing land.  
 At least 45% of new homes to go to the ‘Doncaster Main Urban Area’, about 40% 
to the ‘Main Towns’ and approx. 15% to the ‘Service Towns and Villages ’. 
 A minimum of 15,640 net  new homes over the remainder of the P lan Period  (920 
per year ) from 1 April 2018 . 
 Doncaster  Town Centre to be main focus for most retail, offices, leisure, cultural 
and tourist facilities.  
 Flood sequential approach directing deve lopment not meeting local needs away 
from flood zones.  
 General extent of Green Belt will be maintained.  
 Major multi -modal transport hub centred on “Rossington iPort” and business parks 
between the M18 motorway and Doncaster Sheffield Airport.  
 Unity (major mixed -use urban extension between Hatfield & Stainforth).  
 Supporting the sustainable growth of Doncaster Sheffield Airport .

 Foreword  
 
This is Doncaster's Local Plan.  I welcome its adoption and the role it will play in guiding the 
future of our communities by setting out what development is needed, how much is required, 
where it should go, and when it should happ en.  
 
The Local Plan is based on the need to ensure sustainable development.   
 
It supports Doncaster's economic development by helping to meet the need for development 
within our Town and Borough .  In doing so, it seeks to ensure that new development, and  the 
necessary supporting infrastructure, such as open space, health facilities and schools, are 
improved and/ or delivered together.   
 
Doncaster has declared a Climate and Biodiversity Emergency in recognition of the 
fundamental challenges of Climate Cha nge and the need for sustainability.  The Local Plan will 
help tackle climate change and ensure that efforts to create a stronger economy do so in a way 
that supports a sustainable natural and built environment, and which delivers a better quality of 
life for residents and for future generations.  
 
Difficult decisions have been taken as part of the preparation of the Plan and I would like to 
thank everyone involved.  I wish to give special thanks to those who responded to the various 
consultations that have  taken place – these contributions have been invaluable.

  Chapter 1: Introduction  
 
What is the Doncaster Local Plan?  
1.1. Doncaster ’s Local Plan sets out how Doncaster B orough will grow and develop from 2015 to  
2035 .  It identif ies where and how new jobs, homes and services will be located ; its p olicies 
guide investment and development , encourag e sustainable and inclusive economic growth , 
protect the environment  and promote social inclusion . 
 
1.2. The Local Plan forms a key part of th e statutory “development plan ” and informs decisions on 
planning applications.  It is a matter of planning law that “ planning decisions must be taken in 
accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise ”. 
 
1.3. The Local Pla n has been positively prepared informed by public consultation and engagement  
and is based on cooperation with neighbouring authorities and public, voluntary and private 
sector organisations .   Doncaster is a key player within the Sheffield City Region and  is working 
closely with its partner authorities as part of the Combined Authority to deliver growth and 
regeneration across the city region .  Discussions have not identified housing or other needs that 
would be more appropriately shared with other local authorit ies – the Borough’s development 
and infrastructure needs have been objectively assessed and will be met entirely within the 
Borough . 
 
1.4. The Local Plan accords with national policy and will promote  sustainable development in 
accordance with the Governm ent’s National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) .  It is based on 
an up -to-date and proportionate evidence base that demonstrates, amongst other things, that its 
proposals can be deliver ed within the plan period.    
What does the Local Plan consist of?  
1.5. The L ocal Plan sets out a vision  for the Borough and objectives  for meeting strategic priorities .  
It identifies specific sites for development ( development allocations ) and includes planning 
policies  to ensure that the necessary new homes , jobs, shops, leisure and other development  
are of the right type and quality and are delivered in the right places.  Policies also address new 
infrastructure, minerals, energy, health and other community infra structure, climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, and conservation and enhancement of the natural and built 
environment.   Some of the policies are (or will be) supported by  Supplementary Planning 
Documents  (SPDs) which set out more detailed advice.  
 
1.6. A Key Diagram  identifies t he broad locations where growth will occur and illustrates the key 
elements of the Local Plan.  This is accompanied  by a Policie s Map showing the location of 
allocated development sites for h ousing, employment and other uses.  
 
1.7. Land use designations  are also shown on the Policies Map includ ing Green Belt, green space, 
policy areas for residential, industrial and business uses, retail centres, mixed use areas, 
community services and facilities a nd known environmental designations (such as nature 
conservation and historic sites).  
 
1.8. The Council will maintain and make available, via the Council’s web page, an up to date 
electronic version of the Policies  Map.  This will enable individual allocations and designations 
to be viewed independently or collectively.  
How does the Local Plan relate to other plans and strategies?  
1.9. The Local Plan provides the spatial dimension for the Doncaster Growing Together’ (DGT) 
Borough Strategy  that was agreed by the Counc il and its partners ( Team Doncaster ) in 
September 2017.  Achieving inclusive growth is a fundamental priority in the Borough Strategy 
and Doncaster’s Inclusive Growth  Strategy (IGS), sharpens the focus on this priority.  
 2   [go to Contents ] 
   
 
1.10.  The Local Plan replace s the Core Strategy and the saved polic ies of the Unitary Development 
Plan.  The Joint Waste Plan (adopted jointly with Barnsley and Rotherham Councils) will be 
reviewed sep arately.  
Neighbourhood plans  will be prepared for some parts of the Borough by Parish and Town Councils 
(and other neighbourhood planning bodies in areas where local councils do not exist).  They will sit 
alongside the Local Plan forming part of the Develo pment Plan.  
 
The Council will continue to actively support2 neighbourhood  planning bodies to ensure local 
communities have a greater influence in the planning of their areas .  Neighbourhood plans may 
contain development allocations and non -strategic policies but must be in general conformity with the 
strategic policies  of this Local Plan – these strategic policies are highlighted in the Plan.  Once a 
neighbourhood plan has be en ‘made’ (adopted), the policies it contains take precedence over existing 
non-strategic policies in the Local Plan for that neighbourhood where they are in conflict.  The Local 
Plan’s Policies Map will be updated where necessary when new neighbourhood pl ans are made.  
 
Where neighbourhood plans have already been made, or are sufficiently advanced, the Local Plan 
has not duplicated their provisions.  This is reflected on the Policies Map.  
 
Looking further ahead  
1.11.  Following Local Plan adoption, e conomic, socia l and environmental issues  will continue to be 
monitored and evidence update d.  Th ese will inform the statutory need to consider whether to 
review the Plan (in whole or part) at least every five years.  Emerging issues and opportunities 
that may inform Local Plan review could include:   
 
 Major changes in how we live, work and how businesses trade are reshaping our economy 
and transforming communities.  A technological revolution is underway making it easier to 
access services, support greener travel and enab le firms to remain competitive in a global 
economy.  Doncaster can seize the opportunities this present s by, for example , supporting 
growth in industries that can provide higher -skilled, more productive and better paid jobs.  
 
 Doncaster has a wide portfolio  of development projects, either on -going or in the pipeline , 
and is emerging as an important player in the ‘Northern Powerhouse’, the Government’s 
strategy to rejuvenate the north of England.  Ambitious plans include: further delivery of the 
Urban Centre Master Plan, including investing in quality office, student and residential 
accommodation; University City, an over -arching ambition for the future of higher education 
in Doncaster; airport growth, including more quality businesses and jobs securing a link  to 
                                                           
2 See the Council’s website for information on the support available : 
http://www.doncas ter.gov.uk/services/planning/neighbourhood -plans  The ‘Doncaster Growing Together’ (DGT) Borough Strategy is 
Doncaster’s key strategic document . 
 
Ambitions to prepare children and young peop le for a fulfilling 
life, create a stronger economy that benefits everyone and a 
borough that cares together for the most vulnerable, sit 
alongside ensuring Doncaster is vibrant and safe with clean 
and accessible parks and green spaces . 
 
To achieve this, t he strategy aims to maximise the benefit from 
Doncaster’s assets and opportunities whilst addressing its 
challenges.   
3   [go to Contents ] 
  the East Coast Main Line; new or improved transport routes that would  improve access to 
northern Doncaster; and the large -scale mixed -use Unity project (junction 5, M18).  
 
 The increasing number of neighbourhood plans could gradually replace some of the  non-
strategic policies of the Local Plan.  National planning policy continues to evolve in response 
to climate change and the growing and changing needs of the population and economy.  
 
 A Yorkshire -wide Devolution Deal would provide Doncaster with the oppo rtunity to play a 
significant role in increasing Yorkshire’s contribution to improving productivity, rebalancing 
the national economy and spreading wealth and prosperity.   It would provide resources and 
powers to support jobs and growth  by, for example , building new infrastructure.  
 
 The Government is promoting the construction of a completely new high speed railway from 
London to Birmingham and then onward via a western leg to Manchester and an eastern leg 
to Leeds passing through Doncaster Borough.  The pr oposed route of th e High Speed 2 rail 
line is shown on the Policies  Map.  This route is subject to a ‘Safeguarding Direction ’ made 
by the Secretary of State for Transport to protect the line of the route from conflicting 
developments.  These are not Counci l proposals and the route will not be determined 
through the Local Plan.  They will be considered in Parliament under hybrid Bill procedures, 
which will provide opportunities for petitions to be made to parliament by those directly 
affected by the scheme.  Construction is currently intended to begin within the Local Plan 
period, with the route potentially opening around 2032 -33. 
 
 Improved understanding of residual flood risk to the Borough, especially at the Main Town of 
Thorne -Moorends, following completio n of Hydraulic Modelling being finalised by the 
Environment Agency  at time of Plan preparation .  The lack of detailed modelling available 
prior to adoption of this version of the Local Plan limited the Plan’s local flood risk evidence 
base  at that point . 
 
 The Plan has been drafted in the uncertain climate following the Brexit  referendum in 2016.  
Brexit has posed a number of challenges in undertaking forecasting of economic growth and 
there are hugely opposing views on what the impacts will be on economic g rowth, trade and 
investment decisions at the natio nal, regional and local levels.  
Sustainability Appraisal  
1.12.  The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to achiev ing sustainable development.  The 
Local Plan has been subject to Sustainability Appraisa l throughout its preparation  to assist in 
achieving the preservation, protection and improvement of the environmental, social and 
economic state of the Borough.  The appraisal has met the requirements of Strategic 
Environmental Assessment (SEA).  
 
1.13.  The Sust ainability Appraisal Report sets out issues that impact o n sustainability, sets out the 
effects of “reasonable” alternatives to the Plan’s strategy and proposals, the reasons for 
discounting alternatives, and the likely significant effects of the Plan’s preferred sites and 
policies.  The Report outlines mitigation which has been incorporated into the Plan to avoid, 
minimise and compensate for negative effects and maximise positive effects .  It also proposes 
monitoring so that the effects of the Plan can be tracked and any unforeseen effects addressed.  
  4   [go to Contents ] 
  How to use the Local Plan  
1.14.  All the policies in the Local Plan should be read together - individual policies do not 
necessarily refer to other relevant policies . 
 
1.15.  Policies  should also be read in conjunction wit h other parts of the Development Plan  (including

  Chapter 2: About Doncaster  
 
2.1. This chapter provides a portrait of the Borough as it is now and outlines the issues an d 
challenges it faces in the future . 
Doncaster – the location  
2.2. Doncaster is a metropolitan borough and is located in the heart of England in the county of 
South Yorkshire and the Yorkshire and Humber region, some 20 miles from Sheffield, 26 miles 
from Leed s, 30 miles from York and 47 miles from Hull (see  Figur e 1).  The Borough lies to the 
south of Wakefield, Selby and East Riding, east of Rotherham , Barnsley and Sheffield and north 
and west of the rural districts of Bassetlaw  and North Lincolnshire.  
 
2.3. The town of Doncaster sits in the centre of the Borough on the river Don, with dispersed former 
mining settlements (Mexborough, Denaby and Conisbrough  to the west, Stainforth to the east, 
Adwick and Carcroft to the north and Rossington to the south) and large tracks of open 
countryside surrounding it.  There are a number of historic market towns (e.g. Thorne, Tickhill 
and Bawtry) , commuter villages (e.g. Auckley and Finningley) and hamlets  that serve the wider 
rural hinter land.  
 
2.4. Doncaster is one of nine local authorities that make up the Sheffield City Region along with 
Barnsley, Bassetlaw, Bolsover, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, North East Derbyshire, 
Rotherham and Sheffield.  
Doncaster – the place  
2.5. Doncaster (whose origin s date back to Roman times) has evolved over the centuries from a 
market town into a major industrial centre, centred on engineering, coal and manufacturing, 
largely resulting from the expansion of trading routes and services (e.g. railways, canals and 
roads) and its location on the main north -to-south route, from London to Scotland.  Surrounding 
towns, such as Bawtry, Thorne, Tickhill, Mexborough and Conisbrough, have traditionally acted 
as the main trading centres serving the surrounding rural hinterland.   
 
2.6. The Borough of Doncaster covers 226 square miles and is the largest metropolitan borough in 
England. Much of the Borough is rural in nature and includes areas of attractive landscape and 
features, such as limestone gorges, woodlands, country parks and l owland moorland.  Over two 
thirds of the Borough is in agricultural use, mainly in the eastern parts.  Green Belt covers the 
western half of the Borough .  
 
2.7. Doncaster is the second largest settlement in the City Region (after Sheffield) and is the main 
admi nistrative, commercial and educational centre in the Borough .  
 
2.8. Doncaster has over 300,000 inhabitants.  Doncaster’s State of the Borough assessment shows 
that l ike many other areas, Doncaster’s population is getting bigger, older and more diverse.   
Doncas ter’s working age population is expected to decline at a faster rate than the national 
average which has implications for Doncaster’s economic activity rates.  7   [go to Contents ]

  Doncaster - assets and future opport unities  
2.9. Doncaster is undergoing significant change and transformation in response to technology 
advances, economic restructuring, changing lifestyles and climate change, and is reasserting 
itself as a major economic centre within northern England.  Much h as been achieved in recent 
times through concerted efforts of our partners to increase prosperity and enhance the lives of 
those who live and work in the Borough but the agenda remains unfinished.  
 
2.10.  Considerable investment has been made in new infrastructur e and environmental 
improvements (including public transport links, roads, tourist attractions and an international 
airport) and more is planned.  
 
2.11.  Doncaster’s economy is the second largest in the City Region and the seventh  largest in the 
Yorkshire and Hum ber region in terms of the value of its goods and services.  Doncaster 
continues its transition from a traditional industrial base to embrace a broader mix of business 
sectors, such as logistics, finance and professional services, retail, construction , adv anced  
engineering and tourism.  
 
2.12.  Doncaster’s strategic position at the heart of the UK's communication network offers excellent 
access to major conurbations, coastal ports and other parts of the UK and beyond, linking east 
to west and north to south.   Over 6 million people live within a 45 -minute drive of the Borough . 
The Borough is well served across all regions via:  
 
 air (Doncaster Sheffield Airport is located some 5 miles from the centre of Doncaster and 
offers flights to destinations across Europe and  the UK);  
 road and motorways (A1(M), M18 and M180), with links to the M1 and M62 motorways 
and major A roads, such as the A18, A638 and A630 – among the most busiest parts of 
the region’s network;  
 rail (e.g. Doncaster train station lies on the East Coast M ainline – which provides fast 
direct trains between London and Edinburgh  – and serves the largest number of rail 
operators in the UK);  
 waterways (e.g. the South Yorkshire Canal runs through the centre of the Borough and 
the Stainforth -Keadby Canal passes c lose to the centre of Thorne and Stainforth); and  
 ports (with excellent links to the M1 and M62 motorways and international  ports, 
particularly the Humber ports).  
 
2.13.  Although a metropolitan borough, Doncaster is largely rural and contains a wide variety of o pen 
spaces , such as parks, woodland sites, golf courses, allotments, playing fields, green corridors 
and natural habitats.  Many of these assets are linked via an extensive network of rivers (e.g. 
Don and Dearne), canals and other waterways, which extend w ell beyond the limits of the 
Borough . Other significant assets include:  
 
 over 300 miles of public  rights -of-way (footpaths, bridleways and tracks);  
 a mixture of habitats such as wet grassland, crags, caves, lakes and lowland raised mire;  
 sites of nationa l and international importance including sites of special scientific interest 
(e.g. Potteric Carr nature reserve) and special protection areas (Thorne and Hatfield 
Moors); and  
 large ground water aquifers (Sherwood Sandstone and Magnesium Limestone).  
 
2.14.  Doncaster town centre is a major sub -regional centre with a large retail offer.  Mexborough and 
Thorne are the largest centres outside of Doncaster and provide a wide range of services (e.g. 
shops, banks, building societies, libraries and restaurants ) serving  a wide catchment area.  The 
other centres (e.g. Bawtry, Armthorpe and Askern) within the Borough serve more day -to-day 
needs.  
 
2.15.  Doncaster is a major producer of minerals such as sand and gravel, coal and limestone, all of 
which have been worked over many y ears.  Natural gas, clay, coalmine methane and oil are 9   [go to Contents ] 
  also exploited.  
 
2.16.  Doncaster, one of Britain’s oldest boroughs, has a rich and diverse built environment.   Some of 
its distinctive townscape and heritage assets include:  
 
 conservation areas ranging from  Georgian and Victorian residential areas and historic 
town cores through to dispersed rural villages and towns such as Bawtry, Hatfield and 
Tickhill;  
 planned colliery villages (e.g. Brodsworth and Woodlands);  
 a nationally renowned racecourse;  
 archaeologic al sites, including a late Iron Age enclosure and Roman remains (e.g. Ermine 
Street);  
 a wealth of historic buildings, including medieval churches, former Georgian merchant 
houses and a Norman castle (Conisborough); and  
 nationally important historic parks and gardens (e.g. Brodsworth and Cusworth country 
parks).  
 
2.17.  The Trans -Pennine Trail passes through Doncaster and is integral to the extensive footpath and 
cycle network that link the Borough’s communities with the countryside, jobs and recreation 
opportunit ies.  Doncaster has many other recreation, tourism and retail opportunities, including 
Doncaster Dome and the Lakeside Sports Complex (major sporting and entertainment venues), 
Doncaster Rovers Football Club, Doncaster Rugby League Club (The Dons), Doncast er Knights 
Rugby Union Club, Doncaster Rovers Belles Women’s Football Club and many well established 
athletics clubs. 
Doncaster - the challenges  
2.18.  Over recent years Doncaster businesses have led significant jobs growth which has been 
combined with record lev els of business investment and house building.  Employment levels 
have hit record highs, however Doncaster has a relatively low proportion of people employed in 
highly skilled occupations and wage rates are significantly lower than the national average.  T he  
benefits of growth are not yet reaching all people and places.  Levels of unemployment and 
deprivation vary significantly across the Borough and there is still an overall need for economic 
regeneration across the Borough , balanced with the need to ensu re the town centre is a greater 
driver for growth.   The local economy is still underperforming compared with the regional and 
national averages in terms of business stock, the proportion of jobs in the knowledge economy 
and productivity per hour worked.  D oncaster’s economy is relatively reliant on lower skilled 
sectors that are more sensitive to changes in local demand (e.g. local spending in the retail 
sector).  Building an economy with a sectoral mix that contains a higher proportion of high value 
activi ties and jobs is a  key challenge .  Compared to Yorkshire and Humber, our economy is 
relatively inward facing and more reliant on jobs in health, retail, transport, construction and 
public administration.   However, it does have s ignificant jobs in a number  of tradeable sectors, 
for example , manufacturing, engineering and financial and professional services.  Overall, 
Doncaster’s economy remains relatively more sensitive to the impact of economic downturns.  
 
2.19.  Doncaster’s town and district centres face signif icant competition from established out -of-centre 
locations (e.g. retail warehouse parks and large superstores) and on -line shopping.  However, 
the town centre is also relatively over reliant on retail and has considerably less office 
accommodation.  Having  fewer office workers in the town centre reduces the support available 
for retail which is already under pressure from on -line shopping.  
 
2.20.  Doncaster’s population distribution, which is rooted in Doncaster’s industrial past presents a 
significant challenge i n connecting people, places and businesses to economic and social 
opportunities.   This includes improving public transport access to outlying communities in order 
to better link residents to job opportunities as well as providing more active travel opportu nities.  
 
2.21.  Healthy l ife expectancy in Doncaster has improved but remains lower than the national average.  
However, physical activity rates are improving.  Local services, such as social care facilities, 10   [go to Contents ] 
  face increasing demands from an ageing population  and vulnerable people with complex needs.  
 
2.22.  Doncaster’s economy is still relatively self -contained, but more and more people are commuting 
in and out of the Borough and this trend is set to continue.  Doncaster is developing stronger 
mutual labour market ties w ithin the Sheffield City Region, but also with West Yorkshire, the 
Humber and North Lincolnshire.  
 
2.23.  The local  housing market is self -contained and has a good balance of housing types and 
tenures.  In line with the national picture, Doncaster has challenges in meeting the housing 
needs of the borough.  The Borough needs to ensure that it delivers a range of house types, 
tenures and sizes moving forward, in order to meet the existing and projected needs of its 
population, including affordable housing.  
 
2.24.  A key challenge is to support residents of all ages to develop the knowledge and skills needed 
by local employers.  This requires a blend of both academic and vocational skills.  More 
Doncaster 5 year olds are experiencing a good level of development as a founda tion for a 
fulfilling life , however, further improvement is needed in GCSE attainment.  T he proportion of 
the working age population qualified to Levels 3 or above is significantly lower than regional and 
national averages.  
 
2.25.  Air quality is generally good b ut specific areas face problems such as the main routes leading 
into the town centre and motorway junctions due to the volume and composition of traffic.  
Doncaster has reduced its CO2 emissions, but it still contributes more than the England 
average . 
 
2.26.  Over two fifths of the Borough is located within areas at a medium to high risk of flooding from 
both the river Don and Trent catchments.  Areas at risk include Carcroft, Askern, Thorne, 
Moorends, Hatfield and Stainforth and large parts of the main urban area .  All of these areas are 
very sustainable locations for development and are otherwise appropriate locations for growth in 
line with wider spatial planning objectives.  
 
2.27.  Doncaster’s highway network requires extra capacity to accommodate future traffic deman d at 
key bottlenecks such as motorway junctions . In addition, former coalfield communities remain 
isolated from strategic transport routes and centres of employment because of inadequate 
infrastructure.  
 
2.28.  Table 1 sets out an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges facing 
the Borough  at time of plan preparation .

  Chapter 3: Our Vision for the Future  
 
What will Doncaster look and feel like i n 203 5? 
3.1. ‘Doncaster Growing Together’ is the ‘Team Doncaster’4 strategy for our Borough . It is a set of 
ambitious plans and ideas for the future of the Borough .  It has one Vision for Doncaster:  
 
“A thriving place to learn, work, live and care ” 
 
3.2. The Strategy has four themes to bring the vision to life:  
 
 Learning – that prepares all children and young people for a life that is fulfilling.  
 Working – in ways that create purpose and meaning, and allow more people to pursue 
their ambitions.  
 Living – in a place that is vibrant and full  of opportunity, where people enjoy spending 
time.  
 Caring – together for the most vulnerable in our communities.  
 
3.3. A key ambition of ‘Doncaster Growing Together’ is to use the economic growth already 
achieved to ensure all residents can participate in a str ong and productive economy with higher 
living standards.  This is also the focus of Doncaster’s ‘Inclusive Growth Strategy ’ which aims to 
enhance our distinctive strengths and assets and better connect them within Doncaster and to 
other economies in the re gion, UK and globally.  Together, both seek to ensur e Doncaster is 
modern, well connected, attractive and environmentally sustainable with quality housing, 
leisure, environment and cultural offers.  
 
3.4. This Vision is informed by the ambitions of the City Regi on, its Strategic Economic Plan  as well 
the Northern Powerhouse  ambitions .  These include  the potential for a growing northern 
economy with improving strategic transport infrastructure that will benefit Doncaster’s 
accessibility  and build on our already ex cellent rail connectivity . 
 
How will Doncaster grow and develop over the next 15 years?  
 
                                                           
4 http://www.teamdoncaster.org.uk  By 2035, Doncaster will:  
 be a more important economic hub with a stronger, more balanced and productive economy ; 
 in line with Doncaster’s Inclusive Growth Strategy, have shaped economic success by 
investing in our future , have encouraged existing businesses to expand, attracting new 
businesses to the area and encouraged a low carbon economy to combat climate change;  
 have developed more inclu sive labour markets by providing integrated support for residents to 
access quality job opportunities ;  
 become a University City and ensured residents have the education and skills businesses 
need ; 
 realise the potential of our key industry sectors  to creat e more higher -skilled, better paid jobs  in 
engineering & technology , digital & creative , future mobility  (via rail, road and air), a dvanced 
materials  (for manufacturing and construction) ; and supporting services ; 
 harness the potential of the Airport, inclu ding linking to regional growth corridors and securing 
support for a rail link between the Airport  and the East Coast Main Line ;  15   [go to Contents ] 
   
How will the vision be achieved?  
3.5. To help achieve this vision and inform the Local Plan ’s policies , a series of objectives  have 
been developed in parallel with the S ustainability Appraisal process .  
Supporting the conditions for attracting jobs and growth:  
 
Regeneration and community pride:  
 
Quality of place:  
 
Transport and Accessibility:  
 
   meet our communities housing needs and aspirations focusing growth in the main urban area, 
main towns, service towns and large r villages providing a diverse range of homes, services 
and improved links in between ; 
 ensure that new development and infrastructure requirements such as, roads, broadband, 
open space, health facilities and schools are improved and/ or delivered together ; 
 enhance the vitality of our existing town centres  and the wider Borough making a more 
attractive , healthier, safer and more active place to live, visit and work ; 
 ensure the sustainability of villages and rural economy through appropriate development ; 
 protect and enhance our natural and historic environment including our tourist attractions, with 
new developments taking account of their local surroundings and character ; 
 be a place where nature flourishes and wildlife can move easily across the Borough, thro ugh a 
network of well -connected green infrastructure;  
 be a prosperous place to live, work and visit where growth will address health inequalities, and 
community deprivation.  
1. encourage and support a competitive diverse and stable economy focusing on our to wn and 
district centres, Doncaster Sheffield Airport growth corridor and  strategic transport network.   
2. create and improve access to high quality employment and training opportun ities for 
everyone in Doncaster.  
3. stimulate regeneration to tackle deprivation especially in the most disadvantaged areas and 
ensure an inclusive approach for those at risk of poverty, disc rimination and social 
exclusion.  
4. encourage the re -use of sites and buildings, especially well located and underused 
brownfield land (e.g. redundan t / unused land and empty properties and underused 
floorspace) to help revitalise areas of low demand and stimulate growth.  
5. ensure our towns, suburbs, villages and countryside benefit from high quality appropriate 
development that reinforces distinctive  and vibrant places.  
6. conserve and enhance those heritage assets that make up Doncaster’s historic  and natural  
environment in a manner appropriate to their significance . 
7. protect and enhance our green infrastructure especially our areas of green space for spo rt, 
recreation, play and nature.  
8. improve travel choice within the Borough  and beyond to improve access to services and 
jobs, between communities and along key transport corridors, reducing the need to travel by 
car and ensuring new development is accessib le to everyone . 16   [go to Contents ]

Natural Resources : 
 
 
How will success against the vision and objectives be measured?  
3.6. Ultimately, success will mean that all people in Doncaster are able to benefit from a thriving , 
resilient econo my and a high quality built and natural environment.  Doncaster’s annual State of 
the Borough assessment, provides an overview of the quality of life for people in Doncaster 
now, how it is changing and how it compares to other similar places across 4 theme s: Living ; 
Working ; Learning ; and Caring . 
 
3.7. Most of the indicators are presented at a ‘whole borough  / whole population’ level and therefore 
will be supplemented by more specific measures which could include, for example:  
 
 an increase in  targeted housing  provision  
 improv ed accessibility  between Doncas ter and major economic centres  
 improved quality of our town and district centres and natural environment  
 
3.8. The success of the Local Plan will be monitored against indicators – see ’Chapter 15: 
Implementation and Monitoring ’ for more detail.  9. ensure housing provision meets the housing need and aspirations by increasing the 
provision of new homes for all to meet current and future needs and create mixed and 
balanced communities.  
10. focus new homes primarily within the main urban ar ea of Doncaster and the Borough’s main 
towns, particularly in  areas with access to services.  
11. link the growth in homes and jobs to new and improved infrastructure to create healthier 
and more vibrant well connected  neighbourhoods and communities.  
12. promote h ealthy lifestyles and well -being of people of all ages and backgrounds and reduce 
inequalities and obesity levels across the Borough . 
13. provide new or improved health, sport and recreation facilities and green infrastructure to 
create quality communities an d address deficits in provision.  
14. minimise po llution and improve air quality.  
15. diversify and support the rural economy whilst protecting and enhancing the character , 
quality  and appearance of the countryside and the natural environment, including areas of 
landscape and biodiversity value . 
16. protect and enhance biodiversity and geodiversity and provide opportunities for people to 
access and appreciate wildlife and nature . 
17. reduce dependency on fossil fuels to reduce locally produced greenhouse gas emissions 
and minimise the impacts of climate change in line with the Sheffield City Region and 
encourage the transition to a low carbon borou gh. 
18. ensure that Doncaster adapts to the effects of climate change through careful planning and 
design of developments, avoiding more vulnerable  development in flood risk areas and 
managing the risk of flooding from all sources , including through appropriate mitigation of 
development where avoidance is not possible . 
19. encourage more efficient use of natural resources including water and secure and maintain 
a steady and adequate  supply of mineral resources to facilitate development . 
20. protect and enhance the quality of our water and soil resources (including high grade 
agricultural land) . 17   [go to Contents ]

  Chapter 4: Strategic approach  
 
Introduction  
4.1. To meet the Local Plan’s Vision (see Chapter 3: Our Vision for the Future ), this chapter sets o ut 
the overall strategy for meeting Doncaster’s needs for development and growth up to 2035 .  
The strategic policies set the basis  for the policies given in the rest of the Plan.   
Spatial Strategy  
Doncaster’s spatial strategy seeks to concentrate growth a t the larger settlements of the Borough, 
making the most of existing services and facilities and delivering new development to where it is most 
needed.  Remaining growth is delivered elsewhere in the Borough to support the function of other 
sustainable set tlements and to help meet more local needs.  Policies 1 and 2 set out the supporting 
settlement hierarchy and the levels and distribution of the anticipated growth.  
Doncaster’s Spatial Strategy will focus on delivering sustainable growth, appropriate to the size of 
individual settlements, that meets the needs for new homes and jobs, regenerates places and 
communities, and supports necessary improvements to infrastructure, services and facilities.  
Development should help create and maintain strong, sustainable, cohesive and inclusive communities, 
making the most effective use of previously developed land (except where that land is of high 
environmental value) and the best use of key transport corri dors and existing infrastructure, enabling 
people to access jobs, services and facilities locally.  
New development (including homes, supporting services and associated jobs) will be focussed in and 
around existing urban areas (primarily Doncaster’s ‘Main U rban Area’, its 7 ‘Main Towns’ and 10 ‘Service 
Towns and Villages’).   
At least 45% of new homes will go to the ‘Main Urban Area’, approximately 40% to the ‘Main Towns’ and 
about 15% to the ‘Service Towns and Villages’.  
Housing allocations and mixed -use a llocations to meet local needs housing growth are distributed on a 
pro-rata basis to the most sustainable and deliverable urban and urban extension sites and, in 
accordance with a sequential approach to flood risk, to these settlements.  Other development will only 
be accommodated in flood zones where sites are safe or can be made safe, in accordance with Policy 
57 and national policy.  
Housing allocations and mixed -use allocations to accommodate economic -led housing growth ar e 
largely directed to the most sustainable and deliverable urban and urban extension sites in the 
Doncaster Main Urban Area and Main Towns in accordance with the spatial strategy and with a 
sequential approach to flood risk.  
Major new employment sites will  be focused in locations accessible from the ‘Main Urban Area’ and 
‘Main Towns’ at locations attractive to the market with good access to the Strategic Transport Network 
as well as to Doncaster Sheffield Airport.  Such sites should also be accessible via a  range of transport 
modes.  
Retail, leisure, office, cultural and tourist developments will be located according to a ‘Network of 
Centres’ based on a ‘Sub -Regional Centre’; 2 ‘Town Centres’; 9 ‘District Centres’ and a number of ‘Local 
Centres’ and ‘Neighbou rhood Shopping Parades’ (see Table 2).  Proposals will be supported which 
protect and enhance their vitality and viability and minimise unsustainable trip generation.  Mixed -use 
developments (including housing and o ther uses such as small -scale shops and leisure services) will be 19   [go to Contents ] 
  actively encouraged in and around town and district centres and other areas of good public transport 
accessibility.  Within local centres and neighbourhood shopping parades a degree of flexi bility in the mix 
and range of uses and activities which can be permitted will be allowed, whilst securing adequate 
protection of the existing retail function.  
Policy 1: Settlement Hierarchy (Strategic Policy)  
 
Decisions on the location and sc ale of development should be informed by Doncaster’s Settlement 
Hierarchy as set out below which should be read in conjunction with Policy 2: Level of Growth .  
 
At least 45% of new homes will go to the ‘Main Urban Area’, appr oximately 40% to the ‘Main Towns’ and 
about 15% to the ‘Service Towns and Villages’.  
 
Major new employment sites will be focused in locations accessible from the ‘Main Urban Area’ and 
‘Main Towns’ at locations attractive to the market with good access to t he Strategic Transport Network 
as well as to Doncaster Sheffield Airport. Such sites should also be accessible via a range of transport 
modes.  
 
Development limits have been drawn around the Doncaster ‘Main Urban Area’, ‘Main Towns’, ‘Service 
Towns and Vill ages’ and the ‘Defined Villages’.  Within development limits, proposals for new 
development will be supported provided it accords with both the Settlement Hierarchy and other policies 
in the Local Plan.  
 
1)  Doncaster Main Urban Area  
 
Doncaster Main Urban Area provides services for the whole Borough and beyond.  To strengthen this 
role and to meet its growth objectives and regeneration needs, Doncaster Main Urban Area will be the 
main focus for development in the Borough, including housing, retail, leisure,  cultural, office and other 
employment development.  
 
As a ‘Sub -Regional Centre’, Doncaster Town Centre will continue to provide the main focus for most new 
retail, offices, leisure, cultural and tourist facilities with the defined ‘District’ and ‘Local Cen tres’ serving 
more day -to-day needs.  
 
Additional growth on non -allocated sites within the Development Limits of the Doncaster Main Urban 
Area will also be considered favourably.  
 
The Main Urban Area is defined as the contig uous built -up area of Doncaster c omprising a number of 
distinct but connected districts arranged around the town -centre, including Doncaster town centre , 
Balby/Woodfield, Belle Vue, Bentley, Bes sacarr, Cantley, Clay Lane, Cusworth, Edenthorpe, Hexthorpe, 
Hyde Park, Kirk Sandall, Intake, R ichmond Hill, Scawsby, Scawthorpe, Warmsworth and Wheatley.  The 
Key Diagram provides an indicative representation of areas that are within the Main Urban Area – this 
should be read in conjunction with the Development Limits drawn on the Policies  Map.  
 
2)  Main Towns  
 
To maintain and enhance their roles as main towns, which each provide a high number of services for 
their own needs and their wider catchment areas, and in order to aid economic growth and  regeneration, 
these settlements will be the focus for substantial housing growth, supported by  appropriate levels of 
employment and retail growth and wider service provision.  
 
After Doncaster Town Centre (see 1 above), priority will be given to improving the quality and diversity of 
Town Centre uses and facil ities within the defined ’Town Centres’ of Mexborough and Thorne; with the 
defined ‘District and Local Centres’ serving more day -to-day needs.  
 
Additional growth on non -allocated sites within the Development Limits of the Main Towns will also be 
considered  favourably.  20   [go to Contents ] 
  The Main Towns include 7 large coalfield or market towns comprising Adwick – Woodlands; Armthorpe; 
Conisbrough & Denaby; Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield & Stainforth; Mexborough; Rossington; and 
Thorne & Moorends . 
3)  Service Towns and Villages  
These service towns and villages provide a good range of services meeting their own needs and the 
local area.  To maintain and enhance their role as service towns and villages which provide housing, 
employment, retail, and key services and facilities for the local area, these  settlements will be a focus for 
accommodating an appropriate level of growth to meet their local needs, as well as renewing and 
regenerating any run-down neighbourhoods.  Given the high levels of housing already being delivered in 
some of these settlements, such as at Askern, and associated increases in population and levels of 
service provision, some of these settlements may serve a role more in line with the ‘Main Towns’ in the 
future which would be identified through a review of the  plan.  
 
Defined District and Local Centres will meet day -to-day needs for retail and other town-centre uses.  
 
Additional growth on non -allocated sites within the Development Limits of the Service Towns and 
Villages will also be considered favourably.  
 
The 10 Service Towns and Villages are Askern; Auckley – Hayfield Green; Barnburgh – Harlington; 
Barnby Dun; Bawtry; Carcroft – Skellow; Edlington; Finningley; Sprotbrough; and Tickhill.  
 
4)  Defined Villages  
 
These villages  have  a limited number of services an d house commuters to destinations elsewhere . 
These villages do not have allocations for new development.  Within their defined Development Limits, 
development proposaIs will be considered against other policies of the Plan as shown on the Policies 
Map.  No n-residential development will be supported if justifiable to support a prosperous  rural economy 
in accordance with national policy in the NPPF . 
 
The 40 Defined Villages are Adwick –upon –Dearne , Arksey, Austerfield, Blaxton, Braithwaite, Braithwell , 
Branton , Brodsworth , Burghwallis , Cadeby , Campsall , Clayton (with Frickley) , Clifton , Fenwick, Fishlake, 
Hatfield Woodhouse, Hampole , Hickleton , Highfields , High Melton , Hooton Pagnell , Kirk Bramwith, 
Lindholme, Loversall , Marr, Micklebring , Moss, Norton , Old Can tley, Old Denaby , Old Edlington , Owston , 
Pickburn , Skelbrooke , Stainton , Sutton , Sykehouse, Toll Bar , Thorpe in Balne and Wadworth . 
 
5)  Countryside  Policy Area  
 
Doncaster’s Countryside Policy Area  is defined as that outside of the Green Belt and beyond de fined 
‘Development Limits’ as shown on the P olicies  Map.  Proposals for new development in the Countryside  
Policy Area , including those which support the rural economy, will  be supported where  in accordance 
with Policy 25. 
 
If the Council is unable to demonstrate a deliverable five year housing land supply across the Borough 
as a whole , or the Council fails the Government’s Housing Delivery Test,  residential d evelopment will 
also be supported in the Countryside Policy Area  if all of the following criteria are met:  
A) The site is adjacent  to a Development Limit  of a settlement in levels 1 -3 above;  
  
B) The development is  consistent with the role and service function of the settlement in the 
settlement hierarchy set out above ; 
 
C) The si te is well related to the existing built form of the settlement and would represent a logical 
extension to the built up area or is of a scale and nature that is in keeping with the core shape, 
form and size of the settlement;  21   [go to Contents ] 
   
D) The development  will not caus e significant harm to a settlement’s character, setting and 
appearance (including partial or total coalescence with another settlement) or to the intrinsic 
character  and beauty of the surrounding countryside; and  
 
E) It accords with other policies in the Loca l Plan . 
 
6)  Green Belt  
 
The openness and permanence of Doncaster’s Green Belt (as indicated on the Key Diagram ) and 
defined on the Policies  Map will be pr eserved . 
 
The general extent of the Green Belt will be reta ined.  Within the Green Belt, national planning policy will 
be applied including the presumption against inappropriate development except in very special 
circumstances.  
 
7)  Flood Risk  
 
The current and future challenges arising from having large areas at r isk of flooding in the Borough must 
be considered .   National policy and guidance will be applied, including the flood risk sequential and 
(where necessary) exception tests.

Explanation  
Settlement Hierarchy  
4.2. Doncaster’s spatial strategy seeks to concentrate growth at the larger settlements of the 
Borough  with r emaining growth delivered elsewhere to support the function of  other sustainable 
settlements and to help meet more local needs  taking account of existing settlement size, 
demography, accessibility, facilities, issues and opportunities .  This includes giving 
proportionate support to the Borough’s rural communities and  rural economy.  
 
4.3. This approach , informed by a Settlement Audit of service provision across the Borough , makes 
the most of existing services and facilities, delivering new development to where it is most 
needed.  It provides new jobs and new homes in access ible locations, taking account of  
infrastructure improvements , and aids opportunities to regenerate urban areas . 
Development Limits, Defined Villages and Countryside  Policy Area   
4.4. The Strategy gives priority to development proposals within the Development Limits of existing 
settlements, reflecting existing development with planning permission, and identifying  new site 
allocations in Levels 1 -3 of the Settlement Hierarchy.  More limited development in Defined 
Villages may be allowed in accordance with this P olicy.  
 22   [go to Contents ] 
  4.5. The inclusion of land within a Development Limit does not automatically indicate that it is 
suitable for development.  There may be areas of open space, woodland, areas at risk of 
flooding, areas that contribute to a settlement's local distinctiven ess and other protected sites 
that would be inappropriate for development.  Additionally, other material considerations may 
influence whether development within development limits is acceptable or not.  
 
4.6. Doncaster’s Countryside Policy Area is defined as tha t outside of the Green Belt and beyond 
defined ‘Development Limits’ as shown on the Policies Map.  Proposals for new development in 
the Countryside  Policy Area , including  those which support the rural economy, will be supported 
where in accordance with Pol icy 25.  
 
4.7. Should the Council fail to demonstrate a five year Borough housing supply, or fail  the 
Government’s Housing Delivery Test , this Policy also sets out circumstances  in which proposals 
to develop land in the Countrysi de Policy Area  around Level 1 -3 settlements will be considered.  
In such circumstances the Council may be required to prepare an Action Plan; this Policy 
provides flexibility for delivery of sustainable development in appropriate locations under such 
circu mstances.  Other Local Plan policies will also need to be met.  
Green Belt  
4.8. The fundamental aim of Green Belt is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently 
open.  Green Belt serves five purposes: to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas; 
to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another; to assist in safeguarding the 
countryside from encroachment; to preserve  the setting and special character of historic towns; 
and to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban 
land.  
 
4.9. The L ocal Plan does not repeat national Green Belt policy set out in the NPPF .  The Council will 
apply this when considering relevant planning applications.  In summary, new buildings are 
inappropriate except for agricultur e, forestry, outdoor sport and outdoor recreation, and 
cemeteries.  Proportionate extension to, re -use of or replacement of, existing buildings, mineral 
extraction, engineering operations, necessary transport infrastructure, affordable housing in 
accordanc e with this and Policy 7, and redevelopment of brownfield land are  all capable of 
being appropriate as long as they preserve the openness of the Green Belt and do not conflict 
with the purposes of including land within it.  I nappropriate development is, by definition, harmful 
to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in ‘very special circumstances’ where 
harm is clearly outweighed by other considerations.  
 
4.10.  Doncaster’s Green Belt forms part of the wider South Yorkshir e Green Belt which serves to 
prevent the merging of the large urban areas of Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield, Barnsley and 
Wakefield.  The outer boundary of the Green Belt within Doncaster is largely defined by the 
East Coast Main Line and has been since a doption of the South Yorkshire Structure Plan in 
1979. Doncaster’s Green Belt is thus limited to the countryside in the western “half” of the 
Borough.  
Employment, Housing, Retail, Leisure and other Town Centre Uses  
4.11.  The Strategy and Settlement Hierarchy re fers to the provision of new growth including 
employment, housing, retail and other uses.  Further detail on the level and distribution of this 
growth is given in the Policy 2. 
Flood Risk  
4.12.  Both plan-making and decision -taking (including implementation of the Plan’s Spatial Strategy 
and Settlement Hierarchy) should be based on a sequential risk based approach to avoid  areas  
of flood risk through application of the sequential and, where necessary, exception tests. Where 
possible,  development should be directed away from medium -high flood risk areas.  Where this 
is not possible, the residual risks must be managed.   Land should be safeguarded from 
development that is required for current and future flood management.  Opportunities t o reduce 23   [go to Contents ] 
  the causes and impacts of flooding from new development should be sought.  Where climate 
change is expected to increase flood risk to existing development, making it unsustainable in 
the long -term, opportunities to facilitate its relocation to mor e sustainable locations should be 
explored.  
 
4.13.  The Borough has extensive areas of land at risk from flooding from various sources, including 
the rivers Don and Dearne in the west and rivers Torne and Trent in the south, and the 
watercourses that feed to them , plus tidal flooding within the low lying Humberhead Levels. 
Large parts of the borough are therefore identified as being in medium and high flood risk based 
on the Environment Agency Flood Map for Planning.  There are also areas of the Borough 
where surf ace water and groundwater flooding poses significant challenges.  The Council has 
considered the need to avoid flood risk where possible when preparing the Local Plan (the 
sequential test).  Where this is not possible, consistent with wider sustainability objectives, 
development must be safe for its lifetime and should not increase flood risk elsewhere (the 
exception test).  
Hierarchy and Network of Centres  
4.14.  Doncaster has a dispersed network of town, district and local centres  where shops, and in many 
cases, other services and facilities are concentrated  (see Figure 2).  They  contribute to the 
sustainability of settlements , each having its distinct characteristics, strengths and opportunities.  
The Plan Strategy and supp orting policies aim to ensure that these centres remain vibrant, 
attractive and welcoming places in which to visit, shop, do business and enjoy leisure.  
 
4.15.  Centres within the Borough vary greatly in size and function  and have been classified according 
to the  role and function they perform.  Doncaster Town Centre is the main shopping and leisure 
destination in the Borough , serving a ‘sub-regional ’ catchment area.   Mexborough and Thorne 
are both important ‘town centres' which provide a wide range of facilities serving large 
catchment areas . 
 
4.16.  Doncaster’s ‘district centres ’ provide a range of retail and non -retail services, such as 
restaurants, banks and convenience stores, as well as public facilities, such as a library/  
community resource centre.   Doncaster’s ‘local centres ’ provide a smaller range of shops and 
services to meet the day -to-day needs of local communities.  The extent of each centre is 
shown on the Policies  Map.  
 
4.17.  ‘Neighbourhood shopping parades ’ are small clusters or groups of shops and businesses that 
reside within existing residential areas, serving the everyday needs of the immediate 
neighbourhood .  Although  small -scale  they have  individually been identified  and shown on the 
Policies  Map.  
 
4.18.  The position of a centre within the network is based on a number of factors such as the size and 
type of shops and provision of other non -retail uses, catchment areas and proximity to other 
centres.  The size and type of a retail, leisure and office or mixed -use proposal will determine 
which centre is the most appropriate place to locate it in.  Policies set out in Chapter 8 provide 
more detail.   24   [go to Contents ]

25   [go to Contents ] 
   
 
Policy 2: Level of Growth  (Strategic Policy)  
 
The Local Pl an’s strategic aim is to facilitate the delivery of :  
 
 at least 4 81 hectares of employment land over the plan period  (2015 -2035) to help grow and 
diversify the Sheffield City Region economy, increase productivity, meet regeneration needs, and 
widen access to learning and training opportunities.  The identified land will accommodate 
business, light industry and manufacturing and distribution and warehouse uses to meet future 
employment needs on sites with good access to the Strategic Transport Network which are 
attractive to market investment and which can be accessed via a range of transport modes.  
 
 a minimum of 15,640 net new homes in the remainder of the plan period 2018 – 2035 (920 per 
annum).  
 
 new retail, leisure, office, cultural and tourist development s in accordance with the defined 
Network of Centres.  Doncaster Town Centre will be the main location for offices and commercial 
uses, further education, regional retailing centre, transport hub, civic uses and range of leisure 
uses.  
 
 
Explanation  
4.19.  This po licy establishes the levels and distribution of growth for employment, housing and town 
centre uses (such as retail, leisure, office, culture and tourism) . 
Employment  
4.20.  In order to support economic growth and regeneration whilst meeting the development needs  of 
business and market signals the policy sets an ambitious but credible land requirement of 481 
hectares.  This policy will help to achieve growth by supporting the conditions and opportunities 
for attracting high quality inward investment and jobs as we ll as encouraging innovation, 
attracting more capital investment, raising skill and education levels, improving graduate 
retention and reducing deprivation . 
 
4.21.  The employment land requirement is evidenced in the Economic Forecasts and Housing Needs 
Assessmen t (Peter Brett Associates, June 2018) and the updated Employment Land Need 
Assessment (ELNA) (2020 ) where a 1%  jobs growth rate has been factored in.  Official 
Government forecasts for 2015 to 2032 predict a lower jobs growth of only 0.6% p.a. which 
transl ates to a very low land requirement.  In order to boost productivity and provide the 
conditions for existing and new sectors to grow, Doncaster is keen to retain an ambitious growth 
target.  It is considered , therefore , that there is sufficient previous ev idence of investment, land 
development and analysis , in the Doncaster Employment Land Review (2018) (Colliers) , that 
enough land should be allocated for a 1% jobs growth.  This also allows for choice, flexibility 
and churn .  The 481 ha figure is broken dow n into the following employment land requirement 
for the plan period  2015 – 2035 : 
 
 Office – 14 ha  
 Business and industry – 124 ha  
 Non-strategic warehousing (B8) – 73 ha  
 Strategic warehousing (B8) – 271 ha  
 Total 482 ha (1 ha over the requirement).  
 
4.22.  The distr ibution of employment sites is required in market attractive locations but also ensuring 
that there is strong accessibility and connectivity between where people live and the 
employment opportunities.  This is particularly important for the communities acr oss the 
Borough that have high levels of deprivation.   Policy 12 sets out in more detail transport 
proposals with an emphasis on public transport and road improvements  to improve  access to 
jobs.   
26   [go to Contents ] 
   
4.23.  In order to help meet the economic growth and regeneration needs of the Borough there are a 
number of  sites allocated through the Local Plan.  These are important in achieving the Plan’s 
Strategy and are linked to major transport corridors across the Borough .  There are already 
majo r schemes with permission such as at Doncaster Sheffield Airport, iPort, Unity and West 
Moor Park.  It is imperative that all of the major schemes have economic growth and  
regeneration benefits which extend acros s the whole Borough .  Some of these sites wi ll extend 
beyond the end of the plan period.  Many people no longer wish to live close to where they work 
and businesses often have locational needs meaning that they need to be located away from 
settlements.  Providing employment sites immediately next to  housing can lead to unacceptable 
impacts on residential areas and therefore careful screening and buffer zones may be needed.  
This policy should be read in conjunction with relevant transport policies.  
 
4.24.  The A1 (M) within Doncaster currently suffers from h igh levels of congestion and Highways 
England has started the lengthy process of examining proposals to make improvements to help 
alleviate that congestion.  Due to that, the A1 (M) corridor could not currently sustain high levels 
of growth , although it may  be able to towards the end of the plan depending upon the progress 
on the Highways England proposals .  Therefore  the M18 will continue to be the main location 
for larger scale new investment and growth  including at Doncaster Sheffield Airport, iPort and 
Unity.  There are also a number of existing employment sites which will continue to support the 
economy.  
 
4.25.  Doncaster urban centre has a range of sites reflecting previous development patterns from 
traditional industries and their requirements but they are of ten poorly located.  Some sites have 
come under pressure for housing and other commercial uses.  Existing established employment 
sites will continue where they serve the needs of modern business.  
 
4.26.  As well as supporting the M18 corridor, it is necessary tha t land in the north of Doncaster is 
identified  to ensure economic growth and regeneration  is spread across the Borough .  Land in 
the north of Doncaster tends to have low value and poor accessibility as well as flood risk 
issues.  Proposals for an A1 to A19  link road will unlock this potential by providing improved 
access to the A1(M).   However, this will be towards the end of the plan period when there are 
clearer proposals for A1 improvements and funding for an A1 -A19 link.  Once these highway 
links are in  place there are considerable prospects for the north of Doncaster including land at 
Carcroft Common of 54ha.  Land is being brought forward with a new link road as part of the 
Unity mixed use scheme at Hatfield/Stainforth unlocking 66ha  of employment land  including re -
using former colliery land.  This is covered by Policy 69.  Also in the north, Thorne has recently 
been attractive to a range of business developments alongside the M18 and continues to 
provide opportunities at  Nimbus Park and Capitol Park with good links to the Humber Port  and 
its town centre provides a range of commercial opportunities.  
 
4.27.  This Policy also supports the rail sector which is currently expanding in Doncaster.   The 
National College for Advanced Tran sport and Infrastructure  is located  at Lakeside, close to rail 
companies such as DB Schenker, Volker Rail and Hitachi.  The rail sector , through both 
engineering and offices , will bring higher -value jobs and support existing businesses.  
Doncaster is ideal ly placed to further expand its role.  It is therefore critical that sites for rail 
companies are provided in the right locations.  Work is also being undertaken on the National 
Institute for Infrastructure.  
 
4.28.  Although there are no strategic employment allo cations within the Green Belt, the Local Plan 
supports the modest removal of Green Belt land in Edlington to support the expansion of an 
existing business on Broomhouse Lane.   In the west of the Borough both Mexborough and 
Conisbrough are constrained by a lack of sites.  Any existing sites within these settlements have 
been under pressure for other uses or do not always meet the needs of modern businesses.  
There is however access to business parks at Manvers (in Rotherham) as well as strong public 
transpor t routes, both bus and rail, and road connectivity to Doncaster and other City Region 
towns . 
  
27   [go to Contents ] 
  4.29.  It should be noted that a strong, diverse economy is not solely built on providing land in the right 
place at the right time, there also needs to be other interve ntions to help deliver that land as well 
as the jobs and conditions for employees to secure a job. Other measures include marketing, 
promotion and branding of Doncaster and its available sites; work and skills plans; training 
plans; masterplanning; travel plans; and training and recruitment plans.  
 
4.30.  Reference should also be made to the Infrastructure Delivery Plan which includes details of the 
physical infrastructure being planned to help deliver sites and jobs.  
Housing  
4.31.  Providing sufficient homes of the righ t type and quality and in the most appropriate places is a 
key element of the Plan’s vision  and objectives .  This also reflects the Government’s housing 
policy detailed in the NPPF.  
 
4.32.  Doncaster ’s housing need  is evidenced in the Economic Forecasts and Housi ng Needs 
Assessment (Peter Brett Associates, June 2018 ) and the earlier Doncaster Housing Need 
Assessment 2015 (partially updated 2016).   Doncaster Borough functions as a self -contained 
housing market  area but has important functional connections with othe r parts of the Sheffield 
City Region and East Midlands .  An estimated 75 -80% of workers travel to work within the 
Borough with a fifth travelling to work within the same electoral ward in which they live.  
 
4.33.  Using the Government’s Standard Housing Methodolog y as a starting point, national projections 
identify a housing need in the Borough for 585 homes per year (baseline growth) over the plan 
period .  In addition , to meet planned economic growth over the plan period, an additional 327 
homes per year (economic  growth) is identified.  Th is gives a t otal objectively a ssessed housing 
need ( OAHN) of 920 new homes (net) per year for the  Borough once economic growth is taken 
into account  (and with a rounding up of the figure) .  This comprises both housing for sale an d 
rent on the open market and affordable housing for those people who cannot afford to buy or 
rent on the open market.  
 
4.34.  The Plan’s Settlement Strategy proposes that new housing (derived from both baseline and  
economic growth) is distributed according to th e Plan’s Settlement Hierarchy  – see Policy 1 – 
summarised as follows .  
Table 3: Settlement Hierarchy and Distribution of Proposed Housing  
Doncaster Main Urban Area: Provision to meet local housing need  and housing to meet the 
Borough’s  economic  aspirations .  Total housing  provision = at least 45% of the Borough total.  
7 Main Towns: Provision to meet  local housing need and a share  of housing to meet the Borough’s  
economic aspirations .  Total housi ng pro vision = about 40% of the Borough total.  
10 Service Towns & Villages: Provision to predomina ntly meet local housing need  in each town 
and village.   Total housing provision = about  15% of Borough total.  
40 Defined villages : Limited  development in accord ance with Policy 1 / other Plan policies  
Green Belt and Green Belt settlements:  development in accordance with Policy 1 and national 
Green Belt policy  
‘Countryside  Policy Area ’: outside  of Gre en Belt or Development Limits : Development in 
accordance with Policy 25 and, as defined in Policy 1. 
 
4.35.  Local housing need has been  distributed pro-rata (based on current settlement size) to all  
settlements with a “service function ” to meet locally the housing growth needs of the existing 
population.  A settlement with a service function is defined as having 4 or more of the 12 key 
services (of which at least two are primary key services ) as set out in the Settlement Audit.  The 
balance of the local need figure (that which relates to villages without a service function) has 
been distributed to higher order settlements in the Borough . 
 
4.36.  Housing  to meet the Borough’s economic growth aspirations  has b een directed to the most 
sustainable and deliverable sites in the Doncaster Main Urban Area and Main Towns.  The flood  
28   [go to Contents ] 
  sequential approach has been applied to sites across these settlements.  The Settlement Audit 
shows that Doncaster and the seven Main Tow ns are larger and have a greater service function 
than other settlements in the Borough .  The majority of housing to meet the Borough’s 
economic growth aspirations is directed to the Doncaster Main Urban Area in recognition of its 
status as a sub -regional centre that serves the whole Borough and a wider catchment , with a 
share also  distributed  to each of the  seven Main Towns.  
 
4.37.  The exact distribution of housing across the Main Urban Area and Main Towns is in accordance 
with the site selection methodology.  This comprises a sustainability appraisal of sites but also 
has regard to the findings of the Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment 
(HELAA ), the distribution of existing planning permissions (that are sustainable and deliverable), 
progress wi th neighbourhood  plans, a sequential approach to flood risk and the need to 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances to justify taking land out of the Green Belt.  
 
4.38.  Housing Allocations must be demonstrably developable in the plan period.  There are a number 
of potentially suitable urban  sites (mainly in the Doncaster Main Urban Area and Mexborough ) 
where deliverability  issues ( mainly  associated with addressing flood risk mitigation  and/or 
directly impacted by the safeguarding route of HS2 ) have prevented them c oming forward and 
where their development in the plan period cannot at this time be demonstrated.  Because they 
are otherwise suitable for residential (or mixed -use including residential) development the sites 
are designated as “Potential Development  Sites” (Policy 5) to allow residential development to 
come forward, possibly within the plan period in which case this would be a housing land supply 
that would be additional to the allocations .  
 
4.39.  New urban edge allocations  have of necessity require d land previously designated in the UDP 
as Green Belt or Countryside .  Table 4 identifies the overall plan period allocation that has been 
made to each of tiers 1 -3 of the hierarchy, and to the re spective settlements.  The overall 
allocation accords with the distribution identified in Policy 1 for at least 45% of new homes to be 
directed to the Doncaster Main Urban Area, approximately 40% to the Main Towns, and about 
15% to the Service Towns & Villages.  Appendix  12 of the Local Plan identifies a number of 
indicators as part of Policy  5 (Housing Allocations) which will be  monitored throughout the plan 
period to check progress on how the housing supply is coming forward in line with the 
settlement hierarchy and requirement. This will help to inform as to whether a review of the Plan 
is necessary.  There are also other polic ies in the Plan (such as Policy 1 Part 5 – if a 5 -year 
supply cannot be demonstrated), and/or the Housing Delivery Test, that could assist in ensuring 
there is a supply of housing at all times to meet the plan period requirem ent should sufficient 
sites not come forward as anticipated.

4.40.  Within the development boundaries of these towns and villages there will also be opportunities 
for quality “windfall” development (i.e. development outside the allocations) subject to other 
relevant policies of the Local Plan (design policies, Conservation Area policies , etc.).   The vast 
majority  of opportunities will be small infill sites within areas defined on the Policies  Map as 
‘Residential Policy Areas ’ where new residential development is supported in principle subject 
to Policy 10.  Windfall proposals on other designations (for example, land designated for 
employment) would be required to satisfy the relevant local plan policy.  
 
4.41.  There will also be limited development opportunities on a sm aller scale in the 40 Defined 
Villages.  Most of the land within the Defined Villages is designated as ‘Residential Policy Area ’.  
All of these villages have poorer  service provision than the eighteen settlements identified for 
housing growth.  
 
4.42.  Outside set tlement Development Limits the land is designated Green Belt (in the western “half” 
of the Borough ) or as Countryside  Policy Area  (in the  eastern “half” of the Borough ).  This 
includes a number of small villages and hamlets without development boundaries t hat are 
covered  by Green Belt or treated as Countryside  Policy Area . 
 
4.43.  Within the Green Belt and the Countryside Policy Area development  is restricted but will be 
supported in line with the NPPF and relevant Local Plan policies, including that permitted in 
Levels 5 and 6 of the Settlement Hierarchy , Policy 25 and other specialist land uses (such as 
gypsy and traveller accommodation  (Policy 11). 
Approach to Housing & Neighbourhood Plans  
4.44.  The Local  Plan does not make specific housing requirements for individual areas.  This is 
because the Local Plan identifies sufficient sites overall to meet its housing allocation 
requirements, and does not rely on neighbourhood plans making additional housing allo cations 
therefore.  Given national guidance is clear that the Council should seek to avoid conflicts 
where possible between respective plans, and avoid duplication of the process, a number of 
sites allocated in the Local Plan have already been identified a s allocations in ‘made’ and  
30   [go to Contents ] 
  emerging neighbourhood plans.  Whilst there is no requirement for neighbourhood plans to 
allocate housing sites, they are able to identify additional housing sites if they wish to do so, and 
provided that they are in general con formity with the strategic policies in the Local Plan.  
Retail, Leisure, Office, Culture and Tourism  
4.45.  The Plan’s Spatial Strategy and Settlement Hierarchy includes a network of centres based on 
Doncaster as a ’Sub-Regional Centre ’, Thorne and Mexborough as ‘Town Centres ’, a series of 
‘District Centres ’ and ‘Local Centres ’ and ‘Neighbourhood Shopping Parades ’. 
 
4.46.  Some centres are struggling to adapt to the pace of change arising from the growth of internet 
shopping, competition from out -of-centre development and  the emergence of new services and 
practices (e.g. click and collect) and face an uncertain future.  In response, Doncaster’s centres 
need to reinvent and reposition themselves in order to remain viable and competitive . 
 
4.47.  GVA were appointed in 2015 to prepa re the Retail, Leisure and Town Centre Study and it is 
used to help inform the Local Plan.  The Study undertakes town centre checks; looks at 
shopping patterns; examines retail capacity; and makes strategic recommendations on future 
needs for both convenie nce and comparison goods.   
 
4.48.  The Doncaster Urban Centre Masterplan sets out the long term vision and guiding principles to 
maximise development opportunities within Doncaster Town Centre.  There are a number of 
town centre sites which are capable of accommo dating mixed use development including 
offices, education/training facilities and residential.  These uses will help to support a vibrant 
diverse economy.  Many town centre sites have a low land value and will require public 
investment to support both site  development and infrastructure provision.  For offices in 
particular, alternative locations such as the Airport and Lakeside are attractive.  However , the 
sequential test set out in national policy  (and Policy 22) will need  to be undertaken before such 
developments can be supported  (exceptions set out in Policy 6).  
 
4.49.  Retail, leisure, offices, culture  and tourism will be directed according to the ‘network of centres ’, 
as set out in Policies 1 and 2.  Proposals will also be assessed against policies  in Chapter s 8 
and 16.  A new mixed use development at Doncaster Sheffield Air port (Policy 6) will, upon 
substantial completion, become a new town centre (subject to future assessment of the final 
scheme).  
Economy, New Employment Allocations and Existing Employment Policy Areas  
4.50.  To help deliver the Spat ial Strategy (Policy 1) and meet the level and distribution of employment 
growth (Policy 2), the following two policies allocate new site specific employment proposals 
(Policy 3) and designate and protect Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) where existing 
employment uses will continue to be  supported.   Together the policies seek to ensure that 
enough land is provided in the right place to meet the employment land need requirement as 
well as helping to assist the Doncaster Inclusive Growth Strategy of enabling Doncaster people, 
places and businesses to enjoy improved prosperity by participating in a growing and productive 
economy. The  policies, sites and schemes  and projects build on the objectives of the Local Plan 
Vision, encouraging existing businesses to expand and /or modernise, and attractin g inward 
investment to help grow and diversify Doncaster’s economy.  
 
4.51.  Doncaster  has opportunitie s for major schemes  arising from a range of assets as well as  a 
determination to regenerate the Borough .  These schemes includ e Unity; Doncaster Sheffield 
Airport and the Great Yorkshire Way  corridor; and Main Urban Area mixed use sites .  Specific 
policies  are included in Chapter s 5 and 16 to recognise the ir status in the S heffield City Region  
Strategic Economic Plan , the levels of investment needed , and the requirement for these 
schemes  to mitig ate their impacts and improve the quality and range of job opportunities across 
the Borough .  Not all new major opportunities are located where previous traditional industries 
existed – transport and access will play an important role in enabling the benef its of new 
opportunities to be retained within the existing settlements of the Borough .  
31   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 3: Employment  Allocations (Strategic Policy)  
 
In accordance with Policy 2, the sites shown in Table 5 below and set out in Tables E1 to E8 , and  on the 
Policies  Map, w ill be allocated for employment uses in accordance with the following principles : 
 
A) Only research and development, light industr ial, general industry and storage and distribution 
uses will be permitted on these sites unless the proposal is ancillary to the employment use.  
 
B) The employment sites will be developed in accordance with the development requirements set 
out in Appendix  2 and other relevant Local Plan policies.  
 
C) For employment or other developments that propose 20 or more direct jobs, the Council will 
seek to enter into a local labour agreement with the developer/applicant that sets ou t the 
following:  
 
1. An agreed percentage target for local labour ; 
2. A training and recruitment plan ; 
3. Commitment to an agreed target for the proportion of local procurement of services and  
supplies.  
 
Table 6 identifies  a site, as shown on the Policies Map, as a designated Potential Development Site. The 
site is suitable for employment development but not currently considered developable in the plan period.  
Employment development will be supported in accordance with polic ies of the Local Plan, and with 
regard to the developer requirements set out in Appendix 2, and will be additional to the allocated land 
supply. Proposals that would remove the anticipated  employment potential will not normally be 
supported unless it is demonstrated that employment is unlikely to ever be viable.  
 
Explanation  
4.52.  The Doncaster Inclusive Growth Strategy highlights the need for a focus on higher -skilled jobs 
including engineering and technology , digital and creative , future mobility (via rail, road and air) , 
and advanced materials.  This is also reflected in the  Local Plan ’s Vision and Objectives  which 
emphasis e that Doncaster  should have a strong inclusive economy and be a leading centre in 
logistics, aviation, rail and civil engineering.  Both also highlight the need for the development of 
more inclusive labour markets with integrated support for residents to access q uality job 
opportunities .  As wel l as e xisting businesses being  encouraged to expand  and/or modernise , 
new busines ses are being  attracted to the area .  There is also support for  a low carbon 
economy to help combat climate change.  
 
4.53.  The allocation of employment sites (including strategic s ites) will help to stimulate employment 
opportunities, help to develop a diverse economy and assist in tackling deprivation through job 
creation and training. The sites make best use of road and rail links  and other infrastructure  to 
help stimulate busines s growth particularly in manufacturing, green and high -tech industries and 
logistics and rail sectors.  The location of these sites will allow residents to benefit from easy 
access to employment .  However, market interest and deliverability are also import ant 
considerations in the location of sites as well as a focus on sustainable locations  including re -
using brownfield land  wherever possible . The allocated employment sites are as follows:

4.54.  Larger sites are allocated to support sectors such as distribution warehousing and major 
manufacturing  and engineering including rail related industries .  These will utilise the Borough’s 
advantages, such as motorway access , and will meet the operational demands and market 
needs of the sectors set out in Policy 3 whilst also providing flexibility allowing investment to 
take place through any potential changing economic circums tances.  Larger sites tend to need 
to be where business uses can operate efficiently especially those that require 24 hour 
operations, large footprints and easy access to the strategic highway networks including rail 
freight and air freight.  These sites a lso generate large amounts of HGV traffic and will therefore 
be required to make provision for sufficient lorry parking in line with Policy 15. 
 
4.55.  The north of the Borough remains a priority for identifying new economic opport unities and 
careful consideration is required to make best use of existing non-Green Belt sites at and close 
to Carcroft Industrial Estate.  These are linked to potential road improvements from the A1(M) 
and A19.  A mixture of private and public investment  would be needed over the long term to 
improve accessibility to new potential employment areas and mitigate flood -risk impacts .  For 
this reason, the Local Plan identifies  Carcroft Common as a Potential Development Site. Any 
development will be additional to the allocations capacity. Applications for employment uses will 
be approved where flood risk sequential test, as well as any other development requirements, 
can be satisfactorily addressed . 
 
4.56.  There are some allocated  employment sites which are not suitab le for large scale warehousing/  
distribution but instead are attractive for light industry and manufacturing  (including rail related)  
and smaller distribution.  Together with existing sites, new sites are able to cater for both new 
demand and replacement s ites which are needed if a business decides to relocate or expand 
for investment reasons.  
 
4.57.  In addition to new employment allocations, the employment land requirement also includes 
some sites that have already been developed between 2015 and 2018 and other s with planning 
permission.  The  following provides links to  Tables E1 to 8 of Chapter 16  which list the sites with 
planning permission .  The sites have been assessed for their continued deliverability and this 
will be kept under review .

B2: General Industrial; and  
B8: Storage and distribution.  
E(g):  offices, research and developmen t or light industrial.  
 
4.60.  Office  uses are considered town centres uses within national policy . Therefore such proposals 
must satisfy  the requirements set out in Policy 22.  However , in some cases (such as airport 
related offic es and ancillary  offices ) they may be appropriately located on employment sites.  
 
4.61.  The Council will encourage partnership working between employers and local training providers 
to help develop the skills of the Borough’s work force and sections of the commu nity that are 
disadvantaged in the labour market.  Supplementary planning guidance will be adopted to 
support local labour agreements  which will cover the area of Doncaster Borough and will 
include all job vacancies being advertised locally with the suppor t of one of the Council’s 
Business Consultants . 
 
  
                                                           
5 The Local Plan Inspector’s Report concluded that the allocations in the Plan are justified , effective and consistent with 
national policy but that the take up and future demand for different types of employment land will n eed to be kept under 
review an d the Plan updated if necessary.  
  
34   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 4: Employment Policy Areas  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Buildings or land, the use of which fall within Use Classes B2 and/or B8 within  Employment Policy Areas, 
as defined on the Policies  Map, will continue to be supported primarily for these  uses.  Where possible 
existing land and premises used for offices, research and development and light industrial (Use Class 
E(g)) will be retained.  
 
The Council will consider the use of planning conditions  for applications which are for offices, research 
and development or light industrial uses (Use Class E(g)) to ensure that they remain within that use in 
perpetuity.  
 
Other uses will be supported within Employment Policy Areas  provided  the following criter ia are satisfied:  
 
A) It can be clearly demonstrated they support the existing or permitted employment uses on the 
site; or  
 
B) They are a specialist use appropriate to the site; or  
 
C) Are a mix of commercial and/or community uses that provide clear additional ben efits to the 
community.  
 
If one of the above criteria is satisfied, the following should be demonstrate d: 
 
D) Alternative  employment sites are accessible from the locality which are suitable in terms of 
quality and quantity so as to ensure there is still easy  access to employment uses;  
 
E) The proposed  use is appropriate in terms of scale, design and location will not adversely affect 
the operation of adjacent employment land or uses through environmental, amenity or traffic 
problems; and  
 
F) There  is compelling evi dence that the buildings or land are  no longer viable for B2, B8 or E(g) . 
 
Explanation  
4.62.  Employment Policy Areas play an important role in ensuring that there is a range of employment 
land and buildings available to meet employment needs.  It is important th at these sites are 
retained whilst having regard to the NPPF which states that employment land should not be 
protected for employment use if there is no reasonable prospect of the land being used for that 
purpose and that applications for alternative uses of land or buildings should be treated on their 
merits . 
 
4.63.  Any planning application on Employment Policy Areas will need to consider if a  greater level of 
mitigation is required for new proposals to ensure the amenity of surrounding uses are taken 
into accou nt.  Similarly , new development proposals adjacent to or near Employment Policy 
Areas will need to take account of the existing business activities and ensure suitable mitigation 
measures are in place so that businesses can operate efficiently and that nei ghbouring uses are 
compatible.  
 
4.64.  This policy seeks to ensure that any loss of employment land or buildings  still provides 
additional benefits to the community in which it is located.  It is important that other uses are not 
granted permission on employment land just because the land values are more acceptable to 
the applicant.  
 
4.65.  It is imperative that there is compelling evidence that clearly shows that the building or land  is 
no longer viable for employment use.   The applicant will need to demonstrate that th e building 
or land  has been marketed to the Council’s satisfaction for at least 12 months.  This should 
include traditional and web -based marketing as well as regular advertisement in local, regional  
35   [go to Contents ] 
  and national publications as appropriate.  In addition t o this, opportunities to re -let the building  
need to be fully explored.   It should be demonstrated that the building or land  have been 
marketed at a price commensurate with market values (based on evidence from recent and 
similar transactions and deals).  It should also be demonstrated that the terms and conditions 
set out in the lease are reasonable and attractive to potential business and that no reasonable 
offer has been refused.  
 
4.66.  In the past the  Borough has seen  increased pressure on employment sites f or community, 
leisure, specialist retail uses (such as car or caravan showrooms) and service uses which do 
not have specific allocations or which prefer to be on employment sites where business needs 
are met.  However,  these uses will only be permitted wh ere relevant considerations have been 
addressed such as proving demand for the use, passing a sequential test (if relevant), 
addressing highways and parking issues and environmental health concerns . It is recognised 
that the changes to the Use Class Order which came into effect on 1 September 2020 now 
mean that some uses no longer require planning permission to change to a different use.  
Housing Allocations  
4.67.  To help deliver the Spatial Strategy ( Policy 1), meet the needs for ho using ( Policy 2) and 
support sustainable communities, the following policy allocates new site specific housing 
proposals.  It should be read together with the policies in Chapter 6; and Chapter 16  where the 
site specific allocations are found at settlement level . 
 
Policy 5: Housing Allocations (Strategic Policy)  
 
Housing Allocations to deliver the housing requirement and distribution set out  in Policy 2 are shown on 
the Policies  Map and set out in Tables H1(A -O) and Tables H2 (A -Q). 
 
Tables H1(A-O) of Chapter 16 identify sites with planning permission  (as at 1/4/2018) as  Housing (or 
Mixed -use including housing) Allocations that will help deliver the housing requirement .  
 
Tables H2(A -Q) of Chapter 16 identify sites without planning permission  (as at 1/4/2018) as  Housing (or 
Mixed -use including housing) Allocations that will help deliver the housing requirement.  They will be 
developed having regard to both the specified developer requirements set out at Appendix 2 and the 
indicative number of homes specified in Tables H2(A -Q) and at Appendix 2.  Proposals for lower or 
higher densities will be  supported where this would assist in the delivery of a better design solution.  
 
Housing and Mixed -use Allocations will be developed primarily for residential uses (or in the case of 
mixed -use, the uses specified).  Other uses will only be permitted on these sites where they:  
 
A) are small scale and ancillary to the housing;  
 
B) provide a service or other facility mainly for local residents; and  
 
C) would not harm residential amenity or undermi ne the delivery of housing.  
 
Tables H3 (A -E) of Chapter 16 identify sites, shown on the Policies  Map, as designated Potential  
Development Sites.  They are suitable for housing  (or mixed -use including housing) development but are 
not currently considered developable in the plan period.  Housing (or mixed -use including housing) 
development will be supported in accordance with the policies of the Local Plan and will be additional to 
the allocated land supply.  Proposals that would remove the anticipated housing potential will not 
normally be supported unless it is demonstrated that housing is unlikely to be viable.  
 
Explanation  
4.68.  Policies 1 and 2 set the minimum housing requirement of 15,640 net new dwellings (or 920 net 
new dwellings per annum)  over the remaining 17 year plan period  (2018 -2035) , commits to  
36   [go to Contents ] 
  allocating  housing sites to meet this  requirement  and sets out the  distribution of these 
allocations.  Allocations have  been selected having regard to the Spatial Strategy and the 
findings of the site selection methodology.  
 
4.69.  The 2018 Doncaster Residential Land Availability Report  identifies sites with planning 
permission  as at 1 April 2018 with a combined capacity for over 12,600 homes.  Many of these 
sites have commenced development ; their capacity is that which is remaining as at 1 April 2018.  
Sites with permission and remaining capacity of 5+ units are sufficiently la rge to consider as 
potential allocations  towards the Borough’s housing requirement . 
 
4.70.  Of the settlements identified for an indicative housing allocation in line with the Spatial Strategy 
and Settlement Hierarchy , 127 sites with planning permission , with a c ombined  capacity of 
9,149 dwellings , have  been found through the Housing and Employment Land Availability 
Assessment  2018  (HELAA ) to be deliverable and/or developable in the first 15 years  of the Plan 
Period .  One very large permissioned site (Unity  Regene ration Project – see Policy  69) has also 
been found to still be delivering in the last 2 years of the plan period (and beyond) with an 
additional supply of 140 dwellings.  Permissions that had not formally commenced as at 1 April 
2018 have all  been assessed through the Site Selection Methodology  (2019)  as meeting the 
sustainability objectives and Local Plan objectives .  They are therefore allocated to help deliver 
the housing requirement.   In summary, the plan period supply f rom permissioned sites 5+ net 
units remaining equates to 9,289 dwellings (with a further supply beyond the plan period of 
2,085 dwellings).  
 
4.71.  The remaining permissions on sites of 5+ units at the Defined Villages  and those of 1 -4 units 
throughout the Boroug h are not specifically allocated through the Plan, but  have a combined 
capacity of 585 dwellings  and is additional housing land supply to help address the plan period 
requirement.  
 
4.72.  The 2018 HELAA  sets out the evidence for the potential supply of land for n ew housing in 
Doncaster.  Of the supply not permissioned as at 1 April 2018, i t identifies  a deliverable  / 
developable supply far greater than the 2018 -2035  period requirement.  However, much of the 
supply is not without constraints including Green Belt an d high flood  risk (Flood Risk Zone 3) so 
has needed to be considered in more detail through the wider evidence base and the relevant 
stages of the site selection methodology.  
 
4.73.  The Site Selection Methodology (2019) finds  sufficient sites to generally make g ood the 
additional requirement for all of the settlements  in the hierarchy where an allocation is being 
proposed.  Additional to the supply from permissions, the Local Plan makes a further 5 2 
housing allocations that equate s to a total capacity of 6, 825 dwellings, of which the vast majority 
(6,618 units) are developable within the plan period with the remaining 207 units  falling beyond 
the plan period.  
 
4.74.  Combined with the supply from permissioned sites , including small sites across the Borough 
and larger sit es at the Defined Villages , the Local Plan identifies 16,492 new dwellings in the 
plan period (2018 -2035).  Furthermore, there is a supply beyond the plan period of 2, 292 units 
(usually very large sites that are estimated will not completely build out in t he plan period) but it 
is possible that this additional capacity could come forward sooner.   This supply does not 
however include an allowance for windfalls whereby a further 3,000 new homes are identified as 
contributing towards the requirement (see parag raph 4.80 for this).   Table 9 identifies a plan 
period housing supply of 19,492 net new dwellings compared to a plan period requirement of 
15,640 new homes (which is 3,852 dwellings great er, or a supply in excess of nearly 25% 
compared to the requirement).  
 
4.75.  Figure 3 shows the housing trajectory for the plan period based on allocated supply through the 
Local Plan and is exclusive therefore of any wind falls, supply from small permissioned sites 
across the borough, and any commitments at the Defined Villages, nor does it account for any 
housing in line with Policy 6 at the Airport.

  4.76.  The sites allocated in Tables H1 and H2 have been found to be deliverable and/or developable 
through t he HELAA and assessed through the site selection methodology to be the most 
sustainable and deliverable sites to meet the housing allocati on requirement set out in Policy 2.  
Site capacities are indicative rather than minimum s or maximums; where it is demonstrated that 
a different density could support a better design solution this will be supported.  
 
4.77.  Allocations will be expected to be delivered in accordance with their current permissions or the 
developer requirements set out  at Appendix 2.  They  will also be required to comply with all 
other relevant policies  of the Local Plan including those relating to the provision of affordable 
housing, design, provision of green space, addressing flo od risk and so on.  
 
4.78.  The Allocations include a good range of sites in terms of spread across the Borough , Greenfield 
and Brownfield, urban and urban extensions and of different sizes including a number of smaller 
sites which, along with windfall opportuniti es, should encourage the small building firms to 
increase delivery in the Borough .  National policy requires at least 10% of the housing 
requirement to be identified on sites up to 1 hectare in size in the Local Plan  and Brownfield 
Land Registers.  96 of the allocations identified on the Policies Map are on sites up to 1 hectare 
in size and equate  to 1,311 dwellings.   The Local Plan’s housing requirement for the remainder 
of the plan period is 15,640 dwellings so this represents 8.4% of the requirement.  Further to 
this, the 2019 Brownfield Land Register identifies an additional 65 sites totalling 1,009 units on 
sites less than 1 hectare in size which are not proposed as allocations. Collectively this equates 
to a total of 14.8% of the plan period requiremen t of 15,640  dwellings being on small sites less 
than 1 hectare  in size . 
 
4.79.  Potential Development Sites have a capacity of 1,438 dwellings .  This capacity is additional to 
the allocations  capacity.  These are sites  where there is currently doubt about whether  they 
could be developed in the plan period , due to HS2 Safeguarding Route, and/ or where allocation 
cannot be justified in accordance with a sequential approach to addressing flood risk.  The sites 
are however otherwise sustainably located within urban are as and development for housing (or 
mixed -use including housing) would be appropriate if flood risk and other issues can be 
overcome.  New applications will be approved where flood risk sequential and exceptions tests 
and/or other development requirements c an be satisfactorily addressed.  Any completions on 
these sites will contribute to meeting the plan period housing requirement  but have not been 
factored into housing supply . 
 
4.80.  The Council will maintain a 5 -year d eliverable housing land supply throughout th e plan period 
with the requirement being based on the plan period’s 15,640 net new dwellings and taking into 
account any shortfall or over supply against the plan period requirement from the start of the 
plan period in 2018 .  Any shortfall since 2018 will be taken off the requirement for the remainder 
of the plan period and the five year requirement calculated from the residual requirement.  Any 
shortfall since 2018 that needs to be made good will be added to the requirement for the next 
five years.  The 5 -year d eliverable housing land supply will also have the appropriate buffer 
applied  calculated by reference to national policy and guidance .  In line with national policy, 
demonstration of a 5 -year deliverable housing land supply (incorporating a 10% buffer ) as part 
of the Local Plan examination and adoption process , allows for the supply to be fixed from the 
date of the Plan’s adoption for the appropriate period as set out in national policy. The Council 
has demonstrated through the examination process that  there is a 5 -year requirement for the 
period 1 April 2019  – 31 March 2024 of 4,923 dwellings (or 985 dpa). This includes the 
appropriate 10% buffer and factored in completions from year 1 of the plan period which were in 
excess of the 920dpa annualised av erage.  Following robust discounting of supply first and 
foremost, followed by a generous non -implementation allowance of 10% across the supply, a 5 -
year supply of 6,929 dwellings were demonstrated as being deliverable.  This included a total 
windfall allo wance of 600 dwellings for the final 3 years of the period, and so as to avoid double 
counting with extant permissions. This equates to a 7.03 year deliverable housing land supply .  
Windfalls have been a significant supply of housing completions for many y ears ( source: 
Residential Land Availability Reports) averaging 419 per year 1999 -2011; 543 per year 2004 -
11; and 494 per year 2011 -15.  Excluding windfalls on garden land, windfalls 2011 -15 averaged 
424.  The plan period supply has included an  allowance fo r windfalls over the plan period of  
40   [go to Contents ] 
  3,000 dwellings, which is based on 200 per annum from 2020 to avoid double counting with the 
supply from small sites 1 -4 units and at the Defined Villages already contributing towards the 
supply .  Windfalls will  also make a significant contribution to 5-year deliverable supply (although 
the calculation is also adjusted to avoid double counting with extant small permissions at the 
start of the 5 year period  and to exclude windfalls on residential garden land ). 
 
4.81.  It is consi dered that these additional sources of land supply will provide sufficient flexibility to 
deliver the housing land requirement for the plan period and beyond.   The significant additional 
supply also justifies that the requirement has not been adjusted to a llow for a specific lapse rate 
of permissions (either commitments as at 1 April 2018 or future lapses during the plan period). 
Likewise, there is no justification  to provide an additional buffer to the allocated supply (20% is 
sometimes referred to as appr opriate) to provide for non -delivery, choice, longer term housing 
needs, and so forth as the plan identifies such a buffer already through the allocations proposed 
and additional sources of supply. An arbitrary 20% on top would essentially be a buffer to a n 
already buffered supply.  
 
4.82.  The National Planning Policy Framework  encourages the development of suitable brownfield 
sites and a number of brownfield sites have been found to be sustainable and developable and 
so allocated.  The  overall allocation (plan p eriod supply) that is on brownfield sites is 42% 
(6,608  dwellings) . Viability  issues , rather than sustainability, particularly those associated with 
mitigating flood risk, have prevented more brownfield sites forming part of the plan period 
allocated suppl y.  
 
4.83.  The following Table  8 sets out a summary of the allocated housing supply by settlement and

  Chapter 5: Doncaster Sheffield Airport   
 
Introduction  
5.1. Since its closure in 1996, former RAF Finningley has been transformed into a significant 
regional airport.  In the intervening years, Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA) has grown and 
expanded its passenger and cargo operations and is now recognised as an important asset for 
both the Borough and City Region.  
 
5.2. DSA is often referred to as the ‘Gateway to the City Region ’.  The Airport now  forms part of a 
corridor linking DSA to the M18, which incorporates along it the i Port initiative (an intermodal rail 
freight interchange), as well as the large housing redevelopment of the former Rossington 
colliery (1,200 new homes).  Beyond this the M18 links to the A1 and the M1, including to the 
University of Sheffield Advanced Manu facturing Park  in Rotherham , as well as the M180 and 
the Humber ports.  Strategically, both the Airport  and the Borough are therefore well connected, 
both on a local / regional level and to wider national and international routes.  
 
5.3. The potential of this ar ea and the transformational effect it could have on the local and regional 
economy is acknowledged.  
 
5.4. The Airport  is an economic priority both for Doncaster  and for the Sheffield City Region as a 
whole.  The airport corridor  is recognised regionally as a c atalyst for business development, 
inward investment and job creation with regard to logistics, engineering and associated aviation 
activities.  The Doncaster Inclusive Growth Strategy continues to support airport growth 
including expanding the enterprise s ectors and linking to regional growth corridors (such as the 
aforementioned Advanced Manufacturing Park ).  Doncaster Sheffield Airport will play a key role 
in driving the loca l and regional economy forward.  
 
5.5. In March 2018, DSA published its  Growth Plan6, which is said to show “illustrative but realistic” 
plans for development and growth at the Airport  between  2018 and 2037.   This document 
includes plans for:  
 
 Large passenger growth.  
 Growth in cargo operations.  
 The enhan cement of the terminal building.  
 Airside development.  
 Development of the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility, linked to the 
Advance d Manufacturing Research Centre.  
 Ambitions for employment and housing growth around the Airport, as  well as a plaza 
incorporating retail, leisure a nd hotel facilities.  
 A potential future railway station linking to the nearby East Coast Mainline.  
 
5.6. Should the goals of the Growth Plan be realised, there can be little doubt that the Airport  will be 
transformed by 2037.  
 
5.7. The Council is broadly supportive o f the ambitions for the Airport , and recognises the 
importance of this unique asset.  A successful airport brings economic benefits for the Borough 
and the City Region. It opens both up to enhanced business and employment opportunities, and 
                                                           
6 The published name of this growth plan is ‘Masterplan 2018 – 2037 Draft consultation report’   
45   [go to Contents ] 
  increases oppor tunities for international investment, as well as easy access to international 
markets for local businesses.  It can make the Borough a more attractive place for both people 
and business to locate, and provides convenient tourism opportunities for the Borough’s 
residents, as well as opening the Borough and City Region up to, and catering for, in -bound 
visitors  and trade . 
 
5.8. The Council, and local planning policy, broadly supports the published Growth Plan and is 
generally supportive of the aspirations include d within it7; the following policy ensures the 
Council has sufficient overall policy input to ensure that the Airport delivers sustainable and 
carefully planned growth.  
Policy 6: Doncaster Sheffield Airport Policy Area  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Grow th and investment at Doncaster Sheffield Airport (within the Airport Policy Area  defined on the 
Policies Map) will be supported to enable its development and expansion in line with the following 
principles:  
 
A) Aviation  uses and infrastructure required for th e safe operation and growth of operational 
passenger and freight at the Airport  will be supported within the airport operational area , as 
defined on the Policies Map.  Within the Airport Operational Area the following new or enhanced 
infrastructure will be  supported:  
 
1. an expanded passenger  terminal;  
2. additional taxiways, aprons and aircraft stands;  
3. new air cargo transit sheds;  
4. new aircraft ‘Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul’ (MRO) campus and advanced  
  manufacturing research centre;  
5. airside related retail and  catering facilities;  
6. public and staff car parking;  
7. public transport facilities and enhanced services in accordance with an adopted airport  
  travel plan;  
8. training centres for airlines and related services; and  
9. other facilities for general aviation and ass ociated infrastructure.  
 
B) Aviation related development will be permitted within the Airport Operational Area (as shown on 
the Policies Map).  
 
C) Site DSA04 is allocated within the Airport Operational Area for new airside8 employment and 
operational uses only, including:  
 
1. new air cargo transit sheds;  
2. a new aircraft ‘Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul’ (MRO) campus and advanced  
  manufacturing research centre; and  
3. other aviation related development, including aircraft hangars, necessary to be located  
  within the Airport Operational Area.  
 
D) Employment (airport related office only, research and development of product and processes, 
industrial processes, general industrial and storage or distribution) will be supported on allocated 
Site EMP15 & research and developmen t of product s and processes, industrial processes, 
general industrial and storage or distribution on allocated Site EMP05 subject to the requirements 
of Policy 3.  
 
E) Additionally, further employment development will be support ed within Employment Policy Areas 
within the Airport Policy Area for:  
                                                           
7 This document was produced independently and not subject to input from the Council prior to pub lication  
8 ‘Airside’ refers to land within the Airport Operational Area   
46   [go to Contents ] 
   
1. engineering and manufacturing for aerospace and automotive purposes;  
2. supporting activities relating to the operation of the Airport or ancillary to employment  
  areas; and  
3. offices whe re they are aviation related or meet the sequential test requirements of Policy 
  22. 
 
F) An area of 105.5 hectares (as shown on the Policies Map as Sites DSA01 , DSA02 & DSA03 and 
which includes existing woodlands) is identifie d for a mixed use development to support the 
growth of Doncaster Sheffield Airport, help the Airport to realise its economic potential and to 
create the sustainable co -location of employment uses, housing (linked to the delivery of jobs), 
and retail and co mmercial elements within the Airport Policy Area, as per Parts 1 – 3 below. 
These areas will form part of a masterplan exercise (see Part K below) ensuring a co -ordinated 
and integrated approach to place making which links the individual components togethe r: 
 
1. 10 hectares of land (as shown on the Policies Map as Site DSA01 ) is allocated as a  
  central area of retail, commercial and business uses, known as ‘the Plaza’. Within this  
  area will be a new town centre, with approximately 8,500m2 of retail, food an d drink and  
  leisure floorspace; about 8,900m2 of hotel floorspace; approximately 13,600m2 of airport  
  related office floorspace (or offices for businesses who wish to take advantage of being  
  close to an airport); approximately 150 upper floor apartmen ts as well as other community  
  uses and ancillary development to serve the needs of existing and future residents,  
  employment areas and users/staff of the Airport. This area will also include a carefully  
  designed public realm, landscaping, public op en spaces and pedestrianised areas to  
  ensure a high quality and distinctive area which reflects the areas significance as an  
  international gateway to Doncaster. Design will also ensure clear means by which this site  
  will connect to, and can be acce ssed from, adjacent housing and employment sites to  
  prevent piecemeal development or stand -alone retail development. The Plaza  
  development should be the subject of a comprehensive planning application for the  
  whole  site, and this must be accompani ed by a retail assessment to ensure the proposals
  do not  have a significant adverse impact on the Borough’s other town centres. Should any
  subsequent planning application propose a material increase in the scale of proposals, it  
  should be supported by a new retail assessment. Upon substantial completion, the Plaza  
  will assume town centre status and will ultimately be designated as a town centre in  
  accordance with Table 2. 
2. 11 hectares of land (as shown on the  Policies Map as Site DSA02 ) is allocated for  
   housing to accommodate up to 280 dwellings to support initial phases  of airport  
   expansion and employment growth.  
3. An additional area of approximately 70 hectares (as shown on the Policies Map as Site  
  DSA03) is proposed as an Airport Reserve Housing Site and could accommodate up to  
  920 houses.  The release of housing on this site is conditional , being strictly tied to the  
  robustly evidenced delivery of jobs in line with the Airport Growth Plan and as s et out in  
  Part G below.  
 
 
G) Any release of housing in excess of the 280 dwellings allocated on Site DSA02 to support the 
next phases of airport expansion and employment growth will only be permitted on Site DSA03 in 
line with the following principles and m echanisms:  
 
1. The number of jobs created to trigger the release of housing will be on the ratio of 0.11  
  houses for every job created, up to a maximum of 1,200 houses.  This will be net   
  additional jobs in addition to the number of jobs identified by the Council as existing at  
  the Airport as at 2018, plus an annualised share in lieu of the initial tranche of 280  
  houses, as below.   
47   [go to Contents ] 
  2. The allocation of 280 houses will be permitted on Site DSA02  in lieu of 2,5459 FTE jobs  
  in addition to the existing jobs at the Airport.  The delivery of the 2,545 jobs to account for
  the initial housing allocation will be annualised out across the 17 year period (2018 –  
  2035, or a rate of 150 jobs expected per annum – this is called the annualised share).   
  For furthe r housing to be released, the applicant must clearly demonstrate that the level of 
  jobs at the Airport  as at April 2018 has been maintained, and on average, 150 net  
  additional jobs per annum have been created and sustained in addition to this, at the   
  point  of application.  If this can be demonstrated, then any jobs delivered above this  
  figure will trigger a release of housing on the ratio of 0.11 houses per extra job above that
  owed in lieu on Site DSA03 . 
3. Evidence of the number of additional jo bs created (releasing up to a maximum total of  
  920 houses in addition to the initial 280 houses – a maximum of 1,200 houses overall),  
  must be submitted alongside any planning application for residential development within  
  Site DSA03 .  This evidence will be reviewed in an independent report commissioned by  
  the Council and paid for by the applicant. For further housing to be supported, the  
  evidence will need to clearly demonstrate and quantify the provision of net additional full  
  time equivalent jobs delivered within the Airport Policy Area, or via jobs specifically and  
  clearly related to Doncaster Sheffield Airport within the Borough, over and above the  
  number of jobs existing at the Airport  as at 2018 plus the annualised share to account fo r
  the initial  tranche of 280 dwellings, with clear evidence that the additional jobs have  
  already been  delivered.  To be clear, jobs are net, and therefore based on a running total  
  factoring in gains and losses.  
 
H) Development supporting aviation herita ge and training will be located at land north of Hayfield 
Lane (as shown on the Policies Map as ‘Community Facilities: Vulcan Hangar and Training 
Centre’).  
 
I) Access to the Airport must be shown to be compatible with an up to date Airport Surface Access 
Strategy (ASAS) to enable easy access through a range of travel modes from the Borough, City 
Region and the wider region.  Any additional airport passenger car parking should be provided 
within the Airport Policy Area, having regard to improving opportunities to travel to the Airport by 
sustainable transport modes.  There will be a presumption against provision of airport car parking 
in off -site locations outside the Airport Policy Area.  
 
J) The community rail station (on the Lincoln Line and as shown on the Polic ies Map) will continue 
to be protected for such uses.  
 
K) In the interests of ensuring a holistic approach to development, mitigating potential impacts and 
achieving a high quality, well designed and sustainable place, development proposals must be 
informed b y comprehensive airport area -wide masterplanning (henceforth known as the 
‘masterplan exercise’).  This must include production of an agreed design code for the housing 
areas (Sites DSA02  & DSA03 ), to be prepared in advance of any development on this land.   The 
masterplan exercise and design code must be prepared in collaboration with the Council, 
landowners, airport operator, with the wider engagement of stakeholders and the local 
community, with further details about component parts provided in paragraphs  5.15 - 5.41 below . 
 
L) Development proposals must satisfy the requirements of all other relevant policies of the 
Development Plan and respect the following specific devel opment guidelines:  
 
                                                           
9 280 houses = 2545 jobs using a ratio of 0.11:1

1. Within the following safeguarding areas planning applications are required to be the  
  subject of consultation with the Airport:  
 13 km radius bird strike hazard area for development proposals likely to attract  
birds (as  shown on the Policies Map);  
 A building and structure height safeguarding area of 15km with some extensions  
to the north and south related to take offs and landings (as shown on the Policies  
Map)10, and  
 a 30 km radius circle of critical airspace centred on the Airport (w hich covers the  
whole of the Borough) that needs to be safeguarded against any harmful effects of  
wind farms11. 
Within such areas, the height and location/design of development that creates a bird  
  hazard and location of wind farms may be restricted.  Dev elopment that could affect the  
  operational integrity or safety of traffic services of the Airport or its surveillance systems  
   will not be permitted.  
2. A Strategic Delivery Plan will be required to enable a full assessment of the transport  
  implicatio ns and identification of timely future interventions required to support and  
  facilitate delivery of the masterplan.  
 
M) Development within the Airport Policy Area will be informed by a Green Infrastructure (GI) 
Strategy which protects the component assets a nd enhances the GI network through planned 
interventions (e.g. habitat creation and restoration) and appropriate land management.  The GI 
Strategy will be developed in conjunction with the Local Authority and other relevant 
stakeholders, alongside wider ma sterplanning as above.  The GI Strategy will prevent the 
fragmentation and isolation of existing ecological assets, particularly established woodlands and 
grasslands, and allow and enable species movement through and around the Airport Policy Area.  
Develo pment proposals must demonstrate how they deliver a net gain for biodiversity and 
enhance the ecological network in accordance with the Green Infrastructure Strategy.  
 
 
Explanation  
5.9. National policy12 recognises the importance of Airports and their potential to contribute to  
economic growth at both national and regional level.  The UK’s air links make it one of the best 
connected countries in the world, and the government is keen to continue this.  The growth and 
importance of airports outside London is acknow ledged and encouraged . However , national 
guidance also recognises the potential for airports to have both positive and negative impacts , 
with airport expansion to be “judged on their individual merits, taking careful account of all 
relevant considerations,  particularly economic and environmental impacts”.  
 
5.10.  The primary function and purpose of the Airport is as a passenger and freight terminal.  As 
such, of fundamental importance is the maintenance and improvement of this airport function 
itself.  Development  of “airside” land inside the Airport Operational Area is supported for aviation 
development and aviation infrastructure.  Other functions solely related to the functionality of the 
Airport include  airside operation s and public safety.  
                                                           
10 This includes land both inside and outside of the Borough. The Policies Map only shows the portion of this radius within 
Doncaster.  
11 As this covers  and applies to the whole Borough, it is not shown on the Policies Map.

49   [go to Contents ] 
  Airside Operations  
5.11.  Certain development within the A irport Operational Area boundary benefit from permitted 
development13.  Development requiring planning permission related to the airport function is 
supported for the types listed on land within the Airport Operational Area boundary  (see Figure 
5). 
Public Safety  
5.12.  Doncaster Sheffield Airport is protected through the process of aerodrome safeguarding14.  
Within this area, as defined on the Policies Map  (for the parts falling within the Boroug h of 
Doncaster) , the Airport must be consulted on planning applications.  Safeguarding areas are 
maintained to allow the Airport to operate safely . 
 
5.13.  It is important that development at the Airport does  not have an impact on the continuity of safe 
operation s.  These include: the maintenance of airspace through which aircraft fly; protecting 
the integrity of radar and other electronic aid from interference; protecting visual aids, such as 
runway lighting;  and avoiding any increase in the risk of bird strike.  
 
5.14.  Land uses or tall structures which would prejudice air safety will not be permitted within the 
‘safeguarding area’.  Additionally, it is envisaged that a Public Safety Zone will be designated at 
each end of the runway  over the course of the Plan Period , within which development will be 
restricted , in accordance with the approach set out within DfT Circular 1/2010 or any successor 
guidance, in order to control the number of people on the ground at risk of death or injury in the 
event of an aircraft accident  on take –off or landing.  It includes a general presumption against 
new or replacement development or change of use of existing buildings within Public Safety 
Zones , when defined .  No new residential development will be permitted within these zones.  
Airpor t Masterplan  Exercise  
5.15.  The Council is keen to support the growth of Doncaster Sheffield Airport .  However , it must also 
ensure this is done in a considered and balanced manner, in order that any growth is delivered 
in a sustainable way, and with potential n egative impacts suitably mitigated.  
 
5.16.  In order to achieve this, the Council , through Policy 6, is supportive of the multi -use growth of 
the Airport, in line with the development of a comprehensive airport wide masterplan  exerc ise, 
which will be prepared in collaboration between the Council , landowners, airport operator, with 
wider engagement of stakeholders and the local community.15 
 
5.17.  The masterplan  exercise  will ensure a holistic approach to development at the Airport, and  
ensu re that the various elements are brought together in a carefully considered and well thought 
out manner, as opposed to a piecemeal approach which could result in a poorly integrated, 
disconnected series of developments.  This is particularly important give n the release 
mechanism for housing and the aspirations for a central plaza which will serve the needs of 
local residents.  
 
5.18.  The masterplan exercise will consist of an overall growth plan, and a well -considered place -
making vision and strategy covering area s identified for airport operations, employment 
development, the new local centre, transport infrastructure, green infrastructure, ecology areas, 
open space and new housing areas.  It will need to demonstrate how the various land uses will 
be conceptually and physically integrated, particularly in terms of transport connectivity and the

50   [go to Contents ] 
  creation of a high  quality mixed use place.  It will need to clearly establish a delivery framework 
and phasing plan in order to meet these requirements.  
 
5.19.  Of particular impo rtance are the need to consider the following issues.  
Archaeology  
5.20.  As part of satisfying other development policies within the Local Plan the impact on the heritage 
assets in the vicinity of the Airport will  need to be assessed including the impact on any 
archaeology that may be present.  A study of aerial photography and other archival sources has 
shown that there are likely to be archaeological remains present on the allocated airport sites 
south and west of the runway, of up to r egional or higher signific ance.  A detailed archaeological 
evaluation of these sites will be required to determine the extent, nature, date, and condition of 
any archaeological remains present, and to establish their significance which will then inform 
the layout and design of futu re proposals.  
Design  
5.21.  The overriding intention of the proposed masterplan  exercise  is to provide a well-designed and 
carefully thought out scheme, however there are specific design requirements which must be 
taken into account.  
 
5.22.  Overall the scheme should ac hieve high quality development with distinctive design for all new 
buildings and spaces, reflective of the area ’s significance as an international gateway to 
Doncaster, the Sheffield City Region, and beyond.  This is especially important for the central 
plaza and all  development adjacent to the Great Yorkshire Way.  
 
5.23.  A comprehensively connected scheme should be created for both the movement of people as 
well as ecological movements.  This includes connectivity through the individual developments 
and integrat ion with existing local networks.  
 
5.24.  It must be ensured that the masterplan exercise and design code is designed, phased and 
delivered to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for employment, living and community 
interaction, including recreation, nature  and open space throughout the course of the 
development.  
Environmental Management  
5.25.  The approved masterplan must include as a major element, a Green Infrastructure Strategy .  
The G reen Infrastructure  strategy should clearly set out how the important ecologi cal and 
landscape features are identified in relation to biodiversity, landscape character and green 
space provision.  
 
5.26.  The ecological secti on of the Green Infrastructure S trategy shall identify how biodiversity will be 
protected and enhanced to deliver a b iodiversity net gain.  The application of the mitigation 
hierarchy will provide a means by which development impacts on biodiversity (habitats, species 
and ecological networks) will be accounted for, and avoided, mitigated, or, as a final resort , 
compensat ed, in line with the GI Strategy and within the context of the Airport Masterplan.   Off-
site biodiversity enhancement utilising the DEFRA biodiversity Metric , in line with Policy  29, will 
be required where a biodiversity net  gain cannot be secured as part of a development proposal.  
 
5.27.  The direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts associated with the Airport’s 
development and operation  need to be understood and addressed, including those to human 
health (such as nois e and air quality), biodiversity and wider environmental degradation.   In 
particular, Thorne and Hatfield Moors are internationally important, rain -fed, wetland nature 
reserves and are inherently susceptible to degradation associated with pollution and poo r air 
and water quality.   Detailed consideration, including through a Habitat Regulation Assessment, 
will need to be given to the air quality impacts of future increases in flights and any other  
51   [go to Contents ] 
  activity.   The land take of the Airport and its  associated de velopment will result in the significant 
loss of habitats, including priority habitats,  impacts on priority species , and the functioning and 
connectivity of ecological networks.  Proposals will need to account for their impacts, follow the 
mitigation hiera rchy and deliver strategic biodiversity compensation in -line with an agreed 
airport Green Infrastructure Strategy that delivers the Lawton principles of ‘bigger, better, more 
and joined’ habitats16. 
Employment  
5.28.  The allocated employment sites will provide opp ortunities for companies specialising in 
engineering and manufacturing for aerospace and automotive purposes to cluster around the 
Airport, providing highly skilled jobs  and affirming the Airport’s key role within the city region 
innovation corridor .  The Airport Plaza also offers an opportunity for aviation related office uses 
to locate there , or offices for businesses who wish to take advantage of being close to an  
airport .  Outside of the plaza (Site DSA01 ), office proposals at the airport would need to show 
they are necessary to su pport aviation services or they can meet the sequential tests and 
impact assessments as set out in Policy  22.  Regard should also be had to Policy 3 which 
requires the developer/  applicant to enter into a local  labour agreement which will help to 
develop the skills  of the Borough’s workforce.   
 
5.29.  The masterplan exercise must  also take account of employment development and, as with 
housing, it should set out the design expectations, principles and parameters which new 
applications will need to follow.  Regard will need to be given to issues such as public access 
including pedestrian links and cycle routes.  There may also be a need for a lorry park in line 
with Policy 15.  
Housing  
5.30.  In relation to the housing, the masterplan exercise will include a comprehensive design code 
which will clearly set out the design expectations, principles and parameters which new 
applications for housing will co nform to.  This is important to co -ordinate a large phased housing 
scheme which may be delivered by a number of developers.  The design code must be 
produced and agreed by the Council  prior to any application on Sites DSA02  and DSA03 .  In 
developing the ma sterplan exercise and design  code, the applicants must adhere to other 
relevant Local Plan policies and Supplementary Planning Documents.  As a gateway site to the 
region, it is important that the design of buildings and landscaping are of high quality.  The 
housing will also be subject to wider Local Plan policies which will be important to ensure that a 
proportionate amount will be delivered as affordable housing given some airport related jobs will 
be lower paid.  
 
5.31.  Further information on the release mechan ism for housing on Sites DSA02  and DSA03  is 
available in Appendix 3. 
Retail and Commercial  
5.32.  To ensure the sustainable growth of the Airport and adjoining employment and housing areas , 
the provision within Site DSA01  of a central plaza to provide new services and community 
facilities is supported.  This area will accommodate a mix of retail, leisure, food and drink, hotel 
provision, office space and community facilities  to serve the needs primarily of existing and 
future residents, employees in the area and visitors , as well as the needs arising from the 
growth of the Airport .  A modest amount of housing above retail units is supported in the 
interests of making good use of space, and supporting the vitality of the plaza, particularly the 
evening economy .  Within any such development there should be opportunities to link the area 
to the wider network to ensure good public transport links and a safe and secure walking and

  cycling routes are integrated where it would not lead  to unsustainable trip generation for users  
and help develop a thriving community.  
 
5.33.  This area is allocated to serve the needs of local communities, employees and users of the 
Airport and its surrounding employment areas.  As such, development within Site DSA01  akin to 
an out of town retail park facility will not be permitted.  
 
5.34.  The status of the plaza will be kept under review.  Upon substantial completion, the plaza will 
assume town centre status and will be ultimately designated as a town centre in accorda nce 
with Table 2.  The type of centre it is assessed as being will depend on how the scheme 
evolves over time.  
Transport  
5.35.  Ensuring sustainable multi -modal access is a fundamental element of successful growth at the 
Airport.  The masterplan exercise must  consider transport  requirements in relation to an up to 
date Airport Surface Access Strategy (ASAS).  The ASAS should be regularly reviewed and 
looks to develop, implement and promote sustainable surface access to the Airport to facilitate  
long term growth and to maximise the opportunities for inclusive transport access.  
 
5.36.  Surface access to the site must consider both the impact of vehicle trips on the highway 
network and ensure access by sustainable modes.  Prioritisat ion of modal access must be 
compliant with the NPPF, considering the needs of pedestrians and cyclists and public transport 
accessibility.  The masterplan exercise should  ensure opportunities for sustainable transport are 
maximised and provide safe and sec ure access by all modes.  Car parking requirements should 
be line with an up to date ASAS and relevant standards set out in Appendix 6, considering the 
need for a balanced approach to ensure effective demand management  and be justified by 
need as agreed by the Local Authority.  
 
5.37.  The masterplan exercise must include  a full assessment of the transport implications and 
identification of timely, future interventions required to support and facilitate delivery of the 
developm ent.  Significant impacts arising from the proposed development on the transport 
network m ay require mitigation measures.  
 
5.38.  A community station on the Lincoln Line (the extent of which is shown on the Policies Map) can 
provide rail connectivity to the airpo rt albeit requiring a shuttle connection. The land associated 
with this proposal has been protected to ensure delivery of a station can be achieved in line with 
the Section 106 Agreement for the airport which protects this site for such a use.  
 
5.39.  Doncaster Council is currently working with Doncaster Sheffield Airport, Sheffield City Region, 
Department for Transport, Network Rail and Transport for the North to further plans for a new 
station at Doncaster Sheffield Airport  which connects to both the East Coast  Main Line and the 
Lincoln Line.  Emerging evidence shows that this is a preferred alternative to the Lincoln Line 
station, but the scheme is yet to secure funding at the point of Plan adoption . 
 
5.40.  The introduction of a new station , and associated improvemen ts to the rail lines , will support the 
growth and investment at the Airport and beyond.  This would provide transformational 
connectivity to the Airport , the wider Airport Policy Area and beyond, whilst also providing an 
alternative to Doncaster Central St ation for passengers needing to access Mainline services. It 
will not only expand the travel catchment for air passengers, but also introduc e a new 
sustainable mode of travel to access the Airport, with the potential to significantly reduce car 
usage.   Should plans for the East Coast Main Line station be realised, relevant sections of the 
Local Plan related to this will be reviewed in light of the potential significance of this proposal. 
Likewise, the Council may be willing to agree a variation to the Secti on 106 Agreement with 
respect to the Lincoln Line community rail station, although there may be wider benefits still to 
retaining the site as a secondary station, including to support tram -train links to the Airport. See 
also Policy 12.  
53   [go to Contents ] 
  Other  
5.41.  It is likely that land will be required to be safeguarded for a primary school in this location, and 
the impact of development on schools will need to be monitored and managed accordingly.

  Chapter 6: Meeting the Need for New Homes  
 
Introduction  
6.1. The policies and proposals in this chapter should be read alongside Policies 1 and 2, which set 
out the overall approa ch to meeting housing need and supporting sustainable communities , and 
Policy 5 which identifies specif ic new housing sites .  Together they seek to ensure that enough 
homes are built within Doncaster, of the right type and in  the right locations , to meet the 
‘Objectively Assessed Need ’ for new homes and other objectives of the Local Plan.  Policies 
also address the management of new development within existing residential areas and the 
specific accommodation needs of Gypsies a nd Travellers.  
 
6.2. The Local Plan will support and work alongside the Council’s Housing Strategy to: bring existing 
housing (council and private) up to decent homes standard; reduce the number of empty 
properties; deliver more housing and affordable housing o n Council -owned land and , through a 
range of national and local housing delivery initiatives , ensure that vulnerable people have 
access to suitable housing and support services so they can live independently within their 
communities.  
 
Policy 7: Delivering the Necessary Range of Housing (Strategic Policy)  
 
The delivery of a wider range and mix of housing types, sizes and tenures will be supported through the 
following measures:  
 
A) New housing developments will be required to deliver an appropriate  mix of house size, type 
and tenure to address housing needs and market demand, having regard to the Council’s latest 
Housing Needs Study or other robust and up -to-date evide nce. 
 
B) There is a clear requirement for the provision of affordable housing to meet  local needs in the 
majority of the Borough’s communities.  Housing sites of 15 or more homes (or 0.5 Ha or 
above) will normally be expected to include 23% affordable homes in the Borough’s high value 
housing market areas (as defined in explanatory text be low), or a lower requirement of 15% 
elsewhere in the Borough (including starter homes / discounted market sales housing which 
meet the definition in the NPPF) on -site.  Of this, there should be a tenure split of around 75% 
affordable homes for rent (includ ing social rent) and 25% intermediate low -cost home 
ownership.  Proposals for affordable housing on developments  of less than 15 units will be 
supported where these meet other development plan policies . 
 
C) Commuted sums in lieu of on -site affordable housing provision and of broadly equivalent value 
will only be accepted where this is robustly justified which would include where there is already 
an identified surplus of affordable housing within the community.  These commuted sums will be 
used to target areas of need in the Borough in order to assist  with rebalancing the housing 
market.  They may also be combined with council house building programmes that would take 
place on land that the Council owns or subsequently needs to acquire.  
 
D) In order  to provide the necessary housing supply required for the changing needs of residents 
and to support independent living, new developments should include the provision of homes 
which are adaptable , accessible, and suitable for people with a wide range of needs in line with  
Policy 45.  It must also be demonstrated how the provision of housing types suitable for older 
people can be increased, especially bungalows, extra care facilities and supported living 
accommodation.  These will be supporte d on sites suitable for housing and which have good 
access to local services and facilities by means other than private car.  
 
E) Specialist student accommodation will be supported on sites with walk/cycle and/or public 
transport access to Doncaster College or  other training facilities.  Wherever possible, commuted  
57   [go to Contents ] 
  sums  relating to such accommodation will be used to target areas of need in the Borough . 
 
The provision of opportunities to accommodate custom build and self -build homes will be encouraged  on 
housing  allocations and elsewhere.  
 
Explanation  
6.3. The NPPF aims to significantly boost the supply of homes.  It requires that the needs of groups 
with specific housing requirements are addressed, including , amongst others , affordable 
housing, family housing, older  persons housing, student accommodation, housing for people 
with disabilities, travellers (see Policy 11), and  those who wish to self -build . 
 
6.4. Delivering more homes, including more affordable homes, is a key Government priori ty which is 
also reflected within the  City Region and in Doncaster.  The need for more affordable homes is 
articulated through the Doncaster Housing Strategy 2015 -2025 and reflected in the Living 
theme of Don caster Growing Together (DGT).  The Council has an existing programme of 
delivering affordable housing to meet local housing need through both direct delivery of new 
Council houses and an ongoing Housing Asso ciation Development Programme.  In delivering 
these programmes the Council and its partners maxi mise external funding opportunities where 
applicable – primarily through our work with Homes England.  
 
6.5. There remains, however, an unmet need for which we must plan over the coming years.  It is 
essential that the future programme is informed by a detailed evidence base of affordable 
housing requirements, including types and locations, along with robust needs information.  The 
future delivery programme will aim to meet the varied housing needs of our residents by 
delivering a range of property types includin g, but not limited to, accommodation for:  
 
 General n eeds  
 Older people  
 Care l eavers  
 Adults with learning disabilities and a utism  
 Physical d isabilities linking to the Accessible Housing Register  
 Homeless / at risk of h omeless ness   
 
6.6. The creation of the futur e programme will clearly articulate how the delivery programme will 
contribute to the wider Transformation Programme objectives across the Council.  
 
6.7. The Economic Forecasts and Housing Need Assessment (June 2018) establishes the 
Borough’s housing requiremen t.  Following on from this, the 2019 Housing Need Study 
identifies the size, types and tenures required across the Borough, and also identifies affordable 
housing need, older peoples housing needs, and the housing needs of people with disabilities.  
The Co uncil is committed to keeping such evidence up -to-date to identify any changes in 
housing need during the plan period and will undertake a Housing Needs Assessment at least 
every 4 years to inform both planning applications and a review of the Plan itself.  
 
6.8. With regards to type and size, this report finds that whilst proportions vary across the Borough, 
generally the greatest need identified  is for 3 bed houses, followed by larger 4+ bed houses and 
2 bed bungalows .  Appendix 4 sets out  the main findings from the Study in terms of dwelling 
type and mix by each of the settlements identified in the top 3 tiers of the settlement hierarchy.  
This evidence should help inform applicant’s drawing up planning applicat ions of the need for 
certain house types and mix by area, including areas where there is already an oversupply of 
certain house types.  
 
6.9. Affordable homes can be social rented, affordable rented, intermediate , starter and discounted 
market sales homes provid ing homes to eligible households whose needs are not met by the 
market.  The 2019 Housing Need Study identifie d that overall, 209 affordable units are required 
per year over and above the Council’s own build programmes, which equates to 23% of the  
58   [go to Contents ] 
  Borough ’s housing target .  However, this assessment does not factor in what levels of 
affordable housing have been secured already through commitments  as it is just a percentage 
of the annual housing target of 920 net new homes.   Nor does it consider whether the t arget is 
appropriate to adopt as a policy requirement as it  takes no account of viability where national 
policy is clear that whatever requirement set through policy must be justified in terms of whole 
plan viability .  The ratio between affordable homes fo r rent and low cost home ownership is 
75%:25%.  
 
6.10.  The Doncaster Local Plan Viability Testing (2016) evidence base assessed a series of 
hypothetical housing sites across the Borough’s housing market areas in line with national 
policy and the best practice gui dance.  The 2019 Viability Testing Update to  this evidence al so 
revised  the typologies before modell ing a number of actual L ocal Plan allocations.  The 
conclusion being that development sites in the Borough’s high and medium value areas are 
generally viable with a 23% affordable housing requirement when considered in conjunction 
with other Local Plan policy asks.  However, sites within the Borough’s low value areas come 
under greater viability pressure.  The evidence therefore recommends that it is more 
appropriate to adopt a reduced affordable housing requirement of 15% in the se parts of the  
Borough .  Appendix 5 identifies the Borough’s two a ffordable housing requirement policy areas 
for the purposes o f this policy.  
 
6.11.  Affordable housing should be provided on site, unless off -site provision or  an appropriate  
financial contribution in lieu can be robustly justified, and the agreed approach contributes to the 
objective of creating mixed and balanced communi ties.  Such justification could include where 
the Housing Needs Assessment, or other robust and up -to-date evidence, has identified that 
there is already a surplus of affordable housing in a community (see Appendix 4).  Where a 
commuted sum is deemed appropriate, wherever possible this should be utilised to target areas 
of need in the borough in order to assist with rebalancing the housing market. This is to ensure 
that the policy provides much needed affordable hou sing to meet the needs of the area 
providing local housing for local people . 
 
6.12.  This policy seeks to ensure that the mix of house types and tenures addresses the particular 
needs of Doncaster residents; these are detailed in the 2019 Housing Needs Study but other 
assessments and evidence will emerge over the plan period.  The most recent Housing Needs 
Study  and Housing Design Standards Policy Evidence Paper 2019 shows there is a need for 
less bedrooms, more bungalows, homes suitable for older and/or  disabled people  or which are 
easily adaptable, supported living  and extra care facilities  and executive homes. Larger sites will 
be expected to include a good mix of house types to help create balanced communities and 
reflect identified needs, and should also consi der whether parcels of land on such sites can be 
reserved for identified demand for self and custom build plots . 
 
6.13.  The provision of bespoke student accommodation to house expected increases in student 
numbers over the plan period is under active considerati on and will also help reduce pressure 
on the existing housing stock.  
 
Policy 8: Removal of Occupancy Conditions  
 
The removal of occupancy conditions on dwellings will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances 
where it can be demonstrated,  via an independent report, that:  
 
A) There is no longer a long -term need for the dwelling on the particular enterprise on which the 
dwelling is located; and  
 
B) Unsuccessful attempts have been made to sell or rent the dwelling at a price that takes account 
of the occupancy condition.  
 
  
59   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
6.14.  There may be instances where a dwelling for a rural worker, in either the Countryside Policy 
Area or Green Belt, is no longer needed.  Proposals to remove occupancy conditio ns need to 
demonstrate there is no longer a need for the dwelling on the particular enterprise on  which the 
dwelling is located, either due to changes in the nature of the business or that the business is 
no longer viable.  Applications should be accompanied by an independent report to demonstrate 
that unsuccessful attempts have been made to sell or rent the dwelling at a reasonable price, 
for a continuous period of at least 12 months prior to the application being made to remove the 
condition.  This should take into account the occupancy condition a nd include offering the 
property at a price based on the average of at least 3 written valuations and at a price at least 
30% less than normal market value.  Unless there are special circumstances to justify restricting 
the dwelling to the particular enter prise where the dwelling is located, an occupancy condition is 
likely to allow occupation by other workers in the locality.  In this case it should be considered 
whether there is other demand locally, not just whether the demand for this particular enterpr ise 
has ceased.  
 
Policy 9: Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)  
 
The growth in the number of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) in parts of the Borough has led to 
significant impacts on existing communities linked to the over concentration of people and pressures on 
local infrastructure.  There are also concerns around the quality of living for occupants of these 
dwellings.  Proposals for HMOs will only be supported under very strict circumstances where:  
 
A) the internal standards of the proper ty are suitable for multiple occupation , including bedrooms 
with good soundproofing, privacy , outlook, light, ventilation and have good communal facilities  
for washing, preparation and consumption of food ; 
 
B) external communal areas and facilities are of sufficient  size and standard to satisfactorily 
accommodate waste and recycling bins, safe and secure cycle storage and on -site parking 
(unless it can be demonstrated that the site is sustainably located and therefore justifies 
reduced levels of on -site parkin g); 
 
C) the overall size of the dwelling is sufficient to provide proper and adequate accommodation and 
living space for the number of residents intended to be accommodated;  
 
D) the existing dwelling or building is capable of conversion without causing harm to t he area or the 
amenity of nearby residents particularly with noise and disturbances or over -looking  and, in 
areas of flood risk, do not result in ground -floor or basement level self -contained rooms;  and 
 
E) the proposal would not result in an over -concentrati on of HMOs within a  
community/ locality /street/row, or result in a significant adverse impact to local amenities .  
Proposals must not create:  
 
1. more than two HMOs side by side;  or 
2. the sandwiching of a single self -contained house or flat between two HMOs; or  
3. more than two HMOs within a run of twenty properties on one side of the road; or  
4. more than one HMO in a road of fewer than twenty properties on one side of the road.  
 
The Council will utilise all of its powers available, including licensing and enforcemen t, to ensure the 
negative impacts of HMOs are managed and that our communities are not negatively impacted by the 
provision of such accommodation.  
 
 
  
60   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
6.15.  A House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) is defined as a house or flat occupied by a certain 
numbe r of unrelated individuals who share basic amenities and is classified by the Use Class 
Order.  HMOs  can play an important role in meeting the housing need of a range of groups, 
including students, temporary work -training students, young professionals and individuals on 
low incomes.  However , all too often such accommodation has unintended and unacceptable 
consequences for the established community as HMOs can have a high turnover of occupiers. 
Issues include insufficient car parking, problems with refuse d isposal and collection, 
overcrowding, noise, and in some cases anti -social behaviour .  This policy will be applied to 
known HMOs (be they licensed, non -licensed with planning permission or those created under 
permitted development) as well as others brough t to the Council’s attention.  Part E of the policy 
will be applied on a community -wide basis taking into account the impact on rows of houses, 
streets and the wider area.  For the avoidance of doubt, this could include consideration of 
multiple streets an d rows of properties including corner premises and need not be limited to one 
road at a time.  
 
6.16.  It is important that any proposals that do accord with this policy are delivered without detriment 
to existing communities , properties and businesses in the area .  This can best be achieved 
through preventing the over concentration of such properties in particular areas and 
encouraging a more even distribution across the Borough .  Proposals that lead to self -contained 
rooms at ground floor or basement level in are as at risk of flooding are unlikely to be supported 
as such accommodation must be able to provide satisfactory mitigation against residual flood 
risk and there are likely to be challenges around providing a safe point of refuge.  
 
6.17.  The Council is fully aware  of the issues that HMOs can create, and the impact they can have on 
existing established communities when poorly managed.  As such, the Council is committed to 
tackling and managing the problems that proliferation of such housing can cause.  This includes  
various Council Departments, for example Planning, Enforcement and Licensing; the Licensing 
Scheme and Article 4 Direction that are utilising powers of the Housing Act and Town and 
Country Planning Order to address housing issues identified.  The Council has given notice of 
the “making” of an Article 4 Direction on 9 August 2018.  The Direction relates to developments 
comprising of changes of use from dwelling  houses (Class C3) to HMOs (Class C4) and applies 
to land within the areas of Town, Town Fields, W heatley, Hexthorpe, Balby, Wheatley Hills, 
Intake and Belle Vue (the exact boundary is shown on the Policies Map).  The Direction comes 
into force 14 October 2019 (subject to confirmation), and removes permitted development rights 
for this type of developm ent i.e. planning permission will be required.  The Council has also 
introduced additional licensing, which applies to certain HMOs not already covered by 
mandatory HMO licensing, which came into effect 1 October 2018.  
 
Policy 10: Residential Policy Areas  
 
Within Residential Poli cy Areas, as defined on the Policies  Map:  
 
A) New residential development will be supported provided:  
 
1. the development would provide for an acceptable level of residential amenity for both  
  new and existing residents; and 
2. the development would help protect and enhance the qualities of the existing area and  
   contribute to a safe, healthy and prosperous neighbourhood; and  
3. the development would meet other development plan policies including those relating to  
flood risk , open space, design and sustainable construction.  
 
The establishment or increase  of non -residential uses of appropriate scale will be permitted provided 
they would not cause unacceptable loss of residential amenity through, for example, excessive traffic,  
noise, fumes, smells or unsightliness.  
  
61   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
6.18.  The Policies  Map defines not just housing allocations, the main location s for new homes, but 
also Residential Policy Areas which cover the majority of  existing residential areas in the 
Borough and which continue to be locations for significant new housing infill and other forms of 
‘windfall ’ development.  They are predominantly , but not exclusively , comprised of residential 
properties  often includ ing small businesses, shops, community facilities, resident ial institutions  
and other uses which can meet local needs in a sustainable way and contribute to the variety 
and attractiveness of residential areas . 
 
6.19.  Proposals for residential development are acceptable in principle subject to the criteria of this 
and ot her relevant development plan policy.  For example, s ome small areas of open space are 
washed over by Residential Policy Area but can have an important amenity, biodiversity or play 
space function and will not be appropriate for development.  Windfall prop osals in Flood Zones 
2 and 3 (as defined by the Environment Agency’s Maps) are , unlike housing allocations , 
required to pass a flood sequential test (see Policy 57).  
 
Policy 11: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelli ng Show People (Strategic Policy)  
 
The assessed accommodation needs of Gypsies , Travellers and Travelling Show People should be met 
on existing sites / yards with capacity in the Borough, and by maintain ing a five year supply of sites 
across the Plan Perio d: 
 
A) All sites listed in Table 10, and shown on the Policies Map, are sites with a capacity of 5 or 
more pitches / yards, and are designated as Gypsy and Traveller or Travelling Showpeople 
sites.  The establishment or  re-establishment of pitches  / yards on vacant plots or unused land 
within these designations will be supported . 
 
B) Within the Plan’s defined development limits, proposals for new sites, or site extensions, will be 
supported on sites suitable for residential  development and, in the case of travelling show 
people, for storage of their equipment . 
 
C) Proposals for new sites outside of development limits and the Green Belt will be supported 
where there is an unmet need established in the latest Gypsy, Traveller and  Travelling 
Showpeople’s Needs Assessment (GTANA  / TSPANA), the sites are in accordance with the 
principl es set out in D and  F, and the proposal is for : 
 
1. 5 or more  pitches/yards (provided the scale of the site would not dominate the nearest  
   settled comm unity); or  
2. a smaller extension to, or intensification of, an existing well managed site ; or 
3. a smaller site that makes effective use of brownfield land . 
 
 Small extensions to, or intensification of, an existing well managed site may be supported where 
there is no overall unmet need, if there is a demonstrable need specific to the family on site, and 
the proposal accords with all other relevant parts of the policy.  
 
D) Proposals for new sites or pitches  / yards will be required to demonstrate : 
 
1. there will be no  significant harm to the built or natural heritage including trees,   
  hedgerows,  and biodiversity;  
2. there will be no significant harm to local amenity, infrastructure or agriculture;  
3. there is safe and convenient access to the highway network;  
4. the site is close to, or has good public access to, key services including schools, medical  
  facilities and shops;  
5. there is sufficient space for the planned number of caravans, commercial vehicles, play  
  space, amenity blocks, parking and the safe movement of vehi cles; and  
6. the site is within , or can be well integrated into, the local townscape in a manner in - 
 keeping with the local character, using boundary treatments and screening materials   
62   [go to Contents ] 
   which are sympathetic to the existing urban or rural form.  High fences  or large walls  
 should be avoided wherever possible to prevent the impression that the site is being 
deliberately separated from the rest of the community.  
 
E) Proposals for mixed residential and business use sites will be required to demonstrate that the 
site is suitable having regard to the safety and amenity of the occupants and neighbouring 
residents  
 
F) Proposals for transit Gypsy and Traveller facilities will be required to  show that :  
 
1. there is a demonstra ble need for such facilities;  
2. there is convenient  access to the road network;  and 
3. the proposal meets the requirements of D 1), 2), 3)  and 6). 
 
Explanation  
6.20.  The Local Plan seeks to meet the housing need of all its residents including the specialist 
accommodation needs  of those gypsies and travellers who ha ve a traditional nomadic way of 
life requir ing traveller caravan sites , which in turn requires a specific planning policy approach . 
 
6.21.  National Planning Policy for Traveller Sites  (August 2015) highlights that the traditional and 
nomadic way of life of Gypsi es, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople should be facilitated 
whilst respecting the interests of the settled community.  Local Planning Authorities should 
make their own assessment of need and set targets for pitches and yards.  A supply of specific 
deliverable sites should be identified to provide 5 years’ supply against the target.  
 
6.22.  This policy should be read in conjunction with the latest local evidence on Gypsies, Traveller 
and Travelling Showpeople.  This can be found in the Doncaster Gypsy  and Travel ler 
Accommodation Needs Assessment (GTANA) and the Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Needs Assessment (TSPANA).   The Council will monitor and periodically update this evidence 
across the plan period.  The 2018 report identifies that the Borough has a sur plus of 274 pitches 
by 2032 (due to existing supply and future supply from existing sites significantly outweighing 
the current (surplus) and future need from household growth).   In relation to Travelling 
Showpeople, there is a small overall need by 2032 o f 5 additional pitches, which can be met 
through existing sites, or via the mechanisms set out in this policy such as small extensions to 
sites, and therefore no new allocations are required . 
 
6.23.  Authorised sites in the Green Belt have been removed from the G reen Belt and allocated as 
“Green Belt Traveller Sites” on the Policies Map, and in Table 11.  These sites are allocated for 
this use only and no alternate uses other than as a Gypsy and Traveller site are acceptabl e.  
 
6.24.  Within the Green Belt, there will be a presumption against the development of new sites except 
in ‘very special circumstances ’.  In the ‘Countryside  Policy Area ’, that is, outside of the Green 
Belt and defined development limits, the designation  takes  preference.  
 
6.25.  Proposed new sites, or extensions to existing sites, within flood zones 2 or 3, will be subject to 
relevant local and national flood risk policy . 
 
6.26.  The GTANA indicates the average site size is 6.1 pitches  in the Borough .  It is the Council’s 
view that 20 pitches , in the form of 3 or 4 well located, well laid out  and well managed sites , is 
both preferable to, and would have less impact than 20 single pitch sites which can be larger 
than pitches on multiple pitch sites  and are likely to be relati vely socially and environmentally 
unsustainable.  The creation of new smaller sites within towns and villages would still be 
possible as would smaller extensions to existing sites in the Countryside  Policy Area  and, 
subject to exceptional  circumstances, th e Green Belt.

It sho uld also be noted that the GTANA/TSPANA considers a number of additional factors in relation 
to calculating the capacities of sites and yards, including smaller sites, unauthorised elements that are 
likely to get permission within a year, or sites which ar e immune from enforcement. These can count to 
the overall supply of sites and yards, but are not listed in the above table, which reflects permissions 
and sites above 5 plots only. For more information please refer to the GTANA /TSPANA .

  Chapter 7: Transport, Access and Infrastructure  
 
Introduction  
7.1. National policy indicates that access to jobs, shopping and leisure facilities should b e available 
by all modes of travel, with an emphasis on public transport and other sustainable modes.  It 
sets out an overall approach to addressing the needs of motorists, other road and public 
transport users and business by addressing congestion and pol lution and achieving better 
access to development and facilities.  
 
7.2. The Sheffield City Region Transport Strategy sets out an overarching transport v ision to offer 
people a great place in which to live, work, invest and visit over the next 15 years.  The goa ls of 
the Strategy are to support the economic growth of the Sheffield City Region whilst enhancing 
social inclusion and health, reducing emissions from vehicles and maximising safety to keep 
people and commerce moving efficiently.  
 
7.3. The Local Plan and the Transport Strategy will mutually seek to alleviate existing transport 
issues, implement new road infrastructure (where required to support economic objectives)  and 
improv e public transport access and options for walking and cycli ng to facilitate sustainabl e 
transport choices.  Whilst the Local Plan should be read as a whole, transport proposals are 
strongly linked to housing and employment (including retail) proposals, particularly where there 
are existing network constraints , to maximise opportunities to a ccess employment opportunities 
from new and existing housing . 
 
7.4. Policy is also provided to guide the provision of telecommunications and utilities infrastructure to 
both influence the reduced need to travel and its more general contribution towards achievin g 
sustainable development.  
 
Policy 12: Strategic Transport Network (Strategic Policy)  
 
Proposals will be supported which:  
 
A) Improve key routes  and connections to the Strategic Road Network and effectively manage 
traffic and relieve congestion,  in particular at the following locations:  
 
1. Hatfield Link Road.  
2. West Moor Link (A630).  
3. Improvements to M18.  
4. North Nottinghamshire to A631 capacity improvements  
5. A1(M) motorway (capacity improvements).  
 
B) Improve rail transport , including : 
 
Strategic Prioritie s for New Infrastructure Provision  
 
1. The Community rail station site (on the Lincoln line and as shown on the Policies Map)  
  will continue to be protected for such uses.  
2. New rail station at Askern, with the site as shown on the Policies Map being protecte d,  
   and rail links to towns and communities on the line serving Askern.  
3. New, expanded or re -opened lines and stations and rail links to outlying towns and  
   communities where feasible.  
4. New high -speed rail opportunities in association with new and expa nded interchanges.  
5. Developing a tram train network to serve the Borough utilising where possible existing  
   heavy rail network.  
 
  
66   [go to Contents ] 
  Shorter -Term Improvements to Existing Infrastructure  
 
6. Improvements to the sustainable access to all 8 of the Borough’s local  train stations will  
    be implemented. Within the station footprint these will include:  
 improved CCTV and lighting;  
 increased secure cycle parking;  
 upgraded displays and information; and  
 improved signage.  
 
Longer -Term Improvements to Existing Infrastru cture  
 
7. Network R ail enhancements schemes to improve connectivity and capacity.  
8. Upgrading of the East Coast Mainline (Leeds and York) and Trans Pennine links  
   (Manchester, Lincoln, Sheffield and Hull), including capacity improvements in the  
  Doncaster S tation area.  
 
C) Improve bus transport , including:  
 
1. expanding / upgrading  key bus routes and improvements to the bus network; and  
2. the provision of additional and/or improved park and ride facilities.  
 
D) Improve the efficiency of freight transport, and provide o pportunities for alternatives to road 
transport, where possible, including:  
 
1. upgrades to freight lines between Immingham, Scunthorpe and Doncaster  / Knottingley;  
2. signalling and loading gauge improvements to allow deep -sea containers on key  
   intermodal a rteries;  
3. navigation and wharf facilities along key waterways;  
4. secure lorry parking facilities and roadside service areas along the Strategic Road  
   Network to meet future demand, where appropriate; and  
5. increased aviation and rail freight movements, incl uding at the existing rail port at White  
    Rose Way and iPort, Rossington.  
 
Developments which generate large volumes of freight traffic or involve the transport of bulk materials 
should be located close to the strategic transport network, where this can  be accommodated within the 
existing capacity of the network.  The network capacity will need to be established through the 
submission of a Transport Assessment (TA).  Routing agreements will be required where deemed 
appropriate.  
 
Explanation  
7.5. Doncaster’s p osition at the heart of the UK's strategic transport network offers excellent access 
to major conurbations, coastal ports and other parts of the UK and beyond , linking east to west 
and north to south .  The Borough is well connected with strategic road and rail networks, access 
to waterways , has international links through Doncaster Sheffield Airport and to international 
ports via the M1 and M62 motorways.  
 
7.6. Strategic transport infrastructure plays a key role in supporting the economic growth of the 
Borough and the wider Sheffield City Region.  It provides the means by which residents can 
access employment, education, retail and leisure opportunities, as well as providing the 
mechanism for businesses to transport goods and services .  Infrastructure is key to unlocking 
and driving the job creation set out in the Sheffield City Region (SCR) Economic Growth Plan.   
Ensuring investment in infrastructure is one of the six priorities for the Sheffield City Region 
Economic Growth Plan, as a mechanism to unlock key dev elopment opportunities , and to 
provide access to key markets, including those outside of the City Region.  
  
67   [go to Contents ] 
  7.7. The vision and objectives of the Local Plan seek  to make efficient use of existing infrastructure 
to improve accessibility to jobs and services and t o reduce the need to travel by car by ensuring 
all journeys are undertaken by the mos t sustainable mode of transport.   These ambitions look to 
improve access to services and jobs and enable delivery of the growth strategy set out in the 
Local Plan.  
 
7.8. Altho ugh Doncaster is well connected nationally and internationally, it is recognised that these 
connections need to be improved to meet future growth requirements.   The Infrastructure 
Delivery  Plan provides more detail on how these and other infrastructure pro jects will be 
delivered and implemented.  This policy sets out the broad approach and key schemes for each 
transport mode  – it is not exhaustive and other major schemes will come forward during the 
plan period .  Where feasible and practical, large developm ent sites should explore the potential 
for the use of alternatives to road transport for the supply of construction materials and 
aggregates to and from the site.  
Road Network  
 
7.9. Doncaster occupies a strategic location at the centre of the UK’s motorway netw ork, with 
access to M18, M180 and A1(M) motorways and links to the M1 and M62 motorways.  The 
A1(M) provides direct access to the north (towards York and the north east of England) and the 
south (towards London).  The M18 motorway provides direct links to the east coast ports via the 
M180 and M62 motorways as well as access to the other regional and national centres via the 
A1(M) and M1 motorways.  
 
7.10.  Improvements to key routes and connections to the Strategic Road Network will be required to 
effectively manag e traffic, relieve congestion and ensure capacity to delivery future growth.   
Table 12 below shows the major enhancement scheme priorities on the road network in 
Doncaster .  The Policy gives specific support to those  road schemes which either have 
committed funding or are under construction at Plan adoption as well as other short -term 
strategic priorities which are in the process of securing funding and which have approval status 
and scheme design that will be deliver ed early within the plan period . 
 
7.11.  There are also a number of other road schemes which are potential longer term priorities that 
will be assessed in the context of national planning policy and guidance and taken into account 
in a future review of the Plan, including through the sustainability appraisal of reasonable 
alternatives.  They are not needed to deliver development in the Plan.  These schemes are at 
various stages of development including some with Strategic Outline Business Cases that have 
indicativ e scheme proposals with options considered, whereas other schemes are yet to start 
the full feasibility stage.  
 
   
68   [go to Contents ] 
  Table 12: Major Road Network Enhancement Priorities  
Scheme  Description  
 
Committed Schemes  
 
Hatfield Link Road scheme  The scheme will connect the Hatfield/Stainforth area of the Borough to 
junction 5 of the M18 motorway/ junction 1 of the M180.  The scheme 
will unlock up to 200 hectares of development land and improve access 
to the strategic transport network.  The link road is an integral element 
of the Unity scheme, a 170 ha mixed used development that will 
transform and regenerate the communities of Hatfield, Stainforth, 
Dunscroft and Dunsville.  
West Moor Link scheme  The scheme involves improvements to the A630 betwee n junction 4 of 
the M18 motorway to the A18 (Thorne Road) and between the A18 and 
A630 Wheatley Hall Road.  The scheme may involve the widening of a 
rail bridge thereby removing a pinch point.  Once complete, the scheme 
will increase the capacity of the ne twork, facilitate the unlocking of 
housing development and employment land along the route, and 
support sustainable modes such as cycling.  
Short -Term Priorities  
 
Improvements to M18  Capacity improvements may be required along the M18 between 
junctions 2 and 6 to improve journey times, reduce congestion and 
accommodate future growth.  Proposals are being explored in 
partnership with Highways England for improvements to junction 3 to 
increase capacity and reduce congestion.  
North Nottinghamshire to 
A631 c apacity 
improvements  Capacity improvements are required to improve access from North 
Nottinghamshire to Doncaster via the A631 in light of recent growth.  
Harworth and Bircotes, in the neighbouring district of Bassetlaw, has 
seen significant housing and em ployment development over recent 
years. This has impacted on the highway network in Doncaster along 
the A631 between Tickhill and Bawtry, particularly the A631 Stripe Road 
Junction.  Improvement schemes are required along the A631  corridor 
to accommodate t he recent growth and reduce congestion.  
 
A1(M) capacity 
improvements  Highways England is looking to upgrade and increase the capacity of 
the A1 around Doncaster to improve safety and reliability of the network.   
Currently, the section of A1 through Doncas ter has some of the highest 
levels of flow breakdown and the greatest level of accidents on the A1.   
The A1 -M18-M62 scheme will see the upgrading of the A1 to 3 lanes 
from the junction with M18 to the junction with the M62.  This will require 
improvement w orks to A1 junction 35 / M18 junction 2.  Capacity 
improvements to the Strategic Road Network are subject to Highways 
England funding.  
Longer -Term Priorities  
 
Pan Northern Route (PNR)  The PNR will provide a new strategic highway connecting Manchester 
and the proposed Trans -Pennine tunnel with the A1 and Humber Ports.  
The new highway will provide resilience, capacity, investment 
opportunities and growth across the Pennines, providing a strategic 
east-west link across the north of Doncaster, through Barnsl ey linking 
the Trans -Pennine Tunnel with the M1, A1(M), M180 and the M62 
motorways to the East Coast Ports.  
 
As well as providing important Trans -Pennine connectivity benefits, the 
proposal will also build on and enhance the benefits of a number of local  
69   [go to Contents ] 
  Scheme  Description  
 
highway schemes to enhance connectivity across the region  particularly 
improving links between Doncaster and Barnsley .  
 
It is envisaged that the proposed PNR will form part of a series of 
interlinking routes, between Manchester and the Humber Ports (via 
Barnsley and Doncaster).  The PNR will deliver two key projects for 
Doncaster; the Hickleton and Marr bypass and the A1 -A19 link road. It 
will also enable connection between the A19 and the M18. The PNR is 
subject to funding being approved and the precise ro ute is yet to be 
finalised.   If funding is not forthcoming the A1 -A19 and the Hickleton 
and Marr bypasses will be delivered as stand -alone schemes.  
North Doncaster  
A1-A19 link  The scheme will provide a link road from the A1 to the A19 at Bentley 
Moor Lan e, north of Toll Bar.  The existing link between the A1 and A19 
via Skellow does not have sufficient spare capacity to accommodate the 
additional traffic arising from proposed growth opportunities in the wider 
area.  The link road will help boost regenerat ion and economic 
development in Doncaster’s northern communities which have high er 
levels of deprivation. In particular, it is hoped that the improved access 
to the A1 will help release the long term potential of the Carcroft 
employment area and help to en able the development of land at 
Carcroft Common.  
Dearne Valley to A 1(M) 
Improvements ( Hickleton 
and Marr Bypasses ) In light of significant recent development and further growth plans in the 
Dearne Valley area, connectivity improvements are required betwee n 
the Dearne Valley and the A1(M). The A635, which forms the principle 
route between Dearne Valley and the A1(M), is currently a low capacity, 
single carriageway road. The high volumes of traffic experienced along 
the road cause severance issues as well as significant air quality 
challenges in the villages of Hickleton and Marr. Both villages are 
classified as conservation areas and Hickleton has been designated as 
an Air Quality Management Area.  
 
The Hickleton and Marr Bypasses look to divert traffic and c ongestion 
away from the villages, connecting the A635 Barnsley Road/ Doncaster 
Road with the A1(M).   The Dearne Valley to A1(M) is also part of the 
wider Pan -Northern Route linking M1 to A1(M).  
A19 – M18 Connectivity  Connectivity improvements are sought b etween the A19 and M18 to 
increase accessibility for Doncaster’s northern communities and support 
regeneration priorities. Schemes look to provide a new east – west 
connection, increasing accessibility in the north of Doncaster and 
releasing capacity to su pport economic development.  Schemes to 
improve A19 – M18 connectivity will support the Pan Northern Route 
objectives and deliver improved connections to the M180.  
M18 / A1(M) interchange 
improvements  Due to limited interchange facilities between M18 and A1(M) congestion 
and queueing are frequent at peak times around junctions 2 and 3 of the 
M18 and junctions 35 and 36 of A1(M).  Although plans are being 
explored by Highways England to increase the capacity of the A1(M), 
further work is required to increas e the capacity of the M18 / A1(M) 
interchange to accommodate demand.  
 
7.12.  Improvements to the local highway n etwork will support regeneration initiatives, especially 
within former coalfield areas, and allow demand management to influence travel choices.  
Deve lopment proposals will need to have access to the appropriate category of road to ensure 
that traffic can be accommodated safely and conveniently on the local highway  network and 
‘Strategic Road Network ’.

  Rail 
 
7.13.  Doncaster train station has good rail links to major towns and cities through its position on the 
East Coast Mainline , with 104 stations directly served by trains from Doncaster .  The Borough is 
also serviced by a range of local and regional services  and boasts 8 local rail stations . 
 
7.14.  Rail passenger  numbers are growing and the local rail network requires improvements to 
increase capacity, increase connectivity and improve frequency of services in order to increase 
access to jobs and facilities, particularly at peak times.  
 
7.15.  A community station on the  Lincoln Line (the extent of which is shown on the Policies Map) can 
provide rail connectivity to the Airport albeit requiring a shuttle connection. The land associated 
with this proposal has been protected to ensure delivery of a station can be achieved i n line with 
the Section 106 Agreement for the Airport which protects this site for such a use .  Doncaster 
Council  is working with Doncaster Sheffield Airport , Sheffield City Region , Network Rail and 
Transport for the North  to further plans for a new statio n at Doncaster Sheffield Airport  
connected to both the East Coast Mainline and the Lincoln Line.  Emerging evidence shows that 
this is a preferred alternative to the Lincoln Line station, but the scheme is yet to secure funding 
at the point of Plan adoptio n.  The scheme will see a new station and associated improvements 
to the rail lines to support growth and investment at the Airport  Priority Growth Area and 
beyond .  The station will serve as an international gateway to the region and provide 
transformatio nal connectivity to the Airport , the Airport Policy Area and beyond,  by expanding  
the travel catchment for air passengers , and to the East Coast Main Line by providing a 
strategic park and ride facility . 
 
7.16.  There is an aspiration to enhance the local rail ne twork through the introduction of new and re -
opened lines and stations  alongside existing rail line improvements .  Such schemes can help to 
relieve congestion on local roads by providing a sustainable alternative to car travel and can 
also significantly in crease accessibility of existing or new developments.   A number of 
opportunities are being explored, including  a new station at Askern to  the north of the Borough 
and associated improvement works to the line, to improve accessibility and reduce congestion.   
Land for the delivery of Askern Station has been secured to ensure that, subject to a successful 
funding bid, the station can be constructed and rail service to Askern re -opened.  There is also 
an aspiration to explore reinstating the direct rail  line be tween Doncaster and Barnsley to 
improve public transport connectivity between the two towns.  
 
7.17.  The station accessibility schemes will improve active travel links to local train stations around 
the Borough.  The schemes will create new walking and new cyclin g infrastructure connecting 
people to the stations as well as improving existing facilities nearby.  The works will enable 
more people to make multi modal journeys as part of their commute.  This will see 
improvements made to footpaths, new segregated cycl e facilities installed nearby and 
improvements made inside the stations to facilitate more active travel journeys.  Additional cycle 
parking is to be installed within the stations to meet demand.  
Bus 
 
7.18.  The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPT E) has responsibility for supporting 
public transport services throughout South Yorkshire.  Doncaster has a comprehensive bus 
network serving urban and rural communities.  The bus network helps to support areas that 
cannot be reached by other modes of publ ic transport and can provide a vital lifeline to rural 
communities.  However, bus patronage has been falling for a number of years with annual traffic 
surveys suggesting up to a 33% decrease in average passengers numbers over the last 10 
years.  
 
7.19.  To address  declining bus patronage, Doncaster Council has been working in alliance  with 
SYPTE  and service providers through the Doncaster Bus Partnership.  Launched in 2016, the 
Bus Partnership looks to promote and deliver a high quality local alternative to car use  in the 
Borough.  The principle objectives of the partnership are to improve service delivery and ensure  
71   [go to Contents ] 
  efficiencies through a coordinated approach to ticketing, marketing and network delivery.   There 
are a number of aspirations for expanded and/or upgrad ed key bus routes and improvements to 
the bus network  to increase accessibility across the Borough, as well improve the current bus 
vehicle stock operating in the Borough to support air quality improvements .  Additional ly, 
provision of new and/  or improved  park and ride facilities  will be sought , including at locations 
such as Unity (Hatfield and Stainforth) and Doncaster Sheffield Airport.  
Freight Transport  
 
7.20.  With strong links to the strategic transport network and to international ports to the east, 
Doncas ter has seen significant growth in the freight transport and logistics market over recent 
years.  The development of iPort as a major multi -modal transport hub has further strengthened 
Doncaster’s role as a logistics centre of national significance.   Donca ster is keen to support its 
role as a logistic hub.  Improvements are required in the efficiency of freight transport to reduce 
the impact on the strategic and local road networks.  Opportunities for alternatives to road 
transport will be supported, partic ularly in relation to rail, aviation and waterway improvements 
to support freight distribution.  
 
7.21.  Logistics and distribution businesses within Doncaster attract significant HGV traffic  and new 
lorry park facilities will be required to meet demand and suppor t growth.  Requirements for lorry 
park provision are set out in Policy 15.  New lorry parking facilities should be close to the 
Strategic Road Network.  
 
7.22.  Development  which generates large volumes of HGV and other freight traf fic, or involves the 
transport of bulk materials , should be located close to the strategic transport network 
(considering alternatives to road transport) where such movements can be accommodated 
within the existing capacity of the network to reduce the imp act on local roads.   Routing 
agreements will be required where deemed appropriate .

Policy 13: Promoting Sustainable Transport in New Developments  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Proposa ls are required to meet the following requirements:  
 
A) New development shall make appropriate provision for access by sustainable modes of 
transport to protect the highway network from residual vehicular impact.  The Council  will work 
with developers to ensu re that:  
 
1. access to the development can be made by a wide choice of transport modes, including  
   walking, cycling, and the private car, and public transport where appropriate;  
2. site layouts and the street environment are designed to control traffic speed t hrough an  
   appropriate network and street hierarchy that promotes road safety for all;  
3. walking and cycling are encouraged within the development and beyond, through the  
   design of facilities and infrastructure within the site and provision of linkages to the wider  
   network;  
4. appropriate levels of parking provision are made in accordance with the standards  
   contained within Appendix 6.  A departure from these standards may be justified on a  
   case by case basis, for example reduced parking levels for Town Centre residential  
   developments where accessibility to public transport is more prevalent.  Developments  
   should also include provision for electric vehicle charging points, with fast charging  
   infrastruct ure provided for use by short stay users where appropriate;  
5. residential developments should provide dedicated cycle storage for each property. For  
   houses, this could be in adequately sized garages or bike sheds. For flats or apartments,  
   this may be shared dedicated secure facilities. Non -residential developments are required  
   to provide cycle parking spaces to the equivalent of at least 10% of car parking spaces as  
   set out in Appendix 6.  Any departure fr om the standards for car parking provision should  
   not be reflected in the reduction of cycle parking provision and, where appropriate, this  
   should be increased in locations where cycling infrastructure encourages higher levels of  
   cycling; and  
6. deve lopment does not result in unacceptable impact on highway safety, or severe  
   residual cumulative impacts on the road network.  Developers must consider the impact of  
   new development on the existing highway and transport infrastructure.  Where necessar y, 
   developers will be required to mitigate (or contribute towards) any predicted adverse  
   effects on the highway and the wider transport network.  
 
B) New developments will need to provide, as appropriate, Transport Statements, Transport 
Assessments and Travel Plans to ensure the delivery of travel choice and sustainable 
opportunities for travel in line with the latest government guidance and best practice. Thresholds 
for when these documents are required are set out in Appendix 7. 
 
New developments that are predicted to have an adverse impact on the transport network  will  
be expected to contribute towards capacity and mitigation measures .  Proposals that require  
new projects will be required to make a pro portionate financial contribution.  
 
In addition, proposals should include details of post -development monitoring of traffic and mitigation 
measures in the event that traffic levels agreed through the original permission are later exceeded.  
 
Explanation  
7.23.  New developments shall be designed to ensure the efficient movement of people and goods 
and to maximise the use of sustainable forms of transport.  All developments shall be designed 
and laid out in order to provide safe access by all forms of transport , in line with the relevant 
Supplementary Planning Documents and design guidance .  Residential developments shall be 
linked to local centres in order to reduce journey lengths and encourage travel by walking, 
cycling and public transport.  
  
74   [go to Contents ] 
  7.24.  New developments will need to provide, as appropriate, Transport Assessments, Transport 
Statements and Travel Plans to ensure the delivery of travel choice and sustainable 
opportunities for travel in line with the latest Government guidance and best practice.  
Consideration sho uld be given to the future maintenance requirements on the road network as a 
result of the development.  Construction management plans may also be required . 
 
7.25.  Where an application may raise transport implications, developers will be required to produce a 
Transport Assessment and Travel Plan.  For proposals which have less of an implication a 
Transport Statement may suffice.  The use of Travel Plans is an essential measure to mitigate 
the impact of development traffic.  Thresholds for when these documents are  required are set 
out in Appendix  7.  
 
7.26.  Figure 7 shows the various stages involved in the Transport Assessment process for planning 
applications.  
Figure 7: Transport Assessment of Planning Applications  
 
7.27.  If new junctions onto the public highway are required to accommodate new development and 
considered acceptable in principle, these shall be designed in accordance with the current 
relevant desig n standards.  This will ensure that there are no adverse effects on the safety and 
integrity of the existing highway network.  Road safety audits will also be required to accompany 
any new junction proposals at the appropriate stage of the design and adopt ion process.  
 
7.28.  All developments will be expected to provide adequate car parking in safe, convenient and 
secure locations in line with the requirements set out above.  Car parking spaces should be well 
 
75   [go to Contents ] 
  defined and integrated with good quality surfacing mate rials and landscaping within the public 
realm, whilst not letting parking dominate the residential environment.  A Car Park Management 
Strategy may also be requested if deemed appropriate.   Parking standards are contained in 
Appendix 6. 
 
7.29.  The Council has adopted minimum parking standards within residential developments in order 
to overcome issues associated with low parking provision.  In determining the right levels of 
parking the Council will consider the anticipated d emand from the type of housing proposed, the 
likely occupiers, the design of the public realm and highway, the proposed parking design 
solutions and any local restrictions.  
 
Policy 14: Doncaster Town Centre Car P arking  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Town  centre car parks will be managed in favour of short stay car parking with supply aligned to meet 
operational demand.  Off-street car parking in Doncaster town centre must comply with the following 
principles : 
 
A) Public off -street car parking in and around D oncaster Town Centre will be carefully controlled in 
line with the recommendations set out in Doncaster Town Centre Parking Strategy and 
subsequent reviews.   Development proposals will be supported that replace, consolidate and 
improve existing provision e lsewhere in the town centre.  Additional provision will only be 
acceptable to meet operational needs.  Where proposals look to provide a net increase in the 
number of off -street public car parking spaces available at any given time, a strong 
demonstration of need must be provided, through a Transport Assessment / Statement.  
 
B) Supply will be managed in favour of short stay car parking within the Inner Parking Zone (as 
defined on the Policies Map).  Long stay car parking will normally only be supported outsid e of 
the Inner Parking Zone where need is demonstrated.  
 
C) Any new public off -street car parking, whether associated with development or not, will only be 
permitted in and around Doncaster Town Centre  where it:  
 
1. provides efficient, high capacity parking  which makes effective use of land ; 
2. improves the balance and distribution of car parking within the town centre ;  
3. operates with a tariff that encourages short and medium stay use, and which discourages  
    all day commuter car parking;   
4. is of high quality and  secure, with level surfacing  and marked spaces , is properly lit , and 
    can demonstrate the facility will be well maintained and managed;  
5. includes adequate and well -designed provision for disabled drivers with appropriate level  
    access to the surroun ding area;  
6. is easily accessible by car from a main road network;  
7. is easily accessible on foot to the retail/leisure area(s) that it serves; and  
8. includes  provision for sustainable refuelling infrastructure, such as electric vehicle  
    charging points.  Wi thin the Inner Parking Zone, fast charging electric charging  
    infrastructure will be supported to encourage use by short stay users and promote high  
    turnover of charging spaces.  
 
Planning permission sought for temporary surface level car parking wil l only be supported where it is 
considered appropriate and where such use would not delay or prejudice beneficial redevelopment of a 
site.  Such permissions will be strictly time limited.  
 
Explanation  
7.30.  Car parking is an important asset within town centres, helping residents and visitors access 
businesses and services.  However, oversupply of parking can be a problem as it can 
encourage traffic, which can have a negative impact on congestion and air quality.  A surplus of  
76   [go to Contents ] 
  surface car parks can also hinder reg eneration, contributing little to the visual fabric of the 
townscape . 
 
7.31.  The National Planning Policy Framework supports improvements to car parking in town centres 
provided it is safe, convenient and secure, alongside measures to promote accessibility for 
pedestrians and cyclists.   A balanced approach is needed with respect to the provision of public 
car parking.  It is important to take account of the need for the centre to be attractive to 
employers and visitors, while encouraging the use of public transpo rt to reduce congestion and 
car related air quality impacts.  
 
7.32.  The Doncaster Town Centre Parking Strategy reviews parking in the town centre and presents 
a strategy for the future management of car parking provision to ensure equilibrium between 
parking pro vision and effective demand management.  Annual monitoring of parking provision 
will be undertaken as part of this strategy to assess changes in demand and supply.  
 
7.33.  This policy sets out a proactive approach , based on the Parking Strategy,  in which the dema nd 
for off -street parking within the town centre will be effectively managed to balance the needs of 
business and local economic growth alongside the protection of the environment.  Our intention 
is to limit the amount of car trips being undertaken to the town centre whilst improving the 
range, quality and distribution of available on street parking.  At the same time, long stay car 
parking will be directed to locations outside of the Inner Parking Zone , prioritising short stay 
parking in the town centre fo r shoppers and visitors.  
 
7.34.  For the purposes of this policy, public off -street car parking is defined as town centre car 
parking provision that is available for any member of the public to use.  It specifically does not 
include any off -street parking related  to a particular use (e.g. a private office car park).  This 
type of parking provision is normally referred to as ‘private non -residential parking’.  
 
7.35.  Consideration will be given to allow more flexibility to accept the temporary use of town centre 
developme nt sites for public car parking as a means of generating income to support the 
viability of redevelopment schemes.  
 
7.36.  Where public parking is proposed in the short term on a temporary basis, the use of a site for 
car parking should not result in unacceptable  traffic impacts or delay or prejudice beneficial 
redevelopment.   Permissions would need to be strictly time limited to ensure that permanent 
redevelopment was not unreasonably delayed.   Proposals of this nature will therefore need to 
be assessed on a case -by-case basis, taking account of these impacts as well as the availability 
and quality of existing parking provision.  
 
7.37.  Outside of Doncaster Town Centre,  each development will be assessed on its merits, taking into 
account the following : 
 
 The parking stand ards and requirements set out in Supplementary Planning Documents 
and design guidance ;  
 The type mix and use of development ; 
 Whether measures can be undertaken to significantly reduce the use of private car travel 
to and from the development through the us e of a Travel Plan ; and  
 The location of the development in relation to public transport interchanges or routes well 
served by public transport . 
 
7.38.  Improvements to cycle parking provision in Doncaster Town Centre will also be sought, which is 
covered in Polic y 16. 
   
77   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 15: Lorry Parking  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Lorry parking provision (with proportionate levels of ancillary facilities) will be sought in line with the 
following principles:  
 
A) Development  on sites which  generate or are likely to generate significant HGV  movements,  
and/or other commercial vehicles used for distribution, such as new strategic employment sites,  
and/or lead to an associated demand for lorry parking which is not already provided for by an 
appropriate facility must:  
 
1. accommodate suitable on -site lorry parking and turning facilities, along with welfare  
    facilities; or  
2. contribute towards additional provision of formal lorry parking facilities, which could  
    include extending or providing an appropriate facility.  
 
B) Proposals for lorry parking facilities will be supported which:  
 
1. are justified by evidence of need;  
2. are of a size that is viable and makes a significant contribution to meeting the identified  
    need;  
3. take account of their impact on  the Strategic Road Network and local highway;  
4. provide a level of on -site facilities for lorry drivers appropriate to the size of the scheme  
    (including overnight stay accommodation and toilet facilities, where possible);  
5. incorporates suitable arrangeme nts for the management and maintenance of the facility;  
    and 
6. are well -designed, laid out to a high standard and give consideration to environmental,  
    anti-crime and design standards.  
 
Where unsecure and inappropriate lorry parking is deemed to be cau sing disruptions, consideration will 
be given to restricting where lorries can legally park in these areas through the introduction of Traffic 
Regulation Orders (TROs).  
 
Explanation  
7.39.  Doncaster’s strategic location at the centre of the UK’s motorway network has helped the 
Borough to become a nationally important logistics and distribution hub.  The significant growth 
in the logistics market over recent years  is set to continue with the expansion and development 
of new and existing sites.  
 
7.40.  Doncaster is keen to  support its role as a logistics centre of national significance.  Logistics and 
distribution businesses within Doncaster attract significant HGV traffic and generate a need for 
lorry parking facilities.  Lorry parks provide an essential service to the roa d freight industry.  
They are important in terms of road safety, preserving local amenities, reducing crime, and 
provide vital facilities to meet the needs of the lorry drivers.  Lorry drivers require parking for use 
overnight as well as to wait for alloca ted delivery or collection slots.  
 
7.41.  Anecdotal evidence suggests a minority of lorry drivers are causing disruption to local residents 
and businesses from parking along the local highway network, notably within existing industrial 
estates and in some residen tial areas.   It is also noted that such issues also arise from smaller 
commercial vehicles  increasingly being used for the distribution of goods.   Complaints range 
from dangerous parking, to noise and littering and waste.  Closure of the A1 laybys has furt her 
exacerbated this problem.  Additional provision of lorry parks could help to alleviate some of 
these issues .  A lorry parking strategy is currently being prepared for Doncaster to explore how 
related issues can be addressed in the Borough.  
 
7.42.  National p lanning policy in the NPPF states that Local Plans should recognise the importance of 
providing adequate overnight lorry parking facilities and requires proposals for new or expanded  
78   [go to Contents ] 
  distribution centres to make provision for sufficient lorry parking to ca ter for their anticipated 
use.  
 
7.43.  Where new developments are likely to create a demand for such provision or exacerbate an 
existing problem, developers may be required to make suitable onsite provision or provide a 
financial contribution towards an appropri ate facility.  Ideally, lorry parking facilities should be 
provided within appropriate development.  New lorry parking facilities should be close to the 
Strategic Road Network and should be located in areas justified by evidence of need for parking 
provisi on.  Proposals which may damage the integrity of Thorne Moor SAC, Hatfield Moor SAC 
or Thorne and Hatfield Moors SPA will not be supported  in line with Policy 30.  
 
7.44.  The Council w ill support the provision of lorry parking within development sites in order to 
manage the demand for both short stay and overnight lorry parking.  Wherever possible, lorry 
park developments should include a range of facilities proportional to the size of the 
development, such as toilets, overnight facilities and refreshment facilities, with any ancillary 
uses being of a type and scale appropriate to the main use of the site as a lorry park.  
Additionally, Lorry parks must include effective measures to create a s afe and secure 
environment which restricts opportunities for crime to be committed.  
 
 
Policy 16: Cycling in Doncaster  
 
Cycling provision in Doncaster (including new routes and improved links to existing networks and to 
existing and new develop ment) will be sought in line with the following principles : 
 
A) The Council  will seek to implement a programme of cycle routes and facilities (including cycle 
parking) improving accessibility to town, district  and local centres , major employment area and 
tourist attractions .  Developments will be expected to provide or contribute towards 
enhancements and/or links to these routes.  Development proposals should identify, and seek 
to remedy, areas of deficiency, particularly in access to services.  
 
B) The needs of c yclists will be supported in relation to new developments and in the design of 
highways and traffic management schemes to ensure safety , accessibility  and convenience .  
The Council  will seek to:   
 
1. protect, maintain and improve existing cycling infrastructu re; 
2. improve signing to encourage the use of safer routes;  
3. encourage the provision of supporting facilities along principle cycle routes including the 
    Trans Pennine Trail and Sustrans routes;  
4. make information available on safe routes and other facilitie s; and  
5. make provision for secure cycle parking facilities in new developments and in town,  
    district and local centres across the Borough.  
 
C) To encourage cycling as a means of travel, proposals for new development will be supported 
where they:  
 
1. demonstr ate that they will have a positive impact on the cycling network and its users;  
2. are designed to encourage cycling and enhance cycling connectivity to the existing cycle  
    network and to key destinations such as to local services and town, district and lo cal  
   centres;  
3. provide appropriate cycle access and sufficient secure cycle parking facilities in  
    accordance with the latest Council standards and, for new development for employment  
   uses, provide changing and showering facilities; and  
4. ensure  the provision of appropriate signposting and way -finding to en courage the use of  
    the network.  
 
   
79   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
7.45.  The benefits of increased cycling are significant.  As a mode of sustainable travel, cycling offers 
the economic advantages of affordable transpor t while having the potential to reduce 
congestion and improve air quality through reduced car use.  
 
7.46.  Doncaster is committed to increasing the uptake of cycling, both as a leisure activity and as a 
form of active travel.  As a borough with a range of health challenges  including increasing 
obesity levels and increasing numbers of people with diabetes , the health and wellbeing 
benefits of cycling are of particular significance .  Regular cycling has shown to reduce the risk of 
chronic illnesses such as heart dis ease, type 2 diabetes and stroke . 
 
7.47.  It is intended to implement a programme of on and off -highway cycle routes across the 
Borough , including cycle lanes, crossings, greenways and advanced stop lines.  Such routes 
will be designed to provide direct, safer cy cle journeys to the main urban facilities, particularly 
Doncaster town centre and other Town and District centres , as well as to key trip generators 
such as major employment area and tourist attractions.  All measures will be in accordance with 
the adopted  Doncaster Cycling Strategy , and accompanying documents, and the forthcoming 
South Yorkshire Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan.  Priority will be given to those 
routes and junctions where:  
 
 there are gaps in the existing network (e.g. A630 Whea tley Hall Road (Holmes Market to 
Churchill Road));  
 they provide direct access to major trip generators such as Doncaster town centre  and 
other town and district centres , major employment centres  and tourist attractions; and  
 scheme opportunities arise (for example, links to new developments).  
 
7.48.  Additionally, e xisting greenways will be protected and enhanced and new links should be 
provided, where possible.  
 
7.49.  Where new developments take place, developers will be expected to provide for potential users 
including  cyclists in line with the relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and design 
guidance.  The design of new development should encourage cycling, considering cycling 
accessibility, wayfinding and connectivity to key destinations, as well as providing secu re 
cycling parking and related facilities as appropriate in line with the latest Council standards.  
  
7.50.  Projects that may have an impact upon cycling will require a cycle audit.  The audit will ensure 
that cycling is accommodated within the project as a safe  and convenient travel option and will 
take the needs of cyclists into account at all stages of the design process.  Cyclists are 
particularly vulnerable when accidents occur and new highway and traffic management 
schemes will ensure that cyclists are adeq uately catered for through a variety of appropriate 
measures.  
 
Policy 17: Walking in Doncaster  
 
Walking will be promoted as a means of active travel as well as for recreation.  Improvements will be 
sought to walking connectivity throughout the  Borough in line with the following principles:  
 
A) Proposals will be supported which provide new or improved routes which enhance the existing 
network and address identified gaps within that network.  
 
B) The needs of pedestrians will be supported  and prioritise d in relation to new developments, in 
public realm improvements and in the design of highways and traffic management schemes.  
 
C) Development should maximise opportunities for walking through their design.  Proposals will be 
supported where they:  
  
80   [go to Contents ] 
  1. protect, ma intain  and improve existing pedestrian infrastructure;  
2. provide h igh quality attractive pedestrian routes that are direct, legible and pleasant  and 
    are integrated into the wider network;  
3. ensure the provision  of appropriate signposting and way -finding t o encourage the use of  
    the network.  
4. enhance pedestrian  safety and security through considered design;  
5. ensure p edestrian accessibility and permeability in line with the relevant Supplementary  
   Planning Documents; and  
6. consider t he needs of all users through inclusive design.  
 
Explanation  
7.51.  Walking  as a mode of transport has the potential to reduce the number of short car journeys 
undertaken in the Borough, helping to reduce congestion and improve air quality.  As well as 
contributing to healthier lifest yles, walking supports the development of vibrant public spaces 
and encourages social cohesion . 
 
7.52.  Doncaster has a number of health challenges .  The Borough has increasing numbers of people 
with diabetes and a slower fall in cardiovascular disease mortality than seen regionally or 
nationally.  Doncaster has high levels of adult obesity and some of the lowest participation rates 
in physical activity in the country equating to 70,000 of our residents classed as inactive (Active 
People Survey, 2015).  
 
7.53.  Encouragi ng people to walk is central to creating sustainable communities. The provision of a 
safe and pleasant walking environment has a significant role to play in supporting quality of life, 
improving health and encouraging active travel.  Providing environments  that makes walking an 
easy choice of transport has a wide number of benefits.  Such environments improve the ability 
of local communities (particularly disadvantaged or vulnerable groups) to access employment 
opportunities and important services including  education, healthcare and greenspaces.  
Developments which maximise opportunities for walking through their design have the ability to 
reduce car dependency and reinforce sustainable travel patterns . 
 
7.54.  Where new developments take place, proposals must take  account of the needs of pedestrians, 
in line with relevant safety and design standards and guidance.  Developers will be expected to 
provide for walking provision in line with the relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and 
design guidance . 
 
7.55.  New develop ments should contribute to enhancing and developing integrated networks of 
continuous, attractive and safer routes for walking within the site and beyond.  Consideration 
must be given to the quality of the walking environment to ensure routes are safer, le gible and 
attractive.  Development layouts must be fully accessible and be designed to encourage walking 
by providing direct pedestrian routes following future and existing desire lines.  Proposals 
should take account of points of conflict with vehicular t raffic, severance issues and the need for 
other pedestrian accessibility improvements.  
 
7.56.  New residential development should take account of street patterns and road hierarchy and 
demonstrate  that they achieve the levels of accessibility in line with the rel evant Supplementary 
Planning Document s and design guidance . 
 
Policy 18: Development Affecting Public Rights of Way  
 
Proposals will be supported which improve the number and quality of opportunities for walking, cycling 
and riding and create m ulti-user routes through development sites, particularly in areas of the Borough 
where such opportunities are currently deficient.  In such cases, the following principles should be 
considered : 
  
81   [go to Contents ] 
  A) Where new developments affect public rights of way, the publi c right of way should be retained 
and wherever possible be on the legally recorded alignment.  Where a public right of way is 
affected the development should be designed to accommodate the route following the principles 
outlined in Policy 19. 
 
B) Where development leads to the diversion of an existing right of way, a suitable alternative must 
be established, following the principles outlined in Policies 19 and 20. 
 
C) Development will not normally be allowed to lead to the closure of a public right of way unless a 
suitable replacement can be established.  
 
D) Developers will be expected to consider any unrecorded public paths that cross development 
sites and treat them in t he same way as definitive public rights of way.  
 
E) Proposals will be supported that enhance the Trans Pennine Trail, particularly those that create 
off-road sections for all users.  
 
Explanation  
7.57.  The public rights of way network is important not only as a mean s of accessing Doncaster’s 
countryside, but also in providing links between residential areas and local amenities, allowing 
residents, workers and visitors to make journeys along routes that are mainly traffic free.  
 
7.58.  Doncaster has  over 500 kilometres of pu blic rights of way ( as shown on the Definitive Map and 
Statement ).  Of these, approximately 80% are public footpaths, 17% are bridleways and the 
remaining 3% are byways open to all traffic and restricted byways.  Some areas of the Borough 
are well -connecte d to the public rights of way network, while other areas have limited or no 
access at all.  The bridleway network across the entire Borough can be described as 
fragmented at best, making it impossible to travel great distances on horseback without 
travelli ng on the highway network.  
 
7.59.  Public rights of way are highways and are protected by law.  Proposals to divert, extinguish, 
alter the status of or build over a public right of way will require an appropriate legal order under 
relevant legislation.  However, early liaison between the developer and the appropriate planning 
and highway authorities and any other relevant party will be essential to ensure an acceptable 
scheme.  
 
7.60.  As highway authority, the Council  has a legal duty to protect and assert the public’s u se and 
enjoyment of and prevent as far as possible the closure or obstruction of the public rights of way 
network.  The Council  will work with developers and other interested parties to ensure that any 
public right of way affected by development is fully i ntegrated into the wider network.  
 
7.61.  There are a number of unrecorded routes across the Borough that people are using on a 
regular basis providing useful links to the public rights of way network.  Many of these may carry 
public rights.  Unrecorded routes ca n cause undue delay to the development if they are not 
taken into consideration at an early stag e.  These routes will be clear and obvious on the 
ground, for example a clearly worn desire line linking public places or existing highways 
adjacent to the deve lopment site.  Where necessary the appropriate legal procedures will be 
followed to ensure the public right of way is preserved and not permanently lost.  
 
7.62.  The Trans Pennine Trail is a popular recreational multi -user route that runs through the heart of 
the Borough from Harlington to Sykehouse and is part of a long distance east -to-west route 
between Southport and Hornsea, with links to Chesterfield, Leeds, Kirk Burton and York.  The 
majority of the route through Doncaster is off road.  There are also sectio ns along the highway 
network in rural areas.  On-going maintenance and improvements to the trail will ensure that it 
continues to be well used and remains a high quality asset.  
  
82   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 19: Access, Design and Layout of Public Rights of Way 
 
Proposals will be expected to meet the following access, design and layout considerations in respect of 
public rights of way and highways network : 
 
A) Developers will be expected to incorporate the principles of least restrictive access in the design 
and layou t of public rights of way as part of the development.  
 
B) Wherever possible, any existing or alternative route alignments through development sites 
should run through open, landscaped areas and should:  
 
1. avoid the use of estate roads;  
2. avoid alignments enclos ed by fencing with little or no surveillance from adjacent buildings;  
3. be free from sharp bends which could provide blind spots and hiding places;  
4. be suitably surfaced to a specification agreed with highway authority;  and 
5. be free from barriers. Barriers sho uld be considered as a last resort and will only be  
  authorised where there is clear justification.  Agreed structures will need to be the least  
  restrictive and conform to the British Standard for Gaps Gates and Stiles.  
 
C) Where paths are not enclosed, m inimum widths of 2 metres for footpath and 4 metres for 
bridleway and restricted byways should be provided.  If it is necessary for the path to be 
enclosed by fencing, hedging or buildings, then minimum widths of 3 metres for footpaths, 5 
metres for bridle ways and 6 metres for restricted byways should be provided.  
 
D) Any new routes or altered alignments through development should link into the surrounding 
public rights of way network or adopted highway network to maintain and improve connectivity 
and ease of movement.  
 
E) New routes should have formal status and be recorded on the appropriate legal record. This will 
secure the long -term protection of the route and formalise responsibility for maintenance.  
 
Explanation  
7.63.  Proper integration of public rights of way wi thin development sites will provide safe, convenient 
and attractive routes for users and should avoid scenarios whereby paths are physically 
constrained , poorly surfaced and harmful to the safety and amenity of the area.  Poorly 
integrated routes can also potentially increase the risk of crime and anti -social behaviour and 
can substantially affect the quality of life for those who live and work in the area and those who 
use the public rights of way network.  
 
7.64.  Some users  (for example, those with mobility pro blems or those with pushchairs) can 
experience difficulty using the public rights of way network.  The type of surfaces and barriers 
(for example , natural stone or earth, stiles, gates and A -frames) along certain routes make 
some paths inaccessible.  It is therefore important that the needs of all individuals and groups 
within the Borough are carefully considered within the design and layout of public rights of way 
within new development.  It is also important to take into account the priorities and actions  set 
out in Doncaster’s Rights of Way Improvement Plan.  
 
7.65.  In addition, the Council  will consider dedication and creation agreements to record new paths 
on the legal record once we are satisfied that the new route is of public benefit and there is no 
initial  additional expenditure required from our budget to bring a path into a fit condition to use.

Policy 20: Public Rights of Way Crossing Road s, Rail ways , Canal s and Rivers  
 
Development proposals that are expected to give rise to significant increase in the use of public rights of 
way where they cross roads, railway lines, canals and rivers must show that all safety and accessibility 
considerations have been taken into account to ensure use of the crossing can be maintained.  This 
should inclu de consultation with the appropriate authority (for example, Network Rail).  
 
Where it is not possible to make an existing level crossing safe, a fully accessible (Equality Act 
compliant) underpass or bridge should be provided in close proximity to the orig inal crossing point.  
 
Where necessary, existing structures (for example bridges or underpass) should be assessed and 
improvements made to meet the requirements of any projected increase in use of t he public rights of 
way network.  
 
Lengthy diversions of a p ublic right of way, as an alternative to either a bridge or underpass, will not be 
supported.  Diversion of a public right of way may be considered as a last resort but only where it does 
not detract from its use and enjoyment.  
 
Where necessary, new crossi ng points should be provided across new roads, railway lines and 
waterways where there is a need to provide safe convenient access and to maintain connectivity.  
 
Explanation  
7.66.  Appropriate  crossing points where public rights of way cross new or existing roads , railways, 
canals and rivers are essential to ensure the safe operation of the transport network, whilst 
maintaining and improving the connectivity and character of the public rights of way network.  
 
7.67.  The ability for all users to safely use a crossing is a  material consideration and the onus should 
be on the developer to provide a safe, fully accessible crossing point along the public right of 
way that is not to the detriment of the user or the network as a whole.  
 
7.68.  Developments close to public rights of way  that cross railway lines at uncontrolled level 
crossings may increase the number of journeys across the crossing.  Where this change could 
significantly increase usage there may be safety implications that need to be addressed at an 
early stage as part of  the planning application process.  
 
Policy 21: Telecommunications and Utilities Infrastructure  
 
Proposals to extend or improve access to telecommunication (including broadband services) and utility 
infrastructure networks and the siting of a ssociated apparatus will be supported subject to meeting the 
following criteria : 
 
A) Essential utilities and telecommunications infrastructure will be protected unless it is no longer 
required or can be adequately relocated and/or replaced.  
 
B) All new housing and commercial developments must provide connectivity to the fast est 
technically available Broadband network unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not 
possible.  
 
C) Utility and telecommunications infrastructure and connections must be designed in to, integrated 
within , and included in , any new development.  Works will need to be carefully managed and 
coordinated between different providers to minimise disruption to highways and residential 
amenity and ensure the safety of all users.  
 
D) Wherever possi ble, new utility and telecommunications infrastructure such as transmission 
equipment should be placed underground.  
  
84   [go to Contents ] 
  E) It has been demonstrated that equipment/site sharing is not feasible and that 
telecommunications apparatus cannot be sited on an existing b uilding or other appropriate 
structure where this represents the preferable environmental solution.  
 
F) The size of the apparatus is kept to the minimum necessary to achieve their purpose and every 
effort has been made to minimise the visual impact of the pro posal.  
 
G) The telecommunication apparatus is positioned so as to minimise their effect on the external 
appearance of the building or structure to which they are attached, and is of a suitable colour 
which minimises visual impact and enables them to merge in to the background.  
 
H) The apparatus is not used primarily as a means of advertising.  
 
I) The apparatus would not harm an element which contributes to the significance of a designated 
heritage asset.  Antennae on listed buildings will be supported provided it ca n be hidden from 
public view (subject to adequate screening) and it is small in scale.   
Explanation  
7.69.  The purpose of this policy is to ensure that businesses and residents have equal access to high 
quality communication services (e.g. high -speed broadband) a nd utilities (e.g. electricity, water 
and gas) in a way that keeps disruption and environmental impact to a minimum.  
 
7.70.  This policy also provides guidance on the design, siting and layout of telecommunications and 
utility apparatus  so that the Council, relevant providers and lead agencies and developer s can 
promote and encourage the provision and expansion of the communications network across the 
whole of the Borough  whilst minimising adverse impacts and inst ead making positive 
contribution s to the appearanc e of the area and enhancing  a sense of place.  
 
7.71.  Certain types of telecommunications and utility infrastructure such as mobile masts and 
equipment cabinets do not require planning permission  and have  permitted  development rights .  
In nearly all cases,  develo pers must notify the Council of the intention to install 
telecommunications equipment.   Control over the siting and appearance of such  development  
can still be made , especially within conservation areas and nature conservation sites .

  Chapter 8: Retail and Town Centres   
 
Introduction  
8.1. This chapter sets out policies to support the growth and development of Doncaster’s town and 
other retail centres to guide the provision of new shopping, leisure, commercial, cultural and 
entertainment facilities within the Borough .  In supporting our town centres they in turn generate 
local employment, promote beneficial competition and create attractive, healthier and safer 
places where people want to live, visit and work.  
 
8.2. Government policy requires that Local Plans promot e competitive town centres as the heart of 
their communities and pursue policies to support their viability and vitality.   Policies should 
provide customer choice and a diverse retail offer which reflects the individualities of town 
centres.  
 
8.3. Based upon a  defined network (or hierarchy) of town, district and local ‘centres ’, strategic 
policies 1 and 2, and the following  policies, seek to encourage a suitable mix of uses to reflect 
their character .  The objective to direct Main Town Centre Uses to existing centres is because 
of their higher levels of accessibility and ability to support multiple purpose trips.  Changes to 
the Use Classes Order in 2020 provide enhanced flexibility for the use of bui ldings to switch 
between commercial, business and service uses in Class E.   They should be read in 
conjunction with area specific policies for Doncaster, Mexborough and Thorne town centres  
given in Chapter 16 . 
 
 
Policy 22: Locating Main  Town Centre Uses (Strategic Policy)   
 
Main Town Centre Uses, including  retail, leisure, office, cultural and tourist developments , will be located 
according to the ‘Network of Centres’ defined by Policy 1 and Policy 2.  Proposals within centres (as 
defined on the Policies Map) will be assessed against Policy 23 below . 
 
Part 1: Sequential Approach  
 
Proposals for Main Town Centre Uses on the edge of, or outside of, designated centres will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
 
A) Sites within , and then on the edge of , town, district and local centres  have been assessed and it 
can be demonstrated that they are not available (or expe cted to become available within a 
reasonable period), suitable or viable for the proposed development, and then  
 
B) In the case of bulky goods floorspace, the availability, suitability and viability of premises in out 
of centre and retail parks to accommodate  the proposed development has been assessed.  
 
For retail uses, sites are defined as in-centre  where they lie within a defined centre boundary – except in 
Doncaster, Mexborough and Thorne where sites are defined as in -centre where they lie within a defined 
‘primary  shopping area’ (see Policy 23 below).   For all other main town centre uses, all locations with in 
the boundary of a centre are defined as in -centre.  
 
For retail uses, edge -of-centre  is defined as a location that is w ell connected to, and up to 300m from, a 
defined centre boundary – except in Doncaster, Mexborough and Thorne, where it is up to 300m from a 
defined ‘ primary  shopping area’ .  For all other main town centre uses, edge -of-centre is defined as 
locations withi n 300m of a centre’s boundary.  For office development, this includes  only those locations 
within 500m of a public transport interchange e.g. bus, train stations.  
 
 
 
  
87   [go to Contents ] 
  Part 2: Impact Assessment  
 
Outside of Doncaster’s existing town, district and local centr es, retail and leisure proposals (including 
extensions , creation of mezzanine floors  and changes of use) that exceed the thresholds set out below 
must be accompanied by an assessment of:  
 
A) the impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public  and private investment in 
centres in the catchment area of the proposal; and  
 
B) the impact of the proposal on the vitality and viability of centres, including local consumer choice 
and trade.  
 
Use Location  Threshold    
 
Retail   Edge  of Doncaster Town Ce ntre  (Well connected to and up  750 sq. m or above of 
 to 300m from the ‘primary shopping area’ boundary)   gross floorspace  
 
All other Town   Edge of Doncaster Town Centre (Up to 300m from the town  750 sq. m or above of 
Centre Uses  centre boundary)  gross floorsp ace 
 
All Town Centre   All other locations  500 sq.  m or above of  
Uses  gross floorspace  
 
Part 3: Out of Ce ntre Locations  (including Retail Parks)  
 
Subject to meeting the above criteria , the following types of retail provision will be supported in principle 
within out -of-centre locations , with preference for accessible sites which are well connected to centres:  
 
A) Bulky -goods, non -food retail development within existing out of centre locations (as defined on 
the Policies Map).  
 
B) Specialist shops (including car sh owrooms) and trade centre developments within local 
employment sites (as shown the Policies  Map). 
 
C) Small -scale shops and other ancillary uses which would complement the function and role of 
existing or proposed  employment, housing or mixed -use site s where they serve a local need . 
 
D) Limited and small -scale ancillary retail uses (e.g. farm shops) outside of Development Limits 
and the Green Belt that satisfy Policy 25.  
 
To ensure that development of main town centre uses in out -of-centre locations, and particularly retail 
parks, remain complementary to defined centres the impact of such development will be mitigated by 
imposing appropriate conditions including : on the use of land and premises ; the scale of development ; 
the sub -division of units ; and the goods that can be sold from any retail outlet.  
 
Explanation  
8.4. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy 1 and Policy 2 which together  seek to 
direct shops and other Main T own Centre Uses , such  as leisure, office, entertainment and 
cultural facilities , towards existing centres rather than unsustainable out -of-centre locations . 
Sequential Approach  
8.5. Under Government policy  in the NPPF , proposals for new retail, lei sure, cultural and office 
development must follow a ‘sequential approach’.  This means that, where possible, such uses  
should be located in existing town, district or local centres.  Where no central sites are available, 
edge -of-centre sites should be used  in preference to out -of-centre sites.  It is not necessary to  
88   [go to Contents ] 
  apply the sequential test approach  to applications for small scale rural offices or other small 
scale rural development.  
Impact Assessment  
8.6. The impact assessment will be applied to applications for retail  and leisure  development in 
locations outside of town, district and local centres depending on (a) the amount of floorspace 
proposed; (b) the type of town centre use proposed; and (c) whether it is situated at an edge -of-
centre or out -of-centre l ocation.  
 
8.7. In preparing these assessments, applicants should also have regard to the scale of the proposal 
relative to existing centres and the cumulative impacts of recent developments, particularly 
where the town, district or local centre is vulnerable . 
 
8.8. Doncaster town centre is performing well as a shopping and leisure destination and offers a 
good range and mix of facilities.  However, many of the secondary areas within the town centre 
are in decline and require significant investment and redevelopment.  Convenience provision in 
the town centre is also relatively limited.  In these circumstances, even relatively modest trade 
diversion from out -of-centre developments could have a significant adverse impact on the 
vitality and viability of the town centre.  
Out-of-Centre Locations including Retail Parks  
8.9. Doncaster has a high proportion of out -of-centre and out -of-town facilities (e.g. food stores and 
retail parks) .  Doncaster’s retail parks are gradually moving away from selling bulky goods (e.g. 
furniture, D IY, hardware, radio, electrical and other household appliances) towards the provision 
of town centre uses (e.g. food and clothing stores, restaurants, bingo halls and coffee shops). 
This puts them in direct competition with existing centres and is leading to significant trade 
diversion, especially in relation to food and grocery provision.   It is therefore appropriate to 
ensure that any further significant detrimental impact from development of main town centre 
uses in out -of-centre locations is mitigated t hrough appropriate conditions ( see P art 3 of the 
policy).   
 
8.10.  Existing centres will continue to be the main focus of shopping, leisure, cultural and social 
activity within the Borough .  Development will be particularly encouraged in those centres which 
face a significant shortfall of convenience and comparison shopping provision.  Due to the 
dominance of out -of-centre food stores, there is limited capacity to support additional food 
shopping provision within the Borough during the lifetime of the plan.  Howev er, Doncaster and 
Mexborough town centres will require additional provision to help claw back trade from existing 
out-of-centre stores.  
 
8.11.  New urban extensions will need to ensure they have access to an appropriate range of shops 
and services within easy wal king distance of new residents and workers.  Shops and other 
ancillary uses (e.g. community facilities) will be supported on large mixed -use sites and urban 
extensions, so long as they do not detract from the vitality and viability of existing centres with in 
the catchment area and offer good public transport, pedestrian and cycle links to the community 
they are intended to serve.  
 
8.12 Small shops are defined as units having a gross floor area of 300m2 or less . Small -scale shops, 
such as newsagents and conv enience stores, will be encouraged in appropriate locations where 
they meet a local need.  Because they are intended to serve local needs, developments allowed 
under this policy should not include large dedicated car parks.  
   
89   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 23: Devel opment within Town, District and Local Centres (Strategic Policy)   
 
Part 1 : ‘Primary  Shopping Areas’ 
 
‘Primary shopping areas’ are the priority locations for new and existing shopping facilities.  In Doncaster 
Borough, ‘primary shopping areas’ have been d efined within the town centres of Doncaster, Mexborough 
and Thorne.  
 
Main town centre uses will be supported for the following uses at ground floor level in the Primary 
Shopping Areas:  
 
 Shops and food and drink outlets  
 Financial and professional services; and  
 Other uses to which pedestrians may be expected to visit in the course of a shopping, leisure, 
entertainment or tourist trip,  
 
provided that : 
 
A) the proposal retains an active frontage and entrance; or where the proposal relates to a 
premises with an ex isting shop front, the shop windows will continue to be used for display 
purposes;  
 
B) the proposal is compatible with adjoining uses ; and  
 
C) proposals for food and drink uses also comply with Policy 24.  
 
Proposals for new devel opment will be supported on the upper floors of buildings within the ‘primary 
shopping area’ except where their presence would be seriously detrimental to the amenity of 
neighbouring activities  and/or would have a negative impact upon the successful runnin g of the ground 
floor commercial unit and/or the living conditions of future users/  occupiers.  
 
Part 2 : Other Centres  
 
Proposals for development in town, district and local centre s, outside of any defined ‘primary  shopping 
area’, will be acceptable in pri nciple for a wider range of Main Town Centres Uses,  such as restaurants, 
pubs, hotels and cinemas  and financial and professional services.  Non-town centre uses will be resisted 
unless it can be demonstrated that they will not negatively impact upon the vi tality and viability of the 
town centre, with particular regard to the amenity of existing businesses and residents.  
 
Part 3 : Betting Shops , Amusement Arcades, Pay  Day Loan Units and Pawnbrokers  
 
Subject to the above criteria, proposals to change the us e to a betting shop , amusement arcade,  pay day 
loan unit and pawnbroker will only be supported where it can be demonstrated that:  
 
A) the property is vacant and /or has  been marketed unsuccessfully for at least one year and the 
rent value has been set at a re alistic rate;  
 
B) the new use would generate footfall within the shopping frontage; and  
 
C) there is no clustering or cumulative impact resulting from  an over concentration of such uses in 
an area.  Clustering will occur where more than 10% of units, in a parade  of Main Town Centre 
Uses, will be used (in any combination) for betting shops, amusement arcades, pay day loan 
units and/or pawnbrokers.  
 
  
90   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
‘Primary  Shopping Areas’  
8.13.  Policy 1 defines a network of town, district and  local centres across the Borough.  Each town 
centre contains a ‘ primary shopping area’ – the place where shopping activity is concentrated.  
These boundaries are shown on the Policies  Map.  For district and local centres, the ‘primary 
shopping area’ const itutes the boundary of that centre.  
 
8.14.  For Doncaster, Mexborough and Thorne ‘Town Centres’, ‘ primary shopping areas’ are defined 
in recognition that these higher order settlements are the priority locations for new retail, offices, 
leisure, cultural and tour ist facilities in the Borough and require specific policy for the protection 
and promotion of their core shopping areas.  
 
8.15.  ‘Primary  shopping areas’ contain a high proportion of shops such as food, clothing and 
household goods.  In Doncaster town centre, the area is  located along Baxtergate, Frenchgate, 
St Sepulchre Gate, Printing Office Street, Market Place and Scot Lane.  In Thorne and 
Mexborough town centres, the retail areas  are mainly concentrated along pedestrianised streets 
and include existing market  areas.  
 
8.16.  These areas  are under increasing pressure from changes of use , amalgamation of services 
(e.g. post offices in general stores, pharmacies in health centres etc.)  and conversions to other 
uses (e.g. coffee shops, financial and professional services,  betting shops and housing) .  
Competition from online shopping  is also increasing  in its effects . 
 
8.17.  This policy seeks to protect and maintain the existing character and function of these core retail 
areas  and manage the mix and balance of uses within them.  At the same time, it is important to 
ensure that non -retail uses do not unacceptably dilute or erode the shopping function of the 
‘Primary  Shopping Area ’. 
 
8.18.  The boundaries of these areas  will be subject to change over the life of the plan and will be kept 
under review through regular town centre monitoring and surveys.  
 
8.19.  Where new outlets  cannot be accommodated within the  ‘primary  shopping area’  the main town 
centre boundaries should be preferable and used in the first instance.  If this is not possible, 
then sites on the edge of these areas should be used before out -of-centre sites are considered 
(see Policy 22 Part 1  – sequential  approach).  
 
8.20.  New development (including changes of use, conversions and extensions) within primar y 
shopping areas will be expected to maintain and provide good quality active frontages at the 
ground floor level to enliven the street scene and promote a safer and more secure 
environment.  Active frontages should be provided along the length of the stre et frontage of the 
site or unit through the use of extensive glazing and display space.  In addition, frontages 
should be provided up to the street edge wherever possible.  
 
8.21.  Empty space above shop units represents a significant waste of floorspace and an un tapped 
resource.  Non-retail uses such as offices and homes will generally be supported on the upper 
floors of buildings within existing centres provided that they do not have a negative impact upon 
the operation of the existing ground floor business or th e amenities of potential future 
occupants.   
Other Centre s 
8.22.  Part 2 of the Policy allows greater flexibility where non -shopping uses , in areas of town centres 
outside of the ‘ primary shopping areas’ of Doncaster, Mexborough and Thorne, would make a 
positive contribution to the role of the ‘primary shopping area’.

  Betting Shops, Amusement Arcades, Pay Day  Loan Units and Pawnbrokers  
8.23.  The provision of quality town centres plays a huge part in people’s perceptions and sense of 
place, and it is vital to our reside nts and visitors that they are attractive and comfortable.  The 
over-concentration of the uses defined in Policy 24, Part 3, is not seen as a positive element of 
a vibrant and diverse retail centre or wider neighbourhood.  A clustering of these particular uses 
within parades (rows or frontages) of Main Town Centre Uses in town, district and local centres, 
and neighbourhood shopping parades, can negatively affect their vitality and viability .  Outlets of 
this nature tend to cluster in areas of deprivation wh ere the population is largely made up of 
people most at risk of utilising such services.  Given the clustering and over -concentration of 
these uses within existing retail areas , the Council will limit further growth.  
 
 
Policy 24: Food and Drink Uses  
 
Food and Drink Uses such  as restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars and  hot food takeaways will be directed 
towards town, district and local centres (as identified on the Policies  Map). 
 
Food and Drink Uses will be supported so long as they:  
 
A) satisfy the r equirements of the sequential approach set out in Policy 22 above ; 
 
B) do not have a negative impact upon the amenity and safety of residents and other businesses in 
the area; to include highway safety and parking, hours of ope ration, control of odours and 
cooking smells  and litter and waste disposal; and  
 
C) do not undermine the vitality and viability of the centre , in particular where there would be an 
over concentration of inactive units within a parade of Main Town Centre Uses . 
 
Subject to first meeting the above criteria, where the proposal is solely for a hot food takeaway, 
development will only be supported where:  
 
D) there is no clustering or cumulative impact resulting from an over concentration of hot  food 
takeaways in an ar ea.  Clustering will occur where more than 10% of units, in a  parade of Main 
Town Centre Uses, will be used as a hot food takeaway; and  
 
E) the number of approved hot food takeaways within the ward is less than the UK national  
average of hot food takeaways pe r 1,000 population;  
 
Proposals solely for a hot food takeaway, which are located within 400 metres of a school, sixth form 
college, community centre or playground will not  be supported unless the opening hours are restricted 
until after 1700 during weekda ys and there are no over the counter sales before that time.  
 
Explanation  
8.24.  The definition of ‘Food and Drink Uses’ is set out in the Local Plan’s Glossary at Appendix 1.  
Whilst these uses serve a useful function they have pote ntial to undermine the role of  centres 
where the concentration of such leads to loss of variety in the shopping offer available , 
particularly when evening opening hours result in shuttered premises during the day, making 
the high street less appealing to v isitors during the day.  The policy aims to ensure town centres 
have a suitable mix of uses to create a balance along parades (rows or frontages) of Main Town 
Centre Uses within designated town, district, local centres and neighbourhood shopping 
parades so  that they provide a greater mix of uses, increase footfall, and bring community uses 
closer to communities.  Such uses can affect the local amenity of a centre through extended 
opening hours, increased traffic and on -street parking, generation of cooking odours, smells, 
litter and discarded food waste, produce night time noise and general disturbances and other 
community safety issues.  Appropriate conditions will be applied to the granting of planning 
permission in the interests of protecting the amenity of surrounding occupants and the vitality  
92   [go to Contents ] 
  and viability of the immediate area.  
 
8.25.  Food and drink uses should be located within easily accessible locations, preferably within or 
next to existing centres which can be reached on foot, or on bike and via public transport.  Such 
uses are generally not acceptable within residential areas and there will be some instances 
where it will be appropriate to resist them on existing frontages where there are residential uses 
above them.  
 
8.26.  Unhealthy diets, inactivity and the  availability of high energy foods are major factors in the rise 
of obesity across the UK.  Obesity is a complex issue and not solely affected by individual 
behaviours but influenced by a number of social and environmental issues.  There are around 
260 exi sting hot food takeaways across Doncaster  (2017 data)  with 89.3% of the population 
living within 1  km of a takeaway.  As such, there are concerns regarding the combination of the 
proliferation of hot food takeaways  in the Borough and the Borough’s high lev els of obesity.  
Planning permission will not be granted for new hot food takeaways  where the number of 
approved establishments, within the ward, equals or exceeds the UK national average per 
1,000 population.  The information on hot food takeaways is regu larly monitored by Doncaster 
Public Health and Planning. When assessing planning applications the most up to date data will 
be used; this can be found on the Council’s website.  
 
8.27.  Childhood obesity is a growing threat to children’s health and Doncaster’s pro portion of children 
identified at risk of obesity is a cause for concern.  Unhealthy weight gradually increases 
throughout people’s lives, and almost three quarters (74.8%) of Doncaster’s adult population 
have an unhealthy weight , which is the second highe st in England.  This policy seeks to 
manage and control the provision of hot  food takeaways particularly within specific areas ( i.e. 
within a 400 metre walking distance of a school, college or playground).  
 
8.28.  The numbers of hot food takeaway establishments a re particularly high within district, local 
centres and neighbourhood shopping parades where people seek easy access to such food.  In 
order to support other Borough strategies, planning permission will not be granted for hot food 
takeaways  where it would result in a clustering  and proliferation of such  uses to the detriment of 
the character and function , or vitality and viability , of a centre , or if it would have an adverse 
impact on the standard of amenity (living conditions) for existing and future occup ants of land 
and buildings.  In order to avoid clustering  and proliferation, hot food takeaways should balance 
out the mix of uses within the parade  (row or frontage)  and not dominate the centre.  In order to 
assess future applications for such uses the po licy sets out the appropriate criteria and 
thresholds to achieve the objective of not saturating centre s with one particular use as well as 
helping to  achieve the Borough’s healthy eating objective .

  Chapter 9: Countryside  
 
Introduction  
9.1. The Local Pla n’s Spatial Strategy and Settlement Hierarchy  (Policy 1) directs the majority of 
new development towards the Borough’s more sustainable settlements and in doing so defines 
settlement Development Limits within which policy for  the Strategy’s top 4 levels of the 
settlement hierarchy apply, namely Doncaster Main Urban Area; the 7 Main Towns; the 10 
Service Towns and Larger Villages; and the Defined Villages.  
  
9.2. For the purposes of planning policy, the remainder of the Borough is e ither Green Belt or 
“Countryside  Policy Area ”.  There  is a clear difference between the two  – see Policy 1. 
 
9.3. The Local Plan does not repeat national Green Belt policy in the NPPF .  So in accordance with 
Policy 1 within the Green Belt national planning policy will be applied . 
 
9.4. Proposals for new development in the Countryside  Policy Area  will be supported if in 
accordance with the following Policy.  
 
 
Policy 25: Development in the Count ryside  Policy Area  
 
Part 1: Re-use and Conversion of Buildings  
 
Proposals for the conversion of rural buildings in the Countryside Policy Area  will be  supported provided 
that: 
 
A) the original building is of perman ent construction, structurally sound (demons trated by an 
appropriate structural assessment) and suitable for conversion without significant works, 
extension or alteration  (demonstrated by an appropriate conversion method statement) ; 
 
B) the form, bulk and general design of the buildings are in keeping with the surroundings and the 
proposal is commensurate with the local building style and the materials used;  
 
C) development would lead to an enhancement of its immediate setting;  
 
D) the proposal does not adversely affect neighbouring residential amenity ; 
 
E) the rural location of non -residential development is justifiable to support a prosperous rural 
economy in accordance with national policy in the NPPF; and  
 
F) residential development is not isolated unless in accordance with national rural housing policy in 
the NPPF.  
 
Part 2: Replacement of a Dwelling and Extensions to Existing Dwellings  
 
Proposals for the replacement of a dwelling in the Countryside Policy Area  will be supported provided 
that:  
 
A) the original building is permanent and is not the result of a temp orary permission;  
 
B) the original building has not become derelict or previous residential use abandoned;  
 
C) replacement dwellings are positioned on a comparable footprint , and in close proximity,  to the 
original building unless it can be demonstrated that t he re -positioning would be significantly 
more benefi cial (to, for example,  the character and appearance of the site and locality ). Any 
increase in volume should not exceed 40% above that of the original building where it will have  
95   [go to Contents ] 
  a significant impact on t he character of the countryside;   
 
D) the proposal does not adversely affect neighbouring residential amenity; and 
 
E) it would not undermine the retention of any occupancy condition.  
 
Proposals to extend existing dwellings in the Countryside Policy Area,  or any other building within its 
curtilage, will be supported provided that Criteria A, B, D & E above are satisfied; and that:  
 
F) increases in volume should not exceed 40% above that of the existing building; and  
 
G) would not have a visual impact prejudicial to th e character of the building or the amenity of the 
countryside.  
 
Part 3: New dwellings  
 
In the Countryside Policy Area, planning permission will be granted for dwellings to meet the essential 
needs of an existing agriculture, forestry, or other enterprise w hich justifies a rural location, where it can 
be demonstrated that :  
 
A) there is a demonstrable functional need which relates to a full -time worker that cannot be 
fulfilled by an existing dwelling in the area ; and 
 
B) the enterprise has been established for at least three years, is financially sound, and has a clear 
prospect of remaining so .  
 
If a new dwelling is essential to support the essential needs of a new agriculture, forestry or other 
enterprise which justifies a rural location, it should  normally, for the first three years, be provided by 
temporary accommodation that can demonstrate:  
 
C) there is a demonstrable functional need which relates to a full -time worker that cannot be 
fulfilled by an existing dwelling in the area; and  
 
D) there is clear evidence of a  firm intention and ability to develop the enterprise concerned and 
that the proposed enterprise has been planned on a sound financial basis . 
 
Any such development will be subject to a restrictive occupancy condition.  
 
Applications for temporary and mobile  homes will be considered favourably where  needed during the 
construction of a permanent dwelling on site or on a nearby site.  
 
Permission granted for temporary accommodation will be subject to time restrictions.  
 
Other proposals for new dwellings in the C ountryside Policy Area will  be supported in line with national 
policy for ‘entry level’ exception sites for housing, rural exception sites for housing and for isolated 
homes of exceptional design quality.  
 
Part 4: New Non -Residential Development  
 
Proposals  for non -residential developments will be supported in the Countryside Policy Area  provided  
that: 
 
A) the rural location of the enterprise is justifiable  to support a prosperous rural economy in 
accordance with national policy in the NPPF ; 
  
96   [go to Contents ] 
  B) the location of th e enterprise would not have a significant adverse effect on neighbouring uses  
or on highway safety ;  
 
C) the development is of a size (including floorspace) and scale commensurate with an existing 
use, or that reasonably required for a new  use, and with the r ural character of the location;  and 
  
D) the scale and design of the proposal would not have a significant adverse impact on the 
landscape . 
 
 
Explanation  
9.5. This policy applies to relevant proposals in the Countryside  Policy Area  - as defined  by Policy 1. 
Proposals which may damage the integrity of Thorne Moor SAC, Hatfield Moor SAC or Thorne 
and Hatfield Moors SPA will not be supported  in line with Policy 30. 
Re-use and Conversion of Buildings  
9.6. Part 1 of the Policy is supportive of appropriate proposals to bring back into use buildings which 
are redundant or no longer suitable for their original purpose where the building makes a 
positive contribution by safegua rding the building’s future and enhancing the immediate setting 
of the building.  
Replacement of a Dwelling , and Extensions to Existing Dwellings  
9.7. National policy seeks to avoid new inappropriate isolated dwellings in the Countryside  so 
proposals to replace or extend dwellings in the Countryside Policy Area  will be  subject to Part 2 
of the Policy to assess the proposal against the impact of the 'original' existing development . 
 
9.8. This is defined as the floorspace and volume of the dwelling when it was first con structed ; or for 
older homes constructed prior to July 1 1948, when the Town and Country Planning Act was 
first introduced , the 'original dwelling' refers to the floorspace and volume of the dwelling as it 
was on this date.  
 
9.9. Proposals  will be required to p rovide clear evidence, through volume calculations, that the total 
floorspace of the proposal, together with any previous extensions, alterations and outbuildings 
would not result in an increase of more than 40% above the volume of the original building  
(measured externally  and inclusive of any permitted development ) including outbuildings within 
the curtilage of the existing building . 
 
9.10.  Planning permission is unlikely to  be granted for a replacement dwelling which exceeds this 
amount unless the design is of  exceptional quality or innovative in nature in terms of it design, 
use and materials and levels of energy efficiency in order to justify the deviation from the policy 
limit and does not significantly harm the openness or character of the policy area.  This is 
regardless of whether it is replacing a building of poor quality or not.  
New dwellings  
9.11.  National Policy advises local planning authorities to avoid new isolated homes in the 
Countryside unless there are special circumstances, such as the essential need  for a rural 
worker to live permanently at or near their place of work in the Countryside .  Part 3 provides 
policy to assess such proposals.  
 
9.12.  There is limited extant national guidance on how to assess essential need but it has become 
accepted, as part of d etermining various Appeals by the Planning Inspectorate, that former 
Annex A to the cancelled Planning Policy Statement 7 (Sustainable Development in Rural 
Areas), which gave guidance on ‘Agricultural, Forestry and Other Occupational Dwellings’, 
remains re levant guidance to consideration of this issue.  In practice this is likely to require the  
97   [go to Contents ] 
  commissioning of a suitably qualified or experienced adviser to demonstrate that the 
requirements of the policy can be satisfied.  
New Non -Residential Development  
9.13.  The NPPF gives clear guidance that planning policies should support economic growth in rural 
areas, and together with other policies in the Plan, Part 4 of this policy provides support for 
appropriate proposals for new non -residential development in the Count ryside  Policy Area .  
These uses may include the growth and expansion of rural businesses, the development and 
diversification of agricultural and land -base d rural businesses and sustainable tourism and 
leisure developments.  
 
9.14.  Wherever possible development s hould be located within existing settlements or new 
Development Allocations.  Nevertheless Part 4 recognises that sites to meet local business and 
community needs in rural areas may need to be located adjacent to , or beyond existing 
settlement limits, wher e they can demonstrate that there is an overriding benefit to the local 
economy and/or community and/or environment  for locating development away from built up 
areas.

  Chapter 10: Green Infrastructure  
 
Introduction  
10.1.  Green infrastructure is the network o f green spaces, corridors and ecological networks within , 
around and between towns and villages which can be designed, maintained and improved to 
meet the needs of local communities, wildlife and the environment.  The network is made up of 
open spaces for sport, recreation and children’s play, wildlife and geological sites, woodlands, 
waterways , cycle routes, public rights of way, street trees, allotments, private gardens and 
floodplains.  The green infrastructure network in Doncaster provides multiple func tions and 
benefits to communities and the environment at a local, neighbourhood and regional level.  We 
recognise the role of green infrastructure in supporting healthy communities, cultural value, a 
buoyant economy and aiding resilience to climate change.   Not all green infrastructure assets 
are publicly accessible , for example, privately owned gardens and some local wildlife sites 
contribute toward green infrastructure, but are not open to the public.  
 
10.2.  The policies within this chapter seek to maintain, pr otect, enhance and extend all assets in the 
green infrastructure network in Doncaster.  Development proposals will be supported which 
contribute to an attractive and connected environment including creating and enhancing green 
corridors that link urban are as to countryside.  The policies provide the detail on how our green 
infrastructure visions and objectives will be achieved through the planning system by providing 
a network of well -connected habitats  and an attractive, healthier, safer and more active pl ace to 
live and work.  
 
 
Policy 26: Green Infrastructure  (Strategic Policy)   
 
The Council  will protect, maintain, enhance and, where possible, extend or create Doncaster’s green 
infrastructure  (GI), including landscapes, ecological networks, n atural environment, open spaces, public 
rights of way, geodiversity, biodiversity, navigable river and waterway assets, through the following 
principles:   
 
A) Proposals will be supported which contribute toward green infrastructure and have regard to the 
latest Council GI audits and strategies. The green infrastructure should principally benefit the 
development but also connect to the wider network.  All major development proposals of 1 
hectare or more (see also Policy 42 Part C ) will be required to demonstrate how the 
developm ent:  
 
1. contribute s toward delivering identified opportunities , priorities and address local need ; 
2. create s or enhance s green corridors, including rights of way;  
3. provid es specific and dedicated spaces for wil dlife to encourage a more robust and  
   connected network of habitats;  
4. consider s tranquillity and provide for generous biodiversity rich open spaces;  
5. provide s well designed and accessible, sport, recreation and children’s play space and  
   food growing opp ortunities;  
6. avoid s loss or damage or deterioration to green infrastructure assets;  
7. define s and soften s the edges of settlements to provide a high quality transition between  
   urban and rural areas particularly at urban greenfield extensions;  
8. meet s the Council’s requirements in terms of type, detailed siting, size, shape and design;  
9. helps people and wildlife adapt to the impacts of climate change by including naturalised  
   forms of flood storage and/or incorporating additional tree planting within develop ments;  
  and 
10. provide s for long term protection and climate change resilience through smart  
   developments, management and maintenance.  
  
100   [go to Contents ] 
  B) Proposals adjacent or near to waterways , including those which contribute towards delivering 
identified opportunities and priorities, such as at the Doncaster Waterfront and Stainforth 
Marina, will be supported which:  
 
1. take account of the different existing or potential roles, characteristics and functions of  
   waterways such as for sustainable transport for water borne freight; for recreational use  
   for walking or cycling; and/or for value as a wildlife corridor;  
2. safeguard and improve environmental quality and amenity ; 
3. enhance the local environment and access to and along waterway corridors;  
4. take into account the needs  of all users; and  
5. avoid loss, damage or deterioration of waterways assets and ensure they are an integral  
   part of the development.  
 
Explanation  
10.3.  National planning policy requires new development to protect, restore, maintain, create, 
enhance and extend green infrastructure and improve connectivity within the network.  
Development is also required  to be sustainable and compensate for damage to the environment 
whilst expecting the natural environment to function as an integrated network of habitats.  
Acces s to high quality green infrastructure, including open space for sport, recreation, 
biodiversity and food growing (such as allotments , community gardens or orchards) makes an 
important contribution to the health and well -being of communities.  The policy p rovide s for 
economic, social and environmental benefits, and help address local GI needs , implement  and 
deliver targets set out in our various local strategies.  
 
10.4.  As an example , there are a number of strategic and local priorities identified and included in  the 
2014 Green Infrastructure Strategy including:  
 
 The Humberhead Peatlands NNR (Nature Improvement Area)  
 Dearne Valley Green Heart  (Nature Improvement Area)  
 The river Don (including the Don Gorge)  
 The Magnesian Limestone ridge  
  
10.5.  The Government’s 25 -Year Environment Plan17 commits  to the development of a national 
‘Nature Recovery Network’, intended to improve, expand and connect habitats to address 
wildlife decline and prov ide wider environmental benefits  for people.  The Network will be 
delivered in partnership, including those of the above and be informed by their strategic plans.  
Whilst the local conservation objectives and priorities for the Network are broadly understo od, 
the 25 -Year Environment Plan state s that initially opportunities for nature recovery will be 
explored through the national priorities of: peatland restoration, natural flood management and 
woodland planting, all of which can be delivered as part of Don caster’s ecological network (see 
Policy 29). 
 
10.6.  Green  infrastructure provision requires consideration at the outset and should be addressed as 
an integral part of any new development.  Proposals that benefit strategic and loca l priorities will 
be supported.  Assessing provision and addressing local GI needs are an essential requirement 
for any housing proposal especially when providing family homes, which for the purpose of 
these policies are 2 bedroomed units capable of suppor ting families.  Green  infrastructure 
should be considered as an integral part of any new development  and include landscaping, well 
designed sustainable drainage systems,  providing quality habitat,  accessible amenity areas, 
nature conservation areas and pla y space which meet the Council’s requirements in terms of 
detailed siting, size, shape and design .  GI should form an integral part of the design of major 
planning applications as set out in Policy 42 Part C.  
 
                                                           
17 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25 -year -environment -plan   
101   [go to Contents ] 
  10.7.  Developers should refer to the most recent strategies  for guidance and information  and take 
account of the Local Plan’s health and well-being , design and built environment policies , as well 
as available environmental audits and strategies . 
 
10.8.  Development proposals will be  supported that include considerations for green in frastructure  
within which  developer s should evaluate all the GI assets and facilities in the vicinity of the 
proposal, taking account of quantity, accessibility, quality and value to the local community.  
This will identify priorities in the area and allow for their inclusion in the development scheme.  
Green Infrastructure considerations will therefore have their own defined principles and 
objectives dependent on the nature and location of the development.  
 
10.9.  The real benefit of green infrastructure to planning is that it can help deliver other local, regional 
and national planning policy objectives, not just those related to green space.  The challenge is 
ensuring that green infrastructure is capable of prov iding functions which will meet numerous 
planning objectives through careful design, planning and management.  The green 
infrastructure corridors identified in the Green Infrastructure (GI) Strategy  will help provide the 
evidence to achieve this.  Green infrastructure provision should be linked to the size, scale and 
location of the proposed development.  Where appropriate such provision will include ecological 
netw orks, biodiversity, trees and open space and sustainable transport links covered by other 
policies within this Plan. 
 
10.10.  A number of Doncaster’s green infrastructure assets are identified on the Policies  Map linked to 
specific policies such as open space, loc al wildlife and geological sites, woodlands, tree and 
hedgerows.  A hierarchy of Green Infrastructure corridors , identifying key nodes, assets and 
project areas , has been  developed in conjunction with Natural England.  These connect or are 
capable of conne cting green spaces to improve green infrastructure and wildlife connectivity 
(see Figure 8).  
 
10.11.  The  multi -functional nature of waterways presents planning challenges and opportunities .  The 
policy emphasises the impo rtance of providing for economic, social and environmental benefits 
of waterways development , including and emphasising leisure, recreation and sustainable 
transport .  As places where people live, work and relax, it is important therefore to avoid any 
unne cessary pressure on existing waterways infrastructure.  As such , any new development 
proposal should put the waterway at the ‘heart’ of the development, with the proposal 
incorporating the characteristics of the area into the design proposal.   
 
10.12.  The impacts  of climate change are far reaching, with one of the simplest solutions being the 
incorporation of additional tree planting within new developments to alleviate temperature 
fluctuations and improve flood storage capacity.  The additional tree planting will  contribute 
toward achieving a low carbon borough by aspiring toward a tree canopy cover of 20% from 
12.2% in 201818.  In its role in reducing flood risk, the policy should be read in conjunction with 
policies in  Chap ter 14 .

Policy 27: Protecting Open Space  and Non Designated Open Space   
 
The Council  will protect open spaces which provide important opportunities for formal  and informal 
recreation as well as those which provide a social, cultural and ecological role.  Development on open 
spaces will only be acceptable which accord to the following principles : 
 
A) Within the open space policy areas , as defined on the Policies  Map, proposals for the  creation 
and enhancement of  sports and recreation facilities  will be supported , where:  
 
1. there is no loss of open space  such as playing fields or sports pitches ; 
2. visual amenity is retained and enhanced; and  
3. the environmental and ecologi cal value is retained and enhanced.  
 
B) Within non -designated open space, development proposals will only be supported where:  
 
1. casual playing space is unaffected;  
2. buffers between incompatible uses are unaffected;  
3. visual amenity is retained and enhanced;  
4. natur e conservation improvements are the key driver;  
5. green infrastructure connections are retained ; and  
6. the space does not contribute to the character of a Conservation Area or the setting of a  
   designated heritage asset.  
 
C) Development proposals on ‘Local Gree n Space’ , defined  on the Policies  Map, will be 
considered in accordance with national policy and guidance.  
 
D) Proposals involving the loss of open space policy areas, recreational buildings and non -
designated open space, such as playing fields , will only be  supported:  
 
1. in accordance with national policy, and  
2. where community support can be demonstrated through public consultation.  
 
Explanation  
10.13.  Open space is an important part of green infrastructure provision.  Identifying and protecting 
accessible open spaces  will contribute toward creating an environment where access to 
activities is made easier and public health improved.  Open space policy areas cover a wide 
range of existing recreation, amenity and other open space uses such as sports pitches, parks, 
playing fields and informal (casual children’s play areas), allotments, woodlands and nature 
conservation areas.  Our urban open spaces are important resources offering a range of uses, 
with a value to local communities over and above their existing or primary use.  As well as 
recreation and community resource open spaces can act as buffers between the urban edge 
and the countryside and screening between incompatible uses and of unattractive development . 
 
10.14.  Not all open spaces are afforded the same level of protec tion.  Playing fields and sports pitches 
are protected under national legislation ; some allotments, woodlands and nature conservation 
areas are also protected by law.  Remaining open space , including incidental informal open 
spaces and children’s play spac e, requires protection at a local level.  
 
10.15.  The recreational quality of open space can be eroded by insensitive development or 
incremental loss of a site.  This policy and the Policies  Map identify which areas are protected.  
The provision of new ancillary sports facilities and play equipment may be supported on open 
space policy areas provided the development proposal improves the site and results in no 
significant loss of recreationally valuable open space.  Appropriate development on open space 
may includ e a new play area, a multi -use games area (MUGA), a sports pavilion, or changing 
room improvements or extensions.  Ultimately the development has to result in an overall  
104   [go to Contents ] 
  improvement to the site, be sensitive to the local situation, result in no significant  loss of open 
space and provide significant benefits to the users.  
 
10.16.  It should be noted that urban areas include numerous open spaces which are too small to be 
mapped.  These areas (non-designated open spaces) tend to be amenity road verges, 
landscaped or g rassed incidental open spaces around buildings and residential areas and may 
have little or no recreational value.  They do however make an important contribution to the 
environmental quality of the area and contribute positively to the urban aesthetic.  These areas 
also contribute to green infrastructure and as such are protected in accordance with Policy 26.  
Any new open space created after Plan adoption is covered  by the Policy . 
 
10.17.  In line with national planning policy there are a number of  areas identified as ‘ local green 
space ’, identified by l ocal communities as being important to them  for a number of locally 
significant reasons including, proximity to the community, beauty, richness of wildlife, 
recreational value or add ing to the local character of the area.  These three sites (off Low Road 
West, Warmsworth; Sutton Road, Campsall; and Cardwell Court, Braithwell) are also identified 
on the Policies  Map as ‘Local Green Space’ in line with the ‘Local Green Space Methodology  
and Sites’ evidence base document . 
Proposals involving the loss of open space  
10.18.  National planning policy states  that ‘existing open space, sports and recreational buildings and 
land, including playing fields, should not be built on, without prior considera tion.  Development 
proposals resulting in the permanent loss of the open space will therefore be required to:  
 
 demonstrate the land provides no benefit to the community and the local community 
supports alternative proposals;  
 demonstrate through an independ ent assessment that the land or buildings are surplus to 
requirement;  
 ensure the need for and benefits of the development outweighs the loss; and  
 provide compensation for loss of facilities.  
  
10.19.  The Council will resist any development proposals resulting in the permanent loss of open 
space, especially in deficient areas.  However, we also acknowledge that not all open space is 
of value to the local community  - in such case s community consultation will be carried out and 
an assessment will be required to ident ify whether the site is suitable for a different type of open 
space use in the first instance or a beneficial local community use in the second instance.  
Permanent loss of open space will require careful consideration as this can result in increased 
press ure on remaining facilities.  
 
10.20.  Visual amenity, environmental and ecological value of the open space should also be retained 
and where possible enhanced through the protection of existing trees and other important 
habitats and through appropriate landscapin g of important areas, vistas and frontages and 
careful attention to detailed design and layout.

Policy 28: Open Space Provision in New Developments   
 
To address local green (open) space needs development proposals : 
 
A) of 20 family dwellings19 or more will be supported which contribute 10% to 15% of the site as 
on-site open space to benefit the development itself – the nature and type of which will be 
determined by having regard to the Council’s Green Space Audit and Playing Pitch Strategy . 
 
B) of 20 family dwellings or more , adjacent or close to a large open space (such as a public park or 
recreation area) alternatively may be asked to provide a commuted sum of 10% to 15% of the 
market land value20 of the development site . The open space / GI requi rements will be 
determined by having regard to the Council’s Green Space audits and strategies.  
 
C) of between 10 and 20 family dwellings will be supported which provide for a commuted sum of 
10% to 15% of the market lan d value20 of the development site to improve existing open spaces 
within the vicinity of the development . 
 
D) for retirement living schemes and / or aftercare facilities will be required to provide good quality 
on-site amenity spaces equating to 16m2 of open space p er person.  
 
E) providing on -site open space will be required to provide for sustainable open space 
management and maintenance  to be determined in discussion with the planning authority . 
 
Explanation  
10.21.  National planning policy states access to high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport 
and recreation makes an important contribution to health and well -being.  The policy is 
supported by a robust and up -to-date Playing Pitch Strategy and Green Space Audit, which 
identifies open space, sport and recreation facilities and opportunities for new provision.  Open 
spaces within or adjacent to residential areas is the most regularly and intensively used type of 
open space .  The provision of open space in residential proposals can be quite complex as the 
varied typ es of open space provide different functions and benefits to the local community.   It 
can take the form of informal, unequipped playing fields and kick -about areas, equipped play 
areas or multi -use games areas, a local park, and even a recreational sports ground.  
Woodlands, nature conservation areas, green corridors, allotments and community gardens are 
also important open spaces which form an integral part of an area’s green infrastructure.   
Doncaster’s Green Space Audit document is a useful  starting poin t to identify the type of open 
space required, but we also recommend early discussions with the Planning Authority for 
individual sites. 
 
10.22.  The policy indicates that proposals must address open space  needs with developments of 20 
family dwellings or more , providing 10% to 15% of the red line boundary as onsite open space.  
In areas that need  children’s play space (informal open space) this provision will be the highest 
priority.  On smaller development proposals the emphasis may wholly be on the provision of 
children’s play space (see paragraph 10.32 ).  On larger applications , where green space 
provision will equate to 0.4 hectares or more , the type of open space to be provided should 
include  children’s play , in the first instance , with the remain der taking the form of recreational 
sports fields, woodlands, nature conservation areas, allotments, or green infrastructure 
corridors , depending on the type of identified need in the area .  Alternatively very large 
developme nts could consider  open space provision such as a public park with integrated 
children’s play.  Ultimately the nature and type of open space will be determined by having 
regard to most up to date Green Space Audit , Playing Pitch Strategy  and Green Infrastr ucture 
                                                           
19 “Family dwelling” for the purposes of this policy means a dwelling with 2 or more bedrooms. This includes flats.  
20 The commuted sum will be 10% to 15% of the market land value of the development site as defined by the red line 
boundary of the planning application   
106   [go to Contents ] 
  Strategy . 
 
10.23.  The Green Space Audit identifies a number of different standards and associated open space 
needs within our communities,  taking account of five different open space types including : 
formal and informal open space, allotments, public parks , woodlands and nature conservation 
areas.   On-site open space provision within new development proposals will have direct regard 
to these open space types.   The provision of green (open ) space around the Borough varies 
greatly both by type and by communit y.  It is important therefore to look at local provision, 
accessibility, quality and value of green space when determining  a com munity’s needs and 
requirements as part of a new development . 
 
10.24.  The Playing Pitch Strategy  (adopted by the Council in September 2018) sets out actions and 
recommendations to maintain and improve the future delivery of sports pitches (playing fields) 
and associated sports facilities between 2018 and  2033.  The Strategy covers the sports of 
football, cricket, hockey, bowls, rugby union and rugby league and should be used by 
developers to identify needs and requirements as a result of the development proposal.  
 
10.25.  Development proposals of between 10  to 20  family dwellings will be required to provide a 
commuted sum.  The market value of a site will be established by the Council’s in -house 
property surveyors , taking account of any information provided by the applicant,  and this will be 
used to determine the amount of commuted sum, to be agreed through a Section 106 
agreement.  Development  proposals of 20 dwellings or more, adjacent to or in the vicinity of a 
large open space or recreation area , may alternatively be required to provide a commuted sum 
for open space improvements or a combination of commuted sum and on -site provision if the 
evidence in the Green Space Audit supports  the need for improvements over new open space.  
In assessing the exact amount of commuted sum and/or on -site provision  to be provide d, the 
Council will have regard to the nature and location of the development and existing open space 
needs within the community  (see paragraph 10.30).  The commuted sum will be 10% to 15% of 
the market land valu e of the development  site as defined by the red -line boundary of the 
planning application . 
 
10.26.  It is important that proposals for retirement living schemes and aftercare facilities  provide for 
good quality on-site amenity open space as research shows that peo ple aged 65 and over are 
more likely to suffer from poor health  and, as a group , may be the least likely to benefit from 
green infrastructure because they may be more susceptible to environmental stressors . 
 
10.27.  Please note, where larger development proposals  or areas  are broken down into multiple 
applications  or phases of less than ten units , and a new application is received within 3 years , 
the policy will be applied as if it is one single development and address the open space 
requirements as a whole.  
Open S pace Considerations in New Developments  
10.28.  Within new developments open space provision should be an integral part of the planning 
application – see Policy 26.  It is important to identify priorities in the area and allow for their 
inclusion within  the development scheme.  
 
10.29.  To ensure the delivery of appropriate type of open space (outdoor sport, informal play and 
recreation provision ) planning applications  should:  
 
 identify types of open spaces, their locations and define the use s; 
 include areas of natural play (where  appropriate) ; 
 identify movement patterns for pedestrians, cycles and motor vehicles;  
 identify how the streets and open space are connected; and  
 identify relationships between buildings (including indoor sports facili ties) and public and 
private spaces.   
107   [go to Contents ] 
  Addressing Open Space Needs and Priorities  
10.30.  The Council  will liaise with developer s to agree area specific priorities for development 
proposal s having regard to open space needs  and priorities within a community as ident ified in 
the latest Green Space Audit.  The preference is always for on -site provision where possible.  
However, in circumstances where it is considered that the creation and or improvement of off -
site open -space is more appropriate, a commuted sum may be accepted.  In making this 
judgement  the Council will have  regard to the overall size of the development proposal , location  
and whether the area has sufficient provision of good quality accessible open space.  
Open Space Management and Maintenance  
10.31.  To ensur e the sustainability and longevity of open spaces the Council  will discuss and agree 
with the developer how the open spaces will be protected , managed and maintained.  A number 
of options are available including:  
 
 adoption by the Council (which would be ac companied by a commuted sum for 15 times 
the annual maintenance cost); or 
 retention by the developer accompanied by the establishment of a management and 
maintenance company (including legal agreement and covenant) ; or  
 gifting to an established green spac e / open space trust, charity or town / parish council . 
Children’s Play Space and Provision of New Play Equipment  
10.32.  Proposals for new or improve d children’s play spaces, including the provision of new play 
equipment , should : 
 
 have regard to Fields in Trust g uidance;  
 ensure children’s play areas and open spaces are safe, clearly observed, accessible;  
 meet the communities needs and do not lead to further nuisance ; and 
 incorporate robust and durable equipment . 
 
10.33.  It is important to note that outdoor informal play space is not the same as public open space.  
Fields in Trust (FIT) define outdoor playing space as ‘space which is available for sport, active 
recreation and or children’s play, which is of a suitable size, and nature for the intended purpose 
and safely ac cessible and available to the general public’.  FIT also provide guidelines for Local 
Areas of Play (LAP), Local Equipped Areas of  Play (LEAP), and Neighbourhood Equipped 
Areas of Play (NEAP).  These guidelines are summarised in Table 13 below and should be 
used specifically for the design of children’s play areas.

108   [go to Contents ] 
  10.34.  A play area proposal shou ld be accompanied by ‘Risk Benefit Analysis’ (HSE Children’s Play 
and Leisure – Promoting a balanced approach).   This will help to ensure all equipped play areas 
are safe, easily observed, accessible, provide challenges and do not lead to further nuisance.  
 
10.35.  To avoid  undue financial burden on the Council , and to ensure ready access to the parts and 
materials to ensure equipment is maintained to an acceptable and safe standard , developers 
should ensure the equipment is robust and sustainable.  Equipment will not be considered for 
adoption by the Council if it is considered to incur excessive maintenance and management 
costs, or is deemed unsuitable for the community.  It is therefore important for developers to 
liaise with the Council  prior to design and costi ngs being commissioned.  
 
10.36.  The applicant should also provide the Council with a copy of the post installation inspection 
certificate certifying the play equipment meets the required safety standard.   The inspection 
must be carried out by an independent regis tered Playground Equipment Inspector.  The 
Council’s Play Equipment Inspector must also inspect the play area, if the Local Authority is to 
adopt it.  
 
 
Policy 29: Ecological Networks  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Proposals will only be supported which  deliver a net gain for biodiversity and  protect, create, maintain 
and enhance the Borough's ecological networks by:  
 
A) being of an appropriate size, scale and type in relation to their location within and impact on the 
ecological network;  
 
B) maintaining, streng thening and bridging gaps in existing habitat networks;  
 
C) planting native species and creating new, or restoring existing, national and local priority 
habitats and/or species; and  
 
D) working with strategic partnerships to deliver conservation projects at a l andscape scale where 
appropriate.  
 
Explanation  
10.37.  The emphasis of nature conservation is shifting from protecting wildlife solely within discrete 
sites to establishing a network of core areas of habitat that are robustly linked together through 
habitat corrid ors resilient to environmental change and human pressure.  An independent 
review21 of England’s wildlife sites and ecological network made five key recommendations: to 
improve management of existing wildlife sites; to increase the size of existing wildlife sites; to 
improve the connections between sites; to create new sites; and to reduce the pressure on 
wildlife by improving the wider environment. While the responsibility for achieving this does not 
solely lie with the development sector, it does have an im portant role to play.  National planning 
policy requires development to be sustainable and compensate for damage to the environment 
as well as expecting the natural environment to function as an integrated network of habitats.  
 
10.38.  To assist with the vision of  having a coherent ecological network the Council has identified a 
series of Biodiversity Opportunity Areas (See Figure  9).  Development proposals within these  
areas can deliver the most for the ecological network by  directing compensation or 
enhancement measures  towards the creation or restoration of habitats that are particularly 
important for that part of the ecological network  (as shown in Table 14).  Landscape scale 
conserv ation partnerships, including Nature Improvements Areas (NIAs) and River Catchment 
Partnerships operate within the Biodiversity Opportunity Areas and plan and deliver strategic 
conservation objectives.  The Dearne Valley Green Heart NIA and Humberhead leve ls NIA both

  fall partly within Doncaster.  Development proposals in proximity to these areas should look to 
contribute towards these initiatives , which will be key contributors to Doncaster’s ‘ Nature 
Recovery Network ’. 
 
10.39.  Doncaster’s Biodiversity Opportunity Areas have been selected based on regional level studies 
to identify priority landscape scale project areas for conservation work , but adapted locally 
reflecting geological data or locally available habit at data , and split into smaller sections where 
this helps to target the types of habitat that the Council would like to see in an area more 
precisely.  An additional two opportunity areas have been identified that encompass areas that 
are important locally  in the ecological network.

Policy 30: Valuing Biodive rsity and Geodiversity  (Strategic Policy)  
 
The Borough has a range of internationally , nationally, and locally important habitats, sites and species 
that will be protected through the following principles:  
 
A) All proposals shall be considered in light of the  mitigation hierarchy in accordance with National 
Policy . 
 
B) Proposals which may harm designated Local Wildlife Sites, Local Geological Sites, Priority 
Habitats, Priority Species, protected species or non -designated sites or features of biodiversity 
interest , will only be supported where:  
 
1. they use the DEFRA biodiversity metric to demonstrate that a proposal will deliver a  
   minimum 10% net gain for biodiversity;  
2. they protect, restore, enhance and provide appropriate buffers around wildlife and  
   geological  features and bridge gaps to link these to the wider ecological network;  
3. they produce and deliver appropriate long term management plans for local wildlife and  
   geological sites as well as newly created or restored habitats;  
4. they can demonstrate that the  need for a proposal outweighs the value of any features to  
   be lost; and  
5. if the permanent loss of a geological site is unavoidable, then provision will be made for  
   the site to first be recorded by a suitably qualified expert.  
 
C) Proposals which may imp act Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas or 
RAMSAR Sites will only be supported where it can be demonstrated that there will be no likely 
significant effects and no adverse effects on the integrity of European sites, unless there are no 
alternative solutions and it is justified by an “imperative reasons of overriding public interest” 
(IROPI) assessment under the Habitats Directives.  
 
D) Proposals that may either directly or indirectly negatively impact Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest wi ll not normally be supported.  Proposals should seek to protect and enhance Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest and maintain, strengthen, and bridge gaps to link them to the wider 
ecological network  wherever possible.  
 
E) In order to ensure development does not negatively impact on nightjar populations, proposals 
located within 3km of Thorne and Hatfield Moors Special Protection Area, that impact habitats 
that nightjars may use for feeding on, will only be supported where they deliver a net gain in 
nightjar f oraging habitat.  
 
Explanation  
10.40.  National planning policies and legislation protect international sites, such as Thorne and Hatfield 
Moors Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area, and Doncaster's 15 Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest Figure 10).  The Council  will work in partnership with other agencies 
to ensure the interests of all these sites are protected and enhanced.  Thorne and Hatfield 
Moors Special Protection Area is designated as it supports m ore than 1% of Great Britain’s 
population of breeding pairs of nightjar.  While the breeding habitat of nightjar is protected by 
the boundary of the Special Protection Area birds fly several  kilometres  from their nesting sites 
to find food.  It is therefor e important that their feeding habitats, which cover a large area in the 
east of the Borough , are protected.   In addition the Borough has approximately 350 local wildlife 
and geological sites, many of which are in private ownership.  As well as their biodi versity or 
geodiversity value local sites contribute to the distinctive character of an area making the 
Borough a pleasant place to live and work.  This policy will help ensure these sites are 
protected during development and managed appropriately for the features for which they are 
designated.  
  
112   [go to Contents ] 
  10.41.  The use of the mitigation hierarchy will ensure  that the most valuable ecological features of a 
site are protected and harm to biodiversity is minimised.   In line with best practice, the provision 
of compensation to  account for residual biodiversity impacts will not be allowed unless the prior 
steps of the mitigation hierarchy have been followed, and all opportunities to avoid and then 
minimise negative impacts have first been pursued. Impacts on irreplaceable habita ts such as 
ancient woodland and lowland raised mire will not be supported and cannot be accounted 
through a Net Gain approach.   Using the  latest  DEFRA biodiversity metric is an effective way of 
accounting for the impacts of a proposal on biodiversity and d emonstrating that a net gain will 
be delivered.  It also provides flexibility and encourages projects to consider biodiversity from 
the outset .  Use of the metric  rewards schemes that  minimise their impacts  but also gives 
options to developers in terms of whether necessary mitigation is delivered on or off site.   A 
minimum 10% net gain will be expected unless national standards increase this in the future.  In 
order to properly inform applications, surveys will be required in line with the latest British 
Standard (BS42020 2013  or its replacement ).  It is expected that compensation will be directed 
towards projects that contribute to Doncaster’s Nature Recovery Network and other biodiversity 
and landscape scale conservation priorities.  Proposals can sometime s affect land surrounding, 
or neighbouring, local sites as well as impacting them directly.  Proposals can sometimes affect 
land surrounding, or neighbouring, local sites as well as impacting  them directly.  The policy 
therefore requires that appropriate b uffers are provided around Local Sites to ensure that the 
features of interest for which a site is designated are not lost.  Where necessary the Council  will 
also seek planning obligations to help to bring a greater number of Doncaster's local sites into 
good management and secure their long term sustainability.  This is important as it will not only 
preserve the extent of the ecological network but also improve the quality of the habitats 
present.  
 
10.42.  The policy will also protect breeding populations of night jar on Thorne and Hatfield Moors. 
Nightjar feed on insects such as moths so habitats such as hedgerows, scrub, grassland, 
ditches and ponds are therefore important.  This policy will ensure no net loss of these types of 
habitat and hence protect this impor tant internationally designated site.  In line with the aim of 
supporting jobs and growth in the Borough of Doncaster the policy gives flexibility in terms of 
whether sites retain existing habitats or choose instead to create new habitats nearby in 
compens ation for those that will be lost (all offsite habitat creation must still be within 3km of the 
SPA).  Developments that do not result in the loss of, or damage to, nightjar foraging habitat 
would not trigger the policy and therefore would not be required to create new nightjar foraging 
habitat.  
 
10.43.  The Local Biodiversity Action Plan and Geodiversity Action Plan describe Doncaster's 
biodiversity and geodiversity resource and Doncaster’s Green Infrastructure Strategy 2014 sets 
targets to focus their conservatio n.  The Council has also set out criteria defining why an area 
will be designated as a local wildlife or geological site.  The location of Local Sites are shown on 
the Policies  Map.  Together with published information on nationally and internationally 
designated sites these resources tell us where many of Doncaster's important habitats and 
species are located .  The Council’s website also provides a Biodiversi ty Map22 that collates all 
the latest information on biodiversity and geodiversity designations and nature conservation 
areas such as Nature Improvement Areas and Biodiversity Opportunity Areas.

Policy 31: Local Wildlife and Geological Sites  
 
Local Wildlife and Geological Sites will be identified and designated by the Council  and are  shown on the 
Policies  Map.   Other sites, including those awaiting designation, w hich can be demonstrated to meet the 
selection guidelines for Local Sites will be afforded the same level of protection.  
 
Explanation  
10.44.  Local Sites are areas of land that support recognised and valued attributes concerning habitats, 
species or geological fea tures, which by definition (as set out within the site selection guidelines  
in Appendix  8) are of substantive local biodiversity or geodiversity importance.  Local Sites 
therefore represent the core biodiversity compon ents of local ecological networks , and 
complement statutory sites such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest which are designated to 
protect the best examples of the UKs flora, fauna and geological features.  This policy is the 
mechanism by which these i mportant core sites are identified and their substantive interests can 
be taken into account as part of development proposals.  Protecting and maintaining a 
functioning ecological network which includes these biodiverse Local Sites, enables the natural 
environment to effectively deliver ecosystem services and adapt to pressures such as climate 
change and development.   Enhancing, buffering and connecting Local Sites will contribute to 
the Borough’s ‘ Nature Recovery Ne twork ’. 
 
10.45.  The designations shown on the Policies  Map represent our knowledge and assessment of  Local 
Sites at a fixed point in time  and it is important to note that this is a snapshot of a n ongoing 
process  of review .  The Council  works with conservation pa rtners to continuously collect  and 
record environmental information and assess sites against the Local Site selection guidelines .   
The conservation value of existing Local Site s as well as non -designated sites  may change over 
time and it is expected that new sites will come forward for designation whilst others will need to 
be removed from th e series.   It is therefore necessary for the Local Site series to be updated , 
using the Local Site selection guidelines , to ensure that all sites can be demonstrated t o be of 
substantive biodiversity and geodiversity interest.   Any site that can be shown to meet the Local 
Sites selection guidelines will receive the same level of protection as a designated site but may 
not be shown on the Policies  Map until it is updated . 
 
10.46.  The environmental information we hold about Local Sites is managed by the Doncaster Local 
Records Centre and forms the primary evidence base for the implementation of this policy. 
Information supporting development proposals is therefore expected to con sider this information 
and address how the biodiversity and/or geodiversity features underpinning a site’s reasons for 
designation will be protected  and enhanced to provide a net biodiversity gain.   In some 
scenarios Local Sites may offer appropriate recep tor areas  for biodiversity compensation 
measures resulting from  development elsewhere, i.e. through an agreed Biodiversity 
enhancement  scheme.  
 
 
Policy 32: Woodlands, Trees and Hedgerows  
 
Proposals will be supported where it can be demonstrat ed that woodlands, trees and hedgerows have 
been adequately considered during the design process, so that a significant adverse impact upon public 
amenity or ecological interest has been avoided.  There will be presumption against development that 
results in the loss or deterioration of ancient woodland and/or veteran trees.   Proposals will need to 
include:  
 
A) the submission of survey information of woodland, trees and hedgerows, as appropriate, to a 
recognised professional and fit for purpose standard which  is able to demonstrate evaluation of 
these features for realistic long -term retention, and how this has positively informed the design 
process;  
 
B) demonstration of how retained features are to be protected during development;   
115   [go to Contents ] 
   
C) an adequate landscape buffer ( which excludes built development and residential gardens) 
adjacent to existing woodlands, wildlife sites and at settlement edges;  
 
D) sufficient provision of appropriate replacement planting where it is intended to remove trees and 
hedgerows; and  
 
E) avoidance o f the loss or deterioration of woodland.  
 
Explanation  
10.47.  A pleasant and attractive environment including woodlands, trees, shrubs and other green 
assets  contributes to maintaining and improving the quality of life for people living and working 
in Doncaster an d is significant in helping to attract new investment into the Borough .  The 
evaluation of these existing assets is an important part of the design process for development 
proposals .  Retaining positive green infrastructure assets wherever possible ensures  the 
environment is not damaged and that these assets are available for the benefit of future 
generations.  This is particularly important for woodlands, especially ancient woodlands which 
have an unbroken history of tree cover and are uniquely valuable an d irreplaceable habitats, 
with no effective form of compensation for their loss or deterioration.  
 
10.48.  Trees can also confer economic benefits to Doncaster through the provision of ‘ecosystem 
services’.  Such services include the production of oxygen, the capt ure and storage of carbon, 
the removal of pollutants from the air and the slowing of storm water run -off.  Trees are an 
essential component of urban biodiversity providing food and shelter to many important native 
and migratory birds and animals and provid e a vital resource of deadwood for many 
invertebrates.  
 
10.49.  The retention  of trees and hedgerows that are present on or adjacent to a site is a consideration 
whether or not they are protected.  New tree planting should be recognised from the outset as 
an integ ral part of any development scheme, not just those where it is proposed to remove 
existing trees.  Development layouts should be designed to ensure that retained and newly 
planted trees have sufficient space to flourish and mature and deliver their full ra nge of 
environmental benefits without causing harmful nuisance.  Trees, which are poorly related to 
buildings, can cause structural problems, distress or financial loss to occupants.   In order to 
deliver the greatest environmental benefits, the use of nati ve tree and hedgerow species will be 
encouraged where appropriate.  
 
10.50.  In no circumstances should woodland be included within residential curtilage and an appropriate 
buffer zone will normally be required between the woodland edge and development, although it  
may be possible to locate non -amenity uses within these areas (e.g. service roads or garages), 
subject to other constraints.  Maintaining the ecological connectivity of woodlands via green 
corridors is a key consideration, and the function of hedgerows is  particularly important in this 
respect.  Proposals that either directly or indirectly result in the loss or deterioration of ancient 
woodland will not be supported unless the need for and benefits of the development at that 
location clearly outweigh the l oss.  When considering the planning balance in these cases 
compensation proposals must not be considered as part of the benefits resulting from a 
development.  
 
10.51.  There are nationally recognised surveying methods (for example , the current version of British 
Standards Institute 5837: Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction – 
Recommendations; Defra (2007) and the Hedgerow Survey Handbook, a standard procedure 
for local surveys in the UK).   These are readily available online to aid the planning p rocess. The 
Borough’s Green Infrastructure Strategy sets out the key principles that ensure that the 
provision of green assets is embedded in to the design of development, adding value to the 
place -making process.  Supplementary Planning Documents may be p repared to support this 
policy.   
116   [go to Contents ] 
   
 
Policy 33: Landscape  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Proposals will be supported that take account of the quality, local distinctiveness and the sensitivity to 
change of distinctive landscape character areas and individua l landscape features , in particular Thorne 
and Hatfield Moors .  Development will be permitted provided that it conserves, enhances and, where 
possible, restores:  
 
A) the landscape character and local distinctiveness of the area including its historical, biodi versity, 
cultural character and its tranquillity;  
 
B) the distinctive setting of, and relationship between, settlements and buildings and the landscape 
including important views;  
 
C) the nature conservation value of the area including the pattern of woodland, fo rests, trees, field 
boundaries, vegetation and other features;  
 
D) the special qualities of rivers, waterways, wetlands and their surroundings; and  
 
E) the topography of the area including sensitive skylines, hillsides and geological features . 
 
Where development  proposals will most likely result in a significant impact on the Borough’s landscape 
the proposals should assess the potential impact (including cumulative impact) and  propose how any 
negative effects will be minimised.  In doing so consideration should b e given to:  
 
F) alternative site selection;  
 
G) the scale, massing, design, form, layout, orientation and/ or operation of the development;  
 
H) the incorporation of suitable mitigation measures; or  
 
I) where suitable mitigation measures are not achievable on site, the n development should 
provide appropriate compensation off site.  
 
Landscape works shall be appropriate to the scale of the development in accordance with Policy 48 
(Landscaping of New Developments).  
 
Explanation  
10.52.  Landscape set ting is an important element contributing to local character and quality of life.  It is 
concerned with the positive, distinct, recognisable and consistent pattern of elements that make 
each landscape  and settlement different.  These elements are defined b y geology, landform, 
drainage, vegetation cover, settlement pattern and land use.  The policy is needed to protect, 
maintain and enhance the distinct character, identity and setting of existing settlements.  This in 
turn will help to support local distinct iveness, regeneration and foster community pride by 
maintaining and enhancing a sense of place for people living in different areas.  This policy will 
help the Borough to grow but in a manner that is sensitive to its landscape.  
 
10.53.  The landscape character and  quality of the Borough’s countryside varies considerably.  To the 
west and south lies the attractive belt of Magnesian limestone country bisected by the Don and 
Went Gorges, well wooded and mostly intensively farmed.  To the east is the Bunter sandstone, 
less hilly and quite extensively farmed.  To the north -east lies a much larger and generally flat 
landscape, criss -crossed by drainage ditches and with extensive peat moors.  Distinctive local 
elements such as hedgerows, trees, copses, woodlands, river val leys, ponds, watercourses, 
historical sites, estate features, enclosure landscapes, stone walls and other built heritage 
features all contribute to the overall character.  The tranquillity of significant areas of  
117   [go to Contents ] 
  undisturbed countryside also contributes su bstantially to the quality of the countryside and its 
enjoyment.  
 
10.54.  The Landscape Character and Capacity studies in Doncaster describe variations in the 
landscape, which make one area distinctive from another, and assess landscape sensitivity and 
the capaci ty of the landscape to accommodate various types of development without adverse 
effects.  These will be material considerations in the determination of relevant planning 
applications.  
 
10.55.  Support will be given to initiatives, strategies and projects working t owards or contributing to 
landscape scale  conservation, implementing an integrated approach to managing the 
environment and all its functions.  
 
10.56.  Landscape scheme preparation shall be appropriate to the scale of the development and its 
impact, and shall have  regard to appropriate technical standards.  Consideration shall be given 
to: 
 
 potential future climate change  
 existing soil resource and the requirements for ground preparation  
 retention of existing vegetation  
 appropriate species selection and spatial req uirements  
 site utilities, services and circulation  
 tree planting sizes, specifications and accessories  
 sustainable drainage, including use of green roofs, rain gardens and rainwater harvesting  
 community involvement, access and safety issues  
 maintenance and  management including replacements of failed stock.

  Chapter 11: The Historic Environment  
 
Intro duction  
11.1.  Doncaster's rich  and diverse  heritage assets includ e evidence of early settlements, castles, 
country houses and estates, nationally significant par ks and gardens, historic market towns and 
villages, ecclesiastical, agricultural, civic and industrial buildings, railway and canal structures, 
twentieth -century suburbs and planned colliery settlements .  The geology of the Borough  gives 
rise to an interes ting variety of vernacular building materials from sandstone buildings  to the 
west, through limestone buildings, to brick and timber -framed buildings to the east.  Stone slate, 
Welsh slate and clay pantile roofs are distinctive characteristics of parts of the Borough.   Policy 
34 identifies  those heritage assets that are of particular importance to the distinctive character  
of Doncaster and the enjoyment of its historic environment  and how those assets will be 
conserved for th e future .  
 
11.2.  The development management policies which apply to the historic environment of the Borough 
follow the significance led approach of national policy  in the NPPF.  An adequate analysis of the 
significance of heritage assets affected by proposals i s essential for understanding the impact of 
any such proposals so Policy 35 and its supporting text is fundamental to good decision making. 
This is followed by more detailed policies  for all types of applications affecting d esignated and 
non-designated heritage assets within Doncaster so that applicants may make more successful 
applications.  These policies either expand on those within the NP  `PF or develop on 
areas where the NPPF is silent.  
 
11.3.  The benefits of these policies should contribute towards improving the quality of the historic built 
and landscaped environment and , in conjunction with other design policies , the stimulation of 
high architectural quality in new buildings, the creation of a stronger local identity and s ense of 
place, increased sustainability, and the encouragement of local building craft skills.  
 
 
 
Policy 34: Valuing our Historic Environment  (Strategic Policy)   
 
Doncaster’s historic environment will be conserved in accordance with the follow ing principles : 
 
A) Proposals and initiatives will be supported which preserve and, where appropriate, enhance the 
heritage significance and setting of the Borough’s heritage assets (including locally identified 
undesignated heritage assets), and especially t hose elements which contribute to the distinct 
identity of the Borough. These include:  
 
1. the nationally -important waterlogged archaeological remains at Sutton Common, Thorne  
   Moor, and Hatfield Moor;  
2. the Roman camps and settlements, motte and bailey cast les, historic houses, historic  
  parks and gardens and villages, with special regard to those along the Southern  
  Magnesian Limestone Ridge;  
3. the Georgian townscape and the railway heritage of Doncaster, its historic grain, including  
   its street layout s and plot sizes and key views and vistas especially of the spires and  
  towers of Doncaster’s churches;  
4. the Borough’s historic market towns such as Thorne, Hatfield, Bawtry, and Tickhill;  
5. early twentieth century suburban developments, including planned colliery villages; and  
6. sites and structures associated with aviation history including the heritage of the second  
   world war and cold war.  
 
B) Proposals and initiatives will be supported which improve the accessibility and enjoyment of  the 
Borough’s  existin g and potential  local, regional and national historic attractions in keeping with 
their heritage significance. These include:  
  
120   [go to Contents ] 
  1. The Mansion House  
2. Cusworth Hall and its parkland  
3. Doncaster  Minster  (St. George’s Church)  
4. Conisbrough Castle  
5. Brodsworth Hall and p arkland.  
 
C) Proposals and init iatives will be supported which identify, promote and secure the long term 
future of Doncaster’s heritage assets . These include:  
 
1. increasing and making  publically available  our knowledge and understandi ng of the  
   historic envi ronment gained through the planning process;  
2. continuing to review existing and prospective parks and gardens of local historic interest  
   and consideration of the designation of buildings of local architectural and historic  
   interest;  
3. the identification  of heritage assets at risk and implementing strategies and initiatives to  
   reduce their number through positive management;  
4. supporting the re -use of sites and buildings of heritage significance putting them to  
   viable  uses consistent with their conse rvation; and  
5. supporting investment in the repair and maintenance of Doncaster’s historic buildings . 
 
Explanation  
11.4.  The Borough has around 800 listed buildings, designated nationally.  In addition, we have 4 
nationally registered parks and gardens of special historic interest and 51 nationally  designated 
scheduled monuments.  These are detailed in The National List for England which is publically 
available.  The Borough has designated 46 conservation  areas reflecting the variety of heritage 
assets described in  Policy 34 and their individual characteristics contribute to the distinctive 
character of the Boroug h.  
 
11.5.  Undesignated heritage assets also contribute to local character.  There are 26 parks and 
gardens  of various types we h ave identified as being worthy of designation as Parks and 
Gardens of Local Historic Interest.   The Borough has a rich archaeological record which can be 
found in the Sites and Monuments Record held by the South Yorkshire Archaeology Service 
(SYAS).  Outsi de conservation areas there are likely to be numbers of historic buildings and 
structures which while not meriting national listing also contribute to local distinctiveness.  The 
process of identifying such buildings and structures is described under Polic y 40 below . 
 
11.6.  Part A of th is policy together with the supporting policies  in this chapter  explains how the 
Borough’s historic environment will be sustained and enhanced particularly with regard to 
reinforcing local distinctiv eness .  Part A identifies particularly important elements which 
contribute to the distinctive character of the Borough which is intended to give them additional 
weight in planning decisions.  This policy places importance on identifying and protecting the 
distinctive local identity of the Borough’s heritage assets whether these be ‘designated’ (e.g. 
listed buildings, conservation areas or Scheduled Monuments) or ‘undesignated’ (e.g. local 
parks and gardens of historic interest or as yet unknown archaeologic al remains).  
 
11.7.  The purpose of Part B of this policy is to give increased weight in decision making to proposals 
that serve to increase the accessibility to, and enjoyment of, key buildings which are important 
to the heritage of the Borough  and to encourag e greater opportunities for use of the historic 
environment in education and increased levels of investment and tourism.   Heritage assets of 
national significance are identified in the policy but the policy is intended to apply equally to 
other heritage ass ets of regional or local significance.  How the  long-term conservation of the 
Borough’s heritage assets can be achieved through the planning process is identified in Part C 
of the policy.

Policy 35: Understanding and Recording the Historic Environment  
 
Proposals that affect known or potential heritage assets will require:  
 
A) The provision of a heritage statement (or its equivalent) that includes:  
 
1. sufficient informa tion to gain  an understanding  of the potential impact that the   
  proposals  will have on the significance of any heritage assets or historic environment 
likely   to be  affected; and  
2. for heritage sites with archaeological interest, at least a desk -based assessment and,  
   where appropriate, the results of a field evaluation.  
 
B) In the exceptional circumstances where harm could be justified, detailed investigation and 
recording will be required to an agreed standard in advance of any alteration, demolition o r 
groundwork to ensure that an understanding of the affected heritage asset is gained and that 
knowledge is widely publicised  including deposition of the site archive with the relevant archive 
repository and deposition of a report on the results with the S outh Yorkshire Sites & Monuments 
Record (Historic Environment Record ). 
 
Explanation  
11.8.  Many proposals lack an adequate appraisal of their impact on the Borough’s historic 
environment and heritage assets23.  Therefore , this policy reinforces national policy in requiring 
that proposals for such assets be supported by an adequate heritage statement so that the 
heritage significance referred to in other policies is clearly understood and informs decisions .  
 
11.9.  Part A of this policy explains what is required for propo sals affecting all heritage  assets.  An 
adequate analysis of the heritage asset is essential for understanding  the impact of any such 
proposals.  The degree of information required should be proportionate to the significance of the 
heritage asset and , for minor applications , the heritage statement can be incorporated into a 
design and access statement (if this is also a requirement).  A heritage statement should 
include details of how the assets and their significances will be affected by the proposed 
devel opment, demonstrate a clear understanding of the significances, and show how the 
proposals will minimise any adverse impacts on the asset and its setting.  Where the proposal is 
likely to result in harm to a heritage asset the justification for any harm (i ncluding any public 
benefits arising from the proposed development) should be set out in the heritage statement.  
As a starting point for any applications affecting heritage assets, particularly those of 
archaeological interest, the Sites and Monuments Rec ord held by the South Yorkshire 
Archaeology Service should be consulted.  A good understanding of the significance of the 
heritage asset is the foundation for applying all of the heritage policies below.  
 
11.10.  National Policy explains that there are exceptional  circumstances, for example, where there 
would be benefits to the community or for sustainable development , that would decisively 
outweigh the historic value of the heritage asset, where loss or damage to heritage assets may 
be acceptable.   In such  circums tances Part B of this policy sets out the Council ’s expectations 
that a developer will undertake an appropriate level of recording for the historic building or 
archaeological asset so that understanding of the contribution of that asset to local character is 
not completely lost but adds to our knowledge of the heritage of the Borough . 
 
11.11.  Where loss or damage has been agreed to a heritage asset, an appropriate record will need to 
be achieved through detailed recording.  For historic buildings this may take the  form of a 
photographic or drawn survey, depending on the building.  This must be carried out in advance 
of any alteration  or demolition works taking place.  Where loss or damage has been agreed to 
historic landscape features or archaeological sites, detai led recording in the form of earthwork 
                                                           
23 defined in Glossary   
123   [go to Contents ] 
  survey and/or excavation will be carried out in advance of any groundworks (including removal 
of foundations and other clearance works) taking place.  The Council  can advise on the level of 
recording required for indi vidual heritage assets.  
  
11.12.  Making such information publicly available is enshrined in the NPPF.   Therefore , where such 
recording has been carried out , the results , and any ensuing analyses and research , must be 
written up and published and the resulting arc hive deposited with an appropriate archive 
repository.  Opportunities should be sought for the results to be interpreted and displayed on 
site within the new development.  
 
Policy 36: Listed  Buildings  
 
Development proposals affecting a listed b uilding or its setting will be assessed against the following 
principles:  
 
A) Proposals that enhance or better reveal the significance of a listed building or structure will be 
supported.  Proposals that harm the significance of a listed building or its setti ng will not be 
supported other than in circumstances where that harm is clearly outweighed by the public 
benefits of the proposal  having regard to the significance of the heritage asset affected.  
 
B) Alterations and extensions  to a listed building will be con sidered acceptable where they are 
sympathetic to the historic proportions and massing of the building ; make use of materials that 
complement the materials used on the building; and preserve and enhance its special interest . 
 
C) Measures f or improving the ener gy efficiency of a listed building will be supported where they 
do not conflict with its special interest as a listed building.  Where there is a conflict of interest 
the Council  will weigh the public benefits of the proposal against the harm to the listed  building  
having regard to the significance of the heritage asset.  
 
D) A proposal for a change of use to a listed building would be considered acceptable where it 
does not harm its heritage significance.  Where a change of use requires significant alterations  
with potential harm to the listed building it will be necessary to demonstrate that the proposed 
alterations are necessary to secure the long term survival of the listed building . 
 
E) Permission will not be granted for proposals which would result in substan tial harm or total loss 
of a listed building or structure  unless the building cannot reasonably be repaired and the 
Council is satisfied  that every effort has been made to secure, repair, or reuse the building, to 
find an alternative use through maintenanc e, grant assistance, or offer for sale or lease, or, that 
there are substantial and demonstrable public benefits to be gained which outweighs the loss of 
the building .  
 
Explanation  
11.13.  This policy expands on the requirements for  proposals affecting listed  buildings  or their settings . 
The policy should be applied alongside Policy 35 which  requires that proposals should be 
informed by an understanding of the heritage significance of the listed building . 
 
11.14.  That heritage significance  can include the form of the building, its materials, its proportions and 
detailing, or other factors as may be revealed during the planning process.  For example, 
traditional limestone buildings in the rural villages and countryside in the west of the Borough 
often use random coursed rubble limestone, clay pantile  roof, and timber windows.  Modern low 
cost or mass produced alternatives tend not to complement these and lead to erosion of 
character and local distinctiveness.  
 
11.15.  Understanding the heritage sign ificance of a listed building includes assessing the contribution 
made by its setting.  For example , the Borough contains a number of heritage assets of different 
designations in the form of great houses and associated formal gardens where the wider  
124   [go to Contents ] 
  landsc ape also forms part of the setting.  Proposals affecting the setting of a listed building 
should contain sufficient information in the application to assess the impact of a proposal on that 
setting.  
 
11.16.  Where the significance of a listed building has been los t or eroded through inappropriate 
alterations, proposals which will restore the building  may be supported but would need to be 
justified within a heritage statement.  The considerations that would apply in any assessment 
include:  
 
 whether the significance of the elements that would be restored decisively outweigh those 
that would be lost;  
 the work proposed is justified by compelling evidence of the evolution of the building and 
is executed in accordance with that evidence;  
 the current form of the building  is not the result of an historically significant event;  
 the work proposed respects previous forms of the place; and  
 the maintenance implications of the proposed restoration are considered to be 
sustainable.  
 
11.17.  Ensuring that extensions and alterations to listed buildings reflect the character of these 
buildings  and encouraging the reversal of unsuitable alterations will contribute to retaining the 
distinctive local identity of the Borough . 
 
11.18.  It is recognised that the conservation of energy and the improvement  of thermal efficiency of 
buildings will be of increasing importance in future years and that there is increasing pressure 
on listed  buildings to adapt .  Part C of this policy is intended to apply to proposals for small 
scale micro -generation equipment suc h as solar panels or for proposals for improving energy 
efficiency such as external cladding or upvc double glazing which require alteration to a listed  
building.  Such proposals can have an adverse impact on its character as a listed  building.  For 
exampl e, altering the external cladding of limestone buildings, solar panels against clay pantile 
roofs, or unsympathetic upvc frames can all impact adversely on some historic buildings 
whereas others can absorb a degree of change.  
 
11.19.  Such alterations to listed bu ildings require listed building consent and where planning approval 
or listed building consent  is needed the proposal should balance the needs of the environment 
with the heritage value of the building.  Where the special interest of a listed  building prec ludes 
alterations that may be acceptable  elsewhere other opportunities should be sought to improve 
the thermal efficiency of the building.  
 
11.20.  The demolition of a listed building should only be considered in exceptional circumstances 
which are outlined in nat ional planning policy on substantial harm or total loss of significance to 
a heritage asset.  The criteria for assessing such proposals are covered in Part E of this  policy.  
Where such loss occurs, a degree of building recording proportionate to its herit age value as 
described in Policy 35 would be  required.  
 
11.21.  Historic England, in conjunction with the Council , has developed databases of Grade I and II -
star Listed Buildings at Risk and the Council has also prepared a list of G rade II Listed Buildings 
at Risk.  Strategies and initiatives to reduce the number of buildings and areas at risk are being 
developed by the Council .  Decision making through the planning process is an important part 
of this strategy and finding a sustaina ble use for a historic building ‘at risk’ would be considered 
a public benefit    
125   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 37: Conservation Areas  
 
Development proposals affecting, or within the setting of , Conservation Areas will be assessed accordi ng 
to the following principle s: 
 
A) Proposals should take fully into account the identified significance contained in the 
Conservation Area Appraisal for the relevant designated area where published . 
 
B) Proposals should not detract from the heritage significance of a conservation area by v irtue of 
their location, layout, nature, height, density, form, scale, materials or design or by the removal 
of trees, the loss of important open spaces or other important landscape features, or through 
adverse impact on key views and vistas.  Proposals th at result in harm to a conservation area 
will be refused unless the harm is outweighed by public benefits arising from the development.  
 
C) Proposals will be supported where it can be demonstrated that they will enhance or better 
reveal an element which can c ontribute to the character and appearance of the conservation 
area.  Proposals within conservation areas requiring the demolition of buildings that make a 
positive contribution to the conservation area will not be supported unless the building is 
currently  derelict and is incapable of rehabilitation; or the removal of the building, and/or the 
proposed redevelopment of the site, would result in demonstrable public benefits sufficient to 
outweigh the harm.  
 
D) Any proposal for the demolition of a building or sit e in a conservation area will need to be 
accompanied by an acceptable redevelopment scheme or a remedial scheme for making good 
the building or site which will be required to be implemented immediately following demolition.  
 
Explanation  
11.22.  Conservation Areas are designated by the Council, as l ocal planning authority , under national 
legislation and Councils  are required to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or 
enhancing the ir character and appearance .  Conservation area appraisals and manag ement 
proposals will be used to identify and assess local character and promote enhancement.   There 
is an ongoing programme of appraisals for these designations  which are now publicly available 
for all the Doncaster town conservation areas and most of the major settlements.  In addition, 
the key characteristics of each of the Borough’s conservation areas are described in 
conservation area character summaries on the Council’s website . 
 
11.23.  Proposals will be expected to preserve and/or enhance the character and a ppearance of a 
conservation area.   In identifying the key elements of character and appearance which 
contribute to the heritage significance of a conservation area, proposals should draw on 
published conservation area appraisals where these exist  and use t hese to inform heritage 
statements.  Enhancement can include the demolition of an unsightly building and/or 
sympathetic redevelopment of a site particularly where identified in conservation area 
appraisals and management plans as a site or building where c hange is encouraged.  
 
11.24.  Part B of the policy describes in detail the criteria by which proposals will be assessed in 
determining applications in or affecting conservation areas.  The policy also explains 
exceptional circumstances where harm may be accepted.  Harm may be localised to a part of 
the conservation area or (particularly in small conservation areas) may be substantial.  Public 
benefits may be anything that delivers economic, social or environmental progress  but should 
be of a nature or scale to be o f benefit to the public at large and should not just be a private 
benefit.  
 
11.25.  Part C of this policy includes the criteria by which proposals for the demolition of buildings which 
make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of a conservation area are 
assessed.   It is important to note that the test for public benefits will be more stringent 
depending on the significance of the building and its impact.  In the event that permission to  
126   [go to Contents ] 
  demolish a historic building is granted a degree of building  recording proportionate to its 
heritage value as described in Policy 35 would  be required.  
 
11.26.  Part D of the policy is intended to ensure that demolition proposals do not result in long term 
unsightly gaps which detract from t he character and appearance of a conservation area.  
 
11.27.  In conservation areas , where significant harm may be caused to its character and appearance 
through permitted development rights , the Council  will consider the introduction of Article 4 
directions to res trict such rights in order to preserve the character of the conservation area.  
 
11.28.  Sufficient information is required in an application to fully understand the impact of a proposal 
on a conservation area.  Normally full planning permission would be required f or proposals 
within conservation areas .  Outline applications are unlikely to provide the degree of information 
required to properly assess a proposal affecting a conservation area . 
 
11.29.  This policy applies to all development within or affecting conservation a reas.  Ensuring that 
alterations to conservation areas retain the character of these areas will contribute to retaining 
the distinctive local character of the Borough . 
 
Policy 38: Historic Parks and Gardens  
 
Development affecting Historic Park s and Gardens will be assessed against the following principles:  
 
A) Development proposals within , or affecting, D oncaster’s nationally registered parks and 
gardens, and parks and gardens of local historic interest (as shown on the Policies  Map), 
should prese rve and, where appropriate, enhance the heritage significance of these parks and 
gardens.  
 
B) Proposals affecting a historic park of local or national significance should not result in harm to 
the built or landscape features or key views or vistas which contr ibute to the significance of the 
historic park or garden, or which might prejudice future restoration.  
 
C) Where proposals result in harm or substantial harm to the significance of a nationally 
designated historic park the proposal will be considered in relat ion to the extent of harm arising 
from the proposal, the relative significance of the historic park and garden, and any public 
benefits arising from the proposal.   In the case of parks and gardens of local interest a balanced 
judgement will be taken weighi ng the scale of any harm against the significance of the park.  
 
Explanation  
11.30.  Nationally registered parks and gardens are ‘designated heritage assets’ with the highest 
priority for protection and the Garden History Society will be consulted on applications a ffecting 
Historic Parks and Gardens on the national register.  
 
11.31.  A further 26 Parks and Gardens of local historic interest have been identified at the outset  of 
this Plan.  The heritage significance of these, the process of assessment, together with the 
criteria by which they were assessed is described in the document ‘Identification and 
Assessment of Parks and Gardens of Local Historic Interest’ which is on the Council’s website.  
The identification and assessment of these parks and gardens was subject to a process of 
public consultation explained in the document.   The criteria by which these were selected are 
included as Appendix 9 which will be revised periodically, and amended and updated as 
necessary, in light of chan ges in national guidance and changing circumstances .  The Council  
will continue to review existing and any prospective parks and gardens of local historic interest .  
 
11.32.  The merits of any proposal should be weighed against the impact on its relative heritage 
significance.  In assessing proposals for these local designations the statement of their  
127   [go to Contents ] 
  significance is a material consideration.  
 
11.33.  Whilst some historic parks and gardens are in private ownership others are public parks used 
for recreation.  Part B of the  policy is required so that where there is development for recreation 
uses those features which contribute to the character of the park or garden are not overlooked 
and that the opportunity for restoration in future is not prejudiced.  
 
11.34.  Normally full planni ng permission would be required for proposals within a historic park and 
garden in order to fully understand the impact of the proposal on their heritage significance.  
 
11.35.  This policy applies to all development within national and locally designated historic parks and 
gardens.  Ensuring that alterations to historic parks and gardens retain the character of these 
landscapes will contribute to retaining the distinctive local character of the Borough . 
 
Policy 39: Development Affecting Archaeology  
 
Development affecting archaeological remains will be assessed against the following principles:  
 
A) Development that would result in harm to the significance of a scheduled monument or other 
nationally important archaeological assets will not be permitted other  than in exceptional 
circumstances.  
 
B) Development affecting other archaeological assets will need to demonstrate how any benefits 
will outweigh harm to the site.  When development affecting such sites is justifiable, the Council 
will seek to ensure preserva tion of the remains in situ as a preferred solution.  When in situ 
preservation is not justified, the developer will be required to make adequate provision for 
appropriate investigation and recording including excavation in accordance with Policy 35. 
 
Explanation  
11.36.  Archaeological remains are a finite resource containing irreplaceable information about the past 
and are valuable in themselves and for their contribution towards education, recreation and the 
economic life of the Borough .  The Council believes that archaeological and historic remains 
should not be needlessly destroyed and their presence is a material consideration in 
applications for new development.  The purpose of this policy is to set out the principles by 
which d evelopment affecting archaeological remains will be assessed.  As a first step in 
developing proposals it is important to understand the nature, significance, and physical extent 
of the archaeological remains present, and the impact on these of the proposa l, as required in 
Policy 35. 
 
11.37.  Part A of the policy makes it clear that development proposals that would result in harm to the 
significance of scheduled monuments or other nationally important archaeological sites will not 
be permitted other than in exceptional circumstances, which are set out in the NPPF.  This also 
adds that substantial harm or loss should not be permitted other than in wholly exceptional 
circumstances.  
 
11.38.  Part B of the policy sets out the approach that will b e taken towards developments likely to 
affect archaeological sites of regional or local importance.  In the case of such archaeological 
remains, there is a need to reconcile the relative importance of the remains with the need for the 
development.  Develop ments should be located or designed to avoid archaeological remains, to 
ensure that these remains are preserved in situ.  Where in situ preservation is not justified or 
feasible, and the development proposal is acceptable in principle, the developer will b e required 
to make appropriate and satisfactory provision for the excavation and recording of the remains 
before planning permission is granted, as set out in Policy  35. 
 
11.39.  Archaeological sites of national and local importance  are identified in South Yorkshire’s Sites 
and Monuments Record.  More and more information about the Borough’s archaeological  
128   [go to Contents ] 
  record is being revealed through investigation and recording as a result of the planning process.  
Part B of this policy would le ad to this information becoming more widely accessible and will 
inform future decision making.  
 
Policy 40: Buildings or Structures of Local Historic Interest  
 
Development proposals affecting buildings that meet the criteria of buildings of loc al historic interest, 
either as part of a local list or as part of the planning application process, will  be assessed against the 
following principles:  
 
A) Proposals which retain those elements of a building of local historic interest which have been 
identifi ed as contributing to its heritage significance, or proposals which better reveal its 
significance will be supported.  
 
B) Proposals should seek to avoid harm to those features, including setting, which contribute to the 
significance of the building of local h istoric interest.  Where proposals result in harm or 
substantial harm to the significance of a building of local historic interest a balanced judgement 
will be made taking into account the degree of harm and relative significance of the heritage 
asset . 
 
Explanation  
11.40.  Many historic buildings are not of national significance but contribute to local character in 
various ways or have local historic interest.  Outside conservation areas their historic character 
is not currently a planning consideration.  As part o f a positive strategy for the conservation and 
enjoyment of the historic environment required by the NPPF  the Council will seek to identify 
unlisted buildings of heritage significance through a local list of buildings of architectural and 
historic interest  with priority given to such buildings outside conservation areas .  A set of criteria 
for compiling such a list is included in Appendix 10 and the process for establishing such a list 
will be subject to  further  public consultation .  The criteria will be revised periodically and 
amended and updated as necessary in light of changes in national guidance and changing 
circumstances .  Once a local list that has undergone public consultation is established the 
heritage signifi cance of buildings or structures on the list would be a material consideration in 
planning applications.  
 
11.41.  Policy 40 establishes the policy framework to assess such applications.  Where buildings have 
been identified by the Council as buildings of local architectural or historic interest proposals for 
alterations or extensions will be expected to retain the heritage significance of such buildings 
including their setting.  The policy recognises that less weight would be given t o these 
‘undesignated’ heritage assets relative to ‘designated’ assets and that a balanced judgement 
would be required in assessing applications.   Policy  40 would apply to local list buildings located 
outside conservation ar eas.  Locally listed buildings within conservation areas would be subject 
to Policy 37 on conservation areas .  Buildings that meet the local list criteria may also be 
revealed as part of the planning application process or t hrough the neighbourhood plan 
process.  Such buildings would also be subject to Policy 40 unless they are within a 
conservation area where Policy 37 would apply, or in the case of neighbourhoo d plan buildings 
of local heritage significance, are subject to specific neighbourhood plan policies.  
 
11.42.  This policy will contribute to the preservation and enhancement of Doncaster’s historic 
environment through conserving the heritage value of these buildi ngs and this would also assist 
in retaining local distinctiveness particularly where such buildings are located outside 
conservation areas.

  Chapter 12: Design and the Built Environment  
 
Intro duction  
12.1.  National planning policy requires new developments to be well designed and appropriate to the 
area in which they are located.  The following policies focus on proposals within the urban 
environment and should be considered alongside the national requirements  – they provide a 
framework for the assessment of  the design aspects of proposals.  
 
12.2.  In meeting these policies development will help contribute to the Local Plan vision and  objective 
of ensuring our towns, suburbs, villages and countryside benefit from high quality appropriate 
development that reinforces distinctive and vibrant places .  The policies will help protect the 
amenity of existing residents and businesses whilst meeting the needs of local communities, 
and help foster local pride.  
 
Policy 41: Character and Local Distinctiveness (Strat egic Policy)  
 
Imaginative design and development solutions  will be encouraged , including innovative and 
contemporary architecture  and public art , to ensure that proposals respect and enhance identity, 
character and local distinctiveness through adherence t o the following principles:  
 
A) Development proposals will be supported where they:  
 
1. recognise and reinforce the character of local landscapes and building traditions;  
2. are of a high quality design that contributes to local distinctiveness;  
3. respond positively  to their  context,  setting and existing site features , respecting and  
   enhancing the character of the locality; and  
4. integrate visually and functionally with the immediate and surrounding area at a  
   settlement, neighbourhood, street and plot scale.  
 
B) Where an applicant wishes to utilise standardised or ‘off the shelf’ designs they should, where 
necessary, be  adapted to complement or re -interpret local character, or make them more 
distinctive by developing a n appropriate  locally inspired new identity and appearance for the 
development .  
 
C) Neighbourhood plans and applications for development should consider the potential for inclusion 
of public art policies and proposals which capture the imagination and identity of local 
communities, including modest or sub tle works for smaller developments.  
 
D) Major urban extensions, high profile and prominent developments (including those within areas 
visited or seen by large numbers of people), and new public spaces will be expected to provide or 
make a contribution toward  permanent public art.  Key priority areas for art include, but are not 
limited to: D oncaster Town Centre (including the Market Place, Station Square, Retail Core, Civic 
Quarter, Waterfront and Minster Canalside), Thorne and Mexborough Town Centres, other local, 
district and out of town shopping centres, the Airport, and main transport corridors and key 
gateway locations identified on the Policies Map.  
 
E) In all cases, applications and design proposals will need to demonstrate an understanding of the 
context,  history, character and appearance of the site, adjacent neighbourhood and the wider 
area, to inform the appropriate design approach.  For major applications this understanding 
should be informed by the views of local communities affected by the proposal, and alongside the 
adopted design approach, is to be clearly explained and presented within the Design and Access 
Statement.  
 
   
131   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
12.3.  Doncaster has a rich variety of urban environments, so there is no single vernacular or simple 
solution to reflecting  local character.  Moving forward we want to re -invent our townscape in a 
positive and distinctive way  which meets modern needs , whilst not forgetting existing character 
or history.  New development has an important role to play in delivering this and we a re keen to 
encourage designers to be creative in proposing locally inspired and distinctive new places, 
spaces , art and buildings  in collaboration with local communities .  To do this, applicants  must 
have a good understanding of the area in which their development will take place , its history  
and the design aspirations of local people .  This includes undertaking an appraisal of the site 
characteristics, adjacent streets, the local settlement and neighbourhood, its movement 
network, landscape, open spaces, l ayout, building forms, siting, spacing, details and materials.  
Early discussion between applicants, the local planning authority and local community about the 
design and style of emerging schemes is important for clarifying expectations and reconciling 
local and commercial interests.   Attempting to justify insensitive design by referencing adjoining 
‘anywhere neighbourhoods’ as the local vernacular, which have little sense of place or justifying 
a design that has not been derived from a site responsive des ign process will not be looked 
upon favourably.  
 
12.4.  Anchoring new neighbourhoods and homes to the surrounding local context through  their 
design enriches the area and evokes a strong visual identity to which people respond positively. 
This fosters a sense of ownership and helps to establish  community  self-recognition.  The 
resulting place is equally attractive and appealing to the existing  local community and new 
residents, as well as reflecting the vision of architects and planners.  Local building forms and 
details in particular contribute to the distinctive qualities of a place.  These can be successfully 
interpreted in new development without necessarily restricting the scope of the designer  or 
significantly impacting viability .  Standard solutions rarely c reate a distinctive identity or make 
best use of a particular site.  It is not about creating pastiche developments which awkwardly 
reflect the past.  It is about taking design cues from the vernacular of the settlement.  The use of 
local materials, buildi ng methods and details can be an important factor in enhancing local 
distinctiveness when used in evolutionary local design, and can also be used in more 
contemporary design.  
 
12.5.  The Council reco gnise s in its Public Art Strategy the inherent social, cultural  and economic 
value public art has in reflecting culture, expressing the history and experiences of our Borough , 
and contributing toward and showcasing our unique identity.  Public art brings our public spaces 
to life; it challenges our ideas and values an d it creates an ongoing conversation between our 
past, present and future.  Public art is free to experience and plays an important role in 
increasing the liveability and desirability of the Borough , which in turn has long term social  and 
economic  benefits .  The Council will support appl icants for new development to make a 
contribution to enhancing public art in the Borough commensurate in scale to the profile and 
size of development and with due consideration to other Local Plan policies, feasibility and 
viability.  
 
12.6.  Further sources of information regarding local character and more distinctive areas in Doncaster 
can be found in our Conservation Area Appraisals and Landscape Character Assessment 
documents.  Similarly , the South Yorkshire Historic Environment Characterisation project is a 
good starting point as it sets out some of the key development types across the Borough and 
the distinctive characteristics and history of different areas which include:   
 
 Complex historic town cores  – historic settlement core s with the presence of market 
places, castles and multi -phase medieval planning ’. 
 Nucleated rural settlements  – individual distinctive settlement cores often surrounded by 
later suburban development . 
 Turn of the 20th century villa suburbs  – low density hou sing built for the wealthier middle 
classes in suburbs typified by spacious green environments . 
 Grid iron terraced housing  – blocks of conjoined terraced housing related to historic 
industry, often with distinctive detailing and embellishments .  
132   [go to Contents ] 
   Industrial and post industrial zones  – large -scale older employment buildings, sidings and 
yards. Modern large -scale pre -fabricated commercial buildings . 
 Planned industrial settlements  – large, garden suburb influenced housing estates built for 
miners / industrial wo rkers and their families .  
 Doncaster re -planned centre zone  – modernist and contemporary redevelopments in re -
planned areas around the edges of the historic town centre.  
 
12.7.  The full list of character descriptions and interactive map zones for the project are  available at 
www.sytimescapes.org.uk/zones/doncaster .  Further design guidance on how to undertake local 
character assessments will be incorporated into reviews of relevant Supplementary Plan ning 
Documents.  
 
Policy 42: Good Urban Design  (Strategic Policy)   
 
High quality d evelopment that reflects  the principles of good urban design  will be supported .  Proposals 
for new development will be expected to follow a best practice inclusiv e design process and where 
appropriate use established design tools to support good urban design .  For major applications of over 
0.5 hectares or 10 or more residential units, this should include making use of pre-application 
engagement with the Council an d affected community, and utilising Design Review.  Employing good 
design will help create quality places which are cherished, sustainable and stand the test of time.  
 
A) New development will be expected to optimise the potential of a site and make the most 
efficient use of land whilst responding to location, local character, relevant spatial requirements 
and design standards. In appropriate instances, such as highly sustainable locations with good 
public transport accessibility, this could involve maximising the density of development  to an 
appropriate level . 
 
B) In all cases, the components of a  development , including: use mix, layout (structure, movement 
patterns, townscape, landscaping, open space and public realm), density (intensity of use), form 
(scale, hei ght, massing ), and appearance  (architectural qualities, details, materials, boundary 
treatments ), must be designed and assessed t o ensure that the proposal  is attractive and 
appropriate to the area, robustly designed, works functionally, and incorporates  the following 
qualities of a successful place:  
 
1. characterful, attractive and welcoming with its own identity appropriate to the area (refer  
   to Policy 41);  
2. well integrated with the built, natural and historic environment;  
3. continuous and enclosed streets and spaces, defined by buildings which incorporate  
   active frontages;  
4. safe and secure private property, public areas and the adoptable highway  ensuring  
   access points, street design, parking and operational highway req uirements safely cater  
   for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles;  
5. connected, walkable and easy for pedestrian and cycle movement with good access to  
   local facilities and public transport services;  
6. attractive and durable streets and public realm  which prioritise people over vehicles,  
   encourage social interaction and use good quality materials, landscaping, street furniture,  
   lighting and signage;  
7. legible, easy to understand and to navigate  around ;  
8. adaptable, flexible and capable of changing over t ime;  
9. inclusive and accessible , promote social cohesion  and meet the needs of as much of the  
   population as possible;  
10. vibrant and busy with a mix of uses where appropriate;  
11. reduce carbon emissions, adapt to climate change  and make efficient use of natur al 
   resources during construction and operation through measures such as orientation,  
   layout, inclusion of technology and material selection; and  
12. include measures to ensure they are well managed  and maintained . 
  
133   [go to Contents ] 
  C) The Council will require  the use , submi ssion , or prepa ration  of urban design ‘tools’ to provide 
greater certainty over design intentions and secure development quality, particularly for major 
applications and multi -phase developments.  The tools include masterplans, design guides, 
design codes , development briefs,  and the use of planning conditions.  The Council  will also 
provide design guidance , including  the use of Supplementary Planning Documents , and by 
preparing briefs where required . 
 
Explanation  
12.8.  Employing good design will help create qual ity places which are cherished, sustainable and 
stand the test of time.   Good urban design is a powerful approach for achieving many of the 
Local Plan’s aims.   It is a matter of creating the right conditions to make places work and the 
Local Plan has a cen tral role in achieving this.  Making successful places depends upon getting 
the right mix of uses and physical form of development.  Good urban design is relevant to all 
scales and types of development , particularly for major developments which have the gr eatest 
potential to improve a place and impact on people’s lives.  Good design takes a long term view 
and aims to ensure that places are built which can accommodate change over long periods of 
time.  
 
12.9.  Successful streets, spaces, villages, towns and cities t end to have qualities in common. These 
fundamental qualities of successful places are reflected in  the policy .  The form of development 
is the physical expression of urban design.  It consists of the relationships, shape and size of 
buildings, structures a nd spaces.  It will influence the user’s activity and movement in a place 
and so is critical to the success of a place.  
 
12.10.  The Council expect s applicants  to follow a best practice design approach when developing 
proposals in Doncaster, particularly for major  applications, in order to encourage better quality 
development  and to ensure design quality is not materially diminished between permission and 
completion, or between outline permission and detailed applications . Also the Council  
encourag es applicants to seek design advice and independent design review  prior to 
submission of an application.  The design approach should include:  
 
 a site analysis and a character and context assessment of the wider area and 
neighbourhood to inform the design  (see also Policy 41); 
 development of outline concept designs and / or options for discussion  (useful at pre -
application stage) ; 
 community engagement and seeking pre -application advice from the Council and other 
key stakeholders;  
 undertake a H ealth Impact Assessment and implement findings (see Policy 50); 
 independent design review where appropriate (for example through Doncaster Design 
Review Panel);  
 submission of a Design and Access Statement detailing the outco mes of the above, and 
clearly explaining the proposal ; and 
 commitment to the use of established design tools to help facilitate high quality design.  
 
12.11.  We may also request the use or submission of  urban design ‘tools’ to provide greater certainty 
over design  intentions and development quality , particularly for major applications and multi -
phase developments .  The tools include masterplans, design guides, design codes or the use of 
planning conditions.  The Council  will also provide design guidance through the  use of 
Supplementary Planning Documents and by preparing briefs where required.   
 
Policy 43: Views, Gateways and Taller Buildings  
 
Development that  respects and  improves the character, image and legibility of the Borough  will be 
supported , particularly from the main transport corridors and key gateway locations identified on the 
Policies Map.   There is to be an exceptional standard of design quality for buildings, spaces and 
environmental improvements at high er profile gateway locations inclu ding, where appropriate, providing  
134   [go to Contents ] 
  landmark or taller buildings and/or public art.  
 
A) Important views , panoramas  and vistas are to be protected and enhanced, particularly where 
these may be affected by a taller building.  Developments should not create  a cro wding effect 
around, obstruct, or appear too close , dominant  or high in relation to any  significant heritage 
asset, particularly Doncaster Minster.  
 
B) Taller buildings should be located where there is good public transport accessibility and they will 
not har m the setting of heritage assets.  Tall and landmark buildings must be of exceptional and 
unique design quality and m ake a positive contribution to the skyline and image of  Doncaster.  
Potential locations for such  buildings include, but are not limited to:  
 
 Balby Road / Cleveland Street roundabout and the adjacent corner of St Sepulchre Gate  
   West, parts of Waterfront and Waterdale . 
 Areas of Marshgate and other gateway locations along the White Rose Way and Trafford  
   Way approach to the town centre . 
 Buildings fronting North Bridge Road, Church Way and St Georges Gyratory . 
 A638/A18 Bawtry Road/Leger Way roundabout on the racecourse side of the junction . 
 Mexborough waterside.  
 
C) New development at the edge of a settlement will be supported where it visually and physically 
integrates with the existing settlement, is sensitive to adjacent uses, the existing landscape 
setting and where appropriate is well screened.  Development should protect the character of 
the wider landscape and enhance views from existing a reas, sensitive locations (including 
heritage assets) and  the main  transport corridors.  It should be designed so as not to result in 
an inorganic or overly urban appearance adjacent the countryside or Green Belt.  This can be 
achieved through a high stand ard of generous planting  and careful attention to siting, scale, 
building form, boundaries and materials.  
 
Explanation  
12.12.  This policy aims to retain and improve local character and create a legible, attractive, distinctive 
and successful borough leaving visit ors and residents with a positive experience of travelling in 
and around the area.  In order to help achieve this the Council will promote exceptional quality 
development and environmental improvements at higher profile locations.  The Policies  Map 
highlig hts significant transport corridors, gateways and arrival points.  
 
12.13.  It is also important to ensure that new development respects the existing historic character of 
the Borough and key landmarks and views that help to make Doncaster distinctive, this include s 
conserving and enhancing the following strategic views:  
 
 view of Minster eastward from Cusworth Hall including panorama of town centre, and 
panorama of Cusworth Hall / Town Centre from A1;  
 view of Minster tower from Great North Road and Wheatley Hall Roa d approaches;  
 views to and from the town centre along South Parade; and  
 views of Conisbrough Castle including those from the railway.  
 
12.14.  At a local level, views and vistas should be identified through a character and context appraisal 
and explained in an app licant’s Design and Access Statement.  The Council  will also identify 
locally important views within Conservation Area Appraisals and through design guidance.  
 
12.15.  Doncaster historically has a relatively low -rise market town character, although in recent years  
some taller buildings have been developed in appropriate locations.  Generally within the 
historic core of the town centre any building over 3 -4 storeys could be considered tall in the 
context of existing building heights  (5-6 storeys outside the conserva tion areas ).  Out of the 
town cen tre any building which is 2 storeys or greater than surrounding buildings could be 
considered tall.  Taller  buildings should receive particular design attention.   The impact on  
135   [go to Contents ] 
  heritage assets such as listed buildings, conservation areas and their settings will be important 
design considerations.  There are a number of locations with the potential to accommodate 
taller landmark buildings as set out in the policy.  In all cases, applications for taller buildings 
must submit v isual impact assessments, detailed photo -visualisations and , where appropriate , 
micro -climatic studies of the proposals.  This helps to determine an appropriate height and allow 
the effects of the development to be properly assessed.  
 
12.16.  Whilst a large propor tion of new development is planned to take place on existing brownfield 
sites within settlements there is an identified need to build via urban extensions at the edge of 
settlements.  It is therefore important that these sites create an appropriate transit ion between 
the urban and rural character of the Borough and protect the setting of settlements and places 
of interest.  This can often be achieved through a well -considered layout and generous 
landscape buffering and tree planting to soften the urban edge  and reduce the negative visual 
impacts of development on the wider landscape.  Applicants may be expected to submit 
accurate photo -visualisations and visual impact assessments as part of any application for 
development in sensitive or edge of settlement l ocations.  The Doncaster Landscape Character 
Assessment and Capacity Study are available to inform the design process.  
 
Policy 44: Residential Design  (Strategic Policy)  
 
New housing , extensions, alterations  and changes of use to housing will b e supported where they 
respond positively to the context and character of existing areas (see Policy  41), or the host property, 
and create high quality residential environments through good  design.  Proposals are therefore r equired 
to meet the following:  
 
A) Developments must protect existing amenity and not significantly impact on the living conditions 
or privacy of neighbours or the host property (including their private gardens), be over -bearing, 
or result in an unacceptable  loss of garden space.  
 
B) Housing proposals will be supported where they meet the following key design objectives:  
 
1. there is good access to (or the development provides  at the earliest opportunity ) local  
  services, community facilities, open space and publi c transport via walkable  
   neighbourhoods;  
2. layout, density, siting, spacing, scale, massing, form, detailing and materials are  
  sympathetic to the character of the area, or the existing host property;  
3. layouts are easy to understand and move through, are well-structured, with secure  
  perimeter blocks, active frontages and dual aspect corner properties;  
4. designs result in a decent  outlook for new homes, with adequate privacy, and good  
  access to daylight and sunlight;  
5. there is adequate provision of intern al living space, storage space, amenity and garden  
  space;   
6. there is sufficient convenient , safe  and secure  allocated and visitor car parking space  
  designed so as not to dominate the appearance of the residential street -scene  or impact  
  negatively on t he function or character of new and existing streets ; 
7. layout and street design will result in attractive, landscaped public realm, which includes  
  community focal spaces that foster social interaction and creates an inclusive, safe and  
  secure environmen t for people and property;  
8. access points, street design, parking and operational highway requirements are safe and 
  provide adequate footpaths, encourage vehicle design speeds of 10 -20mph or less , and 
  complement the character of the existing street -scen e and highway functions;  
9. plot boundaries (front, back and side) are demarcated with robust boundary walls, fences,  
  railings or hedges appropriate to the area;  
10. satisfactory arrangements are made for the storage and collection of refuse, recyclable  
  mate rials and garden waste; and  
11. flood resistance and resilience measures with an allowance for climate change are 
   incorporated if located in, or adjacent to, flood risk areas.   
136   [go to Contents ] 
   
C) Backland  and tandem housing development  proposals will be supported where the los s of rear 
domestic gardens is minimised due to the need to maintain local character, amenity, garden 
space, green infrastructure and biodiversity.  In particular , the prevailing character of parts of 
Bessacarr, Sprotbrough and Thorne Road at Edenthorpe, as  defined on the Policies Map, will 
be pro tected from further Backland and Tandem development.   Modest redevelopment on 
backland sites may be considered acceptable, subject to proposals being subservient to the 
host property and meeting the criteria at A an d B above. In addition such development should 
generally conform to existing plot sizes and not lead to overdevelopment and/or a cramped 
appearance.  
 
D) Major applications (of over 0.5 hectares or 10 or more residential units) which include housing 
should ut ilise Building for a Healthy Life  throughout the design process, including at pre -
application stage where the tool can be beneficial in helping shape high quality housing 
schemes.  
 
Applicants will be expected to explain how these requirements have been met  in their submitted Design 
and Access Statements , which should include a Building for a Healthy Life  assessment  where required.  
 
Explanation  
12.17.  This policy sets out specific design requirements in relation to residential developments.  The 
policy aims to enco urage high quality housing that is sensitive to the character of the Borough 
and meets a range of different needs whilst managing change in existing areas.  It covers both 
major and minor developments and a variety of different forms of housing  includ ing private or 
rented homes, communal forms of living and houses in multiple occupation . 
 
12.18.  Plot size, site layout, open space, landscape, garden space, building size and form, 
architectural style, materials, access, and car parking provision and arrangement are key design 
aspects of a development which will be considered in the assessment of proposals.  The design 
quality of major schemes should be shaped and assessed  by using the Building for a Healthy 
Life criteria (or any subsequent revised national standard)  in addition to the policy criteria 
above .  A high quality  scheme will perform well against all of Building for a Healthy Life criteria.  
 
12.19.  New large -scale developments should follow a robust context responsive master -planning 
approach which includes communit y and stakeholder engagement throughout the process.  
 
12.20.  Backland is usually defined as development o n land behind the rear building line of existing 
housing or other development, and is usually land that is formally used as gardens, or is 
partially enclosed by gardens.   Where appropriate, backland development should largely be out 
of view and not dominate the frontage property but still be partly visible so people can find it.  
This however cannot be an excuse for poor design.  Designers should usually ensure  a 
backland development or tandem property is subservient (i.e. smaller in size, massing and 
scale) to the frontage property.  Such development will also require particular care in its design 
and layout to avoid conflict with neighbouring residential devel opment.   Frontage  development 
will be visible and will not be obscured by other dwellings , so it should respect the character of 
the surrounding area , immediate street -scene and the amenity of the neighbours.  This is 
important in re -enforcing the local c ontext and ensuring that the character of a street  is not 
adversely compromised.   
 
12.21.  There are some residential areas within the Borough which have a special environmental 
character due to a relatively low density form of development comprising mainly larger  
properties with extensive gardens, often with mature trees.  These include Bessacarr, 
Sprotbrough , and parts of Thorne Road at Edenthorpe , which have come under pressure for 
backland  and tandem forms of development in recent years, changing the character of the area.  
The quality of residential amenity and green space provided by these areas will generally be  
137   [go to Contents ] 
  protected from backland development.  
 
12.22.  The Council  will support car parking where appropriate  provision is designed to be convenient, 
safe and secure,  whilst not dominating the character, or impacting negatively on the function or 
appearance , of new and existing places.  New development should also include electric car 
charging points where appropriate.   Car parking  should be located  in safe, convenient  and 
secure locations close to and overlooked by occupiers.  Car parking spaces should be well 
defined and integrated with good quality surfacing materials and landscaping within the public 
realm whilst not letting parking dominate the residential street -scene.  
 
12.23.  Most developments will benefit from, and will be required to provide, a detailed scheme of hard 
and soft landscaping.  Attractive public realm can be created through inclusion of tree planting 
and selection of robust, fit for purpose hard landscape materials, such as highway surfacing 
materials or paving  which do not create onerous ongoing maintenance for the Council .  
Similarly, the impact of new buildings and car parking areas can be softened through landscape 
such as trees, shrubs and hedgerows.  
 
12.24.  Further detail relating to residential design will be set out in Supplementary Planning 
Documents.  
 
Policy 45: Housing Design Standards  (Strategic Policy)  
 
New housing proposals will be supported where they are designed to include sufficient space for the 
intended number of occupants, and are designed and constructed in a way that enables them to be 
easily adapted to meet existing  and changing needs of residents in Doncaster over their lifetime . 
 
A) In order to ensure homes are large enough for t he intended number of inhabitants, all new 
housing should meet the Nationally Described Space Standard24 as a minimum.  
 
B) In order to provide suitable and genuine housing choices for an ageing population and those 
with Limiting Long Term Illnesses or Disabili ties, at least 65% of all new homes on housing 
developments of over 0.5 hectare or 10 or more units should meet Building Regulation 
requirement M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable dwellings’.  
 
C) In order to provide suitable and genuine housing choices for occup ants with more specific 
needs, at least 5% of all new homes on housing  developments of over 0.5 Hectare or 10 or 
more units should meet  Building Regulations  requirement M4(3) ‘wheelchair adaptable 
dwellings’.  
 
Where the scale of development would generate more than one accessible home, based on the 
requirements of this policy, the mix of sizes, types and tenures of accessible housing should reflect the 
mix of sizes, types and tenures of the development as a whole as closely as possible (unless there is 
evidenced need for additional accessible housing in one particular size, type or tenure).   
 
In all cases, the above standards (or any subsequent equivalents or improved national mandatory 
minimum requirements) should be met. The required number and mix of acce ssible and Nationally 
Described Space Standard  compliant home s should be clearly illustrated on submitted plans , and in the 
case of accessible homes will be controlled via planning condition.  Exemptions to these requirements 
will only be considered where t he applicant can robustly demonstrate, with appropriate evidence, that 
adhering to the standards is not feasible due to physical constraints (such as vulnerability to flooding, 
site topography, or where step free access cannot be achieved) , or it is demons trated that it is not viable 
to do so.  Any deviation from the minimum space standards must be robustly justified and offset through

  exceptional or innovative design.  
 
Further exemptions to B and C above will only be considered where the applicant can robu stly 
demonstrate, with appropriate evidence, that site specific factors make the policy unfeasible or unviable.  
 
Explanation  
12.25.  The National ly Described  Space Standard defines minimum floor areas and dimensions for key 
parts of dwellings, such as bedrooms and  storage, as well as floor -to-ceiling height.  The 
standard is set at a level that should not stifle development but which can be delivered without 
putting the quality of new homes at risk.  Some recent developments in Doncaster have fallen 
short of provid ing adequate space and storage for the intended number of occupants according 
to their submitted planning application plans.   In order to protect the living conditions and well -
being of future occupants, applications for residential development must demons trate how the 
proposed accommodation is functionally fit for purpose and has been designed to meet the 
specific needs of the occupants with reference to the national standard.  It should demonstrate 
how the accommodation is large enough to provide sufficie nt space for privacy, socialising, 
studying, cooking, dining, sleeping, washing and storage of household goods and belongings  
for the intended number of residents for that dwelling . 
 
12.26.  To allow the Planning Authority body to check compliance of a development  against the 
National ly Described Space Standard  it would be helpful if planning  applications clearly state on 
all appropriate plans:  
 
 The internal area (m2) and width (m) of every bedroom and the number of intended 
occupants for each bedroom in each diffe rent type of dwelling on the site;   
 All specific storage spaces and its internal area (m2) in each differe nt type of dwelling on 
the site; and  
 The overall gross internal area (m2) of each different type of dwelling on the site.   
 
12.27.  National planning policy m akes it clear that the needs of groups with specific housing 
requirements should be addressed.  To allow local authorities the policy tools required to meet 
this need, the Government established ‘Access to and use of buildings: Approved Document 
M’25 which sets out optional building regulations with specific accessibility and adaptability 
design features.  These standards can be applied to a local plan when there is an evidenced 
need of such dwellings.  The Council’s Housing Design Standards Policy Evidence Paper 
suggests that currently not enough housing is flexible and adaptable enough to provide a 
suitable living environment for people as their needs change to promote independent living.  
This problem is predicted to escalate as residents of Doncaster are living longer, bringing 
alongside it the health and disability issues that are associated with older age.  Inclusive 
housing design is about ensuring that new housing is easily adaptable and capable of meeting 
the needs of a wide range of people, including  those with a physical disability.  In particular, 
inclusive design should make access possible for all potential occupants and visitors by making 
the entrance and ground floor step -free, making sure that doors and stairs are wide enough for 
disabled users  and allowing easier and cheaper adaptations to take place.  
  
12.28.  To allow the Planning Authority and Building Control body to check the compliance of a 
development against the M4(2) and M4(3) wheelchair adaptable building regulations , it would 
be helpful if s ubmitted drawings  clearly state on all appropriate plans:  
 
 The required number and mix of M4(2) and M4(3) wheelchair adaptable dwellings ;  
                                                           
25 The Building Regulations 2010 (2015 edition): Approved Document M: Access to and  use of buildings, Volume 1: Dwellings  
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/ uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540330/BR_PDF_AD_M
1_2015_with_2016_amendments_V3.pdf .    
139   [go to Contents ] 
   Provide measurements of the specific design requirements both regulations require, as 
outlined in the relevant sectio ns of the established ‘Access to and use of buildings: 
Approved Document M’ in each different type of applicable dwelling on the site ; and  
 For M4(3) adaptable dwellings, the combined floor area for living, dining and kitchen 
space (m2) in each different ty pe of applicable dwelling on the site.  
 
12.29.  M4(2) and M4(3) adaptable dwellings compliance will be ensured by attaching conditions to 
planning permissions requiring evidence to be submitted of Building Control approval.  Under 
National Planning Practice Guidan ce, local plan policies for M4(3) wheelchair accessible homes 
should be applied only to those dwellings where the local authority is responsible for allocating 
or nominating a person to live in that dwelling26.  As such, only the M4(3) wheelchair adaptable 
category and its subsequent design requirements shall apply in the policy.   
 
12.30.  The policy allows for considerations to be taken into account where s ite specific factors such as 
vulnerability to flooding, site topography, and other circumstances which may mak e a specific 
site (or part of a site) less suitable for M4(2 ), or when  step free access cannot be achieved.  
Where the policy affects dwellings accessed above  the ground floor lift access  would be 
required .  The application of requirement M4(2) has particu lar implications for two and three 
storey blocks of flats, or stacked maisonettes, which historically have not been required to 
provide lifts.  This requirement may be subject to development -specific viability assessments 
and consideration should be given to ongoing maintenance costs.  Where multi storey flats or 
apartments are being developed without lift provision, ground floor flats will still be required to 
meet the optional accessibility standards .  Therefore, the impact on overall scheme viability wil l 
be taken into consideration on a case by case basis.   Any requests for exemptions must be 
clearly evidenced and justified.  
 
12.31.  Likewise any deviation from the Nationally Described Minimum Space Standard must be 
robustly justified, clearly evidenced and offs et through exceptional and innovative design.  
Micro -homes (i.e. those that fall under the standard) will only be considered in exceptional and 
clearly evidenced situations where there is an identified and proven need and demand.  Micro -
housing development s must strike the right balance between providing privacy and social 
interaction.  They must be : of a significant size that is capable of providing additional communal 
recreation, co -working and / or socialising space for the inhabitants within the buildin g; be 
located in highly accessible locations close to exiting public transport services and local 
facilities; and include innovative space saving and liveability features such as large windows, 
high ceilings, adaptive and multi -use furniture and storage sp ace. 
 
 
Policy 46: Design of Non-Residential, Commercial and Employment Developments 
(Strategic Policy)  
 
All non -residential and commercial developments, including extensions and alterations to existing 
properties, must be designed to be high q uality, attractive, and make a positive contribution to the area in 
which they are located by meeting the following requirements:  
 
A) Proposals will be supported where they are designed to:  
 
1. be sympathetic to local  character and/or the host property in terms  of their layout, siting,  
  height, massing, form,  scale, detailing, materials, landscaping or, where appropriate, their  
  heritage significance;  
2. have no unacceptable negative effects upon the amenity of neighbouring land uses or the  
  environment ; 
3. promote  accessibility and way -finding for all travel modes through the layout of the  
                                                           
26 Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, National Planning Practice Guidance: Housing optional technical 
standards, para 009, reference ID 56 -009-20150327.   
140   [go to Contents ] 
    movement network, landscape strateg y and building design;  
4. meet functional requirements, whilst being architecturally appropriate, with interesting  
 and visually attractive ele vations which convey a sense of permanence;  
5. reduce the scale of bulky buildings and bland elevations by breaking down building mass  
  and using better quality human scale materials and detailing for prominent and heavily  
  used parts of the building;  
6. locating parking, servicing and storage areas unobtrusively and reducing their visual  
  impact through landscaping and boundary treatments;  
7. ensure parking areas do not reduce building line continuity and/or create large gaps in  
  street frontages to an unacce ptable extent;  and 
8. be well landscaped, include provision of amenity areas for occupiers, visitors or workers,  
  and ensure good quality external works are coordinated across the site.  
 
  Retail, commercial and mixed use proposals will be supported where th ey also:  
 
9. respect , and where appropriate enhance,  the character and setting of existing street  
  frontages in terms of  active frontage, plot widths, established buildin g lines, shop -front 
  proportion and rhythm ; 
10. consider advertisements, signage, and secur ity measures so they are not overly  
  prominent or dominant and contribute to the visual charact er and vitality of the street - 
  scene;  
11. ensure shop -fronts relate well to the building in which they are located in terms of  
  proportion, elevation design, re lationship to upper storeys, fascia height and width,  
  mullion treatment, materials, and colour; and  
12. ensure that historic shop -fronts are retained unless their loss can be justified.  
 
B) New major non -domestic applications (1000m2 floorspace or more, or a si te of 1 hectare or 
above) must meet the BREEAM rating of at least ‘Very Good’, or any agreed equivalent 
standard, and secure at least 10% of their regulated energy from renewable sources (or 
equivalent carbon emission reductions).  Large footprint building s should ensure roofs are 
designed to accommodate the potential for solar panel arrays.   This should be demonstrated 
through the submission of preliminary assessments at planning application stage.  
 
Explanation  
12.32.  This policy sets out specific design requirem ents in relation to non -residential and commercial 
developments , including, but not limited to, employment buildings, retail developments, leisure 
facilities, education facilities, community buildings, and mixed use proposals .  Successful 
implementation of  this policy will make an impact on the performance of the businesses and 
staff that occupy new commercial premises and support high quality development for buildings 
used by the public.  It will send a strong message to those who visit or pass through the  
Borough how attractive a place it is to live, work and invest.  
 
12.33.  New major developments (1000m2 floor-space  or more, or a site of 1 hectare or above ) will be 
required to meet the sustainable construction standards set out in the policy which address a 
wide range of environmental issues.  BREEAM (Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method) represents an established flexible assessment tool to do 
this.  Renewable energy will form an important component of Doncaster’s future energy needs .  
However , it is recognised that viability and cost effectiveness is directly influenced by the site 
location and the specific energy demand of the development in question.  New development will 
be expected to incorporate on site renewable energy technology  to meet a proportion of its 
future energy demands such as, solar panels, ground source heat pumps, solar water heating, 
as well as biomass space heating.  Where renewables are required, a feasibility analysis should 
be undertaken and information provided to us as part of any planning application.  Large 
footprint buildings offer a specific opportunity to provide significant secure space for photo -
voltaic renewable energy panels, and as such the Council will require the roofs of such buildings 
to be designe d to enable the fitting of Photovoltaic arrays and facilitate renewable energy  
141   [go to Contents ] 
  generation.  Where the use of renewable energy, or roof space for arrays, is not practicable or 
viable, robust evidence must demonstrate this is the case.  Attempts to secure or  exceed an 
equal equivalent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions (over the current Building Regulations 
Target Emission Rates) through other measures  should be made – such as passive 
architectural design techniques or energy efficiency improvements.  
 
Policy 47: Safe and Secure Places  
 
The Local Plan aims  to create safe and accessible environments where crime and disorder, and the fear 
of crime, do not undermine quality of life or community cohesion.   Developments will be supported which 
are de signed in a way that reduces the risk of crime and the fear of crime by ensuring that they create:  
 
A) places which foster ownership and appropriate levels of human activity;  
 
B) access points and routes that are limited to only those necessary to create a conv enient, 
connected, and direct movement network;  
 
C) ground floor active frontage  to public areas avoid ing blank elevations  and potential hiding 
places ;  
 
D) layouts and designs that encourage natural surveillance of streets, public spaces, pa rking 
areas, cycle a nd pedestrian routes, and which are well lit to appropriate standards with good 
sight lines ; 
 
E) allocated residential car parking that is visible from the occupants home, or secured in garages;  
 
F) public, private and semi -private spaces that are defensible, cl early demarcated  and well defined 
through the use of robust boundary treatments appropriate to the level of risk and character of 
the area ; 
 
G) security fencing  (where appropriate)  that provides a robust and effective barrier, but does not 
contribute to a hos tile appearance;  
 
H) clearly defined ownerships and management and maintenance responsibilities for all external 
areas; and  
 
I) CCTV (when required) which has  good coverage whilst retaining privacy  of adjacent private 
property . 
 
Explanation  
12.34.  To achieve high quali ty sustainable places where people will choose to live, work and invest 
emphasis needs to be placed on designing for community safety, helping to reduce crime and 
the fear of crime.  The policy aims to achieve a good overall standard of security for buildi ngs 
and the public and private spaces around them.  Through facilitating  natural surveillance and 
creating  a sense of ownership and responsibility for every part of the development, criminal and 
anti-social behaviour can be deterred.  
 
12.35 . The principle s in the policy should be followed when formulating development proposals in 
order to reduce opportunities for criminal behaviour and disorder, to increase the likelihood of 
detection and to reduce the fear of crime.  The various relevant factors need to b e balanced 
through the planning and design process to achieve a solution which satisfies the needs of the 
development in question and those of the wider community  alongside other design objectives .  
Depending upon the location, scale of development propose d and level of crime in the local 
area, certain design features may be required for incorporat ion into a development, or ‘Secured 
by Design’ accreditation to be achieved.   For higher profile developments , or those which will be 
used by large numbers of peo ple, applicants should seek expert advice.  For development  
142   [go to Contents ] 
  proposals relating to higher risk sites for malicious threats, applicants must take into account the 
most up to date information available and discussions with planning officers and security 
exper ts, such as Counter Terrorism Security Advisors, are recommended at an early stage in 
the design process.  This will ensure that the Council  and applicants share an understanding, 
ideally at the beginning of the design process, of the level of risk and the  sort of measures 
available to mitigate the risk . 
 
Policy 48: Landscaping of New Developments  
 
Development will be supported which  protect s landscape character, protects and enhance s existing 
landscape features , and provide s a high quality, co mprehensive hard and soft landscape scheme that 
includes:  
 
A) maximising links to wider Green Infrastructure in line with Policy 26;  
 
B) the provision of Sustainable Drainage Systems and designs that facilitate floodplain 
compens ation and preservation of flood flow routes  where appropriate;  
 
C) generous tree, shrub and hedgerow planting consisting of appropriate species and nursery 
stock specified for the location, role and prominence of the landscape feature, and to provide 
year rou nd interest;  
 
D) fit for purpose, attractive hard and soft landscaping including; planting, surfacing materials, 
boundary treatments and street furniture, for all external environments,  
 
E) appropriate, robust, low maintenance surfacing materials for  public are as and the adoptable 
highway , which should include more attractive finishes (including block paving) in key focal 
spaces and lightly trafficked carriageways ; and 
 
F) a long -term management and maintenance strategy with clear responsibilities and regimes for 
the upkeep of all external areas.  
 
Explanation  
12.36.  High quality landscape design is an essential part of aiming to achieve a more attractive and 
environmentally friendly Doncaster.  Many of the most attractive, sustainable and desirable 
areas to live and work a re characterised by their green character and include mature trees and 
established plantings .  Successful implementation of this policy will help to protect and improve 
existing areas whilst creating attractive and well -designed places that meet the needs of local 
residents.  
 
12.37.  Most developments will benefit from, and will be required to provide, a detailed scheme of hard 
and soft landscaping .  Attractive public realm can be created through the inclusion of tree 
planting and careful selection of robust, fit f or purpose hard landscape materials, such as 
highway surfacing materials or paving  which do not create onerous ongoing maintenance for 
the Council .  Contributions to future maintenance of materials and plantings within the 
adoptable highway may be sought v ia S106 agreements where appropriate.  Soft landscape 
(such as trees, shrubs and hedgerows) can be used to soften the impact of new buildings and 
car parking and to screen service areas or unattractive views.  New planting will be particularly 
important on  development sites that abut the countryside to soften the urban edge (see Policy 
43).  Trees, and large canopied trees in particular, should be included in a ny scheme as they 
offer other key benefits for ecology, shading, a ir quality and sustainable drainage  – as long as 
there is an adequate rooting environment provided for them to flourish.  
 
12.38.  In order to maximise the benefits of tree planting in housing areas, the Council  aims for a 
minimum of 1 tree per dwelling, including  street trees to be designed into the public realm.  Tree 
planting should be considered as an integral part of the urban design and layout of all  
143   [go to Contents ] 
  development, not a cosmetic after thought.  Where possible major s chemes should include 
linear features, for e xample boulevards of large canopied specimen trees  within the public 
realm/ adoptable highway .  Feature planting at junctions , or community focal spaces , within 
adoptable  streets will be encouraged as it can aid legibility and attractive place -making.  New 
residential  development should provide sufficient space to accommodate some tree p lanting 
within the public realm and adoptable highway, where trees will generally prosper longer term.  
See also Policy 32. 
 
12.39.  Further detailed guidance can be found in the Landscape Character Assessment and , where 
adopted, Supplementary Planning Documents.  
 
Policy 49: Advertisements  and Signage  
 
Advertisements and signage need to be well designed and managed to ensure they do not hav e a 
negative impact on buildings or their surroundings, quality of life, living conditions or public safety.  To 
ensure this, advertisements and signage will be supported where they : 
 
A) respect the character and appearance of the area, site or host building being of appropriate 
siting, location, design, size, scale, number, colour and method of illumination work ing with the 
architectural features of any buildings on which they may be situated (and not be a dominant 
feature of the elevation ); and signage shoul d not be located so as to obscure architectural 
details on historic buildings;  
 
B) would not be the dominant feature of any location, leading to an excessive, visually clutte red or 
over bearing appearance;  
 
C) do not contribute to an unsightly proliferation , com mercialisation,  or clutter of signage in the 
vicinity;  
 
D) ensure that they do not interfere with footpath or highway safety, highway management 
regimes, block routes, cause light pollution or cause any other safety hazard;  
 
E) ensure they do not have a negative  effect on the living conditions of nearby residents; and  
 
F) do not harm the significance of any listed buildings, conservation areas, or other designated 
heritage assets.  
 
Explanation  
12.40.  National policy states that advertisements should be carefully managed in  order to protect 
amenity, safety, buildings and surroundings.  This policy expands on national requirements to 
help achieve the local vision to have a successful borough with vibrant attractive communities.   
It will help to ensure a balance between econom ic needs and the needs of people to live, work 
and do business in an attractive environment.  The policy aims to set clear criteria to enable 
adverts to be placed in the right places without detriment to the amenity of the surrounding area.  
The policy rec ognises the benefits of displaying advertisements whilst protecting the built and 
natural environment and public health and safety.  
 
12.41.  The Borough has a mixture of different places from town centres to rural communities and 
countryside.  The type of adverti sements prevalent in these areas can vary greatly but often the 
concerns remain the same, to protect visual amenity and safety.  However , there are also key 
differences between what may be accepted in a town centre and what will be appropriate in a 
rural s ettlement.  Applicants should be aware of this when considering aspects such as scale 
and illumination.  
 
12.42.  Where advertisements are displayed on buildings they should complement the facade and must 
not obscure architectural features.  On buildings with heri tage value this will be particularly  
144   [go to Contents ] 
  critical where features contribute to heritage significance.  Advertisements fixed to listed 
buildings will usually require listed building consent.  Some commercial areas are set within 
places that contribute to the di stinctive character of the Borough , such as the predominantly 
Georgian townscape of Bawtry and Tickhill and the historic character of Doncaster town centre 
and Thorne and Mexborough.  The design of advertisements should not detract from the 
heritage value of these areas and where possible should be used as an opportunity to enhance 
their distinctive character and sense of place.  
 
12.43.  Applications for advertisements in areas where there are already a high number displayed will 
be considered in relation to existi ng advertisements, or signage for the same business.  Where 
the need for additional controls over advertisements in particular areas can be demonstrated, 
for example through conservation area appraisals or neighbourhood plans, the Council will 
consider the  introduction of Areas of Special Control of Advertisements.

  Chapter 13: Health, Wellbeing and Our Communities  
 
Introduction  
13.1.  Doncaster’s Health and Wellbeing Strategy sets out priorities for improving health in Doncaster.  
It identifies that health a nd wellbeing is improving but not  as fast as in the rest of the country.  
The Borough’s most deprived wards  have particular concentration s of poor general and mental 
health and lower life expectancy.  
 
13.2.  Improving our health and wellbeing requires more than i mproving access to medical treatment 
and services .  A healthy community is a good place to grow up and old in ; it should be one 
which supports healthy behaviours and supports reductions in health inequalities.  By guiding  
the use of land, planning decision s influence  the link between the physical and social 
environment  and help create opportunities for improving both  physical and mental  health , in the 
ways we live, work and play . 
 
13.3.  This chapter contributes towards the promotion of improvements that can posit ively improve the 
health and wellbeing of the local community.  Other policies guiding t he quality and design of 
homes, buildings, public spaces, neighbourhoods and transport ha ve a direct impact on factors , 
such as noise and air pollution , which can harm health.  
 
Policy 50: Health (Strategic Policy)   
 
The Council  will improve and promote strong, vibrant and healthy communities by ensuring a high quality 
environment is provided with local services to support health, social and cultural wellbein g.  In order to 
help achieve this the Council  will require:  
 
A) development to positively contribute to creating high quality places that support and promote 
healthy communities and lifestyles, such as maximising access by walking and cycling;  
 
B) provision of good access to leisure facilities,  greenspace and the countryside;  
 
C) developments designed to encourage and support healthy lifestyles;  
 
D) that the healthcare infrastructure implications of any relevant proposed development have been 
considered  and addressed  when and where necessary;   
 
E) controlling the location of, and access to , Food and Drink Uses,  and 
 
F) that proposals for development or change of use will be assessed against the Health Impact 
Assessment Screening Tool and, when determined if required, the de veloper will demonstrate 
they have undertaken, and responded to the findings of, a Health Impact Assessment (HIA).  
 
Explanation  
13.4.  Health Impact Assessment s (HIAs) are a combination of procedures, methods and tools by 
which developments may  be judge d to asses s potential effects on the health of a population 
and the distribution of those effects within the population.   The completion of  HIAs for 
developments  defined in the HIA Screening Tool will highlight any positive and/or negative 
effects of the development .  Completion of the HIA Screening Tool will determine whether a HIA 
is required and, if so, whether it will b e a Rapid or Comprehensive HIA.  The process will 
contribut e towards health priorities of the ‘Health and Wellbeing Board ’ and partners to help 
reduce health inequalities across the Borough .  Full guidance is available to improve the long 
established link between planning and health as almost every planning decision has a potential 
effect on human health.   Good planning and development has a positiv e effect on healthy 
lifestyles; this could be through ensuring there is access to safe and convenient green spaces  
147   [go to Contents ] 
  or ensuring air qualit y levels remain at a safe level . 
 
13.5.  There are many references to health and wellbeing throughout the Local Plan and natio nal 
policy and guidance.  In consultation with our local healthcare providers who deliver health 
infrastructure facilities in the Borough, developers of large housing developments (or where 
there are cumulative effects from a number of smaller developments ), should have regard to 
whether there is a need to deliver appropriate health care facilities.  The need for healthcare 
facilities, or other health -promoting infrastructure such as segregated cycle lanes or leisure 
facilities, should be considered in -step with the demands from new development.  This is 
particularly necessary for large sites that may develop out in multiple phases during which time 
the demands created from a development may change.  The Council will continue to work 
collaboratively with loc al health care providers to assist with their service planning and to help 
ensure planned development through the Local Plan forms part of their strategic planning.  
 
13.6.  An important contributing factor to poor diet and health in Doncaster is the distribution and 
access to Food and Drink Uses , such as hot food takeaways, cafes and restaurants with a 
takeaway service.  This is of particular  relevance in areas of deprivation.  In some locations 
there is an issue where such uses cluster together, reinforcing  the e ase of and access to 
unhealthy foods.  Consideration will therefore be given to controlling the proliferation of , and 
therefore access to, such uses will be fully considered in line with Policy 24. 
 
Policy 51: Protection of Education, Community and Leisure Facilities  
 
Areas defined on the Policies  Map, or land and buildings currently used or last used for education  
(including school playing fields) , community and leisure facilities, will be retained or developed for such 
purposes.  Development resulting in the loss of an existing education, community or leisure facility, or 
land allocated for such purpose, will be assessed on merit and only be permitted where:  
 
A) the buildings or land are no longer fit for the purpo se which they were being used due to size, 
layout, design and condition and that no alternative community use can be found;  
 
B) there is no longer a need or demand for the facility;  
 
C) alternative provision can be made on another site to the same or higher stan dard in terms of 
quantity, quality and community benefit ; or 
 
D) the current use will be retained and enhanced by the development of a small part of the site.  
 
Explanation  
13.7.  Community facilities contribute to  sustainable communities.  They play an important par t in 
ensuring a good quality of life by supporting the needs of residents and workers in the Borough .  
They can provide services  that help foster social cohesion.   Many are playing an increasingly 
important role to support  Doncaster’s growing and ageing po pulation . 
 
13.8.  National planning policy in NPPF  support s the guarding against the unnecessary loss of valued 
facilities and services, particularly where this would reduce the community’s ability to meet its 
day-to-day needs.  There is a  need to maintain a suff icient number and distribution of all 
community facilities and to safeguard them from alternative forms of development.  However, 
some facilities will become surplus to requirements and subject to development pressure.  Any 
proposal that would involve the loss of a community facility will need to be assessed against the 
policy.  
 
13.9.  Development proposals which involve the loss of key facilities will be assessed to ensure the  
Council  is satisfied that adequate alternative provision has been made or where some 
overriding public benefit will result from the loss of the facility, or that the retention of the land or  
148   [go to Contents ] 
  buildings in community use is no longer viable, on the basis that:  
 
 the site or premises have been marketed to the Council's satisfaction for at least 1 2 
months and included both traditional and web -based marketing, and regular 
advertisement in local, regional and/ or national publications as appropriate , 
 Consultation with the local community has been undertaken ; 
 opportunities to re -let premises have been  fully explored including the formation of a 
social enterprise or charitable group that can take over the premises;  
 the premises/  site have been marketed at a price which is commensurate with market 
values (based on evidence from recent and similar transa ctions and deals); and  
 it has been demonstrated that the terms and conditions set out in the lease are 
reasonable and attractive to potential businesses, and that no reasonable offer has been 
refused . 
 
13.10.  Any changes to education facilities should comply with  relevant Government legislation and 
guidance . Please refer to Government’s guidance on ‘involving the Secretry of State in school 
land transactions ’27 for further informat ion. 
 
13.11.  Community facilities include community centres, village halls, youth centres, m edical facilities, 
places of worship, schools, nurseries, colleges, indoor sports and recreational facilities, local 
authority offices, police stations, libraries, theatres, arts venues and accommodation providing 
an element of care.  Other types of facili ties which offer benefits to the community may be 
assessed on a case by case basis .  Facilities are not necessarily in public ownership and may 
be privately owned or managed .  Existing education facilities will be shown on the Policies  Map; 
other community  facilities may not be specifically identified and instead  “washed over ” by 
designations such as ‘Residential Policy Area ’ (Policy 10).  However,  relevant  proposals 
affecting these should  still be assessed against the policy . 
 
Policy 52: New Education facilities  
 
It is important that the ever diversifying needs and requirements of education provision can be met.  
 
A) A new or improved education facility will be supported where:  
 
1. the scale, range, quality and accessib ility of education facilities are improved;  
2. it meets a recognised need in the area it is expected to serve in line with the Council ’s 
  legal responsibility to provide sufficient school places;  
3. the proposed development is of a scale and design appropriate to the location;  
4. an area of open space and playing fields sufficient to meet the needs of pupils is  
  incorporated;  
5. the development is capable of a joint or dual use for community benefit, in agreement  
 with the school/academy and this has been incorporat ed into the design;  
6. proposals that involve the relocation of existing education facilities outside settlement  
  boundaries (and redevelopment of the original site for alternative use) will only be  
  supported where the new site would demonstrably better m eet the identified education  
  needs and is acceptable in terms of its impacts on the countryside;  
7. the proposal is readily accessible by the community or served well with  public transport  
  and by means other than the car; and  
                                                           
27 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit -a-school -land -transaction -proposal   
149   [go to Contents ] 
  8. sufficient car parking, drop  off zones , pedestrian crossings and the provision of safe and  
  secure cycle parking are provided . 
 
B) Where housing proposals of 20 or more family dwellings28 will create or exacerbate a shortfall in 
the number of local school places, mitigation will be requ ired, either through an appropriate 
contribution to off -site provision or, in the case of larger sites, on -site provision.  
 
Explanation  
13.12.  The Council is committed to supporting high quality, convenient and appropriate local education 
services in all parts of  Doncaster and in particular in areas of population growth.  National 
planning policies give great  weight to the need to create, expand and alter schools to better 
education provision in our communities.   Easy access to good quality educational provision i s 
important for supporting economic growth, developing strong sustainable communities, 
promoting economic prosperity and sustaining quality of life . 
 
13.13.  The dual use of existing facilities and the joint provision and sharing of new facilities provides an 
oppo rtunity to address open space deficiencies.  It also makes good economic sense. 
Educational facilities, such as sports halls, playing pitches and changing rooms can serve the 
community and are often under -utilised outside school hours.  Where there is scop e for 
extending and promoting the dual use of these and other school facilities, this will be welcomed. 
The Council  will also look to opportunities for dual use of indoor sports facilities in the design of 
new, or the improvement of existing , school buildi ngs. 
 
13.14.  All proposed education facilities sh ould comply with the latest relevant Government legislation 
and Council guidance  that informs the need for and manner of education provision , such as 
pupil place planning.  The Council , as education authority , will need to be consulted where 
appropriate.   
 
13.15.  New housing development has the potential to create demand and increase pressure on 
existing education facilities in the Borough .  National policy expects local authorities to plan 
positively for the provision and  use of shared space, community facilities and other local 
services to enhance the sustainability of communities and residential environments.  It also 
expects local authorities to take a proactive, positive and collaborative approach to meeting the 
need f or school places.  Our duty is to ensure that sufficient school places are available to meet 
the needs of existing and new communities.  It is therefore important that new housing 
development does not create or exacerbate shortfalls in available school pla ces, and 
developments may therefore be required to contribute to the provision of additional places.  
 
13.16.  In many cases, local schools will be able to accept children from new housing developments.  
However, there may be cases where the school cannot accept any  more children because they 
are full .  In these cases, developers will be required to make a contribution towards the 
provision of new school facilities to meet the needs arising from new housing development.  In 
most instances such contributions will be s ecured to provide additional facilities at existing 
schools but on occasions some individual or mixed -use development proposals (e.g. urban 
extensions) could be large enough to generate the need for new schools.  The need for school 
places arising from dev elopment both within and immediately adjacent to the  relevant 
catchment area will be considered on a site by site basis having regard to the capacity of 
existing education provision within the area.  Financial contributions relating to education 
facilities  will apply to residential development comprising 20 or more family units.  The Council 
will continue to work with other authorities and providers to monitor the capacity of education 
facilities and their ability to meet forecast ed demands during the plan period.  
  
                                                           
28 “Family dwelling” for the purposes of this policy means a dwelling with 2 or more  bedrooms. This includes flats.   
150   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 53: Provision of New  Indoor  Recreation and Leisure Facilities  
 
The provision of new indoor recreation and leisure facilities will be encouraged in appropriate locations, 
particularly where they:  
 
A) are associated with identifi ed needs of the community;  
 
B) offer greatest accessibility to the public;  
 
C) involve the use of derelict or degraded land particularly where they revitalise communities and 
lessen disadvantage;  
 
D) provide alternative or specialist sports and recreational provi sion.  
 
E) are of a scale appropriate to the type and size of settlement; and  
 
F) are located in the larger urban areas if they attract large numbers of people and are accessible 
by walking, cycling and public transport links . 
 
Explanation  
13.17.  National planning poli cies and local strategies (such as the ‘Doncaster Physical Activity and 
Sport Strategy )’ support opportunities for sport and recreation and identify them as having an 
important contribution to the health and wellbeing of communities.  New and improve d indoor 
and recreation leisure facilities will be supported in appropriate locations such as where the 
need is identified in the Built Sport Facility Strategy and Playing Pitch Strategy where they are 
consistent with this and other plan policies.  
 
13.18.  The provision  of high quality, well maintained facilities improves health and wellbeing, promotes 
social inclusion and community cohesion and is essential to the quality of life of the Borough’s 
residents.  To be sustainable, suitable facilities must be provided locall y, whilst ensuring those 
which attract larger numbers of visitors are accessible by walking, cycling and public transport.  
On occasion leisure or recreation facilities need to be provided where a particular attraction or 
feature is located.  In these case s attention has to be paid to possible conflicts with 
environmental objectives.  
 
Policy 54: Pollution  
 
Development proposals that are likely to cause pollution, or be exposed to pollution, will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated t hat pollution can be avoided, or where mitigation measures 
(such as those incorporated into the design and layout of development) will minimise significantly  
harmful impacts to acceptable levels that protect health, environmental quality and amenity.  When  
determining planning applications , the agent of change principle will be applied, and  particular 
consideration will be given to:  
 
A) an assessment of the risks to public health and the impact of cumulative effects and where 
necessary that the provision for m itigation against the total effects has been provided.  
 
B) the presence of noise generating uses close to the site, and the potential noise likely to be 
generated by the proposed development.  A Noise Assessment will be required to enable clear 
decision -makin g on any relevant planning applicatio n.  Proposals will need to have  regard to the 
standards identified in Appendix 11 to establish is the proposal is acceptable in noise impact 
terms . 
 
C) the impact on national air qua lity; especially but not limited to Air Quality Management Areas, 
areas potentially close to the EU limit value, other sensitive areas and the aims and objectives 
of the Air Quality Action Plan.  An Air Quality Assessment will be required to enable clear  
151   [go to Contents ] 
  decision making on any relevant planning application.  
 
D) any adverse effects on the quantity, quality and ecology features of water bodies and 
groundwater resources, including contamination to Source Protection Zones.  
 
E) the impact of artificial lighting.  Artificial lighting has the potential to cause unacceptable light 
pollution in the form of sky -glow, glare or intrusion onto other property and land.  Development 
proposals should ensure that adequate and reasonable controls to protect dwellings and other 
sensitive property, the rural night -sky, observatories, road -users, and designated sites for 
conservation of biodiversity and protected  species are included within the proposals.  
 
Explanation  
13.19.  National planning policy in the NPPF aims to minimise pollution and  other adverse effects on 
the local and natural environment.   It seeks to prevent unacceptable risks from pollution and 
ensures that new development  is appropriate to its  location , taking into account direct and 
cumulative effects on health, the natural en vironment , general amenity, and the potential 
sensitivity of the area or proposed development.  
 
13.20.  Due to the mixed urban and rural nature of Doncaster pollution varies across the Borough.  
However, t he Council has a duty to ensure that everyone  is safe to enjoy the environment in 
which they live, work and play.  For these reasons it is fundamental that the relationship 
between sources of pollution and sensitive development is effectively and appropriately 
managed when making planning decisions . 
 
13.21.  Noise levels vary from relatively quiet areas within Doncaster’s parks to much noisier areas 
close to the A1(M), M18 and Doncaster Sheffield Airport.  Unacceptable levels of noise can be a 
cause of health and stress related problems, create amenity issues, and can resu lt in negative 
impacts on productivity and learning.  For these reasons, it is fundamental that the relationship 
between noise sources and noise sensitive development is effectively and appropriately 
managed. Key to this approach will be a methodology for separating noise sensitive 
developments from noise generating sources.  
 
13.22.  To assist in the interpretation of Part B of the policy, guidance is set out to assist with preparing 
successful planning applications and to inform decision -making. When  assessing and  
interpreting the likely impact of noise associated with, or likely to affect, the development , 
guidance in Appendix 11 (Noise ) and Planning Practice Guidance standards should be applied.  
Where required, good acousti c design through careful planning and layout can appropriately 
mitigate noise impacts.  
 
13.23.  The quality of the air we breathe is affected by many factors.   These include emissions from 
local industry, domestic sources and exhaust gases from traffic.  Poor air quality is a serious 
public health risk and locally is a major factor in the reduction of life expectancy.  National and 
local planning polic y seek to sustain compliance with , and contribut ions towards  meeting , EU 
limit values or national objectives for po llutants .  Air Q uality Management Areas are declared 
locally where particular action needs to be taken to improve air quality objectives and standards .  
However, p rotecting air quality is as important beyond AQMAs .  Even when development has 
only a minor i nfluence, it is important to consider cumulative effects and require mitigation 
against the total emissions.  
 
13.24.  The impacts of artificial lighting (light pollution) are comprehensively considered in national 
guidance and best practice including , for example , the use of the most up to date ‘Bats and 
Artificial Lighting Guidance Note’.  These measures are of particular importance in the areas 
such as Thorne and Hatfield Moors Special Protection Area’s (SPA).

Policy 55: Contamination and Unstabl e Land  
 
Development on land that is unstable, currently contaminated or suspected of being contaminated due to 
its previous history or geology, or that will potentially become contaminated as a result of the 
development, will require the submission of an a ppropriate Preliminary Risk Assessment.  Proposals will 
be required to mitigate contamination or land stability by: 
 
A) demonstrat ing there is no significant harm, or risk of significant harm, to human health, or land, 
natural environment, pollution of soil o r any watercourse or ground water;  
 
B) ensur ing necessary remedial action is undertaken to safeguard users or occupiers of the site or 
neighbouring land and protect the environment and any buildings or services from 
contamination during development and in the  future;  
 
C) demonstrat ing that adverse ground conditions have been properly identified and safely treated; 
and 
 
D) clearly demonstrat ing to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, that the land is suitable 
for its  proposed use . 
 
Explanation  
13.25.  Groundwat er is an important resource that we rely on everyday and provides the majority of 
drinking water, sustains baseflow and ecology in our rivers, and supports lakes and wetland 
ecosystems.  Contamination in or on land can present unacceptable risks to human h ealth and 
the wider environment, including to groundwater.  Doncaster’s water supply depends on 
groundwater abstractions in the Principal aquifer which has high permeability and needs to be 
protected to avoid any kind of contamination.  The protection is g iven by buffer zones around 
the source of drinking water called Source Protection Zones which are divided into 3 zones 
(inner, outer, and source catchment protection).  The Environment Agency provides further 
guidance on what activities are possible in the se zones – see also Policy 60. 
 
13.26.  The Council will encourage the full and effective use of land in an environmentally acceptable 
manner.  However, failing to deal adequately with contamination and land instability could cause 
harm to human health, property and the wider environment.  National planning policy states that 
any potentially contaminated or unstable land being assessed for development through the 
planning process should be dealt with at this stage ensuring that it poses no unacceptable risk 
to future occupiers or the wider environment .  Adequate site investigation information, prepared 
by a competent person, is required to consider the requirements of Policy 55.  Should any 
proposed sit e, currently or previously, have been subject to land -use(s) which have the potential 
to have caused contamination of the underlying soils and groundwater then any planning 
application must be supported by a Preliminary Risk Assessment to demonstrate that the risks 
posed to ‘controlled waters’ by any contamination are understood by the applicant and can be 
safely managed.  It is recommended that developers consider using the National Quality Mark 
Scheme for Land Contamination Management which involves the u se of competent persons to 
ensure that land contamination risks are appropriately managed and refer to the contaminated 
land pages on www.gov.uk  for more information.

  Chapter  14: Climate Change , Mineral  Resources  & Energy  
 
Introduction  
14.1.  Although it is difficult to predict exactly what the long -term impacts will be in the future from 
climate change, it is generally accepted that increased burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse 
gas emissions are leading to global warming and rising sea levels.  There is expected to be 
increased incidents of extreme weather, such as heat waves, and prolonged periods of intense 
rainfall resulting in flooding which brings expensive damage and disruption to property, and 
potentially even resul ting in loss of life.  
 
14.2.  The policies in this chapter , and throughout the Local Plan,  set out how we will ensure that we:  
 
 address and adapt to climate change, including the changes likely to arise through 
increased flooding arising from more frequent incide nts of extreme weather;  
 follow a risk -based approach to the location of development to avoid flood risk where 
possible, and ensure the residual risks to people and property are properly managed 
where development is necessary in areas at risk from flooding for wider sustainability 
benefits;  
 increase the supply of low carbon and renewable energy;  
 protect best and most versatile agricultural land which is an important asset given 67% of 
the Borough’s area is classified as being in ‘agricultural land use’; and  
 make the best use of our mineral resources  and ensure restoration proposals on new 
mineral workings deliver climate change mitigation where possible . 
 
14.3.  The policies in this chapter reflect national planning policy and will also help support the 
economy, ens ure the environment is adequately considered and protected, and address the 
need to provide local, regional and national demand for minerals.  
 
 
Policy 56: Drainage  
 
Development sites must incorporate satisfactory measures for dealing with thei r drainage impacts to 
ensure waste water and surface water run -off are managed appropriately and to reduce flood risk to 
existing communities.  Proposals will be supported therefore in line with the following requirements : 
 
A) There is adequate means of foul sewage disposal and treatment or that capacity can be made 
available in time to serve the development.  
 
B) They will not increase flood risk on site and ensure no flooding to land or buildings elsewhere . 
 
C) They achieve a reduction in surface water run off on b rownfield sites, and no increase on 
existing rates for greenfield sites . 
 
D) They secure the removal of culverting and avoid building over a culvert or new culverting of 
watercourses  and a 10 metre buffer zone is left free from development from the water’s ed ge; 
 
E) They make use of Sustainable Drainage Systems unless it can be shown to be technically 
unfeasible.  
 
F) They dispose of surface water appropriately according to the following networks in order of 
preference:  
 
1. to an infiltration based system wherever possi ble (such as soakaways).  
2. discharge into a watercourse with the prior approval of the landowner and navigation  
   authority (following treatment where necessary).   
155   [go to Contents ] 
  3. discharge to a public water sewer  or highway drain . 
 
Explanation  
14.4.  The effective management and disposal of surface water plays a role in reducing the risk of 
flooding as well as ensuring that excessive strain is not placed upon existing infrastructure.  
 
14.5.  Proposals on brownfield sites will be supported which achieve a reduction in surface water run -
off.  The Council  will look for a reduction of 30% on brownfield sites, but will consider each case 
on its merits having regard to what is practical.  The policy supports sustainable drainage 
systems  and all major development proposals (10+ dwellings or 0.5 hectares for commercial 
developments) are now expected to make use of them unless there is clear evidence that this 
would be inappropriate.  Careful  consideration of the various techniques will be required in order 
to take account of potential land contami nation or groundwater sensitivities.   The Council 
expect s developers to discharge surface water as high as possible within the surface water 
hierarchy ; where disposed of to an existing surface water sewer there must be no detriment to 
the existing users of  the sewer.   The Council , as ‘Lead Local Flood Authority ’, is now a statutory 
consultee on planning applications for the management of surface water.  To assist applicants, 
the Council has jointly prepared guidance for developers to ensure appropriate info rmation is 
submitted (South Yorkshire Interim Local Guidance for Sustainable Drainage Systems June 
2015  and Doncaster Council’s Guidance for Developers Producing Drainage Strategies  - 
Appendix  A - 2018 ).  In addition to this, the Environment Agency has pu blished a series of 
position statements which outline their approach to the management and protection of 
groundwater which must be adhered to in addition to planning requirements . 
 
 
Policy 57: Flood Risk  Management  
 
A) All development proposals w ill be considered against the NPPF, including application of the 
sequential test and, if necessary, the exception test.   
 
B) The extent and detailed boundaries of the functional flood plain (flood zone 3b) are identified 
through the Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, in agreement with the Environment 
Agency , where national policy will be applied.  
 
C) All windfall development proposals outside of Development Allocations in Flood Zones 2 and 3a 
will be supported  as follows:  
 
Housing ; some commercial, and bu siness and service and general industrial (E(c), E(g) (except  
for E(g(i)) Offices) & B2 use classes) for proposals at Tiers 1 to 3 of the settlement hierarchy (as  
defined in Policy 1): will be required  to pass a sequential te st with an area of search normally  
confined to elsewhere within the same settlement.  
 
Office:  will be required to pass a sequential test with an area of search normally confined to  
elsewhere within the Town Centre where the development is being proposed.  
 
Retail : will be required to pass a sequential test with an area of search normally confined to:  
 
1. elsewhere within the settlement’s town/ district/ local centre; or  
2. where a settlement does not have a retail area defined on the Policies  Map, elsewhere  
  within the same settlement as per the proposal itself.  
 
Mixed use : will need to provide justification that the scheme should be considered as a single  
proposal or otherwise consider whether it is more appropriate to separate out the individual  
component p roposals of the scheme and assess against the land uses as above.  
 
All other proposals: will normally require a borough -wide area of search unless a case can be  
made to narrow the search area due to certain locational needs of the development or specific   
156   [go to Contents ] 
  catchment requirements.  
 
D) The Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment identifies a number of residual flood risk areas 
and details development planning advice for these which should be considered when looking to 
develop in these areas .  The Council will ensure it keeps its evidence base on flood risk up -to-
date, including commissioning a Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment at the earliest 
opportunity, so that proposals outside of Development Allocations have the best available 
evidence on which to pre pare their own site specific flood risk assessments and appropriate 
mitigation and to assist with successful pass of the sequential and exceptions tests.  
 
Explanation  
14.6.  The Functional Flood Plain boundaries are identified through the  Council’s evidence base,  in 
agreement with the Environment Agency, and is also known as flood zone 3b or washlands.  
National planning policy in the NPPF seeks to protect and increase the capacity of the 
functional flood plain to store water during times of flood which will prote ct surrounding areas 
from flooding.  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (Level 1) 2015 sets  out more detail on the 
methodology and approach employed for identifying the functional flood plain . 
 
14.7.  As development allocations have been made in accordance with the sequential approach, an 
application for a use that accords with the allocation will be deemed to have passed a 
sequential test, although any ‘more vulnerable’ uses on employment and mixed use allocations 
will still need to pass a sequential test at pla nning application stage.   For clarity , ‘Potential  
Development Sites’ (see Policy 5) are generally sites that failed the Sequential Test at plan -
making stage so any future development proposals on these sites still need to dem onstrate a 
successful pass of the Sequential Test as part of any future application.  
 
14.8.  Given that significant areas of the Borough are constrained by flood risk, including some of our 
largest and otherwise most sustainable towns and villages, there will al ways be development 
proposals on windfall sites coming forward during the plan period.  These are sites that are not 
allocated through the Local Plan but where investors, landowners, and developers wish to bring 
forward proposals in line with relevant Loca l Plan policies  and being mindful that all the policies 
in the Local Plan should be read together.   Proposals in flood zones 2 or 3a (or other significant 
sources of flood risk such a surface water flooding) outside of Development Allocations will 
need to identify whether there are any alternative and reasonably available sites , normally in the 
areas specified in the policy , that are sequentially preferable to satisfy the Sequential Test.  Any 
sites identified in the same flood risk zone should also be cons idered further as there could still 
be instances  where the site(s) identified  may be sequentially preferable to the application site, 
for example sp eed of onset, duration, velocit y, or depths.  Sites with planning permission can be 
discounted as no longer being reasonably available.  The applicant need only look for sites of a 
similar size to that of the proposal.  The Council’s Housing & Economic Land Availability 
Assessment (HELAA)  and 5 -Year Housing Land Supply Statement , both normally updated 
annually, detail alternative sites for proposals of 5+ dwellings, or abo ve 0.25 hectares  for 
employment land .  Proposals below this site size threshold will need to undertake a review of 
the market to ascertain whether there are any sites available, for example indi vidual 
development plots.  Proposals that cannot pass the Sequential Test should normally be refused 
and do not proceed to the exception tests stage.  As such, developers are advised to consider 
the Sequential Test requirements at the earliest opportunity to avoid unnecessary  expense 
being incurred through progressing an application/commissioning wider planning surveys and 
assessments unnecessarily . 
 
14.9.  The Exception Test may be required depending on the vulnerability of the proposed use.  It is 
important that  new developments are made safe (including, where appropriate, resilient to any 
flooding which may occur and that the residual risk of breach and/or over topping of any 
defences does not pose significant danger to people and /or property) and that they do not 
increase the likelihood or impact of flooding on surrounding land or properties.  A site specific 
Flood Risk Assessment will be required in line with national planning policy. This will form the  
157   [go to Contents ] 
  basis of understanding what the residual risks to the dev elopment are and what may be the 
most appropriate form of mitigation to take. These will be considered in conjunction with the 
Environment Agency and the Council’s Lead Local Flood Authority Team as part of determining 
the planning application.  Proposals  are likely to fall into at least one of six residual flood risk 
areas as identified through the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment.   Proposals that fall into more 
than one residual flood risk area will need to manage the residual risks relating to the greates t 
risk posed.  Evidence for the Exception s Test should be proportionate to the scale of the 
proposal.  
 
14.10.  Following Local Plan adoption, the Council will consider whether a Development & Flood Risk 
Supplementary Planning Document is necessary to support imple mentation of this Policy.   The 
Council will continue to work with the Environment Agency and other flood risk management 
organisations to keep the evidence base on flood risk up -to-date and manage the residual risks 
to the Borough from all sources to the b est of our ability and with the resources available.

Policy 58: Low Carbon and Renewable Energy  (Strategic Policy)  
 
The Council aims to increase the supply of low carbon and renewable energy  generated in the Borough, 
in accordance with the principles set out below:  
 
A) Proposals will be supported which give priority to:  
 
1. community energy schemes that are in full or part community ownership;  
2. biomass and energy crop schemes especially to the nort h and south east of the main  
   urban area, for example mixed woodland, single species short rotation forestry and large - 
   scale forestry, outside of areas of high quality arable farmland;  
3. heat or power generation from light, water, waste and other low c arbon heat sources;  
4. landfill and sewage gas energy generation schemes;  
5. wind power projects which meet the criteria of Policy 59; and  
6. micro -renewable energy technologies and decentralised heat and power systems within  
   new development.  
 
B) In all cases, low carbon and renewable energy proposals will be supported where they:  
 
1. have undertaken community engagement and demonstrate how they will deliver  
  environmental, social and economic benefits;  
2. have no unacceptable adverse eff ects on  local amenity and air quality, and include  
  appropriate stand -off distances between technologies and sensitive receptors, such as  
  residential areas;  
3. allow the continued safe and efficient operation of Doncaster Sheffield  Airport;  
4. would have no u nacceptable adverse effects on highway safety and infrastructure;  
5. have no unacceptable  adverse impacts, including cumulative impacts, on the built and  
  natural environment (including landscape character, and historic and nature conservation  
  assets, such  as Thorne and Hatfield Moors); and  
6. reclaim the site to a suitable and safe condition and use (such as agriculture or nature  
  conservation) within a defined and agreed period should the development cease to be  
  operational.  
 
C) Proposals will be supported w hich facilitate the delivery of combined heat and power (CHP), 
combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) and district heating networks where there is 
sufficient heat density/demand or anchor loads. Development within or adjacent to Heat 
Opportunity Areas wil l be expected to incorporate infrastructure for district heating  where 
feasible, and to connect to existing systems where available.  
 
Explanation  
14.11.  National policy requires us to plan for renewable energy provision.  Renewable energy offers a 
viable alternat ive to fossil fuels and nuclear sources and includes the energy generated from 
wind turbines, hydro (e.g. rivers), solar power, biomass, energy crops, waste facilities, landfill 
sites and sewage gas.  Renewable and low carbon sources of energy are central to achieving 
our commitments on both reducing carbon emissions and combating the effects of climate 
change.  This is in line with our aspirations to become a low carbon borough.  However, the 
potential negative effects of these sources need to be carefully  assessed and managed on a 
case by case basis.  The type of technology proposed will influence the potential impacts on the 
built and natural environment which all need to be adequately considered.  To guide developers 
the Doncaster Renewable and Low Carbo n Study highlights the key opportunities for different 
forms of renewable energy in the Borough .  The Landscape Character and Capacity Study also 
assess es the potential of the landscape to accommodate wind energy developments and 
biomass / woodland crops.  
 
14.12.  The above policy seeks to balance the need to provide a continuous supply of renewable 
energy and encourage sources of low cost energy whilst protecting the interests of local  
160   [go to Contents ] 
  communities, historical, cultural and environmental assets.  The policy sets o ut the main criteria 
that will be used to assess renewable energy proposals.  Whilst the policy is not specific on 
which renewable energy technologies will be acceptable, it highlights key opportunities and 
challenges and explains how renewable energy proj ects can support wider policy aspirations.  
 
14.13.  The Doncaster Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Study (2012) show s that Doncaster makes 
a significant contribution to renewable energy generation in the Yorkshire and Humber Region.  
It was ranked the second highes t authority producing 12.8% of the Region’s total in 2012.  The 
Study also assessed the technical potential for renewable and low carbon energy resources 
within the Borough .  It found that although environmental constraints such as landscape 
character redu ce the overall opportunities for wind development, there is still significant 
potential to capitalise on wind resources.  The Study showed  that the Borough has significant 
biomass resource potential that could fuel district heating networks.   In addition, there are 
opportunities to accommodate biomass planting schemes within lower lying areas and existing 
woodland areas.  The history of coal mining in the Borough increases the potential to generate 
energy from coal mine methane or use mine water heat pumps.   Micro -renewable also offers 
significant potential to supplement energy demands and help alleviate fuel poverty.   In particular 
there is a significant opportunity for solar power schemes to be installed on the roofs of existing 
and planned large scale com mercial and employment developments across the Borough . 
 
14.14.  The Study found that Doncaster also has major opportunities to benefit from developing heat 
networks and establish new decentralised energy networks (for example combined heat and 
power schemes).  These could be established by new development and extended into existing 
areas to leverage the benefits.  A number of urban areas in the Borough generate high energy 
loads in terms of electricity and heat due to the intensity of development and the range of uses, 
particularly Doncaster town centre.  In other locations, large -scale developments could benefit 
from decentralised energy systems due to their anticipated heat and power loads.  
 
14.15.  The Policies  Map shows Heat Opportunity Areas where  there is potential to develop heat and 
power networks, due to : the existing heat demand of the building stock ; the presence of key 
anchor ‘heat loads’ (for example hospitals) or public sector ownerships (for example social 
housing estates or leisure centres ); heat generators  (power stations, industrial sites or energy 
from waste facilities ); new potential development sites ; or a combination of these factors.  
Significant new development  proposals within or adjacent to the Heat Opportunity Areas will  be 
expected to undertake a  feasibility analysis to assess the potential to develop these networks, in 
accordance with the heat hierarchy.  Where appropriate they may be required to provide the 
necessary infrastructure to support development of such networks.  Generally, all develop ments 
should consider their heating and cooling strategy in accordance with the following heat 
hierarchy:  
 
1. Connection to existing C ombined Heat and Power (CHP) / Combined Cooling Heat and 
Power (CCHP)  distribution networks;  
2. Site-wide renewable CHP  / CCHP;   
3. Site-wide gas -fired CHP  / CCHP;  
4. Site-wide renewable community heating/cooling;  
5. Site-wide gas -fired community heating/cooling; and  
6. Individual building renewable heating.

Policy 59: Wind Energy Developments  (Strategic Policy)  
 
Applicati ons for wind energy developments involving one or more wind turbines will be permitted where:  
 
A) medium to large -scale proposals are located within  the Area of Search for Wind Energy 
Developments as shown on the Policies Map ;  
 
B) small to medium  scale wind po wer schemes are directed away from sensitive areas, views  and 
uses;  
 
C) proposals satisfy the requirements of Policy 58 and any other relevant Local Plan policy;  
 
D) development would not lead to unacceptable  coalescence of areas  dominated by wind energy 
development;  
 
E) development achieves a net gain in biodiversity and has no unacceptable  adverse impacts, 
including cumulative impacts, on the historic, built, natural environment and biodiversity 
(particularly flight paths for bird s and bats and, within 3km of Thorne and Hatfield Moors Special 
Protection Areas, foraging or migratory flight paths for nightjar) ; 
 
F) any proposed turbine would be located at a sufficient  distance from any residential property to 
demonstrate that it would n ot cause unacceptable effects on amenity, living conditions, or be 
overbearing;  
 
G) any proposed turbine would be sited away from a susceptible dwelling house, community facility 
or workplace, so as not to cause shadow flicker;  
 
H) any adverse impacts on radar  systems (including the operation and growth of Doncaster 
Sheffield Airport), TV reception, communications links, or telecommunications systems are 
capable of being acceptably mitigated;  
 
I) any proposed turbine would be setback from any highway boundary, ra ilway line, canal or other 
waterway, p ublic footpath or bridleway by a sufficient distance  to be safe ; and  
 
J) following community engagement, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified 
by affected local communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has their 
backing.  
 
Explanation  
14.16.  The Local Plan aims to encourage the transition to a low carbon economy, part of which is 
maximising the use of renewable energy.  Wind energy developments are potentially an 
important supply of re newable energy, but the scale and operation of turbines can have 
negative effects if poorly located.  They are often controversial proposals which can split local 
opinion and generate strong community feelings.  
 
14.17.  The Doncaster Renewable and Low Carbon Energ y Study explored the technical potential for 
‘large scale’ wind energy developments.  The term ‘large scale wind’ describes the development 
of commercial scale wind turbines and wind farms.  These typically comprise turbines of 1 MW 
or more with hub height s of circa  80-100m or more.  To be considered commercially viable, 
wind speeds greater than 6.0m/s at 100m are need ed.  The majority of Doncaster has high 
enough average annual wind speed to exceed this .  However , there are a number of other 
practical, soc ial and environment constraints that need to be considered.  The process of 
physical constraint mapping has been used to identify which sites are likely to have potential for 
locating large -scale wind turbine s.  Renewable UK define small -medium wind turbin es as those 
that power many UK homes, farms and businesses  with height s up to 55m tall  including the  
162   [go to Contents ] 
  blades . 
 
14.18.  Landscape character is important as it often informs much of the debate around wind 
development.  There are two principal landscape types in Donca ster: the South Magnesian 
Limestone and the Humberhead Levels.  The Doncaster Landscape Character Assessment and 
the 2020 update highlights potential areas of low and medium landscape sensitivity where wind 
power schemes may be more suitable.  It also high lights areas that will be sensitive to such 
development, particularly areas in the far west of the Borough and along the Don Valley.  Green 
Belt has been excluded from the Area of Search as development within this designation is only 
permitted under ‘very special circumstances’ . 
 
14.19.  Therefore, the designated ‘Area of Search for Wind Energy Developments ’ shown on the 
Policies  Map (see also Figure 13) focuses on directing medium -scale to large -scale wind 
turbines to the le ss sensitive locatio ns within the Borough .  In Flood Zone 3b (functional 
floodplain) essential infrastructure such as wind turbines has to pass the exceptions test to 
show that it will provide wider sustainability benefits to the community that outweigh flood risk .  
Proposals will need to show how the development will remain operational at times of flood, and 
that it will be safe fo r its lifetime , without increasing flood risk elsewhere in line with the 
requirements of Policy 57.  Although this area of search is preferred , further detailed feasibility 
studies would have to consider a number of additio nal siting constraints as part of any planning 
application and meet the criteria of Policy 59. 
 
14.20.  There is some potential for small -to medium -scale wind energy generation in individual 
developments or adjacent less sensitive p laces such as employment areas.  Smaller scale 
turbines with a hub height of circa 1 1–15m can often be found installed in homes, commercial 
sites, schools, and rural locations , and, like micro renewables, can (subject to certain criteria) be 
installed thro ugh permitted development rights .  Applications for small – medium scale turbine s 
may be permitted anywhere in the Borough but will be judged on a case by case basis by this  
policy.  
 
14.21.  Medium and small scale turbines are much less effective and potentially c orrespondingly more 
expensive than large commercial turbines.  The comparison with large scale wind is important 
when considering cumulative impact.  For example, around 800 6 kW turbines would be 
required to displace a single 2.5 MW turbine.  The low ener gy output per turbine, poorer 
performance, and correspondingly higher cost , means that medium and small scale wind is 
unlikely to be delivered on a commercial energy generation export to the grid basis.  
 
14.22.  This policy sets out the main criteria that will be  used to assess all wind energy developments 
that require planning permission . Within 3km of Thorne and Hatfield Moors Special Protection 
Areas applications will need to demonstrate through an appropriate assessment that there will 
be no adverse impact on the integrity of nightjar populations.   This assessment should consider 
factors such as the following, both in terms of collision risk and displacement: potential for direct 
impacts on nightjar within the designated sites boundary; impacts on feeding habit at outside the 
designated site; impacts on flight paths between the designated site and feeding habitats; and 
impacts on migration routes.    
 
14.23.  Applicants  will need to demonstrate how proposals will not cause an unacceptable impact on 
local residents and bus inesses and the built and natural environment.  When proposing a wind 
development, consult ation  with members of the local community and statutory agencies (e.g. 
the aviation and highway authorities, and the operator of Robin Hood Airport) on the potential 
benefits and adverse effects  will be required .  However, the viability of schemes will not only 
depend on economic and environmental factors such as the sensitivity of the landscape, but 
also the availability of suitable infrastructure, such as grid connec tion points and transmission 
lines.  Where locational and policy requirements are considered to have been met, taking into 
account the environmental, social, economic impacts. The Council will look favourably upon 
applications for wind energy within the Ar ea of Search, if it can be demonstrated that the 
concerns that have been raised by the affected local community (the area of which is agreed in  
163   [go to Contents ] 
  consultation with the Council and community) have been, or can be overcome, through 
mitigation whether this be d esign, construction or operational mitigation.

Policy 60: Protecting and Enhancing Doncaster’s Soil and Water Resources  
 
Proposals affecting land and water re sources will be expected to comply with the following criteria : 
 
A) Proposals on non -allocated sites that involve the significant loss of the best and most versatile 
agricultural land (grades 1, 2 and 3a) will only be supported where:  
 
1. there are no other suit able alternative locations on lower quality agricultural land (or non - 
  agricultural land) available; or   
2. the land can be reinstated back to its previous state ( where possible ). 
 
B) Developers will need to demonstrate through an on -site assessment the actua l grading where 
significant development ta kes place on agricultural land.  
 
C) Proposals will need to demonstrate that all practicable steps have been taken for soil resources 
to be conserved and managed in a sustainable way.  
 
D) Development which would disturb o r damage any soils of high environmental value (e.g. peats 
and other soils contributing to ecological connectivity, carbon stores such as peatlands and 
flood risk alleviation etc.) will not normally be permitted.  
 
E) Proposals will be supported which will:  
 
1. make positive progress towards achieving ‘good’ status or potential under the Water  
  Framework Directive in the Borough’s surface and ground waterbodies; and  
2. promote water efficiency measures which take account of current water availability (e.g.  
  informe d by Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies) and future demand . 
 
F) Proposals will not be supported which would:  
 
1. have an adverse impact on the ecological status or recreational value of rivers and other  
  water bodies such as flood storage areas;  
2. lead t o the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground waters; and  
3. lead to a reduction in ground water levels (or reduced flows in water courses).  
 
Explanation  
14.24.  This policy seeks to conserve, protect and enhance the quality of Doncaster’s land, soil and 
water resources and minimise the loss of high quality arable farmland and ground water within 
the nationally important aquifers as far as possible, whilst preventing unacceptable risks from 
pollution.  Soil and water are finite resources that provide vital functions (known as ecosystem 
services) such as food production, carbon storage, water filtration, flood management and 
support for biodiversity and wildlife.  Yet these resources are coming under increasing pressure 
from a variety of sources, especially f looding from rivers and surface water run -off from new 
development, air pollution, wildlife fragmentation and land intensification.  
 
14.25.  Agriculture is the main land use within the Borough making up nearly two thirds of the total land 
area.  The soils found in  the Borough vary in quality from high -grade arable farmland (grades 2 
and 3) and its extensive network of drains and channels in the east of the Borough, land 
reclamation on former colliery  sites, through to remediated brownfield sites within former 
indus trial areas.  The low -lying agricultural landscape of the Humberhead Levels requires 
careful management to avoid flooding or prevent harm to property and natural ecosystems such 
as wetland habitat.   Around half of the land area of the Borough is given over  to arable farming.  
Doncaster’s high quality agricultural land needs to be protected from inappropriate development 
so that we can maximise its economic benefits such as local food production, whilst 
encouraging compatible land management practices such a s extending field margins to 
encourage wildlife creation and recreation in these areas.  Developers will need to take full  
166   [go to Contents ] 
  account of the potential impact of development on the quality of agricultural land and soil and 
water resources, especially during co nstruction phases.  
 
14.26.  Where significant development is unavoidable, preference will be given to the use of poorer 
quality agricultural land in preference to higher quality land.  Care should also be taken to avoid 
damage or disturbance to soils of high envir onmental value and other soils that contribute 
significantly to ecosystem services.  Proposals for other uses of agricultural land for purposes 
such as flood storage and biomass planting schemes (e.g. reed bed creation) will be supported 
where they avoid t he loss of high quality agricultural land.  
 
14.27.  Development should demonstrate the sustainable use of soils during construction and operation 
stages where appropriate.  Applicants should demonstrate, in their proposals, that there are 
feasible and appropriate methods, locations and receptors for the temporary storage and reuse 
of high quality soils.  Built development should be designed and sited with an appreciation of the 
relative  functional capacity of soil resources and threats to soils with the aim of  preserving or 
enhancing identi fied soil functions.  
 
14.28.  Measures to incorporate green space and sustainable drainage elements that retain permeable 
surfaces, allow water filtration, reduce solid erosion and maintain natural soil functions will be 
supported.  Measu res that waste soil resource, reduce soil quality, compact or pollute soils or 
that create a predominantly impermeable surface should be avoided.  
  
14.29.  The Borough of Doncaster overlies two principal aquifers: Sherwood Sandstone (from which 
drinking water is o btained) and the Magnesian Limestone (from which drinking water can be 
obtained).  Sherwood Sandstone is the second most important source of ground water in the 
UK.  However, ground water supplies within both aquifers are relatively low due to over 
abstrac tion.  Aquifers replenish over time through percolating rainwater so they are also at risk 
from changing weather patterns due to climate change.  The quality of groundwater is at risk 
from nitrate pollution, particularly within the vicinity of Thorne and H atfield Moors.  Doncaster 
has a number of source protection zones, including at Hatfield, Dunscroft, Edenthorpe, Cantley, 
Rossington, Bessacarr and Austerfield, where development might cause pollution or undermine 
ground water sources, such as wells and sp rings.   In these areas, proposals will only be allowed 
where they can demonstrate that any pollution risks can be mitigated during its construction and 
operation.  The Environment Agency will generally refuse new abstraction licenses in these 
areas.  
  
14.30.  In this context, it is important that new development does not impact on water quantity or harm 
water quality within the aquifers, either from increased abstraction or increased pollution.  The 
Council  will work closely  with the Environment Agency to ensure th at development does not 
pose an unacceptable risk to water quality and quantity and will generally support proposals that 
result in an improvement of water quality and the capacity of surface waters to support wildlife.  
  
14.31.  The European Water Framework Direc tive seeks to improve the ecological status of all water 
bodies and protect drinking water sources and nature conservation sites (Habitats Directive 
Sites and Sites of Specific Scientific Interest).  Where development would indirectly or directly 
affects t he quality of a water body in a river basin management plan, applicants will be expected 
to explain how they propose to mitigate these impacts.  In all cases, the information should be 
proportionate to the nature and scale of the proposed development and t he level of concern 
about water quality.  Where a proposal is likely to have a significant adverse impact on water 
quality a more detailed assessment will be required as part of the environmental statement.  
 
14.32.  Proposals which may affect the integrity of the internationally designated Thorne and Hatfield 
Moors will be expected to demonstrate that they will have no significant adverse impact on 
water quality, hydrology and nature conservation interests.  The onus will be on the applicant or 
developer  to screen potential impacts, provide appropriate mitigation measures and deliver 
biodiversity gain.  
  
167   [go to Contents ] 
  14.33.  In the face of climate change there is also a need to store flood water within the landscape to 
irrigate farmland during dry summers and ensure that wetland habitats  do not dry out .  This will 
bring opportunities to restore or create wetland habitat and reduce the risk of flooding, which 
may also contribute to the delivery of Policies 26 and 30. 
 
 
 
 
 
Mine rals Policy  
14.34.  Minerals , such as sand and gravel, limestone and clay are essential to meeting society’s needs 
for economic growth and development.  Others, such as gas and oil, are important in helping  
meet our needs for energy.  Planning for minerals have a number of specialist characteristics 
not found in other sorts of development .  For example:  
 
 they can only be worked where they are found occurring naturally, which leads to a limited 
number of locations where it is both economically viable and environment ally acceptable 
for extraction;  
 working minerals is a temporary land -use, although it can take place over a very long 
period of time;  
 working minerals may have adverse effects but most can be mitigated;  
 extraction of minerals is a continuous process of de velopment ; therefore there is a 
requirement for routine monitoring, and if necessary, enforcement to ensure conditions 
that mitigate negative impacts are complied with; and  
 at the end of extraction the surface land should be restored to a suitable benefici al after -
use. 
 
14.35.  Two principal aggregate minerals are currently extracted in Doncaster : limestone ; and sand and 
gravel ; with sharp sand and gravel becoming much more limited in occurrence due to depletion 
of resources.  Doncaster is also underlain by signifi cant deep coal reserves, although this is not 
worked at present.  Clay is sometimes worked alongside the extraction of sand and gravel 
resources and gas is stored underground in former hydrocarbon reservoirs at Hatfield and 
Trumfleet. Industrial limestone is also extracted in the area.  
 
14.36.  The Local Plan will indicate specific areas where existing and future mineral extraction will take 
place.  It will identify ‘areas of search’ and ‘safeguarding areas’ using information sourced from 
local operators and the Br itish Geological Survey.  With limited proposals coming forward ‘areas 
of search’ for sand and gravel will guide industry toward what the Council consider s the best 
options for potentially working and winning the mineral.  
 
14.37.  As part of the evidence base, th e Council commissioned the British Geological Survey to 
produce a Geodiversity Assessment , and Local Aggregates Assessments  are produced 
annually, providing information on monitoring, supply and demand for aggregate minerals.  
Additional evidence on site selection, areas of search , mineral safeguarding and aggregate 
forecasting has also been produced and can be found on the Council’s website (Local Plan 
Evidence Base) . 
 
14.38.  All proposals for mineral development should accord  with legislation, national policy and the 
Local  Plan.  
 
   
168   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 61: Providing for and Sa feguarding Mineral Resources (Strategic Policy)  
 
The extraction and production of aggregate, industrial, building stone and energy minerals that contribute 
to infrastructure and construction projects will be supported through the following principles : 
 
A) The Council  will aim to plan for a steady,  adequate, efficiently and sustainably sourced minerals 
during the plan period by:  
 
1. encouraging the use of suitable secondary and recycled material in the first instance,  
  minimising the need for primary extraction;  
2. providing for sufficient industrial and energy minerals that balance both the economic and  
  environmental benefits ; 
3. contributing toward local provision by maintaining , where possible, a landbank of  
  permitted reserves for at least seven years for sand an d gravel and , with Rotherham  
  Council,  at least ten years for aggregate limestone;  
4. monitoring and reviewing the permitted reserves of sand and gravel, and aggregate  
  limestone and producing an annual aggregate assessment;  
5. requiring proposals for sand and  gravel to demonstrate that the mineral resource includes  
  at least 20% sharp sand and gravel;  
6. identifying on the Policies Map existing mineral sites with extant permission (see Table 16 
  below), new mineral propos als (preferred areas (see Table 17 below)) and ‘Areas of  
  Search’ (see Table 18 below ) (see also Policy 62); 
7. identifying on the Policies Map Minerals Safeguarding Areas;  
8. identifying on the Policies Map and safeguarding minerals transportation, handling and  
  processing inf rastructure from non -minerals development during and beyond the plan  
  period which may adversely impact on the operation of t he site in accordance with NPPF  
  paragraph 182  (Table 19). 
 
B) Proposals for non -mineral development within Mineral Safeguarding Areas  (see Table 21), and 
the 250m buffer zone, will be supported where  it can be demonstrated that : 
 
1. consideration has been given to the long term economic value of the mineral ; or 
2. non-mineral development can take place without preventing the economically viable  
  mineral resource from being extracted i n the future ; or 
3. the proposal can feasibly incorporate the prior extraction of any minerals of economic  
  value in an environmentally acceptable way ; or 
4. the need for the development outweighs the need to safeguard the area for future  
  minerals extraction ; or 
5. the development is permitted, minor or temporary in nature (see safeguarding exemptions  
  in Table 20). 
 
C) Development proposals within the sand and gravel Safeguarding Area and Airport Policy Area 
which comply wi th Policy 6 (Doncaster Sheffield Airport and Business Park), are exempt from 
Part B of this Policy for the duration of the Local Plan . 
 
Explanation  
14.39.  Doncaster  produce s South Yorkshire’s aggregate, industry and energy minerals and contributes 
toward s meeting the local, regional and national demand for resources to support infrastructure 
and construction projects.  The provision of adequate mineral resources is one of the Council’s 
strategic priorities.  National planning policy identifies  how important minerals are to the local 
economy and advocates the need for sustainable mineral extraction.  The Council is required to 
provide for an adequate and steady supply of construction aggregate for industry by maintaining 
a landbank of mineral planning permissions equating to seven years for sand and gravel and 
ten years for crushed rock (limestone).  National planning policy also advocates promoting the 
use of secondary and recycled aggregates, the provision of a steady supply of all mi nerals, and  
169   [go to Contents ] 
  the allocation of sufficient land to meet our sub -regional mineral share.  
 
14.40.  The challenge is to ensure our minerals are worked efficiently and sustainably whilst 
encourag ing the use of suitable secondary aggregates and minerals to minimis e the n eed for 
primary extraction.  The environmental impacts associated with mineral extraction  should be 
minimised whilst ensur ing the industry can still contribute toward new development, the local 
economy and employment  provision . Proposals which may damage t he integrity of Thorne Moor 
SAC, Hatfield Moor SAC or Thorne and Hatfield Moors SPA will not be supported  in line with 
Policy 30. 
 
14.41.  Reliance on primary aggregate will be reduced by requ iring development at the demolition 
phase to contribute toward s recycling on site material and incorporat ing recycled material such 
as ‘construction demolition waste’ or secondary minerals  at the construction phase . 
Complementary  policies relating to the r euse and recycling of demolition and construction waste 
can be found in the ‘ Barnsley, Doncaster & Rotherham Joint Waste Plan ’. 
 
14.42.  The Government als o acknowledges the need to reduce the reliance on imported fossil fuels 
and explore for on -shore gas and oil from conventional and unconventional sources.  Our 
approach to supporting the need for industrial and energy minerals will have regard to both the 
local economy and environment.  
 
14.43.  The policy implements a planned tiered approach to the exploration and extraction of aggregate 
minerals by identifying existing sites, allocated site extensions  (‘preferred areas ’), ‘areas of 
search ’ and ‘safeguarded areas ’.  Policy 62 provides the policy detail for delivering sharp sand 
and gravel proposals within ‘preferred areas’, ‘areas of search’ and other locations.  
 
14.44.  With regard to aggregate , the amount of extraction plan ned for is inform ed by the ‘Yorkshire and 
Humber Aggregate  Working Party (Y&HAWP) Annual Monitoring Report ’ and the Doncaster 
and Rotherham  ‘Local Aggregates Assessment ’ (LAA) which monitors  supply and demand 
within the Borough and provides evidence for the calculation of landbanks .  Local requirement is 
also evidenced further throug h the ‘Forecasting the Demand for Aggregates’ evidence base 
paper . 
 
14.45.  Doncaster produces and exports the aggregate minerals to other authorities within the South 
and West Yorkshire sub -regions and will continue to do so, should conditions allow. The 
aggregat e forecasting evidence base paper identifies South Yorkshire will require approximately 
3.7Mt of combined sand, gravel and crushed rock aggregate annually to meet with combined 
Local Plan proposals.  This is approximately 27% more than previous annual cons umption. 
Doncaster also exports aggregate to the West Yorkshire market, which will require 
approximately 4.4Mt per annum to meet Local Plan proposals.   Table 15 identifies what 
Doncaster can plan for to contribute to ward these requirements, South and West Yorkshire will 
be reliant on imports from other areas, such as Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, East Riding and 
North Yorkshire, as well as Doncaster to meet aggregate needs for Local Plan proposals.  
 
14.46.  Table 15 identifies the  mineral requirements  Doncaster can supply  during  the Local P lan period 
using the 2018 LAA (and 2017  data).  The table shows a reserve of 5.6Mt (at 2017), plus 
additional sand and gravel provision from the Local Plan allocations (see Table 17).

Notes:  
1. The reserve at 2017 (column B) is taken  from the 201 8 LAA, which reports on minerals monitoring for the 
year 201 7. 
2. The landbank of permissions at 2017 (column D)  is taken from the 201 8 LAA.  
3. The ‘Local Provision’ (column F)  for the plan period is based on ten year average sales (as required by 
national planning policy and identified in the 201 8 LAA) multiplied by the remaining life of the Plan (in this 
case 1 8 years) . 
4. Note - figures are also given based on three year annual sales for comparison (required for consideration by 
national policy to gauge short term fluctuations) . 
5. Mt = Million tonnes.  
 
Sand and Gravel  
14.47.  Figures from the 2018 LAA (see Table 15 above) indicates that the Council may not be able  
mainta in a supply of sand and gravel to meet our provision up to the end of the plan period.  
Based on 10 year  average  extraction levels ( of 0.31Mt), the reserve  of 5.6Mt and the  landbank 
of permissions equates  to 18 years  in 2017 .  Should extraction levels cont inue at three year 
average sales (of 0.5Mt), the 5.6Mt reserve will last 11.2 years.  Two allocations in the Local 
Plan (see Table 17) will provide for an additional 1.9Mt of sand and gravel during the plan 
period.  The allocations will provide an additional six years of supply, based on ten year average  
171   [go to Contents ] 
  sales or 3.8 years supply based on three year average sales.  Doncaster’s local provision will 
equate to 0.42Mt of sharp sand and gravel during the plan period in acc ordance with the figures 
in Table 15.  Given  only a small number of sand and gravel submissions  were r eceived  for the 
Local Plan  and subsequent limited suitable allocation s have been proposed,  it is still essential 
that ‘Areas of Search’ are accounted for in the  Local Plan and considered  as viable options by 
operators .  Please note, t he LAA also identifies minerals from quarries in north Nottinghamshire, 
Lincolnshire and the East Riding  which also provide sand and gra vel to support development in 
Doncaster  and the wider South Yorkshire region . 
 
14.48.  Previous monitoring reports and aggregate assessments identify that sharp sand and gravel 
essential for concreting products is a declining resource in our area  and will become 
increasingly difficult to find in the future .  The Aggregate Minerals Survey  collects monitoring 
figures as part of a four yearly survey ; this Survey co nfirms that in 2009 84% of the sand and 
gravel landbank was made up of soft sand , which has a small but on -going demand .  Paragraph 
3.9 of the 2014 Annual Monitoring Report also confirms that that the reserves of sand and 
gravel in South Yo rkshire are almost exclusively made up of soft sand deposits.   The Y&HAWP 
annual monitoring reports also confirm that only a small proportion of the remaining permitted 
reserve in Doncaster is sharp sand suitable for use as concreting aggregate .  Any new  
proposals  for sand and gravel within areas of search should therefore demonstrate that the 
mineral resource includes at least 20% sharp sand and gravel to support local development.  
Recent historic applications demonstrate that sites are extracting an aver age of approximately 
22% sharp sand and gravel ; therefore  the target of 20% is considered realistic as it takes 
account of local circumstances and offers some flexibility.   Applications outside areas of search 
that can demonstrate a high yield of sharp san d and gravel will also be considered favourably, 
subject to the consideration of other planning policies and constraints within the Local Plan.  
Additional applications for mineral development, not identified in the plan will be considered 
against the need  for the mineral, taking account of the current landbank, economic 
considerations, strategic projects, and localised housing requirement and build out rates.  
 
Limestone  
14.49.  The 2018 LAA identifies  the limestone apportionment for Doncaster  is healthy  with a 51.7 Mt 
reserve and a 30 year landbank  (based on ten year average sales), or 22 years provision based 
on three year average sales.  Based on historic extraction figures, Doncaster’s Local Provision 
will equate to 2Mt of crushed rock during the plan period .  The Council acknowledges there may 
be an issue with the number of working quarries during the plan period with regard to 
maintaining competition.   However , there are quarries in  North Yorkshire,  Wakefield and 
Derbyshire that can and do provide minerals and competition.  A joint  position statement 
betwee n Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council , 
Nottinghamshire County Council and Derbyshire County Council  identifies that Derbyshire has a 
80 year landbank and exports 75% of its production to other areas and could , if necessary , 
contribute toward supplying aggregate mineral to meet the development requirements identified 
in the Doncaster Local Plan.  When considering planning applications the Council  will however  
take into account the number of sites making up the landbank to ensure reasonable competition 
is maintained.  
 
14.50.  The mineral sites shown in Table 16 below have extant permissions and contribute toward s the 
aggregate landbank .  The new mineral allocations (preferred areas) listed in Table 17 are 
Doncaster’s  best options for increasing  the landbank  of permissions during the plan period . The 
‘preferred areas’ will potentially provide 1.9Mt of s and and gravel increasing the land bank by 6 
years based on ten year average extraction rates of 0.33Mt, or 3.8 years based on the three 
year average extraction rate of 0.5Mt.

Areas of Search   
14.51.  The Areas of Search (see Table 18) have been selected as being those that are most likely to 
produc e the required quantity and quality of aggregate mineral with the least impact on local 
amenity and the environment.  The Y&HAWP  Annual  Monitoring Report and our L ocal 
Aggregate Assessment  identifies that good quality sharp sand and gravel deposits are 
increasingly in short supply , not only in Doncaster but also around the region.  The Council 
therefore recognise s the need to identify areas of land where aggregate minerals are likely to be 
available and extraction may be acceptable during the plan period.  The allocated ‘Areas of 
Search’ are the most suitable and sustainable options for the aggregate industry to explore for, 
and possibly win and work , minerals during the life of the plan.  These areas will assist the 
extractive industry by guiding the develo pment of mineral resources toward what the Council  
consider s our best options for exploration.  Applicants are therefore encouraged to look at these 
areas first  to help address the  shortfall in the required amount of sharp sand and gravel required 
to meet the sub-regional apportionment.  Any resulting applications contribut ing toward sharp 
sand and gravel reserves will be dealt with positively in accordance with current policy and 
legislation.  Applications for mineral extraction outside these areas will be  required to provide 
evidence on the quality and quantity of material to be extracted, economic  need for the product 
and show how the material will contribute toward known sharp sand and gravel shortfalls.   
Applications with innovative approaches to the ma nufacture of sharp sand using recycled 
material and soft sand will also be favourably received.   It will be assumed the applicant has 
made every effort to secure mineral and surface rights prior to submission of a proposal.  All  
173   [go to Contents ] 
  new sites in ‘Areas of Sear ch’ will be required to submit a valid application for mineral extraction 
and any associated development.

Industrial Minerals and Building Stone  
14.52.  The Council will ensure a steady and adequate supply of industrial minerals by supporting 
applications that contribute to the local and national economy, but they must still address and 
mitigate all identified local impacts.  The Council will also support small scale building stone 
extraction as part of larger aggregate quarries, or relic quarrie s especially where the material is 
required to support local or national heritage projects.  
 
Safeguarded Minerals Transportation, Handling and Processing Infrastructure  
14.53.  The Local Plan  is required to safeguard existing or potential infrastructure support fa cilities used 
for transport, storage, handling and processing of minerals.  There is currently one working 
wharf in Doncaster which is used on an ad -hoc basis for the transport of magnesian limestone.  
This wharf is located on the River Don at Cadeby Quarr y.  Government policy also states that 
consideration should be given to sites which are needed for the processing and re -distribution of 
aggregate.  Sites (with extant permission) have therefore been identified on the Policies  Map.   
These sites will be saf eguarded from other forms of development that may lead to pressure to 
impose unreasonable restrictions on site operations in line with the ‘agent of change principle’ 
(currently set out in NPPF paragraph 182 ).  Consideration will be given as  to whether a s ite still 
functions as intended and alternative uses may be considered if it outweighs the existing 
benefits and there is no reasonable prospect of the site being used for ancillary minerals 
infrastructure in the foreseeable future.

Mineral  Safeguarding Areas  
14.54.  Mineral Safeguarding Areas (see Table 21) are areas of known  mineral resources that are 
considered to be of sufficient economic or conservation value to warrant protection b eyond the 
plan period.  The purpose of the Mineral Safeguarding Areas is to protect potentially important 
known mineral deposits from sterilisation by non -mineral surface development.  Development 
proposals for mineral extraction, housing and employment al located within the Local Plan are 
considered to be of economic and social importance in line with the objectives of the NPPF and 
have therefore been removed from the Mineral Safeguarding Area to deliver the immediate 
development needs of the Local Plan.  The Council acknowledge s it is still an important  
requirement through national planning policy to consider and safeguard the remaining minerals 
that are an important national, regional and local resource.   These minerals have a fundamental 
role in underpinn ing the local economy by providing aggregate for construction, dimension 
stone for prestige buildings and minerals for industry.  Mineral resources are finite; therefore it is 
essential that a sustainable approach is used to ensure that there is sufficient  supply in the 
future.  
 
14.55.  The entire Borough is underlain by minerals of varying economic value.  Doncaster has 
considerable mineral resources within the Magnesian Limestone ridge  – between Barnsdale Bar 
in the north and Stainton in the south.  The east of D oncaster , between Thorne and Bawtry , sits 
on the Sherwood sandstone bedrock and contains deposits of both alluvial and post-glacial 
sands and gravels as well as soft sand.  Shallow coal is found in the western part of the 
Borough near Mexborough.  
  
175   [go to Contents ] 
  14.56.  Mineral Safeguarding Areas (and the 250m  buffer zones  where relevant ) are identified to 
prevent the sterilisation of shallow coal, crushed rock aggregate, sand and gravel and industrial 
limestone resources during and beyond the plan period.  They  are also identifi ed under some 
developed / sterilised areas to allow for the consideration of prior extraction of mineral should 
this be appropriate  as part of the redevelopment scheme .  Doncaster’s Mineral Safeguarding 
Areas have been developed using an agreed methodology  which assesses the best available 
geological and mineral resource information against a variety of issues and constraints modified 
from our sustainability appraisal criteria. Within these safeguarded areas non -mineral 
development proposals will be require d to comply with Policy 61 Part B points  1 to 5 by 
providing a geological report / mineral survey identifying the extent and quality of the mineral 
and primarily consi der realistic opportunities for mineral extraction prior to development.   
Proposals for temporary, permitted or minor development (see below ), and aviation related 
development within the airport operational area, are not required  to consider the impact of 
mineral sterilisation .

 householder applications within the curtilage of a property  
 advertisement applications

 minor works such as fences, bus shelters, walls, gates and access  
 amendments to current permissions  
 changes of use  
 listed building consent  
 applications for trees or hedgerow removal  
 prior notification for telecommunications, forestry, agriculture and demolition  
 certificates of lawfulness of existing development and  
 certificate of lawfulness of proposed use development  
 
14.57.  Development proposals in urban Mineral Safeguarding Areas should  always assess the viability 
of pre -development pre -extraction.  A good example is Mexborough , a Main Town that sits on 
safeguarded shallow coal field.  Development proposals may find it financially beneficial to pre -
extract shallow coal as part of ground preparation and civil engineering works.  Importantly, 
however projects proposing incidental extraction should always include interim reclamation 
proposals in case the primary development is delayed or fails to be delivered.  
 
14.58.  Although there is no presumpt ion in favour of extraction of coal the Local Plan designate s a 
safeguarding area around the shallow coal reserves to the west of the Borough in line with 
national guidance.  
 
Industrial Minerals Safeguarded Area  
14.59.  The ‘British Geological Survey’ places consi derable economic importance on industrial dolomite 
due to its restricted distribution  – with working quarries located in Durham, South Yorkshire 
(Doncaster) and Derbyshire.  The British Geological Survey regard  ‘Permian dolomites as the 
main source of dolo mite in the UK and are a resource of national and regional importance .  
Ensuring supply during and beyond the plan period is therefore of strategic importance’.   As a 
mineral planning authority (in line with national policy) the Council  will plan for indus trial 
minerals by cooperating with other authorities to ensure a steady and adequate provision, 
support safeguarding / stockpiling important locally sourced minerals and encourage investment 
in existing plant equipment by allowing for the maintenance of re serves to support appropriate  
176   [go to Contents ] 
  investment.  An ‘Industrial Mineral’ ‘area of search’  (see Table 18) and safeguarding area  (see 
Table 21) is identified on the area of land to wes t of Warmsworth Quarry.  
 
Building Stone Safeguarded Area  
14.60.  National planning policy requires us to consider small scale building and roofing stone sources, 
including their need for the repair of heritage assets.  In Doncaster building stone (dimension 
stone)  is produced as a by -product of the aggregate industry, with one site producing both 
dimension stone and aggregate and another site solely producing dimension stone, but with 
extant permission for aggregate.  The production of hand -worked quality building stone is 
increasingly rare ; therefore dormant / disused quarries (with extant permission) have been 
identified and safeguarded on the Policies  Map.  Importantly these sites have historically 
produced material for use in prestige and restoration projects.   Where appropriate the Council  
will support re -opening of historic building stone quarries that are required to facilitate the 
conservation of a heritage asset, subject to other policy considerations.

14.61.  The policy will ensure that minerals are considered and safeguarded from inappropriate 
development beyond th e plan period.  There is no presumption that the extraction of minerals in 
mineral safeguarding areas is, or will be, environmentally acceptable, now or in the near future, 
but that a resource is accounted for during and beyond the plan period.  Applicatio ns for mineral 
extraction within the Mineral Safeguarding Area will be required to provide evidence justifying 
the exceptional economic, environmental and social benefits of the proposal.  Non -mineral 
development allocations, proposals and regeneration pro jects in urban areas with known 
mineral resources will be required to consider realistic opportunities for extraction prior to 
development.  
 
14.62.  Within the shallow coal mineral safeguarding area proposals for coal washing schemes, or prior 
extraction of shallo w coal reserves as part of other development proposals, will be supported in 
line with national policy.

Policy 62: Minerals Development Proposals, Borrow Pits and Incident al Extraction  
 
Proposals for mineral development including aggregate extraction, underground mining and hydrocarbon 
exploration, appraisal and development (including production) will be supported where all impacts are 
addressed and appropriately mitigated  in accordance with policies in the Local Plan, national policy and 
planning practice guidance29.  
 
To manage the supply and delivery of sand and gravel, proposals within ‘preferred areas’ and ‘areas of 
search’ will be considered positively subject to meeting all the relevant mitigation requirements of this 
policy and proving a significant sharp sand and gravel resource in line with Policy 61 A Part 5.  All other 
proposals for sand and gravel extraction will be determined on their merits including the provision of 
information on the quality and quantity of material to be extracted and economic need for the product.  
 
Incidental mineral extraction and borrow pits will be suppo rted where  it can be demonstrated that : 
 
A) the use of reclaimed, recycled or waste material is considered in the first instance and is not 
practical or suitable  and the use of the mineral would not constitute an inappropriate use of high 
quality material ; 
 
B) the borrow pit  is short term and will ultimately  provide either a clear amenity, environmental or 
local economic benefit;  
 
C) the borrow pit is geographically well related  to the project so the mineral can be transported with 
minimal use of the public highway ; 
 
D) the borrow pit it restored to an approved restoration scheme within project timescale and inert 
waste arisings extracted from the construction project are utilised in restoration works ; and,  
 
E) incidental extraction will only be supported where mineral is  extracted consistent with the 
purpose of development and there is a proven need for the mineral . 
 
Explanation  
14.63.  As minerals development is complex it is recommend ed applicants seek advice from the 
planning authority prior to submitting an application .  ‘A Good Practice Guide for Developers 
and Agents’30 is available to help navigate the development management process.  All 
applications for mineral extraction wil l be assessed on their merits, including assessing whether 
there is a need for the mineral.  Pre-application discussion s will help  identify  if the proposal is 
acceptable  in principle , ensure  policy compliance, identify what is required as part of a scheme 
of working and help identify if an Environmental Assessment is required.   Applicants should 
refer to all the requirements in the online planning practice guidance notes, especially the ones 
relating to assessing environmental impacts from minerals extraction , and adequately mitigate 
all the impacts identified.  It should be noted there are areas in Doncaster where minerals 
extraction, quarryin g, and oil and gas exploitation may not be permitted by the  Environment 
Agency (EA)  - applicants should contact the EA in parallel with a submitted planning application  
to ensure the appropriate licenses and permits are in place . 
 
14.64.  The numerous policies wit hin the Local Plan, associated national policy and planning practice 
guidance , will ensure minerals development takes account of the location, siting and design of 
surface development and provide for a high degree of protection for the environment and loca l 
communities.   Proposals which may damage the integrity of Thorne Moor SAC, Hatfield Moor 
SAC or Thorne and Hatfield Moors SPA will not be supported  in line with Policy 30.

30 https://www.doncaster.gov.uk/serv ices/planning/standard -minerals -application -form   
179   [go to Contents ] 
  14.65.  Borrow p its are temporary mineral workings located adjacent to a major construction site and 
used to supply a specific project.  They can be an appropriate way of providing locally sourced 
material for major construction projects without the need for long distance  transportation.  
However, other sources of bulk fill material , such as construction and demolition waste or 
colliery spoil , should always be considered in the first instance.  
 
14.66.  Incidental mineral extraction involves removal of mineral as a secondary part o f ‘Non -mineral’ 
development.  Incidental extraction promotes the sustainable use of minerals that may 
otherwise be lost or sterilised.  Proposals for borrow pits and incidental extraction should aim to 
use the material in a sustainable manner and extract t he minimum amount of mineral consistent 
with the nature of development.  Proposals for borrow pits or incidental mineral extraction will 
generally be supported  subject to accordance  with other  relevant  Local Plan policies.  
 
 
Policy 63: Reclama tion of Mineral Sites (Restoration and After care) 
 
Proposals for mineral extraction will be supported where they include a phased sequence of extraction, 
restoration, reclamation, and implementation of the planned aftercare, specifically benefitting climat e 
change mitigation, biodiversity, our green infrastructure network, informal recreation, local agriculture 
land and/or geodiversity.  
 
Mineral extraction sites within biodiversity opportunity areas will be expected to direct reclamation 
towards the UK Bio diversity Action Plan priority habitats indicated in Policy 29 as a priority for that area.  
 
Proposals will need to demonstrate that:  
 
A) the surrounding landform and landscape impacts are taken into account and appropriately 
mitigated;  
 
B) the requirements for the reinstatement of the lost or damaged habitat / landscape type, or 
provision of new habitat types have been fully considered;  
 
C) an appropriate aftercare period is in place in order to ensure successful restoration;  
 
D) consid eration has been given to long term after -use of the site when designing the restoration 
proposals;  
 
E) are in place to ensure that the restoration is technically and economically feasible, and can be 
successfully completed; and  
 
F) feasible geological features  are retained for scientific study and local appreciation.  
 
Explanation  
14.67.  The policy is designed to ensure restoration proposals maintain or enhance the quality of the 
land providing long term community and environmental benefit  and achieve a net gain in 
biodiversity in line with Policies 29 and 30.  Minerals operators should also ensure the land is 
reclaimed at the earliest opportunity.  
 
14.68.  Restoration and aftercare proposals should take into accou nt the phases of working and long 
term after use  of the site in order to determine the best approach  to maintain or enhance the 
long term quality of the land and  surrounding lands cape .  The restored land should provide for a 
long term living asset.  Reclam ation provides an ideal opportunity to create or enhance sites for 
nature  by delivering UK BAP priority habitats and re -establishing  ecological networks and  locally 
important and nationally protected species .  National planning policy stipulates that resto ration 
proposals should be carried out to a high environmental standard and also ensures the 
provision of new habitats contributes towards an integrated biodiversity network.   Alternative 
restoration proposals that conform to other Local Plan policy design ations and the surrounding  
180   [go to Contents ] 
  landscape will be considered on their merits .  Minerals restoration proposals involving water 
bodies within the 13km bird strike hazard area will be subject to consultation with the Airport in 
line with Policy 6. 
 
14.69.  The aftercare scheme should cover the appropriate steps required to ensure successful 
restoration for the determined period.  The scheme will need to be agreed with the Council and 
include:  
 
 a map identifying all the areas subject to afterc are management.  
 a strategy of commitments (including soils and vegetation establishment and 
management, secondary treatments, drainage, irrigation and watering) for the determined 
period . 
 
14.70.  Although the guidance to national policy stipulates the requiremen t for the provision of an 
outline strategy of commitments for a five year aftercare period , and a detailed programme for 
the forthcoming year, there may be some circumstances where specialised habitats may require 
longer periods to become established.  Where necessary t he Council will require  an additional 
aftercare period  secured by a planning obligation rather than a condition.  It may also therefore 
benefit the mineral company to find partners from local wildlife trusts or organisations to ensure 
the lon g term success of the restoration.  
 
 
Policy 64: Providing for Energy Minerals31 (On-Shore Gas  and Oil (Hydrocarbons))  
 
‘Petroleum Exploration and Development Licence’ (PEDL) areas and hydrocarbon sites are identified on 
the Policies Map for inf ormation.  
 
Applications for the exploration , appraisal  and development (including production) of on -shore gas and 
oil in licenced areas will be determined in line with National Policy, Guidance and relevant policies within 
the Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
14.71.  In line with national guidance ‘Petroleum Exploration and Development Licence s’ and permitted 
hydrocarbon sites will be shown on the Policies  Map for information.  
 
14.72.  The Government awards PEDLs to operators to give exclusive access to operators to ‘search, 
bore for and get’ oil and gas resources which are owned by the Crown.  The award of the 
licence is to help ensure maximum use of a natural resource.   Operators are still required to get 
landowner consent, planning permission and other regulatory consents as ne cessary.   The 
online ‘Onshore Oil and Gas Activity ’ interactive map provides information on licence 
references, ownership, start date, sta tus, size, and licence end date . 
 
14.73.  National planning policy states that both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons (gas 
and oil) are minerals of national and local importance and that Minerals Plans (i.e. the Local 
Plan) should include policies for t heir extraction.  This includes applications for both 
conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons32.  Applications for hydrocarbon exploration, 
appraisal or production , will only be acceptable  in areas where the Oil and Gas Authority33 have 
issued a (PEDL) licence under the Petroleum Act 1998 ( a Petroleum Licence).   Hydrocarbon 
applications will be determined in line with national policy, planning practice guidance and 
relevant policies in this plan.  Applicants are encouraged to engage with the  planning aut hority 
and local community at the earliest opportunity  to ensure a ll potential impacts are addressed 
and mitigated at each separate planning application stage.   Applications which include (or may

Impact Assessment (EIA).   Proposals which may damage the integrity of Thorne Moor SAC, 
Hatfield Moor SAC or Thorne and Hatfield Moors SPA will not be supported  in line with Policy 
30. 
 
14.74.  When determining application s the Council  will consult and work with all the relevant key 
regulators and organisations . 
 
14.75.  Applications for underground  gas storage and carbon storage will also be considered against 
national  policy and guidance , and relevant policies within the Local Plan.  
 
Peat and other minerals  
14.76.  Peat is an economically important mineral resource and Thorne and Hatfield Moors are the 
largest lowland peat resources in the country.  These deposits , however, oc cur within 
internationally designated conservation areas where,  in line with national guidance , peat 
extraction (other than as part of on-site restoration) will not be supported.  However, where peat 
is found in areas outside the moors, such as the land to  the north of the West Moor link road at 
junction 4 of the M18, pre -development extraction may be considered as part of a development, 
re-development / regeneration project.  
 
14.77.  Applications for the extraction of other minerals (for example , coal and clay) will be considered 
on their merits in line with national policy, guidance, relevant policies within this Plan and the 
need for the mineral.

  Chapter 15: Implementation and Monitoring   
 
Introduction  
15.1.  National planning policy highlights that pursuing sus tainable development requires careful 
attention to viability and costs in plan -making and decision -taking.  In preparing the Local Plan 
care has been taken to ensure it is deliverable.  This chapter sets out the Local Plan’s  
approach to seeking developer contributions required to ensure mitigation of harm to make 
otherwise unacceptable development acceptable in planning terms.  Policy is also presented to 
stress that the sites and the scale of development identified in the Plan should not be subject to 
such a scale of obligations and policy requirements that their ability to be developed viably is 
threatened.  
 
15.2.  Review and monitoring are key aspects of the planning system with emphasis on delivering  
sustainable development and sustainable communities.  They are crucial to the successful 
delivery of  the vision and strategic objectives set out for the Local Plan.  Monitoring and 
reviewing proposals set out in the Local Plan will indicate what impact the policies are having in 
respect of national, regional and l ocal policy targets and other specific targets set out in the 
Local Plan.  They will also indicate whether policies need adjusting or replacing because they 
are not working as intended, or whether they need to be changed in the light of changes to 
national  or regional policy.  
 
 
Policy 65: Developer Contributions  (Strategic Policy)  
 
It is important that new proposals are planned in step with the necessary supporting infrastructure, and 
can make appropriate contributions towards new infrastructur e as required, in order to deliver 
sustainable development.  However, developments should not be subject to such a scale of developer 
contributions or policy requirements that development viability is put at risk.  To help ensure this balance 
is achieved, proposals will be expected to accord with the following:  
 
A) Where necessary, directly related to the development, and fair and reasonable in scale and 
kind, developer contributions will be sought to mitigate the impacts of development through:  
 
1. direct provis ion on site (e.g. for on -site affordable housing, education facilities, biodiversity  
  net gain, open space, or sustainable drainage schemes);  
2. provision off site, to ensure the development can be delivered in line with other policy  
  objectives, and to a s afe and satisfactory standard (such as off -site affordable housing,  
  education facilities, biodiversity net gain, flood mitigation, or highways improvements);  
3. contributions towards softer interventions to ensure the benefits of the development are  
  maxim ised by local communities (such as skills and training programmes including local  
  labour agreements); and  
4. pooled contributions for schemes necessitated as a result of the cumulative impact of a  
  number of developments.  
 
B) Where  infrastructure is to be pro vided either on or off site, provision for its long -term 
maintenance will be required (which may include its adoption either by the Council or a third 
party, subject to the provision of appropriate maintenance funding from the developer).  
 
C) To address devel oper requirements as a whole, where development proposals on a large 
composite or naturally defined area are sub divided into multiple applications (or phases) over 
time, planning applications which form part of a more substantial proposed development, on the 
same or adjoining land will be treated as one application for the whole development.  
 
   
184   [go to Contents ] 
  Explanation  
15.3.  Developer contributions  (sometimes referred to as ‘planning obligations’) assist in mitigating the 
impact of unacceptable development to make it accepta ble in planning terms.  It is important 
that developments adequately deal with the resultant impact on our physical, social and green 
infrastructure.  Developers may be asked to provide contributions for infrastructure in several 
ways. This may be by way o f the Community Infrastructure Levy ( although not being progressed 
by the Council at the time of Plan adoption ) and /or planning obligations in the form of Section 
106 agreements and section 278 highway agreements.  Developers  will also have to comply 
with any conditions attached to their planning permission.  
 
15.4.  Should the Council choose to implement the Community Infrastructure Levy in the future, then 
the approach to developer contributions towards site specific mitigation, and more general 
infrastructure fu nding, will need to be clarified through the annual Infrastructure Funding 
Statement  that the Council is required to publish .  Section 106 planning obligations will remain  
in force for regulating development, on -site mitigation, delivering affordable housi ng and 
mitigating the impacts of development that does not fa ll into the Levy .  They cannot be used for 
general contributions to infrastructure funding; such an approach would require the introduction 
of the Levy.  
 
15.5.  Given developer contributions under Secti on 106 are negotiated based on certain site size 
thresholds, for example affordable housing contributions are normally sought from residential 
schemes of 15+ units, it is important to safeguard against larger sites being split into smaller 
phases and there fore below a certain contribution requirement as an attempt to circumnavigate 
the policy. This also applies to contributions for public open space and education.  
 
15.6.  Section 278 Agreements, under the Highways Act 1980, are an agreement for highway works to 
be delivered by the developer respective of the highways and transport works needed as a 
result of the development.  The management and payment for such projects is either by the 
developer contracting the Council or private works operator, provided that suit able permission 
and inspections are sought and paid for by the developer and provided by the Council .  Section 
278 works will continue to play an important role in the delivery of development highways 
infrastructure, particularly for single scheme and fina ncer projects.  
 
15.7.  Mechanisms must be provided for appropriate highway maintenance for an agreed time period 
after the development has been implemented, to include traffic signal and highway funding 
which may be via developer contributions, appropriate to the  scale and location of the 
development.  Likewise, other policies in the Local Plan require provision of Public Open Space 
or Sustainable Drainage Systems  where their long term maintenance will need to be managed.  
 
 
Policy 66: Development Viab ility (Strategic Policy)  
 
Where the applicant can demonstrate that particular circumstances justify the need for a Viability 
Appraisal, t he Council will take a pragmatic and flexible approach to planning obligations and consider 
their genuine impact on via bility of development proposals on an independent and case by case basis , at 
the applicant’s expense , and in line with the following principles : 
 
A) Development which is unable to make the full contribution at the point at which the application is 
submitted m ay be supported where:  
 
1. a robust and fit for purpose viability assessment shows that the full contribution would  
   make the development unviable;  
2. the possibilities for reduced, deferred or phased contributions have been fully explored;  
   and, 
3. it can be d emonstrated that the wider benefits of the scheme outweigh its lower level of  
   contribution.  
  
185   [go to Contents ] 
  B) Where a lower level of contribution is agreed initially for large -scale sites which will develop out 
over multiple phases,  this may be subject to reassessment o nce the development commences 
and/or any other suitable trigger point(s) as appropriate  and agreed between the Council and 
the applicant . 
 
Explanation  
15.8.  National policy states that contributions expected from developers towards infrastructure should 
be set o ut in local plans and that such policy requirements should not undermine the 
deliverability of the plan. This upfront approach therefore ensures costs associated with 
providing infrastructure and other development costs can be factored into land transactio ns 
between developers and landowners and therefore negating the likely occurrences of viability 
being at issue.  Testing policies as part of the plan -making stage therefore negates the need for 
site specific viability assessments as part of subsequent plan ning applications in the majority of 
circumstances . 
 
15.9.  The Council is therefore required to assess the cumulative impact  on development viability in 
the Borough from national and local standards as well as any Local Plan policies which require 
a cost to the developer .  The Council’s evidence base on viability  (Doncaster Local Plan 
Viability Testing 2016  and 2019 Update ) has been independently  prepared in accordance with 
all the relevant guidance .  The findings have led to direct changes to some of the policie s in the 
Local Plan, such as the affordable housing policy requirement, in the interests of ensuring 
viability and deliverability of the plan . 
 
15.10.  The applicant should refer back to the Council’s viability testing that informed the Local Plan 
and provide evid ence for what circumstances have changed since then that justify a site specific 
appraisal to be undertaken as part of the planning application.  Any viability appraisal is to be 
prepared at the applicant’s expense and will be published as part of the plan ning file.  The 
Council has  protocols in place to ensure that they are  then independently verified.  Where an 
applicant is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council  that the planning obligation (s) 
would cause the development to be unviable, th e Council may need to be flexible.   Assessing 
viability should lead to an understanding of the scale of planning obligations which are 
appropriate.  However, national planning policy is clear that where safeguards are necessary to 
make a particular scheme  acceptable in planning terms, and these safeguards cannot be 
secured, planning permission should not be granted for unacceptable development.  
 
15.11.  The viability of any development may change in the future given the time lapse often seen 
between a planning appl ication being determined, and a start on site, but especially so for larger 
development proposals which may take many years to commence and build out over a 
timeframe when invariably market conditions will be different and/or infrastructure needs may 
have changed.  The policy allows for the necessary ‘checks and balances’ to be put in place to 
review the viability at suitable trigger points over the lifetime of the build to ensure any 
contributions not viable at the point of determination, can be realised s hould the viability of the 
development prove to be different to that set out in the initial appraisal.  This is considered to be 
in line with best practice and provides the flexibility to ensure development is not put at risk and 
can be delivered now, but that the benefits to the wider community may still be achieved at 
some point in the future.  
   
186   [go to Contents ] 
   
Monitoring  
 
The Council will regularly assess the performance and effectiveness of the Local Plan based on relevant 
indicators.  The Council will produce an Annu al Monitoring Report which will be used to inform any 
change to policies or additional actions considered to be required.  All information will be made publically 
available.  
 
The Annual Monitoring Report will  
 
A) Monitor Progress of the Local Plan against a s et of indicators . 
B) Report any activity in relation to the duty to co -operate . 
C) Provide up to date details of the implementation of neighbourhood plans. 
D) Provide details of any updates to evidence base documents.  
E) Determine if there is any need to undertake a p artial or full review of the Local Plan.  
 
 
15.12.  The Council will produce an ‘Annual Monitoring Report ’ that will assess the progress of the 
Local Plan against the milestones set out in the ‘Local Development Scheme ’ and the extent to 
which the policies are bein g achieved and targets met.  
 
15.13.  It is likely that during the course of the Local Plan circumstances that have a bearing on 
development will change.  The economy will evolve and there may be new laws and advice 
from central Government .  It is essential that th e Local Plan is flexible and able to respond to 
changed circumstances.  It is important that the Council undertakes regular monitoring of the 
effectiveness of the Local Plan to identify any actions  required to retain its currency and validity.  
The Annual Monitoring Report will track the progress of the Local Plan in meeting the Plan’s 
objectives and the implementation of its policies.  
 
15.14.  Regulation 34 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 
sets out what information the r eports must contain .  The Local Plan’s monitoring indicators are 
set out in Appendix  12 have been developed to conform with national guidance and local 
relevance.

  Chapter 1 6: Spatial  Proposals  
 
Introduction  
16.1.  This Chapter sets out proposals for new land -use allocations in  the Borough ’s settlements and 
growth areas  together with any area specific  policies .  It follows the sequence of the Local 
Plan’s S ettlement Hierarchy (see Policy 1). 
 
Doncaster Main Urban Area :  
including Doncaster town centre, Balby/ Woodfield, Belle Vue, Bentley, Bessacarr , Cantley, Clay 
Lane, Cusworth, Edenthorpe, Hexthorpe, Hyde Park, Kirk Sandall, Intake, Richmond Hil l, Scawsby, 
Scawthorpe, Warmsworth and Wheatley.  
 
Main Towns : 
Adwick & Woodlands  Mexborough  
Armthorpe  Rossington  
Conisbrough & Denaby  Thorne & Moorends  
Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatf ield & Stainforth

Doncaster Main Urban Area  (MUA)  
Settlement Profile  
16.2.  Policy 1 defines  this area as the contiguous built -up area of Doncaster comprising the town 
centre and a number of distinct but connected surrounding districts including Balby/ Woodfield, 
Belle Vue, Bentley, Bessacarr, Cantley, Clay Lane, Cusworth, Edenthorpe, Hexthorpe, Hyde 
Park, Kirk Sandall , Intake, R ichmond Hill, Scawsby, Scawthorpe, Warmsworth and Wheatley.  
With the exception of the boundary between Warmsworth (MUA) and Edlington, this Main 
Urban Area is separated and disconnected from other settlements by parts of the Green Belt in 
the west, or the Countryside  Policy Area  in the  east.  
 
16.3.  The Main  Urban Area has the largest population and best service provision in the borough.  
Doncaster town centre  is a significant sub regional centre with excellent shopping provision, 
including the Frenchgate Centre (a modern indoor shopping centre), Doncaster’s markets and 
high street shopping – as well as a number of bars and restaurants.  
 
16.4.  The Main  Urban Area, outside of the town centre, is comprised of a number of separate 
‘districts’ which each have  their own prov ision of services, in addition to being within convenient 
travelling distance of the town centre.  
 
16.5.  Central Doncaster is home to Doncaster railway station, the Borough’s main railway station, 
with trains serving local, regional and national stations includi ng Sheffield, Rotherham, Leeds, 
Hull, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh and London.  Additionally, two districts (Bentley and Kirk 
Sandall) also have local train stations which are served by local stopping services.  Doncaster 
bus interchange is also located here , with regular local and regional services, as well as being 
served by national coach carriers.  
 
16.6.  The Borough’s  main roads, which lead out to various surrounding settlements, converge in the 
Main Urban Area, whilst the M18 and A1(M) largely circumvent the s ettlement, with numerous  
189   [go to Contents ] 
  easily accessible points.  From here, there is access to the national motorway network, 
including the M1, M62 and M180.  The M18 also connects the Main Urban Area to the Airport 
via the Great Yorkshire Way.  
 
16.7.  The Main Urban Area is the location of a number of important open spaces, entertainment and 
leisure venues .  This includes Doncaster Common, Town Fields, Sandall Beat Wood, Cantley 
Park and Lakeside – a successful mixed residential , commercial, leisure and retail development 
built around a man -made lake - where Doncaster Dome, Lakeside Village shopping outlet, the 
HS2 College and the Keepmoat Stadium (home to Doncaster Rovers F.C.) are also located.  
Additionally, Doncaster Racecourse, home to the renowned classic horse race, the  St Ledger, 
and the Yorkshire Wildlife Park are also located in or on the edge of the Main Urban Area.  
 
16.8.  Recent investment has been made in the town centre to develop a Civic and Cultural Quarter, 
which will comprise of the restaurants / bars, a cinema, th e Cast theatre, and a new museum, 
innovatively designed to house an existing  former girls school within it.  A number of significant 
infrastructure projects have recently completed or are under construction including widening of 
White Rose Way (the main ro ute into town from J3 of the M18) and  the Great Yorkshire Way , 
which links J3 of the M18 to Auckley – Hayfield Green (and consequently, Doncaster – Sheffield 
Airport).  
 
16.9.  Current large scale housing developments include Manor Farm , Bessacarr; Carr Lodge, 
Woodfield ; McCormicks, Wheatley Hall Road; and Lakeside/Belle Vue.  Despite the decline in 
heavy industry and the trend in recent years for new employment sites (particularly logistics) to 
be developed closer to motorway junctions, the Main Urban Area continu es to provide major 
employment opportunities  particularly in retail and public services but also in industrial and 
commercial premises such as those at Doncaster Carr, Balby Carr, Lakeside, Kirk Sandal and 
Wheatley Hall Road.  
 
16.10.  There are a number  of constra ints in the Main Urban Area, which surrounds the urban area to 
the west, and areas of flood risk along the River Don and to the north in the Bentley area in 
particularly.  
 
Settlement Role and Function  (in the Local Plan)  
16.11.  The Local Plan aims to strengthen t his area’s role in providing services for the whole Borough 
and beyond.  It will be the main focus for development in the Borough  (Policy 1), including  
housing, retail, leisure, cultural, office and other employment developme nt with stronger links to 
national transport  networks and enhanced public transport provision to better connect the town 
centre transport interchanges with the rest of the Borough and beyond . 
 
16.12.  The town centre is recognised as a sub -regionally important cen tre at the top of Doncaster’s 
retail hierarchy .  Policies  seek to protect its vibrancy and vitality and to increase its 
attractiveness, accessibility and the range and quality of its businesses, homes, cultural, 
education and entertainment services.  Other  centres across the area are also protected and 
supported . 
 
16.13.  Reflecting its role as the most sustainable location in the Borough with the largest amount of the 
Borough’s population, the Main Urban Area will be the main location for housing growth in the 
plan period.  In total, the area will deliver 45% of the Borough ’s overall housing requirement in a 
variety of locations .  In order to meet this requirement, a number of urban sites are allocated, as 
well as some greenfield extension sites.  This is necessary  given some of the aforementioned 
constraints on land in this location. Viabili ty, particularly in respect of housing requiring flood 
mitigation, continues to be an issue .  Due to flood risk on otherwise suitable sites, some 
‘Potential Development Sites’  will also be earmarked in this location, which are suitable subject 
to constraints being overcome (but not part of the allocated supply).  
 
16.14.  The Main Urban Area straddles the East Coast Main Line and so its western edge is bounded 
by Green Belt whilst its eastern edge  is bounded by countryside outside  the Green Belt.  The  
190   [go to Contents ] 
  river corridor and northern parts of the area lie within Environment Agency designated flood 
zones 2 and 3 but with existing flood defences.  The river and navigation, rail lines, motorways, 
common land and other important open spaces and nationally important habitats provide 
physical constraints to outward expansion of the Main Urban Area in a number of directions.  
Therefore, i t is necessary for urban expansions into land previously designat ed as Green Belt 
and/or in the Countryside Policy Area in order  to accommodate fully the planned level of 
housing growth .  Opportunities  for urban ex tensions  have been identified at Warmsworth , Balby,  
Edenthorpe, Wheatley and Cantley  in addition to the on -going urban ex tensions  at Bessacarr 
(Man or Farm) and Balby  (Carr Lodge ). 
 
16.15.  Major employment sites in the area include Balby Carr, Doncaster Carr, Kirk Sandal, Lakeside, 
Shaw Lane, Wheatley Hall Road and York Road, which will all be protected and supported f or 
employment uses.  
 
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.16.  At the time of writing, the Edenthorpe Neighbourhood Plan is being prepared, as is a 
Neighbourhood Plan for Sprotbrough , which includes in its neighbourhood area land east of the 
A1(M), which is part of the Main Urban Area.  
 
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.17.  Policy 2 includes a target for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough. Table 5 allocates  two sites in the Main Urban Area totalling 14 hectares , both in Balby.  
 
16.18.  As at the 1 April  2018 , there is 19.81  ha with  permission in the Main Urban Area.

  Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.19.  Existing employment sites in this area include:  
 
 Doncaster and Balby Carr including Lakeside – established and growing em ployment 
areas with a range of sites still to be developed.  The area benefits from access to the 
urban area and the strategic road network.  
 Wheatley Hall Road – mix of existing uses including car showrooms and storage.  Some 
brownfield sites, including th e former McCormick Tractors site which has planning 
permission for a mixed use scheme . 
 Kirk Sandall Industrial Estate – established area with a mix of small and medium sized 
businesses with good local access.  
 Shaw Lane Industrial Estate – established area with a mix of small and medium sized 
businesses with good local access.  
 Bentley Road – established area with a mix of smaller businesses.   
 Clayfield Industrial Estate – established area with a mix of small and medium sized 
businesses with good local acces s 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.20.  Policy 2 includes a target that at least 45% of the Borough total is allocated to this area.  Actual 
allocations for the  Main Urban Area equate to 7, 182 new dwel lings which is made up as per the 
following.  
 
16.21.  As at 1 April 2018  there are permissions  for 3,489 dwellings .  All of this capacity is deliverable 
and/or achievable in the plan period and follows some discounting of capacity for specific 
permissions where ne cessary for non -delivery .  Additional allocations are made totalling 3,844 
new houses, although a small element of this supply (151 dwellings) is on a very large urban 
extension site (Carr Lodge, Balby) which will still be developing beyond the plan period .  
Anticipated delivery from these allocations by the end of the plan period equates to 3,693 new 
homes. The Plan th erefore identifies specific sit es as allocations totalling 7,182 by the end of 
the plan period in 2035.  
 
16.22.  Potential Development Sites could c ontribute an additional supply of 749 new homes for the 
settlement (all in the Bentley area) providing viable flood risk mitigation solutions can be 
identified and in accordance with Policy 57 including the requirement  to pa ss the flood risk 
sequential and exceptions tests.  Further significant and additional housing supply is anticipated 
from residential elements of Brownfield sites contained in the Urban Centre Masterplan and as 
per Policy 68 which are likely to include some high  density residential schemes.

Town and Other Centres  
16.23.  As a ‘Sub -Regional Centre’, Doncaster Town Centre will continue to provide the main foc us for 
most new retail, offices, leisure, cultural and tourist facilities.  Doncaster town centre will 
continue to be developed as a thriving and accessible shopping, commercial and leisure 
destination of regional importance with a broader range of high order services, businesses, 
homes and cultural, entertainment  and education facilities.  The historic core of the town will be 
protected and enhanced, including the character and the setting of its heritage assets such as 
the Mansion House, St. George’s Mins ter, Christ Church and the Corn Exchange. Linkages 
between the main shopping areas (e.g. Frenchgate Centre) and the historic waterfront will be 
enhanced.  
 
16.24.  Shops and services to meet day -to-day needs will be directed towards the defined ‘District 
Centre’ of Bentley and the ‘Local Centres’ at Balby, Bessacarr, Cantley, Edenthorpe, Intake, 
Scawsby, Scawthorpe and  Woodfield Plantation will serve more day -to-day needs  for each 
community . 
 
16.25.  The emerging education and training hub around the town centre and Lakesi de will have 
developed into a centre of excellence, offering a diverse  range of academic and vocational 
qualifications across priority sectors such as rail engineering . 
 
16.26.  Proposals in Doncaster  Town Centre will be considered  against  the following policy. 
   
196   [go to Contents ] 
   
Policy 67: Doncaster Town Centre (Strategic Policy)  
 
New development in Doncaster town centre will be supported where it helps improve the centre as a 
thriving and accessible shopping, commercial and leisure destination of regional importance  with a 
broader range of high quality services and businesses, homes and excellent cultural, entertainment and 
education facilities.  
 
Major development opportunities will be directed towards Waterfront, Marshgate, Civic and Business 
District, Waterdale, Mi nster Canalside, the Markets and St Sepulchre Gate West areas of the town 
centre, as defined on the Policies Map . 
 
Proposals will be supported where relevant, which:  
 
A) revitalise the Waterdale shopping centre as a predominately retail -led, mixed -use develop ment 
complementary to the existing retail provision in the town centre, acting as a strong axis 
between the Civic and Cultural Quarter and primary shopping frontages .  
 
B) transform the Colonnades shopping centre into a vibrant commercial destination (includi ng an 
upgrade of the existing built fabric to provide high quality office and retail space, public space 
and improved linkages to other parts of the town centre) . 
 
C) support the expansion and growth of education and research facilities particularly at Waterf ront 
and the Civic and Business District, with a view to achieving independent university status and 
developing strong links with knowledge -based facilities (e.g. Doncaster College) and industries, 
such as rail engineering . 
 
D) transform the Minster canalside  and waterfront area into a vibrant mixed -use destination in its 
own right, framed with higher density development, a hierarchy of greenspaces and a mix of 
small -scale ancillary uses focused around the marina and canalside .  
 
E) provide better opportunities f or the independent and specialist retail and commercial sectors, 
particularly around Hallgate, the market and in the Lower Wheatley, Copley Road and Nether 
Hall Road areas . 
 
F) create high -quality streets, public spaces and routes  which are safe to walk and c ycle between 
key destinations, particularly at Doncaster Waterfront, Waterdale, Doncaster Market, 
Marshgate, Doncaster Minster and St Sepulchre Gate West, including where appropriate tree -
lined boulevards, parks and canal -side walkways . 
 
G) bring about enviro nmental improvements to the character and appearance of the streetscape, 
especially at the station gateway, Hall Gate Triangle, Copley Road/Nether Hall Road, Spring 
Gardens/Duke Street, Silver Street and the Minster quarter .  
 
H) create inviting and safe plac es for pedestrians, cyclists and disabled  people , with special 
emphasis on reducing the severance caused by the Trafford Way/Church Way/Cleveland Street 
corridor and improving links to Balby Island, Doncaster Minister, St Sepulchre Gate West 
(including the  railway station), Doncaster Waterfront, Lower Wheatley, Hyde Park and 
Doncaster Lakeside . 
 
I) create a more attractive mix of day time, evening and night time uses such as restaurants, bars, 
cafes and cultural facilities, with special emphasis on supporting tourism, particularly at the 
Markets and in the Civic and Business Quarter and Waterdale areas . 
 
J) encourage the retention and restoration of traditional shop fronts in the interests of preserving 
and enhancing the historical character of the town centre, us ing original features where 
possible . 
  
197   [go to Contents ] 
  New development should seek to create a traditional street environment around Trafford Way/Church 
Way (A630) with surrounding streets engaging with the highway and public realm, enhanced tree 
planting, crossing facili ties, footway widening, public realm improvements and buildings lining the street.  
To allow greater ease of movement across the town centre and reduce the severance caused by the 
A630, especially at key nodal points, such as the Minister quarter, railway station, waterfront and dual 
carriageway roundabouts.  
 
Explanation  
16.27.  Doncaster is an important sub -regional centre  and serves a wide catchment area.  Its continued 
success is vital to the future prosperity of the borough and the sub -region as a whole.  
 
16.28.  Donc aster town centre remains the focal point of the Borough and fulfils an important role as a 
centre of employment and community life.  It is centrally  located in the heart of the Borough and 
offers frequent bus and rail services to other major sub -regional centres such as Sheffield, 
Barnsley, Rotherham, York, Leeds and surrounding communities.  
 
16.29.  Policies 1 and 2 of the Local Plan’s S trategy  seeks  to focus major growth and new development 
(including  high-density housing, high quality office accommodation and retail and leisure 
developments and other travel -generating uses) within and around  the town centre to support 
its role as a major sub -regional centre and promote the regeneration of brownfield s ites.  
 
16.30.  Figure 15 below shows the  general extent of the town centre.  It also identifies some of its key 
assets (e.g. railway station , waterways and shopping centres) and development and opportunity 
sites.  Detailed boundaries are shown on the Policies  Map 
 
16.31.  Doncaster town centre is relatively  healthy with a good mix of national multiples, independent 
businesses and retail services such as department stores, market trading and wholesalers.  
 
16.32.  The primary shopping area i s reasonably compact, pedestrian -friendly and has good public 
transport connections.  However , there is a spatial imbalance in performance across the town 
centre with the primary shopping area focused in the west around the Frenchgate Centre and 
surroundin g pedestrianised streets (St Sepulchre Gate West, Frenchgate, High Street, 
Baxtergate and Market Place ), with a  considerably lower level of activity within  the secondary 
shopping frontages in the east and south around Waterdale and surrounding streets.  Other 
challenges include falling pedestrian footfall outside of the Frenchgate Centre, high vacancy 
rates within secondary shopping areas, shortage of greenspace, limited convenience provision 
(e.g. national foodstore operators), lack of large floorplates an d an over concentration of pubs 
and bars in certain areas.  There is also an under -representation of high quality restaurants, 
cafes and national food and beverage operators.  
 
16.33.  Immediately beyond the Primary Shopping Area are significant areas of brownfield  and 
underused land (including Doncaster  Waterfront, Marshgate and St Sepulchre Gate West) 
offering significant redevelopment potential in line with the principles set out in Policy 67. 
 
16.34.  The overall aim of the policy is to e nsure that the town centre remains vibrant, attractive, 
accessible and welcoming  place to everyone with a more diverse mix of uses and activities 
throughout the day, evening and night ( including  independent shops and businesses).  The aim 
is to have a cohe rent pattern of streets and spaces framed with high quality buildings and 
greenspaces, consistent with its role as a major sub -regional centre.  
 
16.35.  Doncaster town centre has retained much of its historic street fabric, including the medieval 
street pattern ar ound High Street, Hall Gate, French Gate and the Market Place and a number 
of Georgian and early Victorian  streets, such as South Parade and Priory Place.  Notable 
historic buildings include the grade 1 listed St George’s Church (known as Doncaster Minster ) 
which was built on the site of the original Roman fort/castle and the grade 1 listed Mansion  
198   [go to Contents ] 
  House, one of only three surviving examples in England.  
 
16.36.  Policy 67 also proposes the development of a great urban street along Tr afford Way/Church 
Way lined with high quality buildings that front onto the street, allowing ease of movement of 
traffic and pedestrians and the release of development parcels along its edge, whilst retaining 
existing capacity within the strategic road net work.  The downgrading of Church Way/Trafford 
Way present opportunities to overcome the severance of the inner ring road and re -connect the 
town centre with outlying areas, such as Waterfront, Marshgate, St Sepulchre Gate West, Balby 
Island/Hexthorpe and t he railway station.  Improvement measures could include enhanced 
signposting, multi -functional spaces and pedestrian priority crossing measures.  Trafford 
Way/Church Way is heavily trafficked and often congested, creating a hostile pedestrian 
environment.  In addition, other public realm improvements will be sought at key gateways such 
as public art / sculptures / civic spaces.  
 
16.37.  This policy will help implement the proposals outlined in the Doncaster Urban Centre 
Masterplan Framework, which sets out a long t erm vision and a set of guiding principles to 
maximise development opportunities within the town centre over the plan period.

Policy 68: Key Doncaster T own Centre and Main Urban A rea Mixed -Use S ites (Strategic 
Policy)  
 
The following key sites (as identified on the Policies  Map) will be developed in accordance with the 
principles below, the development requirements set out in Appendix 2 and othe r relevant Local Plan 
policies : 
1 Doncaster 
Markets  The markets area will be remodelled and refurbished to create a more outward -
facing development and improve links to other parts of the town centre such as 
Copley Road and Netherhall Road.  This will inv olve the rationalisation of 
existing market stalls, the introduction of multi -purpose internal and e xternal 
space and the creation of new enterprise space including pop -up shops.  
 
A new urban walkway will be created through the existing surface car park an d 
along High Fishergate to connect the markets with the Minster r iverside and 
waterfront.  The remainder of the site will be retained primarily as a surface -
level car park.  New development w ill frame/enclose High Fishergate and the 
northern side of the ma rkets square.  Live frontages along the new street will 
accommodate flexible enterprise space, shops and restaurants.  
2 Minster 
Canalside  The aim is to transform this area into a vibrant waterside quarter that reinforces 
and celebrates the minster (St Geo rge’s Church) and its relationship with the 
waterfront and the rest of the town centre, acting as the gateway between the 
retail core, transport interchange and canal -side.  New development and public 
routes will be located on both sides of the canal and l inkages improved between 
the Minster and the canal.  
 
Housing and commercial uses such as offices and small scale retail and leisure 
facilities such as bars and restaurants will be supported.  
 
The public realm will be enhanced to improve linkages to the can alside and 
waterfront, in particular Church View and Grey Friars Road will be re-classified 
to create a more attractive pedestrian environment.  
3 Waterdale 
Precinct  The site will be refurbished and redeveloped as a predominantly retail location, 
alongside  a broader mix of leisure and tourism uses such as restaurants, cafes 
and bars, befitting its location adjacent to the Civic and Business District and 
primary shopping area.  
 
Redevelopment could deliver a new anchor supermarket along with 
complementary use s such as leisure, offices and shops and a reconfigured 
street pattern.  Residential uses above the ground -floor will be supported  
4 Civic and 
Business 
District  The area will become a focus of major new civic, cultural, educational, office 
and commercial  investment.  The aim is for the area to become a ‘central 
business district’ that will build on existing civic developments and bring the 
Waterdale Shopping Centre into the area.  
 
The design of the public realm should be of the highest quality.  Future 
development will include:  
 
 grade -A office facilities;  
 education facilities;  
 a new central library and resource centre;  
 complementary leisure uses, such as bars and restaurants;  
 a mix of high -density housing; and  
 additional parking provision.  
 
Hotel and co nferencing facilities will also be supported within this location.  
  
201   [go to Contents ] 
  Development will be expected to follow the high architectural standard and 
quality public realm delivered in the earlier phases of the scheme.  
5 Doncaster 
Waterfront  The waterfront area will become a thriving and attractive high density waterside 
neighbourhood, representing a natural extension of the town centre.  It will 
support a variety of uses and activities such as modern waterfront living, 
student accommodation, employment, educatio n and learning, centred on the 
marina and a high quality public realm.  
 
New and improved pedestrian and cycle links, crossing facilities and 
greenspaces (including a new urban park and, where feasible, a  footbridge over 
the river Don) will also be created,  connecting the waterfront with the rest of the 
town centre.  
 
Small -scale retail and leisure facilities serving the day -to-day needs of the 
neighbourhood will be supported (especially around the marina), so long as 
they do not compete with existing retail uses within the primary shopping area 
or harm the vitality and viability of the town centre.  
 
Accepted uses also include commercial, health, recreation and community 
facilities.  
6 Doncaster 
Waterfront 
Phase 2 
(Waterfront 
West)  This area will become a long er term extension to Waterfront Phase 1 which 
connects well to the town centre.  Proposals for commercial, health, recreational 
facilities, residential and associated waterside developments will provide 
additional capacity for growth following development of Phase 1.  
7 Marshgate  This area will become a well -integrated, high -density mixed -use development 
that rediscovers its role as a gateway to Doncaster town centre and improves 
access to the waterside, with good quality architecture, safe and attractive 
streets and public spaces.  
 
Housing and commercial uses such as offices and small -scale retail and 
community facilities will be supported. Leisure uses may also be supported 
provided they complement the existing town centre offer and do not harm its 
vitality and viability.  
 
Development of the site will also support ecological networks alongside the 
waterways and provide informal recreation routes offering excellent access to 
the nearby countryside.  
8 St 
Sepulchre 
Gate West  This opportunity area will becom e a town gateway with new landmark mixed -
use development which capitalise upon its location close to the retail core and 
railway station.  A reinvigorated and bustling, high -density urban quarter will be 
created with safe and vibrant streets and spaces.  T his will involve the 
relocation of existing car parking, the provision of a new station forecourt public 
space (including new pedestrian routes) and enhancements to the 
façades/entrances to Frenchgate shopping centre and other key buildings along 
St Sepulc hre Gate West.  
 
The station forecourt will be transformed into a dynamic urban square which will 
provide a strong sense of arrival and directs visitors to the primary shopping 
area across an improved Trafford Way (A630).  New office and hotel 
development w ill be sought around this gateway space.  
 
High-density housing and greenspaces will be supported to create activity and 
focus around St James’s Church.  
  
202   [go to Contents ] 
  Existing buildings and facilities such as shops, pubs and other community uses 
which contribute to the  vitality and character of this area will be retained and, 
where possible, enhanced.  
 
Any significant redevelopment of this area will need to explore opportunities to 
improve connections to and from the town centre across the dual carriageway 
(Trafford Way /Church Way) and the railway station.  
9 Wheatley 
Hall Road  This area is the former McCormick Tractor site and will become well -integrated 
and designed mixed -use development that recognises its important role along 
one of the main routes into Doncaster tow n centre.  
 
Housing and commercial uses such as employment (excluding offices) and 
community uses will be supported including small scale retail and leisure 
facilities such as a foodstore, bars and restaurants and health related uses such 
as health centre,  doctor, crèche.  Smaller scale trade counter/roadside uses will 
be acceptable.  
 
New development should seek to provide high quality open space, improve 
access to the canal and have regard to the ecological issues on the site 
particularly alongside the wa terway.  
Explanation  
16.38.  This policy identifies the key development sites within the main urban area of Doncaster and its 
town centre (as shown on the Policies  Map) where significant redevelopment and mixed -use 
regeneration is planned and outlines the uses and  activities  that will be supported within these 
locations.  
 
16.39.  The town centre masterplan aims to re -connect the Waterfront with the rest of the town centre, 
transforming the areas along the banks of the river Don and South Yorkshire Navigation Canal 
into vib rant and distinctive mixed -use neighbourhoods where people can come to live, work, 
learn and relax.  Developments within Marshgate and Waterfront  (see Figure 16 below) will be 
focussed on high -density urban living, e ducation and learning and business space with 
associated open space alongside the waterfront and ancillary services such as local shops and 
businesses.  These facilities will help Doncaster to become an education hub of regional and 
national significance.  
  
16.40.  There are a number of other opportunities to redevelop run down and underutilised areas on the 
fringes of the town centre  such as the market car park, former Council land (Civic and Business 
Quarter) and the area around  the railway station and bus interc hange (St Sepulchre Gate 
West).  In addition, major interventions are needed to improve links between the town centre 
and neighbouring open spaces (e.g. Doncaster Racecourse) and key gateway sites leading into 
the urban centre from the motorway network.  
 
16.41.  The Civic and Business District (as shown on  Figure 16) will become Doncaster’s new central 
business district, inviting  major office occupiers and entrepreneurs back into the town centre to 
benefit from proximity to s hopping, leisure and other amenities.  There are also opportunities for 
other major cultural and education facilities in this area.  
 
16.42.  These sites are at various stages of preparation and development and will require careful 
management  over the 15 years and beyond.  Many of these sites have firm commitments in 
terms of planning permission and public and private sector investment decisions.

  Main Towns  
Role and Fu nction  
16.43.  The seven Main Towns are the largest settlements in terms of size and population, and also 
have an excellent range of services for both their own populations and those of surrounding 
smaller settlements.  Geographically, the Main Towns are spread ac ross the Borough.  These 
settlements are expected to be able to deliver local housing need as well as some of the 
housing needed to meet the Borough’s economic aspirations  over the plan period .  Collectively, 
these settlements will deliver 40% of the overa ll Borough supply . 
 
 
Adwick & Woodlands  
Settlement Profile  
16.44.  Situated towards the north-west of the Borough, Adwick -le-Street grew considerably in the 
twentieth century from its original rural form to its current suburban form.  A striking feature of 
this tw entieth century development is Woodlands to the west of the settlement, which is an early 
example of a garden city layout, modelled on Ebenezer Howard’s ‘Garden Cities of Tomorrow’.  
Woodlands, to the west of Adwick, contains notable examples of early twen tieth century 
domestic suburban architecture and is notable for its uniquely integrated open spaces.  
 
16.45.  Woodlands was developed for the workers of the nearby Brodsworth Colliery, which closed in 
1990 and has since become part of a community woodland , as wel l as more recently seeing a 
housing site come forward on part of the land .  The north -west of the settlement is now home to 
the large Redhouse Interchange distribution park, which, as with the rest of Adwick – 
Woodlands, has excellent access to the A1(M) (and links into the wider motorway network) at 
Junction 38.  Adwick – Woodlands benefits from its own train station, situated on the Leeds to 
Doncaster line, with regular trains to Doncaster, Leeds and Sheffield.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local P lan) 
16.46.  Adwick and Woodlands  is designated as a Main Town .  Land will  be allocated which can 
accommodate 482 new dwellings .  The former Brodswo rth Colliery site provides a significant 
proportion  (342 new homes or 71%) of the t own’s housing supply and is under  construction.  
Smaller permissioned sites and a new allocation of a Greenfield urban site provide the 
remainder of the t own’s housing allocation.  
 
16.47.  In the retail hierarchy Adwick and Woodlands has a District Centre; proposals will be supported 
which prote ct, maintain and enhance its vitality and viability.  
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.48.  Existing employment sites in this area include:  
 
 Redhouse Interchange – large , now established area with mainly large distribution uses 
with excell ent access on to the A1(M) . 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.49.  As at 1 April 2018  there are permissions for 437 dwellings on sites large enough to be allocated 
through the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  A further all ocation for 45 new homes on a 
greenfield urban site brings the town’s housing supply up to 482 new homes without extensions 
on land designated as Green Belt and/or at risk of flooding.

  Armthorpe  
Settlement Profile  
16.50.  The former mining town of Armthorpe lies immediately to the east of the Main Urban Area.  
Originally an area dominated by agriculture, the settlement expanded in the late nineteenth and 
twen tieth century around Markham Main pit, which closed in 1996.  This has been superseded 
to some degree by new distribution centres which  have been developed to the east of 
Armthorpe, at West Moor Park next to Junction 4 of the M18.  The settlement has good access 
to the M18, and this will be further enhanced by proposed improvements to the West Moor Link 
road north of the settlement.  The settlement retains good road links to central Doncaster.  
 
16.51.  Despite its close proximity to the Main Urban Area it has a str ong independent community spirit 
reflected in the considerable work that has gone into the Armthorpe Neighbourhood Plan , which 
has now been adopted .  Armthorpe  has a thriving shopping centre and good quality leisure 
facilities and has been a popular ho using market in recent years.  This includes t he former 
colliery , which  was redeveloped for housing and formal and informal open space.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.52.  Armthorpe is designated as a Main Town .  The Armthorpe Neighbourhood Plan a llocated up to 
985 dwellings.  These allocated  neighbourhood p lan sites will be reflected in the Local Plan in 
addition to other site commitments in the area, which equal 1,049 in totality.  The allocations are 
on both urban sites and greenfield extension sites.  
 
16.53.  In the retail hierarchy Armthorpe is a District Centre; proposals will be supported which protect, 
maintain and enhance its vitality and viability .  There are two existing employment areas to the 
east of Armthorpe  which are West Moor Park and Rands  Lane.  Employment uses will be 
supported on both sites.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.54.  The Armthorpe Neighbourhood Plan was adopted in the contex t of the previous Core Strategy.  
Given Armthorpe has a recently adopted neighbourhood plan, the Local Plan will refle ct the 
allocations made in that document.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.55.  Policy 2 includes  a target for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough.  
 
16.56.  As at 1  April 2018 , there are 43 ha with permission in Armthorpe.

Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.58.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are permissions for 486 dwellings on sites large enough to be allocated 
through the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  This su pply includes some of the sites identified as 
allocations through the Armthorpe Neighbourhood Plan.  A further 563 units are proposed as 
allocations and reflect the balance of supply from the other two neighbourhood plan allocations 
which equate to 563 new  dwellings brin ging the town’s identified housing supply up to 1,049 
new homes.

  Conisbrough & Denaby  
Settlement Profile  
16.59.  Conisbrough and Denaby are two adjacent settlements located in the Dearne Valley in the west 
of the Borough along the River Don.  Conisbrough is famous for its medieval fortification, 
Conisbrough Castle, which dates back to the twelfth century and is now a major tourist 
attraction i n the Borough .  The settlement has grown from this historic centre, including notable 
twentieth century development to the west of Conisbrough.  
  
16.60.  Denaby, which lies between Conisbrough and Mexborough, developed as a settlement for 
workers of the nearby Den aby Main and Cadeby Main collieries.  Since their closures in the 
later twentieth century, the settlement has been extensively redeveloped, with older terraced 
housing associated with the colliery replaced with more modern dwellings.  
 
16.61.  To the west of the s ettlement is the large Denaby Main industrial estate, which is one of the only 
employment areas of its type in this part of the Borough .  The settlement also benefits from its 
own train station, with regular services to Doncaster , Rotherham  and Sheffield, as well as 
frequent bus services, including an express service between Doncaster and Sheffield, via 
Rotherham.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.62.  Conisbrough & Denaby is a Main Town.  Land will be allocated to deliver 325 dwellings, in 
additi on to existing commitments of 203 (528 in total).  
 
16.63.  The Green Belt is tightly drawn around Conisbrough & Denaby, including on land between the 
two, known as The Crags.  Amongst the allocations in this location is an allocation for 200 
dwellings at Sheffiel d Road / Old Road  on former Green Belt land . 
 
16.64.  In the retail hierarchy Conisbrough is a District Centre and Denaby Main a Local Centre. 
Proposals will be supported  which  protect, maintain and enhance the vitality and viability of 
these centres.  
 
16.65.  Denaby Industrial  Estate , which previously benefited from Enterprise Zone status,  is designated 
as an employment policy area (Policy 4). 
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.66.  Existing employment sites in the  area include : 
 
 Denaby Industrial Estate – established industrial area with a mix of large and medium 
businesses serving the local area as well as across the local authority area . 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.67.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are permissions for 203 dwellings on sites large enough to be allocated 
through the plan (5+ units remaining) .  Two additional housing allocations are made on 
greenfield urban extensions to the settlement at Hill Top Road, Denaby and Sheffield Road, 
Conisbrough.  The latter provides 200 new homes on land that was formerly designated as 
Green Belt.  Collectively these allocations provide a further housing supply for the town of 325 
dwellings and an overall plan period housing supply of 528 new ho mes.   A large brownfield 
Potential Development  Site capable of accommodating 325 further dwellings is identified at the 
former Earth Centre, Conisbrough, and adjacent to the housing scheme under construction at 
time of Plan preparation on the former car pa rk.  The site is not within the Green Belt and any 
development will need to comply with Policy 57 including  a successful pass of the flood risk

  Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield  & Stainforth  
Settlement Profile  
16.68.  Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield & Stainforth are four contiguous settlements to the east of the 
Borough.  Collectively, they have the largest population in the Borough outside of the Main 
Urban Area, and the settlement is assessed as being one of the most sustainable in Doncaste r.  
The settlement lies to the west of the M18, although currently has no direct access to the 
nearby Junction 5.   This is proposed to be remedied as part of the Unity development – a 3,100 
house mixed use development that has been granted outline permissi on on land which wraps 
around land associated with Hatfield Colliery, which last operated in 2015  (see Policy 69). 
 
16.69.  In terms of geography, Stainforth lies to the north of the railway line and Hatfield station, with 
the other  three settlements lying south of this.  The Unity scheme when developed will lead to 
the settlement becoming more rounded in shape , and when fully developed will provide new 
housing, employment and other opportunities  for the benefit of the wider communit y.  There is 
one train station which serves the settlement, Hatfield station, with trains running to Doncaster, 
Sheffield and Hull via Scunthorpe.  
 
16.70.  Aside from the Main Urban Area, the settlement is the best provided for in terms of primary 
schools, and the  settlement also has a good range of other services, including three centres 
and a number of neighbourhood shopping parades.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.71.  Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield & Stainforth are designated as a Main Town.  The se ttlement  
already ha s planning approvals  and consents for a plan period supply of 1,860 from 
permissions, and a total supply of 4,053 units once allocations and supp ly beyond 2035 are 
factored in.  
 
16.72.  The main focus for both housing and employment growth in th is location will be the Unity 
scheme, which when fully developed will deliver 3,100 new homes and 66 ha of employment  
land, as well as a link road to Junction 5 of the M18, which will connect the area to the national 
motorway network and open up numerous o pportunities for the settlement.  This scheme is 
projected to be delivering beyond the current plan period, such is its scale, and this has been 
factored in to allocation calculations.  
 
16.73.  In addition to existing commitments in the settlement, there will also  be new allocations on a 
greenfield site at Doncaster Road , and brownfield land at Cuckoo Lane – sites which are not 
constrained by flood risk or otherwise have extant permission.  
 
16.74.  In the retail hierarchy Hatfield, Stainforth  and Dunscroft are Local Centr es; proposals will be 
supported which protect, maintain  and enhance their vitality and viability.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.75.  Stainforth Parish  Council  are in the process of preparing a neighbourhood plan for the area. 
This is unlikely to be adopted before Loca l Plan adoption.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.76.  Policy 2 includes  a target for a t least 481 hectares of employment land to be develo ped in the 
Borough.  
 
16.77.  As at 1 April 2018 , there are 66 ha with permission in Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield & Stainforth 
which is the Unity regeneration scheme.

Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.78.  There are a number of existing employment sites including:  
 
 Bootham Lane – established and area with a mix of business uses . 
 Eco Park (off Bootham Lane) – more recent development of primarily industrial units.  
Housing Allocations (Policy  5) 
16.79.  As at 1  April 2018,  there are permissions for 3,945 dwellings although a significant element of 
this (3,100 new homes) is on the mixed use Unity Project scheme which will still be developing 
long beyond this current plan period.  Discounted plan period supply is therefore 1,860 new 
homes from permissioned schemes.  Two additional allocations contribute a further 108 new 
homes for the town on sustainable sites that are within the existing settlement limit, or on land 
no lon ger defendable as countryside given  planning  decisions already taken on sites 
immediately adjacent and contributing towards the Borough ’s housing requirement already.  At 
the end of the plan period, housing delivery on allocated sites will have equated to 1,968 new 
homes .

Policy 69: Unity Regeneration Project  (Strategic Policy)  
 
New mixed use development, between Stainforth, Dunsville, Dunscroft and Hatfield, known as Unity and 
as shown on the Policie s Map and Figure 18, will be supported  requiring a co -ordinated, master planned 
approach to guide the delivery of new development and supporting infrastructure in accordance with the 
requirements set out below : 
 
A) The on-going development of the Unity project will be in accordance with its planning 
permission and the requirements set out below to provide:  
 
1. a minimum of 1,015 new  homes over the plan period, and up to 3,100 homes over the life  
  of the development, with a minimum of 0.4 hectares of land made available for self -build  
  homes*;  
2. a minimum of 33 .6 hectares over the plan period, and approximately 66 hectares  over the  
  life of the development, of land for business, general industrial and storage and  
  distribu tion uses, a training centre and energy related developments and associated  
  education, technological and research facilities;  
3. a new local centre next to the railway station within which retail, education , commercial,  
  healthcare/retirement uses, and co mmunity facilities will be supported;  
4. a new 2 form entry primary school on a 2.9 hectare sized site ; 
5. green infrastructure delivering over 80 hectares of green space, retaining all existing  
  watercourses and public rights of way and providing enhanced conn ections to the wider  
 green space and rights of way network where practical;  
6. a landscape and biodiversity strategy that retains and enhances most existing landscape  
  features and provides net gain for impacts on habitats;  
7. a new marina on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal with ancillary development;  
8. continued protection for, and enhancement of, the Hopyard Hay Meadow local wildlife  
  site with appropriate landscape buffers connecting it to the wider countryside and with  
  developments in its vicinity;  
9. a link road from junction 5 of the M18 motorway to serve the development and provide  
  wider connectivity, its development coordinated with the delivery of new homes and  
  employment; and  
10. improvements to Hatfield and Stainforth railway station through contrib utions facilitating  
  the delivery of improvements to passenger facilities, transport links and pedestrian   
213   [go to Contents ] 
    facilities.  
 
B) The visual openness of the Bootham Lane landfill site and surrounding area will be safeguarded 
and promoted; proposals that would enha nce its landscape, amenity, countryside recreation, 
and biodiversity will be supported.  
 
C) The lay -down area (as shown on Figure 18) will be a  source of spoil to create development 
platforms (subject to satisfactory c ontamination investigations) and will then be subject to a 
restoration and after care scheme.  
 
D) To secure regeneration of the former  Hatfield Colliery site (as shown on Figure 18) the site  is 
potentially suitable for : 
 
1. employment/industrial uses such as business, light industry and distribution/  warehousing;  
2. technological, manufacturing or research uses ; 
3. ancillary uses including local facilities provided that they are of a scale that is needed to  
  serve the occupiers  of the former Hatfield Colliery site;  
4. other uses, including leisure . 
 
All uses will need to relate well to the emerging surrounding master plan for the Unity project  
and meet other relevant policies and requirements as set out in the plan.  
 
E) No developmen t shall take place that will prevent occupation of the gypsy and traveller sites 
located to the north of Station Road, Dunscroft before a n appropriate  site of similar size , 
proportion and equivalent standard has been laid out and serviced to accommodate 20  gypsy 
and traveller pitches, and transferred to the Council or its nominee.  
 
F) Development of the site should help to secure the long -term conservation of the Grade II Listed 
headstocks.  Detailed Masterplanning should seek to maximise the potential of the headstocks 
as a focal point for the development and place -shaping .  
 
*The submission of the Reserved Matters application that includes the 500th home shall be accompanied 
by a proposal which identifies a site of at least 0.4 hectares suitable for the devel opment of self -build 
houses and a design guide for the development of such plots.  
 
Explanation  
16.80.  Unity (formerly known as the DN7 Initiative) will be developed as a major mixed -use 
regeneration scheme (as shown in the indicative masterplan (Figure 17), indicative area 
schedule ( Table 22) and Policies Map ) over the next 30 years and will be supported with the 
principles set out above .  The policy also seeks to assist the regenerati on of the former colliery 
site including the listed headstocks to bring about the  most sustainable and beneficial use of the 
area and compliment the development activities, investment and growth taking place in the 
adjacent Unity project  areas.   The qualit y of any development proposals must also be 
commensurate with the requirements of the wider project.  
 
16.81.  This policy forms part of a longer  term vision to deliver significant growth and regeneration 
within the local communities of Hatfield, Stainforth, Dunscr oft and Dunsville, both within the plan 
period and beyond.  
 
16.82.  The detailed planning and delivery of the project will be co -ordinated through a public/private 
partnership arrangement  through Planning Performance Agreements and implemented through 
outline plan ning permission  15/01300/OUTA , including its conditions and agreed Section 106 
obligations, as well as associated environmental statements, strategies and masterplans.  
 
16.83.  This project is the culmination of successful partnership working between developers, 
landowners, local community, elected members and government agencies.  The scale of the  
214   [go to Contents ] 
  project is such that it will not develop out entirely within the plan period but will continue to 
provide new homes  and jobs well beyond.   The project is identified with in the Sheffield City 
Region Growth Plan as a 'priority site'.  
 
16.84.  A suite of obligations, contributions and incentives will be delivered through the Section 106 
agreement with a regular review mechanism built in over the lifetime of the project.  Such 
contri butions include affordable  housing, a new 2 form entry primary school, bus levy, park and 
ride facilities, a pedestrian footbridge over the railway line, train station upgrades, and a training 
centre and revenue for a centre manager over a period of 10 yea rs. 
 
16.85.  Unity will provide a total of 3,100 homes but delivery is currently conditioned to no more than 
1200 homes up to 2028  in line with the previous Development Plan for Doncaster .  The Local 
Plan assumes a build -out rate for the project of 1,015 new homes  within the plan period to 2035 
(and 595 by 2028) so is significantly less than the condition allows for at present by around 
50%.  Nevertheless, we would support applications to vary this condition (and so increase the 
supply of land to address the target ) provided:  
 
 there is evidence (primarily from completions) that the number of houses sought could be 
delivered in the proposed new timescale; and  
 the proposed amendment would not undermine delivery against Local Plan targets for 
other towns and villages.   We would expect any such amendments to be incremental as 
development progresses.  
 
16.86.  The principle and timing of the housing will be dependent upon the coordinated delivery of the 
proposed infrastructure (including the new link road) and the provision of jo bs and services 
within the boundary of the scheme.   There are also significant opportunities for further green 
infrastructure and leisure uses (such as a country park) on land to the south of the railway line , 
around the Bootham Lane  Landfill Site , and nor th of the railway line (Colliery Tip), which was 
not subject to the outline planning application, or identified on the Masterplan, and is therefore 
additional to the 80 hectares as referenced in the Policy.  
 
16.87.  Any future development within the Unity/DN7 poli cy area must be subject to and include:  
 
 a feasibility study to identify the opportunities and constraints for any proposed uses;  
 a heritage assessment of the potential impact of the development on the significance of 
any heritage assets affected (includin g an assessment of archaeological potential within 
the policy area and the setting of any heritage assets outside the policy area that might be 
impacted) and mitigation measures to address or reduce the identified heritage impacts  
 a phase 1 desktop study which will be required in support of any development where there 
is a risk of potential contamination;  
 a full ecological assessment of the entire site;  
 mitigation measures to improve accessibility to local services and public transport, for 
which develope r contributions will be required; and  
 a travel plan alongside the transport assessment for this site in order to minimise the 
impact upon the strategic road network.  
 
16.88.  Located north of the railway line , adjacent to the former Hatfield Colliery , Unity  Energy  will 
provide 20.2 hectares  of land for employment, potentially including energy focused employment 
uses.  Details of proposals to be worked up and subject to possible energy sector partnership 
arrangements, access to funding and further viability/feasibil ity work.  
 
16.89.  Unity Energy  has the potential to incorporate world -leading technology and associated research 
facilities and could help deliver a step change in the transition towards a low carbon economy 
and a more diverse workforce.  The Council  will seek t o secure these opportunities as far as 
possible.   With the closure of Hatfield Colliery, access to employment and skills and training for 
local people, businesses and inward investors are essential to the success of the area.  
  
215   [go to Contents ] 
  16.90.  Part of the site has been use d for coal mining activity.  Due consideration will have to be given 
to this aspect and any required remediation measures will be identified and implemented in 
consultation with statutory bodies to ensure that the development is safe and stable for use.  A s 
the site is developed, updated ecological assessments and further detailed mitigation proposals 
will be required.   It is also essential the existing bund between the development proposal and 
Stainforth is retained and appropriately enhanced to buffer the  former colliery site from the 
adjacent community.  
 
16.91.  The headstocks of the former colliery are grade II listed and are of historic and technological 
interest due to their rarity and intactness  as well as being a visual reminder of the former uses 
of the sit e.  However, their security and upkeep is costly and at this point in time they do not 
have an obvious end use.  They are considered heritage assets ‘at risk’.   Imaginative proposals 
that secured the long term conservation of these heritage assets will be encouraged and 
supported.  
 
16.92.  Development proposals, including the design guides for the Unity development subject to 
further detailed planning applications , will be expected to make use of opportunities to enhance 
or better reveal the significance of the her itage assets affected  by, for example, incorporating 
sight -lines towards the listed headstocks or , in the case of the listed lock cottages , introduce a 
‘canalside’ character to the adjacent Unity Life development . 
 
16.93.  The details of transport mitigation measu res, funding, triggers and implementation will need to 
be agreed between partners prior to development.  
 
16.94.  The ownership and associated liabilities of the former Hatfield Colliery  is currently with the 
Crown until formally claimed and therefore any delivery of development cannot be assured in 
the plan period and will not form part of the employment land requirement.  Any potential land 
owner/applicant will be required to ensure that any proposed development seeks to conform to 
the guiding principles set out b y this policy.

  Mexborough  
Settlement Profile  
16.95.  Mexborough is a large market town on the western edge of the Borough, on the north side of 
the River Don / New Cut Canal and south of the River Dearne.  The t own grew mainly in the 
18th – 20th centuries as the result of coal mining , quarrying, brickworks and the production of 
ceramics and was a busy railway junction.  The settlement has a ‘town centre’, one of only three 
in the Borough (along with Doncaster  and Thorne), and whilst this has relatively high vacancy 
levels, it serves an important wider catchment than just the town itself , including parts of the 
Dearne Valley outside the Borough.  It is particularly closely related to the neighbouring Dearne 
towns o f Conisbrough & Denaby, Swinton and Wath . 
 
16.96.  Higher order services include the Mexborough -Montagu Hospital which is one of the key 
hospitals in the Borough and also serves a much wider catchment.  Mexborough also has a 
railway station on the Sheffield -Doncas ter railway line with regular trains between the two, as 
well as to Rotherham and Meadowhall in between , and is served by a bus station.  
 
16.97.  Mexborough is a generally self -contained housing market and a number of smaller housing 
developments including housing  renewal schemes have taken place in recent years.  The only 
two large scale recent housing developments are those on the eastern edge of the town at 
Pastures Road and the Shimmer development at the former Mexborough Power Station.  Both 
are under construc tion but affected by the proposed new route of HS2, which was announced in 
2016.   This is currently proposed to run across the east of the settlement, with the proposed 
HS2 line safeguarded as per the Government directive, thus constraining further develop ment  in 
this location at this time.  
 
16.98.  Additionally, Mexborough is surrounded by Green Belt, as well as the Borough boundary to the 
west and south west, and River Don / Don navigation to the south.  This collectively means that 
if Mexborough is to deliver it s housing requirement , the only considerable land is either a limited 
pool of urban sites, or the potential of Green Belt release to the north.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.99.  Mexborough is  designated as a Main Town .  However, given the af orementioned constraints to 
growth and given the importance of the Green Belt to the west of the settlement in preventing 
Mexborough and Swinton (and consequently Doncaster and Rotherham) from merging, no 
urban extension is proposed .  Mexborough is therefo re only projected to deliver 310 new homes 
over the plan period.  
 
16.100.  There is currently  a possibility of a HS2 parkway station in Mexborough which , if realised, future 
local plans may wish to consider the opportunities that this would prevent for an urban 
extension associated with this transport hub .  However , at present this remains an unknown.  
 
16.101.  In the retail hierarchy Mexborough is a Town Centre; proposals will be supported which protect, 
maintain and enhance its vitality and viability  (Policy  70).  The town has capacity to be extended 
and enhanced , including retail facilities and new office development along the canalside with 
improved links to the railway station.   
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.102.  There are two existing employment sites  in Mexborough :  
 
 Whitelea Grove – a range of businesses serving the local area . 
 Cliff Street – a range of businesses serving the local area.  
16.103.  There are also a number of sites across the Doncaster  bounda ry in Wath -upon -Dearne.   
219   [go to Contents ] 
  Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.104.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are permissions for 108 dwellings on sites large enough to allocate 
through the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  This is following the discount ing of some 
permissioned capacity in light of HS2 Safeguarding Route and non -delivery of remaining supply 
on the Shimmer Estate.  Three additional allocations provide the town with a housing supply of 
202 dwellings bringing the settlement’s plan period all ocated housing supply up to 310 new 
homes.   
 
16.105.  Nationally there is some political uncertainty in respect to the HS2 and whether or not the 
infrastructure project will be delivered.  Despite this, the Safeguarding Direction has to be 
respected until  or unles s instructed otherwise.   Therefore, the  plan identifies 3 additional 
Potential Development  Sites which are directly constrained by the proposed route of HS2.  
Were it not for this Direction it is likely they would have  been allocated.  These sites have 
potential capacity for a further 242 new homes for the town.   Their identification as Potential 
Development Sites provides flexibility and a level of planning policy certainty should the route of 
HS2 not be confirmed as progressing  at some point during the pl an period.

Policy 70: Mexborough Town Centre  
 
Mexborough town centre will be a thriving and distinctive shopping and leisure destination serving the 
south -west of Doncaster and adjoining parts of the Dearne Valley and beyond.  The town centre will be 
extended and enhanced to accommodate n ew and improved retail facilities, new office accommodation, 
canal -side housing development and better links to Mexborough railway station, with clearly defined 
spaces.  The historic character of the town centre will be preserved and enhanced through high quality 
infill development.  
 
Within Mexborough town centre, as defined on the Policies  Map, proposals will be supported where 
relevant, which:  
 
A. explore opportunities to create a more enclosed, dense and compact urban form, especially 
within close proximit y to key routes (e.g. A6023) and the primary shopping area;  
 
B. improve existing retail provision, including a new retail supermarket anchor in the heart of the 
centre;  
 
C. bring about environmental improvements (including tree planting, street furniture, signag e and 
new public spaces) to enhance the streetscape and encourage social interaction, particularly at 
High Street, Bank Street and York Square;  
 
D. retain and sympathetically restore, Mexborough’s historic buildings (particularly in the 
Conservation Area);  
 
E. encourage the retention and restoration of traditional shop fronts in the interests of preserving 
and enhancing the historical character of the town centre, using original features where 
possible;  
 
F. improve pedestrian/cycle links between the primary shopping  area and surrounding areas, 
particularly the bus and railway stations, Montagu Hospital and Sheffield and South Yorkshire 
Navigation Canal;  
 
G. open up public access and promote active travel to key views to the waterfront/canal side, 
particularly across the  dual carriageway (Greens Way);  
 
H. introduce traffic calming measures along Greens Way to reduce and control vehicle speeds and 
protect the safety of pedestrians and cyclists;  
 
I. provide active frontages at ground floor level, particularly along Greens Way, Station Road, 
John Street and West Street, wherever possible;  
 
J. enhance the sense of arrival at key gateway sites around the edges and entry points into the 
town centre such as the Greens Way (Doncaster Road), A6022 (Bridge Street), Adwick Road 
and Station Road; and  
  
221   [go to Contents ] 
  K. support the rationalisation of existing car parks and refurbishment of the multi -storey car park 
and adjoining sites through sensitive redevelopment.  
 
Proposals to change the use of a unit from a shop to a residential, community or business us e within the 
conservation area (as shown on the Policies  Map) should be designed in a way that is sympathetic to the 
design of the original building and, as far as possible, should retain its original features.  
 
Explanation  
16.106.  Mexborough is the second largest  commercial and shopping centre in the Borough (after 
Doncaster) and fulfils a wider role in meeting the local shopping and service needs of the 
Dearne Valley area.  The town centre offers good access to a range of transport modes 
(including  public transpo rt, walking and cycling) and is well connected to surrounding 
settlements in the Dearne Valley such as Swinton, Conisbrough and Wath upon Dearne.  
 
16.107.  Mexborough is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Mechesburg and there are remains of a 
motte and bailey castle , which is a scheduled monument, within Castle Park about a mile to the 
east of the town centre.  Mexborough lies at the confluence of the rivers Don and Dearne, and a 
market has reportedly been held here for 800 years.  The settlement expanded rapidly in the 
Victorian period, mainly as a colliery town, although other industries were also developed.  The 
area that is now designated as Mexborough Conservation Area was developed at this time, 
serving as part of the main retail area along Bank Street, a role i t still serves today.  
 
16.108.  Mexborough has a relatively linear centre extending from Hartley Street in the west, along Main 
Street, High Street and Bank Street, to the former Royal Electric Theatre in the east.  The 
centre offers a good range of shops and servi ces (including high street banks, building 
societies, cafes, pubs and clothes shops) serving everyday needs.  The key strengths of the 
centre are its historic setting, high pedestrian flows, strong independent offer, availability of 
parking/public transpor t and good quality markets.  
 
16.109.  The ‘Main  Shopping Area’  (as defined on the Policies Map)  of the town centre extends along the 
pedestrianised  area on High Street and along sections of Garden Street and Bank Street.  It 
also includes the indoor and outdoor mar kets.  
 
16.110.  Mexborough continues to perform an important role as a retail and commercial designation but 
remains in a precarious position.  Particular concerns include the lack of national retail 
representation, limited unit size, empty properties, narrow pave ments (beyond High Street) and 
a declining environment.  There is also a shortage of high quality leisure and entertainment 
uses (e.g. cafes and restaurants) and food retailers in the town centre.  Mexborough needs a 
new large supermarket and anchor store that offers a full range of food and grocery products to 
help claw back trade from out -of-centre stores and encourage more linked trips.  Restaurants, 
cafes and coffee bars are also under -represented.  
 
16.111.  Much of the centre is inward -facing, with a high propo rtion of blank spaces, unattractive infill 
plots and surface car parking, especially along Greens Way (A6023), Hartley Street 
Roundabout  and Station Road.  The dual carriageway (Greens Way) splits the retail core and 
conservation area from the old historic  centre of the town based around the church, 
river/canalside and railway station, thus reinforcing the isolated nature of the area.

  Rossington  
Settlement Profile  
16.112.  Rossington is a large former mining village which is currently the focus of significant new  
infrastructure and development.  The village lies 5 miles south of central Doncaster, west of the 
A638 Great North Road immediately  south of the M18 , and straddles the East Coast Main Rail 
line (although there is no railway station).  The settlement expan ded greatly in the twentieth 
century due to housing development associated with the colliery, in wha t is known as ‘New 
Rossington’.  
 
16.113.  The colliery closed in 2007 and is now being redeveloped for housing -led mixed -use including 
1,200 new homes.  In April 201 6, phase 1 of the Great Yorkshire Way (formerly the Finningley 
and Rossington Regeneration Route Scheme or FARRRS) was completed between the A638 
and the M18 (at Junction 3) providing Rossington with a direct motorway connection for the first 
time.  There are clear signs of increased investment levels in the village following this significant 
improvement in connectivity which has also provided a local traffic alternative to the East Coast 
Main Line level crossing which is the cause of regular traffic queues .  Phase 2 of FARRRS , 
linking directly to the Airport , was completed in 2018.  
 
16.114.  To the west of Rossington is Doncaster iPort, a 136 ha  logistics park, which is under 
construction, with a number of companies already on site.  It includes a 14 ha  rail freight  
intermodal terminal (the largest in Yorkshire ).  When complete, it will provide 6 million square 
feet of warehousing and is expected to provide up to 5 ,000 new jobs, as well as local training 
opportunities . 
 
16.115.  At the time of plan preparation, a planning app lication for the Rossington Hall Professional Golf 
Association European Tour Golf Destination is under consideration.  The site covers around 194 
hectares and is located to the south and east of Rossington between the A638 Great North 
Road (Bawtry Road) an d the East Coast Main Railway Line.  The proposal would be one of only 
two venues in the UK that form part of the European Tour and one of only eleven such courses 
located throughout Europe and Asia.  The proposal could bring significant economic benefits to 
the local area and wider economy.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.116.  Rossington is  designated as a Main Town .  Given the scale of the housing redevelopment on 
the former Rossington Colliery, the  Town has a significant supply of hosuing  on this 
commitment alone.  However, some additional urban sites will also be allocated in this location.  
Therefore, its housing allocation is 1,282 new homes in  the plan period to 2035  (although some 
of this is projected to be delivered towards the back end  of the plan period).  An additional urban 
site is also proposed on the former playing fields of Tornedale School including the  adjacent 
Gattisson House site.  
 
16.117.  Rossington’s retail centre is designated as a District Centre in the retail hierarchy; shops wil l be 
protected and will continue to be the dominant use in this area.   The new area of housing also 
sees development of a large  supermarket and the inclusion of a small parade of sh ops serving 
local needs . 
 
16.118.  The East Coast Main Line forms the outer boundary  of Doncaster’s Green Belt and so land to 
the west of Rossington lies in the Green Belt and land to the east is Countryside  Policy Area .  
The Green Belt has been amended to reflect the iPort development and Colliery development. 
The Green Belt in this loca tion has also been extended to cover the area of the country park, 
enhancing the Green Belt and securing  Green Belt improvements including environmental and 
biodiversity enhancement, improved accessibility, recreational benefits, landscape and visual 
enhan cements and the improvement and greening of degraded land. This also helps to 
compensate for the loss of Green Belt at other locations across the Borough .  
223   [go to Contents ] 
  Neighbourhood Planning  
16.119.  The Rossington community  is preparing  a Rossington Neighbourhood Plan but adop tion is 
unlikely before adoption of the Local Plan.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.120.  Policy  2 includes a target for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough. Table 5 allocates one  site in Rossington totalling 18 hectares on Bankwood Lane.  
 
16.121.  As at 1  April 2018 , there are 79 ha with permission in Rossington  at the iPort development (see 
Policy 71: iPort) .

Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.122.  There is one  existing  employment  site: 
 
 Bankwood Lane, Rossington  – Due to the opening of Great Yorkshire Way, t his site now 
has excellent access to the motorway network and this will help it to realise its potential as 
an employment site . 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.123.  The Local Plan identifies a total supply  from allocated  sites of 1 ,282 new homes in the plan 
period . 
 
16.124.  As at 1 April 2018,  there is one large site with permission for 897 new homes which is  large 
enough to allocate (5+ units remaining) with all of this supply being on the former colliery site .  
Latest evidence on build -out of the colliery  demonstrates that the 1,200 units permissioned are 
not going to be achieved within the existing boundary so this site has been discounted to reflect 
a more realistic capacity for the site of 984 new dwellings  with 897 units remaining to b e built on 
the site as at 1 April 2018.  The Local Plan identifies an additional phase therefore for the 
colliery to make good the balance of 1,200 units and realise the opportunity to make full and 
effective use of the former colliery land .  A further all ocation  is made o n the former playing fields 
of Tornedale School and the adjacent Gattisson House site which will provide a further supply of 
92 houses for the town on a sustainable site now surplus to requirements.

Policy 71: iPort (Strategic Policy)   
 
A Strategic Rail Freight Interchange (SRFI) together with ancillary infrastructure and operational 
development, known as iPort, will be developed at Rossington as shown on the  Policies Map.  
 
A. The on -going development of iPort will be in accordance with the principles set out in its planning 
permission as set out below:  
 
1. an intermodal terminal and rail and road served distribution units (562,000m2) in Use  
  Class B8 (including ancillary B1/B2 floorspace);  
2. road, rail access and other infrastructure facilities and works; and  
3. the realignment of water  courses, provision of landscaping, ecological networks and  
  improvements and flood mitigation and enhancement.  
 
B. Units in Use Class B2 will also be acceptable, subject to meeting other policies in the Local Plan.  
 
Explanation  
16.125.  iPort, as shown on the Policies Map, will be developed as a strategic rail freight interchange 
supported by the principles shown above , which are  in line with pla nning permission 
09/00190/OUTA.  The policy recognises the contribution that iPort, a nationally significant 
infrastructure project, will have to the wider economy.  
 
16.126.  Doncaster is promoted, both nationally and regionally, as a key location for the logistic s and 
distribution industries including through various Sheffield City Region strategic and investment 
plans such as the Strategic Economic Plan (SCR SEP) and the Transport Strategy.  The site at 
Rossington offers quick and effective links to national and international freight networks and will 
lead to a significant net reduction in HGV traffic and emissions due to the transfer of freight from 
road to rail.  The scheme is under construction and is approximately 60% complete.   Further 
development at the site  is important to ensure that the Local Plan Spatial Strategy of major new 
employment sites being accessible by a range of transport modes is implemented by providing 
rail-access for freight movements.  
 
16.127.  The National Policy Statement for National Networks st ates (footnote 42) that SRFI may include 
manufacturing and processing activities, in addition to warehousing and container handling 
facilities so , although iPort has been granted permission specifically for rail related strategic 
warehousing, there may be instances where an alternative use maybe appropriate such as 
those within Use Class B2.  Each case will be considered on its merits and will need to meet the 
requirements set out in other Local Plan policies  such as parking standards and design 
standards.  Based on the best information on market potential currently available, it is 
anticipated that around 15% of the overall employment floorspace will be for B2 uses .

  Thorne & Moorends  
Settlement Profile  
16.128.  Thorne is an historic market town in the north -east of the Borough lying east of the River Don 
and on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal.  Peel Hill Motte ancient monument sits at the heart of 
an extensive conservation area.  The former mining village of Moorends is immediately to the 
north of Thorne separated  by only a small rural gap.  The combined population is 17,295 and 
the settlement is one of only three in the Borough to have a town centre ( together with  the Main 
Urban Area and Mexborough) which serves  a wider catchment than just the town itself.  The 
relative isolation of the settlements supports a proud community spirit and a sense of 
independence from Doncaster.  Despite excellent connectivity  by rail and road (to the motorway 
network) , this relative isolation has resulted in under -investment in recent  years and both plac es 
are in need of regeneration.  
 
16.129.  Thorne is served by the A614 and the M18 Junction 6 immediately next to the town.  It is also 
served by two railway stations (the best provision in Doncaster aside from the Main Urban Area) 
with services  to Doncaster, Goole and Scunthorpe.  The canal is under -used but is capable of 
accommodating large commercial  traffic to and from the Humber Ports.  Between the motorway 
and the edge of Thorne are large scale logistics and other commercial uses benefittin g from 
motorway access and proximity to the Humber ports and providing an important supply of local 
jobs.  East of the settlements are Thorne and Hatfield Moors, an extensive area of former peat 
workings and an internationally important wildlife habitat an d national nature reserve.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.130.  Thorne & Moorends is  designated as a Main Town.   Flood risk constraints in Thorne make the 
allocation of land challenging in this location .  However, the total amount of land ident ified in 
Thorne via permissions (391 units) and allocations  (333 units), means that Thorne is 
contributing a not insignificant 724 units  towards  the Borough ’s allocated  supply . 
 
16.131.  Whilst Thorne is a very sustainable settlement, national policy and Local Plan strategy for a 
sequential approach to flood risk mean that at the time of Plan preparation it was not 
appropriate to allocate any further  housing  given  that all the remaining available sites are at 
high risk of flooding.  On -going work by the Environment Agency may establish opportunities for 
future additional allocations through a review of the Local Plan and/or Thorne and Moorends 
Neighbourhood Plan.  
 
16.132.  In the retail hierarchy , Thorne is a Town Centre and Moorends is a Local Centre; proposals will 
be suppo rted which protect, maintain  and enhance their vitality and viability (Policy  72).  
Opportunities exist to improve the connectivity between Finkle Street and King Street and for 
Market Place to act as a focal point.  
 
16.133.  There are 3 successful existing  employment  sites serving the local area and wider area with a 
mix of businesses and units.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.134.  A neighbourhood plan for Thorne and Moorends is in preparation ( Regulation 14 Pre-
submission draft published  October 2016).  The intention is that this plan will make allocations 
on sites in Flood Zone 1 due to the flood risk constraints of the area.  At the time of drafting, it is 
understood that the neighbourhood plan is now looking to also identify additional housing 
allocations which will require land that is at risk of flooding.  
   
226   [go to Contents ] 
  Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.135.  Policy 2 includes a target for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be develop ed in the 
Borough.   Table 5 allocates one site in Thorne totalling 52 hectares at Junction 6, M18.  
  
16.136.  As at 1 April 2018 , there are 9 ha with permission  in Thorn e.

Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.137.  There are a number of existing  employment  sites including:  
 
 Nimbus Park – A large distribution warehouse de velopment to the north of Thorne with 
good access to the M18.  
 Capitol Park – established mixed use business area including potential rail connectivity.  
The area has access to motorways and Thorne North rail station.  
 Coulman Road, Thorne – established area  with a mix of small and medium sized 
businesses with good local access . 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.138.  As at 1  April 2018,  there are permissions for 391 dwellings.   The Local Plan identifies a further 
333 units as allocation s which provides the settlement with a housing supply of 7 24 new 
dwellings.  
 
16.139.  The Local Plan housing allocation at the Main Town of Thorne -Moorends is constrained by a 
lack of potential development sites not at high risk of flooding.  Although sufficient si tes have 
been identified, were it not for this physical constraint to plan -making then the Main Town would 
have seen a  higher  allocation.  This is due to the town’s size and population as being one of our 
largest communities outside of the Main Urban Area with strong sustainability credentials, for 
example: 2 train stations; frequent bus links; large town centre with excellent range of services 
and facilities; and  no Green Belt constraints to growth.

  Town and Other Centres  
 
Policy  72: Thorne Town Cen tre 
 
Within Thorne town centre, as defined on the Policies  Map, proposals will be supported, where  relevant, 
which:   
 
A. provide opportunities to improve connectivity between Finkle Street and King Street and 
develop the Market Place as a key focal point of t he town centre, reflecting its role as a market 
town;  
 
B. restore/bring listed buildings and other buildings of local importance back into active use;  
 
C. protect and enhance the setting of the scheduled monument (Peel Motte and Bailey Castle);  
 
D. respect the his toric pattern and character of buildings and spaces within or on the edge of the 
town centre;  
 
E. improve parking and active travel opportunities in the town centre through the rationalisation of 
existing on -street parking (e.g. The Green) and the provision o f safe and formal car parking 
provision sustainable transport infrastructure in order to provide safe and secure travel options 
and improve Air Quality ;  
 
F. protect and enhance existing areas of greenspace and secure improvements to the public 
realm (includi ng high quality street furniture, surface treatment and planting) through good 
design;  
 
G. provide continuous active street frontages at ground floor level, with the minimum use of set -
backs, especially along Church Street, King Street and Silver Street;  
 
H. encourage the retention and restoration of traditional shop fronts in the interests of preserving 
and enhancing the historical character of the town centre, using original features where 
possible; and  
 
I. create inviting and safe places for pedestrians, cyclists  and the disabled people with particular 
emphasis on securing improvements to better manage traffic and pedestrian flows along King 
Street/Silver Street and Finkle Street/Market Place, with special emphasis given to reducing 
severance and congestion and im prove Air Quality.  
 
Explanation  
16.140.  Thorne operates as an historic market town serving a relatively large rural hinterland, some 12 
miles from Doncaster and 13 miles from Scunthorpe.  The M18 motorway passes to the west 
and the M180 motorway immediately to the  south of the town.  The town has two railway 
stations.  
 
16.141.  Thorne is performing reasonably well for a town centre of its size and provides an attractive 
market town environment, a strong convenience  offer, ample car parking and a good mix of 
retailers and re lated uses, including a farmers market.  Like many similar centres, Thorne has 
suffered from gradual decline in recent years and now performs a more local function.  
 
16.142.  Retail activity within the centre is focused along two main streets: King Street and Finkl e Street, 
the latter of which is pedestrianised .  Retail and service units are also located at either end of 
the centre along Silver Street and Market Place as well as along The Green and Market Place.  
Finkle Street contains the highest proportion of reta il floorspace, most of which is occupied and 
in good condition.  King Street provides the main link between the retail and historic core of the 
town centre but suffers from a poor quality environment with narrow pavements, low levels of  
229   [go to Contents ] 
  pedestrian activity  and heavy traffic movements.  
 
16.143.  Much of the town centre lies within a conservation area.  The area includes a wealth of small -
scale residential and commercial properties, mainly dating back to the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries, although a few signifi cant buildings survive from earlier periods.  Thorne’s 
street pattern has evolved from a typically medieval pattern  of narrow properties, with some set 
at right angles to the principal streets of King Street, Queen Street and Finkle Street.  The 
market are a (which dates back to the 1600s, when Charles II granted it a royal charter) lies 
within the historic town and acts as strong anchor point.  However, there are several gap sites 
(including parking lots), unsympathetic modern developments and vacant/  under used buildings 
which currently detract from the setting and character of the conservation area and effectively 
sever the grade one listed parish church (St Nicholas) and scheduled monument (Peel Motte) 
from the rest of the town centre.  Some of the listed buildings around Market Place and 
Stonegate are at risk of further decay and neglect.  Redeveloping these sites will help 
reinvigorate the appeal of the conversation area and improve the attractiveness and vitality of 
the town centre as a whole.  
 
16.144.  The publ ic realm (streets, spaces and squares) within the town centre is of varied quality and 
lacks coherence.  Problems include blank and insecure spaces, a lack of greenery, poor 
pedestrian crossings, poor quality shop frontages and uncoordinated street furnitu re.  Several 
opportunities exist to bring enhancements to existing public spaces and the streetscape such as 
seating, signage, planting, shared surfacing/crossings and more functional and attractive 
paving, especially at key arrival points, such as Market Place and King Street.  Many of the 
shop fronts are in poor condition and make use of external roller shutters and grills that currently 
detract from the appearance of the streetscape and create a hostile environment.  Appropriate 
contributions will be sou ght from developers and other funding sources towards the provision of 
public realm and traffic management improvements within the town centre.  
 
16.145.  In addition, surface and on -street car parking should be rationalised within parts of the town 
centre to maximi se the use of the space and improve pedestrian circulation (e.g. The Green) 
and prioritise local residents (e.g. Queen Street).  There is scope to make use of underused 
upper floors of buildings either as office or residential accommodation.  
 
16.146.  Thorne’s heri tage assets such as Market Place, Peel Hill Motte and Thorne Hall have the 
potential to act as a driver of revitalisation within the town centre.  New development within the 
town centre will need to be sympathetically designed and in harmony with the scale  and 
character of the townscape, using traditional materials, wherever possible.  
   
230   [go to Contents ] 
  Service Towns and Villages  
Role and Function  
16.147.  The ten Service Towns and Villages are comprised of smaller towns and villages in the Borough 
that have good service levels and  existing population, and are therefore capable of supporting 
some local growth.  This growth  predominantly relates to meeting local housing needs .  This 
means that every settlement has a housing allocation .  Collectively, these settlements will 
deliver up  to 15% of the Borough’s housing  supply . 
 
 
Askern  
Settlement Profile  
16.148.  Askern is a former mining town in the north of the Borough.  It lies along the A19 between 
Doncaster and Selby, and is equidistant between Doncaster town ce ntre and Junction 34 of the 
M62.  It has a direct road link to both along the A19.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 
Askern developed  as a successful spa town  with far reaching popularity to the extent that it 
became a destination for visitors from far and wide.  This was als o the main driver for the 
railway being built to the Town  which was on the back of Askern’s growing reputation for its 
bathhouses and their healing waters .  However , since  the establishment of a colliery in 1911, 
the settlement, like many others in Doncast er, has become associated with coal mining.  After 
80 years, the colliery closed in 1991 and was being redeveloped for housing  at time of Plan 
preparation . 
 
16.149.  Askern railway station closed in 1947, but there is a longstanding ambition for a rail service to 
be reintroduced  with some initial feasibility work being undertaken .  To the north and west of 
Askern are the closely related  villages of Norton, Campsall and Sutton, meaning Askern also 
has an important role as a Service Town for these settlements, as well  as the more outlying 
villages of Moss and Fenwick.  
 
16.150.  The settlement is inset within the Green Belt, and has areas within Flood Zone 2.  There are, 
brownfield / urban redevelopment  opportunities within the town, and this is reflected in the fact 
that the nu mber of sites available , both via existing commitments and new allocations , mean 
Askern can far surpass its housing target  and has a housing supply far more in line with the 
Borough’s Main Towns . 
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.151.  Askern is d esignated as a Service Town.  Existing permissions and ot her suitable urban site s 
means there is no need for additional  urban extensions into the Green Belt , with th e exception of 
a single site which has now been granted planning permission post April 2018 at the Askern 
Miners Welfare .  Askern is projected to deliver the most new dwellings in the Service Town and 
Village tier and will also deliver more new dwellings than some of the larger Main Towns which 
are more constrained.   Given  the Town is currently e xperiencing a significant level of growth, 
especially in respect to housing, coupled with the role Askern plays in supporting smaller 
villages in the area, then the Town’s population and service provision is likely to increase even 
further in the near futu re.  A review of the Local Plan may therefore identify Askern as having 
the higher population and service provision more characterised by a ‘Main Town’ in the future.  
 
16.152.  In the retail hierarchy Askern is a District Centre; acknowledging it serves a wider cat chment, 
proposals will , therefore, be supported  which protect, maintain and enhance its vitality and 
viability.

  Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.153.  Policy 2 includes a target  for at least  481 hect ares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough.  
 
16.154.  As at 1  April 2018 , there are 2.27 ha with permission in Askern.

16.155.  Existing employment  sites include:  
 
 Askern Saw Mills – two small established employment sites supporting local businesses . 
 Selby Road – two separate sites on either side of A19 supporting a regional company with 
some  vacant land and a supermarket.  
 Askern Industrial Estate – existing site with a mix of small units providing local jobs.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.156.  As at 1  April 2018,  there are permissions for 564 dwellings on sites large enough to allocate (5+ 
units) .  A further 127 new homes are allocated across three sites.  Two of these are sustainable 
urban sites and the third is a brownfield  Green Belt site which is now permissioned post April 
2018; all of which provides housing supply for Askern total ling 691 ne w homes.  A relatively 
small Potential Development Site (29 dwellings) could provide further new housing for the town 
if flood risk challenges can be addressed in line with Policy 57, including  the need to pass the 
sequentia l and exceptio ns tests.

  Auckley & Hayfield Green  
Settlement Profile  
16.157.  Auckley – Hayfield Green are two contiguous s ettlements under one parish to the east of the 
Borough, which are closely related to Doncaster – Sheffield Airport.  The settlement (particularly 
Hayfield Green) expanded around RAF Finningley (now Doncaster – Sheffield Airport) in the 
1960s, and more rece ntly there have been further housing  developments close to this.  
 
16.158.  The settlement is currently undergoing a transformative period, as the Airport  seeks to expand 
its operations.  Key to this has been the completion of the Great Yorkshire Way, which links the 
Airport to the M18, providing residents, commuters and goods quick and convenient access to 
the motorway network and central Doncaster.  In March 2018, the Airport  Masterplan was 
published which proposed an increase in airport operations, employment s ites and housing 
around the Airport.  The Local Plan has a separate policy (Policy 6) related to the Airport.  
 
16.159.  Auckley – Hayfield Green is closely related to other villages in the east of the Borough, which 
occur along and of f the B1396.  These include Branton, Blaxton and Finningley, and therefore 
these settlements have some service interdependence.  This road also leads towards the Main 
Urban Area, meaning residents have reasonably straight forward and good access to service s 
here too.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.160.  Auckley – Hayfield Green  is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  Between existing 
permissions (115 units) and new allocations  (140 units), the settlement can deliver 255 new 
units in the pl an period .  Additionally, as per Policy 6, there will be 280 houses allocated on land 
adjacent to Doncaster Sheffield  Airport, which will be additional to the housing requirement for 
the Borough and which will not be counted towards the overall housing supply.  Further housing 
up to 920 additional units may also be permissible, subject to the proven delivery of jobs in this 
location.  For more information please refer to Policy 6 and Appendix 3.  
 
16.161.  As part of its overall  development, the Local Plan also supports new employment and retail 
development at the Airport .  
 
16.162.  The area does not have a designated retail centre but provides some smaller shops and 
services within shopping parades.   Policy 6 proposes a new mixed use development at the 
Airport which will, upon  substantial completion, become a new town centre (subject to future 
assessment of the final scheme).  
Neighbourhood Planni ng 
16.163.  The local community are currently  preparing a neighbourhood plan for the area, but this is 
unlikely to precede the Local Plan.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.164.  Policy 2 includes a target for  at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough.  
 
16.165.  Table 5 allocates one site in Auckley  & Hayfield Green totalling 69 hectares which is at the 
Airport and will form part of Aero Centre Yorksh ire. 
 
16.166.  As at 1  April 2018 , there are 14.85  ha with permission in Auckley & Hayfield  Green , one of 
which is at the Airport and is part of the business  park offer.

Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.167.  There are a number of existing employment sites at the Airport including:  
 
 Workpods, Fountains Court – a site with a number of  small off ice units . 
 Sky Business Park, Delta Court – a mix of small business units . 
 Hayfield Lane Business Park – a mix of office units  of differing sizes.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.168.  As at 1  April 2018,  there are permissions for 1 15 dwellings on a single site large enough to 
allocate through the Local Plan (5+ units ).  A single additional allocation is made on a greenfield 
urban site capable  of accommodating 140 new homes.  This brings the settlement’s housing 
supply up to 255 new homes across the plan period.  There is no justification , therefore , for any 
additional allocations that would require land currently designated as Countryside , with the 
exception of any housing at the settlement in accordance with Policy 6 which  sits outside of the 
settlement strategy and forms an additional pote ntial source of housing supply.

  Barnburgh & Harlington  
Settlement Profile  
16.169.  Made up of two adjacent settlements with a strong sense of a shared identity, Barnburgh – 
Harlington, which has its origins in Anglo – Saxon times, is o ne of the smaller and more rural 
settlements in the Borough.  
 
16.170.  Despite both settlements being of a similar size, the majority of services are found within 
Barnburgh.  Lying to the west of Doncaster, the settlement is well related to both Mexborough , 
in Donc aster , and Goldthorpe and Bolton upon Dearne , in Barnsley.  As Mexborough and 
Goldthorpe both have railway stations, there are close by links to Doncaster and Sheffield  as 
well as the Leeds line at Goldthorpe and Bolton.  Barnburgh – Harlington does have a  smaller 
population and lower service levels than other settlements with allocated housing, and this is 
reflected in the modest requirement for 60 new plan period homes.  
 
16.171.  The Green Belt is tightly drawn to the settlement boundary and , coupled with a lack o f urban 
sites in this location, this means that there are very limited opportunities for development 
without considering suitable Green Belt release.  This is reflected in the low level of existing 
permissions in this settlement.  
Settlement Role and Functi on (in the Local Plan)  
16.172.  Barnburgh – Harlington  is designated as a Service Town.   As there are no existing permissions 
in this location, the settlement require s a new site allocation.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.173.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are no permissions on sites large enough to allocate through the Local 
Plan (5+ units) .  A single urban  extension for 66 new houses is made on land that was formerly 
Green Belt to the south of Harlington on a site east of Mill Lane and south of Doncaster Road.

  Barnby Dun  
Settlement Profile  
16.174.  With a population of 3,413, Barnby Dun is the largest village in Doncaster.  Lying along the 
eastern edge of the River Dun Navigati on, the settlement lies just outside the Main Urban Area, 
and is consequently well related to both Kirk Sandall (being in the same Civil Parish), and also 
well located in relation to Kirk Sandall railway station which  is a mere 15 – 20 minute walk away.  
 
16.175.  Thorpe Marsh power station stood just outside Barnby Dun with its large cooling towers 
dominating the landscape  to the west  until their demolition in 2012.  The settlement is home to 
St Peter and St Paul’s church, sitting  towards the edge  of the settlement,  which dates back to 
the 14th century.  The settlement is the last closely related settlement to the Main Urban Area, 
before the more outlying settlements of Thorne & Moorends and the northern villages.  
 
16.176.  It is reasonably well located in relation to Kirk Sa ndall railway station, which is a short journey 
from the village.  The village is constrained  by flood risk, however there are pockets of available 
land outside of these areas, including potential  greenfield extensions.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the  Local Plan)  
16.177.  Barnby Dun  is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  As there is only one small existing 
permission in this location, the settlement’s local housing need must largely be met through site 
allocations.  Given the lack of available urban site s, a greenfield extension will be required to 
meet the need in this location.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.178.  As at 1 April 2018,  there is permission for just 6 dwellings on a single urban site large enough to 
allocate through  the Local Plan (5+ units) .  The village is significantly constrained by areas at 
high risk of flooding which limits the availability of potential sites for additional more vulnerable 
housing uses.  However, a single urban extension is allocated which has potential to 
accommodate 98 dwellings on the part of the site which is not at risk of flooding and adjoining 
the existing village.  The allocation includes some additional land that is flood risk zone 3, but in 
line with the sequential and exceptions tests  only water compatible uses such as open space 
and landscaping are supported on this part of the site.

  Bawtry  
Settlement Profile  
16.179.  Bawtry is an attractive historic market town just inside the Borough ’s southern boundary with 
Nottinghamshire.  Originally a river port, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Bawt ry’s 
prominence as a coaching stop increased , which corresponded with a period of prosperity for 
the town.   Today, the settlement is an attractive and sought after area with a good level of 
services  and a vibrant social offering.  
 
16.180.  Bawtry is situated along the intersection of the A638 and A631, which means the settlement has 
good local access.  The A1(M) lies approximately 3 miles to the east and south of the 
settlement, with access achievable at Junction 34 near Blyth in Bassetlaw.  Bawtry also lies 
about 5  miles south of the Airport, with  access  via the A638, which also continues towards 
central Doncaster.  Despite the East Coast Mainline passing through the east of the town, as 
with other settlements to the south-east of the Borough, t here is no local trai n station.  
 
16.181.  At its core, Bawtry has a good range of shops, restaurants, pubs and bars, as well as office 
space, with residential areas surrounding this.  The settlement is relatively isolated in relation to 
central Doncaster  but does however lie close to t he market town of Tickhill, as well as Harworth 
and Bircotes in Bassetlaw.  Its location means  the Nottinghamshire towns of Worksop and 
Retford are not much further away than central Doncaster.  Slightly east of Bawtry is the 
Defined Village of Austerfield , which can utilise Bawtry’s services.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.182.  Bawtry  is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  The supply  will be made up by a mix of 
permissions (54 units) and allocations (36 units), which will include a smal l former  Green Belt 
site, and a further urban site.  
 
16.183.  In the retail hierarchy Bawtry is a District Centre; proposals will be supported which protect, 
maintain and enhance its vitality and viability . 
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.184.  The Bawtry Neighbourhood Plan was adopted in November 2019 . 
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.185.  There are two existing employment  sites, which are:  
 
 Hudsons Yard, Bawtry Road – a local site with a haulage business.  
 Station Road Industrial Estate – small busin esses serving the local area.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.186.  As at 1  April 2018,  there are permissions for 54 dwellings on sites large enough to allocate 
through the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  An additional two relativ ely small allocations are 
made through the plan; one being a greenfield urban site and the other a greenfield extension 
on land formerly designated as Green Belt.  These two sites have a combined capacity of 36 
new homes and bring the settlement’s housing allocation up to 90 dwellings for the plan period .  
Any additional allocations  would require large urban extensions on land currently designated as 
Green Belt where it is not considered exceptional circumstances exist to remove further sites.

  Carcroft & Skellow  
Settlement Profile  
16.187.  Carcroft and Skellow are two contiguous settlements lying towards  the north-east of Doncaster.  
The settlement expanded with the mining industry in the twentieth century, with Bullcroft Colliery 
operating in the settlement  until 1968.  Today it is the largest of the Service Towns and Villages 
in the Borough  in terms of population and households  and has a good level of services , and 
access to services in neighbouring Adwick – Woodlands.  
 
16.188.  Between Carcroft – Skellow and Adwick – Woodands is Carcroft Industrial Estate, and the 
Redhouse Logistics Park is also located within A dwick, both providing good employment 
opportunities to local residents .  Adwick railway station is situated  towards the boundary of the 
settlements and is therefore also well placed for residents of Carcroft – Skellow.  The small 
villages of Burghwallis an d Owston lie in close proximity to the settlement and can utilise 
services here.  There are two southbound access points to the A1, which lies to the west of the 
settlement; however , northbound access is only via Junction 38 at Adwick.  
 
16.189.  The settlement is t ightly bounded  by the Green Belt and extensive areas are also covered by 
flood zone . 
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.190.  Carcroft – Skellow is designated as a Service Town and Village. Due to the aforementioned 
constraints on land , and a lack of available existing permissions and unconstrained urban 
opportunities in the area, a greenfield extension is allocated  on former Green Belt land.  
 
16.191.  In the retail hierarchy  Carcroft and Skellow each have a Local Centre; proposals will be 
supported which pr otect, maintain and enhance its vitality and viability.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.192.  Policy 2 includes a target for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough.  
 
16.193.  Table 6 allocates a Potential Development Site  in Carcroft & Skellow which is at Carcroft  
Common.   Any development on this site will be additional supply above the employment land 
requirement for the plan period,  
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.194.  There is one existing employment site:  
 
 Carcroft Industrial Estate – large established site with small and medium businesses 
serving the local area . 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.195.  As at 1 April 2018, there is just one single site with permission for 7 dwellings meaning the 
majority of the town’s housing need is still to be identified through new allocations.  Much of the 
land available is constrained by Green Bel t and/or Flood Risk.  The Local Plan allocates a 
single urban extension on land formerly designated as Green Belt which has capacity for 300 
new homes following some generous discounting of the total potential site capacity in order to 
provide extensive gr een buffering between the development and the adjacent A1(M) to the west 
of the site.  Collectively these two allocations provide 307 new homes for the town . 
  
240   [go to Contents ] 
  16.196.  A single Potential Devel opment Site is identified at Owston Road, Carcroft which is capable of 
delivering 93 further homes  for the town if flood risk constraints can be viably addressed in line 
with Policy 57. This would  require successful pass of the flood risk sequential and exceptions 
tests as these have not been met  at plan -making stage so would still need to be demonstrated 
through any planning application.  It should be noted that even if this Potential Development  
Site came forward, and based on the very low supply from existing permissions, the 
settlement’s local housing need would still not be met  without a Green Belt extension .

  Edlington  
Settlement Profile  
16.197.  Edlington is a former mining town located to t he south -west of the Main Urban Area, from which 
it is separated by Warmsworth Hal t Industrial estate, and lying to the east of Conisbrough.  Like 
many towns in Doncaster, the formerly rural settlement expanded around coal mining, to house 
workers for the nearby Yorkshire Main Colliery, which was first sunk in 1909, and cl osed in 
1985.  
 
16.198.  Edlington is well placed in relation to the road network, lying close to the A630 which leads to 
central Doncaster, and also close to the A1(M) at Junction 36 (Warmsworth), which is also one 
junction north of where the A1(M) intersects the M18.  
 
16.199.  Edlington is one of the best scoring settlements in the Borough in the Settlement Audit, having 
service provision akin to larger settlements.  It is also extremely well placed to util ise the high 
levels of services in the Main Urban Area and Mexborough, as well as its excellent accessibility 
to the wider road network.  Although  the settlement is surrounded by Green Belt numerous 
development opportunities exist out side this designation.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.200.  Edlington is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  Existing permissions and other suitable 
urban site capacity (including the housing renewal sites at Thompson and Dixon Roads and the 
Granby estate) means there  is no need for additional urban extensions into the Green Belt.   
 
16.201.  In the retail  hierarchy Edlington  is a District Centre; proposals will be supported which protect, 
maintain and enhance its vitality and viability.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.202.  The Edlington  Neighbourhood Plan was successful at referendum and was ‘made’ in July 2018 
but does not concern itself with development plan allocations instead focussing on detailed 
policies to guide decision making.  
Employment Allocations (Policy 3) 
16.203.  Policy 2 includes a target  for at least 481 hectares of employment land to be developed in the 
Borough.  
 
16.204.  As at 1  April 2018,  there  is 1 Ha with permission in Edlington.

   Warmsworth Halt – established area with small and medium businesses serving the local 
area. 
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.206.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are permissions for 622 dwellings on sites large enough to allocate 
through  the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  An additional 2 sustainable urban sites are 
allocated which provide a further supply of 43 new homes and will help provide sites in order for 
some of the aspirations set out in the Neighbourhood Plan to be realised, s uch as affordable 
housing and dwelling mix , given all the other sites are existing permissions which were 
determined in advance of the Neighbourhood Plan being ‘made’.

Policy  73:  Local Business Expansion Site: Polypipe   
 
Land south of Broomhouse Lane, Edlington , as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated as Local 
Business Expansion Site (BES01) to allow for the expansion of Polypipe in line with the following 
principles:  
 
A. Development of the site for office and ancillary uses is supported to allow the existing Polypipe site 
north of Broomhouse Lane to remain for, and expand its, operational purposes;  
  
243   [go to Contents ] 
  B. Development of this site should be accompanied by the enhancement of the remaining open 
space to the south of the site and/or a compensatory contribution to the replacement of play 
equipment elsewhere in the vicinity; and  
 
C. Compensatory improvements must be provided to  the Green Belt land in proximity of the site.  
 
Explanation  
16.207.  Polypipe, located in Edlington, is one of the largest, and most well established employers within 
Doncaster Borough.  In order for Polypipe to expand and continue to operate efficiently there is 
the need to provide extra capacity for the company to remodel and allow the head offices to be 
relocated.  Land to the south of Broomhouse Lane provides such an opportunity and has been 
removed from the Green Belt specifically for this purpose.  
 
16.208.  Development  on this site will result in the loss of existing open space including the loss of play 
equipment .  Therefore it is important  that the open space to the south is improved and 
enhanced.  There may also be the requirement for the compensatory replacement of play 
equipment elsewhere in the vicinity.  
 
16.209.  Due to the removal of the site from the Green Belt it is necessary that there are compensatory 
improvements to the Green Belt within the local area.  This may include Edlington Ancient 
Woodland or Edlington Pit Wo od.

  Finningley  
Settlement Profile  
16.210.  Lying to the east of Doncaster, Finningley is one of the smaller Service Towns and Villages in 
the Borough.  Physically and historically, the settlement is closely related to the now Doncaster 
– Sheffield Airport ( forme rly RAF Finningley), which lies immediately adjacent to the settlement.  
This airbase, with a 2,700m long runway, was home to a V -Force of Vulcan bombers in the 
latter twentieth century .  However , the airbase closed in 1996 following the end of the Cold Wa r, 
fully reopening to passengers as a commercial airport in 2005  – although now considered to 
relate to the neighbouring village of Auckley – Hayfield Green . 
 
16.211.  Finningley is part of a cluster of villages to the east of the Borough, also including Auckley - 
Hayfield Green and the Defined  Villages of Branton and Blaxton.  In particular, the settlements 
of Finningley and Auckley – Hayfield Green provide a service function for these villages.  
 
16.212.  Links to central Doncaster have improved recently following the compl etion of the Great 
Yorkshire Way in 2018 between the M18 near Rossington and the Airport, although residents 
still have to travel around the Airport  via Blaxton to reach this .  Despite the Doncaster – Lincoln 
railway line lying to the north of the settleme nt, there has not been a passenger service to the 
settlement since 1961 ; although the 2018 Doncaster – Sheffield Airport Masterplan states its 
ambition for a train line and station to be developed at the Airport w hich would also serve 
residents of Finningl ey.  The Local Plan has a separate policy (Policy 6) related to the Airport. 
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.213.  Finningley  is designated  as a Service Town  and Village .  Existing commitments remaining to be 
delivered in the settlement from permissions (50 units remaining),  means  it is not deemed 
necessary to allocate any further land in this settlement.  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.214.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are permissions for 50 d wellings on sites large enough to allocate 
through the Local Plan (5+ units remaining) .  Any additional allocations would require land 
currently designated as countryside  which is not justified .

  Sprotbrough  
Settlement Profile  
16.215.  Sprotbrough Village is a settlement immediately to the west of Doncaster, separated from the 
Main Urban Area  to the east by the A1(M).  Travelling through the settlement represents a 
transition from urban to rural, and beyond Sprotbroug h lies swathes of rural Green Belt, which is 
tightly drawn around the settlement.  
 
16.216.  The village has excellent access to central Doncaster via Melton Road.  However, despite lying 
immediately adjacent to the A1(M), there is no direct access to this.  The Riv er Don passes to 
the south of the village, providing a picturesque waterside setting for the settlement, including 
the seventeenth century Boat Inn.  
 
16.217.  For the purposes of the Local Plan , Sprotbrough Village refers to the settlement west of the 
A1(M), with dwellings to the east of this falling within the Main Urban Area . 
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.218.  Sprotbrough  is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  There are no planning permissions 
with units remaining in this location and a lack of potential urban and non -Green Belt sites, 
meaning greenfield Green Belt land needs to be considered for release.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.219.  The local community are currently preparing a neighbourhood plan which will cover the village 
and land within the par ish boundary to the east of the A1(M).  
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.220.  As at 1 April 2018, there are no permissions for the village on sites large enough to allocate 
through the Local Pan (5+ units remaining) .  A single greenfield urban extension , on land 
formerly designated as Green Belt , to the north of Cadeby Road and to the west of the village is 
allocated for 80 new homes.  Any further allocations would require an additional , and very 
substantial , Green Belt site which is  not justified, nor can exceptional circumstances be 
demonstrated for further Green Belt.

  Tickhill 
Settlement Profile  
16.221.  Tickhill is an attractive market town lying tow ards the south-east of the Borough, close to the 
Borough boundary with Nottinghamshire.  It is physically isolated from urban Doncaster, with 
access via Rossington on the B643 or Wadworth and Loversall on the A60.  It lies close to the 
settlement of Bawtry , as well as the Harworth and Bircotes in Nottinghamshire (to the South 
East) and has access to Maltby in Rotherham, approximately four miles to the west via the 
A631.  The A1(M) runs to the east of the settlement, however this completely bypasses Tickhill . 
  
16.222.  The settlement is relatively nucleated and has its origins in Norman times when a castle was 
constructed  here in the eleventh century.  The main built from of the settlement lies to the north 
of the castle  and expanded in the later twentieth century.  
Settlement Role and Function (in the Local Plan)  
16.223.  Tickhill  is designated as a Service Town  and Village .  There are no planning permissions with 
capacity remaining and a lack of suitable urban sites in the settlement.  Additionally, aside from 
a tightly drawn  Green Belt boundary, many site options in the settlement are restricted due to 
access issues which result from Tickhill’s more rural elements.  That said, a single allocation of 
74 units has been identified on land in the settlement which was formerly Green Belt.  
 
16.224.  In the retail hierarchy Tickhill is a District Centre; proposals will be supported which protect, 
maintain and enhance its vitality and viability.  
Neighbourhood Planning  
16.225.  The Tickhill Neighbourhood Plan was adopted in the context of the previous C ore Strategy and 
so proposes no housing  allocations . 
Employment Policy Areas (Policy 4) 
16.226.  There is one existing employment site close to Tickhill:  
 
 Stripe Road Industrial Estate – a site with predominately warehousing uses s ituated within 
countryside  in the Green Belt.   
Housing Allocations (Policy 5) 
16.227.  As at 1 April 2018,  there are no permissions  large enough to allocate and only a single site, 
equating to 74 units, has been assessed through the Local Plan site selection methodology as 
being supportable for allocation.  Other sites were dismissed either due to importance to Green 
Belt purposes or problems with creating a safe and viable access , from a Highways 
Development Management perspective , given the very rural nature of some of the road network 
around the settlement.  Some sites are ruled out for both o f these reasons.

Sequential approach  Considering options for sites for development in a particular order. For  
example, in terms of new shops, we would first look for sites within a 
shopping centre and then for  sites on the edge of the shopping cent re 
before looking at sites outside the centre. The same approach  is applied 
to finding land at lowest risk of flooding for most types of development 
before support is given to sites at medium -high risk .

woodland from deliberate damage and destruction.  
Unconventional 
Hydrocarbons  Resource  An umbrella term for oil and natural gas that is produced by means that 
do not meet the criteria for conventional production. What has qualified 
as unconventional at any particular time is a complex function of 
resourc e characteristics, the available exploration and production 
technologies, the economic environment, and the scale, frequency and 
duration of production from the resource. Perceptions of these factors 
inevitably change over time and often differ among users  of the term. At 
present, the term is used in reference to oil and gas resources whose 
porosity, permeability, fluid trapping mechanism, or other characteristics 
differ from conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Coalbed 
methane, gas hydrates, sh ale gas, fractured reservoirs, and tight gas 
sands are considered unconventional resources. (Sourced from the 
Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com ).

  Appendix  2: Development Requirements  
 
The Site Development Requirements  set out various and specific requirements for the development  of 
the allocated sites and identify any necessary additional work or studies that need to be undertaken  or 
where specific developer contributions may be required .  The requirements cover issues such as 
archaeology, design, education contributions, etc., but they are not an exclusive list.  If there is dispute 
as to  the protection of identified on -site features or specific land use requirements, or about the need to  
submit particular assessments or details, it will be the responsibility of the developer to produce  robust 
and proportionate evidence to justify a departure from the stated requirements .  Site Development 
Requirements have not been identified where sites have been granted p lanning  permission or 
development has commenced, or where a site does not require specific development  guidelines.

  Housing Sites  
Site MUA46 ; Land Between  Sheffield R oad and Warmsworth Hal t, Warmsworth ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 112 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The site has been fields since at least 1854. Apart from the entrance to a former 
tunnel in the southwest part of the site, the potential for the survival of 
unrecorded buried archa eological remains below the plough zone is considered 
to be moderate. Further archaeological investigation may be required if the site 
is brought forward for development.  
Biodiversity  Development should retain and buffer mature trees, hedgerows and copses . 
Biodiversity enhancements should be focused on extending the habitat 
(grassland/scrub mosaic) corridor that runs along the western side of the site 
and south along Warmsworth Halt.   
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in  the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
accessibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council.  
Design  The scheme should develop pedestrian and cycle connections through the site 
between Sheffield Road and Warmsworth Halt. Properties fronting Sheffield 
Road must be set back along similar building lines to the existing ho using, with 
private drives to the front. The layout must ensure existing private boundaries 
are locked together on the eastern edge of the site to ensure security. 
Landscaped buffers should be included along the western and southern edges 
of the site to so ften the settlement edge and provide a buffer between adjacent 
uses . In the interests of creating a new strong, defensible, and likely to be 
permanent Green Belt boundary in this location, a clearly defined site boundary 
should be formed to the western lim it of the site, using suitably tall, dense and 
continuous hedgerow or tree planting. This could form the periphery to wider on 
site efforts to provide a visual softening between countryside and urban forms, 
or be used as plot boundaries, but must define th e actual site limits in a clear 
and linear fashion.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space will be required.  
 
258   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA46 ; Land Between  Sheffield R oad and Warmsworth Hal t, Warmsworth ; MUA  
Transport  There are possible access issues serving site from A630 due to proximity to  the 
quarry entrance. It may be possible to serve the site from Warmsworth Halt in 
accordance with Manual for Streets. The site will require an extension to the 
existing provision to serve the site frontage. There is bus service provision but 
it is likely to require infrastructure for additional stops. A Transport Assessment 
& Travel Plan will be required. The site may require a routing agreement during 
construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The northern (hedge developing into mostly trees) and western (solid hed ge) 
boundaries are recorded as far back as 1838 and provide important wildlife 
corridors from the open countryside, whilst the southern boundary is more 
fragmented. Development should retain and buffer mature trees, hedgerows 
and copses.  
 
Site MUA47; Stev ens Road, Balby ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 69 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Remains associated with the demolished late C19th / early C20th wagon works are likely 
to be considered of local archaeological significance. The construction of the works is likel y 
to have truncated any earlier buried remains below their footprint, and the potential for 
survival of buried remains pre -dating the wagon works is considered to be low to moderate. 
Further archaeological investigation may be required if the site is broug ht forward for 
development. The nature and extent of investigation should be discussed with South 
Yorkshire Archaeology Service.  
Biodiversity  The site is adjacent to Balby Littlemoor Local Wildlife Site. The habitats on the site would 
need to be assessed by appropriate surveys. The development should provide a wooded 
corridor along the railway line and a buffer to the local wildlife site as well as compensation 
for any habitat losses. Ideally the established tree line should be retained.  
Design  New develo pment should create a green corridor and pedestrian route through the site 
along the axis of the existing Public Right of Way to link the site to the west with Stevens 
Road. New gardens should back onto existing properties to lock rear gardens together in 
a secure layout.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
 
259   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA47; Stev ens Road, Balby ; MUA  
Public Open Space  Open space should be provided on site.  
Transport  Access via Stevens Road. There are a number of Section 106 agreements as a result of 
previous applications on this site. Improvements are required to Stevens Road / Littlemoor 
Lane / Florence Avenue Junction as part of the Section 278 agreement.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The established tree line would make use and permeability of the site more problematic. 
A decision  on retention will need to be based upon arboricultural merit determined by a 
BS5837 survey.  
 
Site MUA48; South of Alverley Lane, Balby ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 150 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The potential for the survival of previously unrecorded bu ried archaeological 
remains is considered to be moderate.  Further  archaeological investigations 
may be required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  A habitat buffer should be provided to the south of the site to protect and 
enhance the adjacent  local wildlife site (2.24) and the wider ecological corridor.  
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
acce ssibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council.  
Design  New development should front toward Alverley Lane and ensure existing 
private boundar ies are locked together on the eastern edge of the site to 
guarantee security. New development should explore opportunities to create 
pedestrian and cycle linkages to the greenway to the southern edge of the site. 
Sufficient separation should be maintained  by new homes from the southern 
boundary to minimise overshadowing and impact on existing trees.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The site will require a comprehensive GI plan with green space and play 
provis ion. 
Transport  There are likely capacity issues and the junction of Alverley Lane and A60 due 
to width of Alverley Lane and the geometry of the junction. There are traffic 
 
260   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA48; South of Alverley Lane, Balby ; MUA  
calming measures along Alverley Lane and therefore the development will 
need to loo k at designing out existing excessive speed issues along the site 
frontage, although frontage development to Alverley Lane will assist in doing 
this naturally. The site should be accessed from Alverley Lane in accordance 
with Manual for Streets. A new foot way along the site frontage will be required. 
The site should provide pedestrian / cycle access to Conisbrough - Woodfield 
cycle route from the south eastern corner of the site. A Transport Assessment 
& Travel Plan are required and the site may require a r outing agreement during 
construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The densely treed Trans Pennine Trail forms the southern boundary; there 
should be an adequate buffer zone to avoid tree felling and encroachment in 
this location.  
 
Site MUA49; Weston R oad, Balby ; MUA 
Indicative  Site Capacity: 92 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Loversall Hospital had been built over the entire site by 1972, and is likely to have 
caused substantial sub -surface disturbance. As such, the potential for the survival of 
unrecorded buried archaeo logical remains on the site is considered to be low. Further 
archaeological investigation is unlikely to be required.  
Biodiversity  Substantial habitat losses would require compensation.  Biodiversity net gain should 
be ensured .  As much possible of the bo undary vegetation to the site should be 
retained, particularly along the northern and eastern boundary.  
Conservation & 
Heritage  Retention or some new planting of trees on the allocation site would complement the 
site as a whole and the heritage assets nea rby.   
Design  New development should front toward the access road. Overlooked pedestrian and 
cycle connections are required in the north and south east corners of the site to 
connect to the adjacent footpaths. Sufficient separation should be maintained fr om 
the boundaries to minimise overshadowing and impact on existing trees.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The site will require a Green Infrastructure plan with green space and play provision.  
 
261   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA49; Weston R oad, Balby ; MUA 
Transport  Layout must provide linkages to the shared footway / cycleway to the East of the site, 
providing access to the existing Woodfield development. These linkages should be 
an integral part of the planning layout.  
 
Access from Weston Road to the development become s heavily congested with 
associated parking during school term time. This limits the available carriageway 
space and may inhibit two -way traffic from the development at times. Furthermore, 
there is only a footway on one side of the carriageway along part o f this road. As 
such, it is requested that a scheme to widen and improve this section is included in 
the application. It should be noted that the land (verge) to the east of the road is public 
highway. The site may require a routing agreement during constr uction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  To the south of the site is an offsite tree with a TPO (potential shading/dominance 
issues); The site benefits from a good strong green eastern boundary hedge line 
providing definition and separating off Farnley Road to the east.  Layouts must be 
informed by a tree survey.  
 
Site MUA50; East of Warning Tongue Lane ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity:  275 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The site has been fields from at least 1854. Ploughing may have truncated sub -surface 
archaeological features  but deep ground disturbance within the site is limited. The potential 
for buried archaeological remains below the level impacted by ploughing is therefore 
considered to be moderate to high. The site is of uncertain archaeological significance and 
therefor e further archaeological investigations are likely to be required to inform 
development proposals.  
Biodiversity  There are local wildlife sites to the north west and south east of this site. Woodland 
planting/landscaping (including a woodland edge margin) should aim to try and establish 
a corridor between these sites.  
Design  New development must front toward Warning Tongue Lane set back behind frontage cul -
de-sac streets and landscaping mirroring the layout of existing homes to the west side of 
Warning Ton gue Lane opposite the site. Development should front toward Doncaster Road 
 
262   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA50; East of Warning Tongue Lane ; MUA  
set back behind private drives where the site is at similar level to Doncaster Road. The site 
layout should enable potential pedestrian and cycle connection points to the neighbouri ng 
site to the north and east adjacent to the roundabout as this is likely to be developed in the 
future. Sufficient separation should be maintained from the southern boundary and M18 to 
minimise noise, air pollution, overshadowing and impact on existing t rees.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The site will require a Green Infrastructure plan with green space and play provision.  
Transport  Access to B1396 / Doncaster Road designed in accordance with DMRB stand ards. 
Visibility to 85%ile WWS. Part of site frontage to B1396 / Doncaster Road is along 
embankment to road bridge.  
 
There are possible access issues due to site frontage on the inside of bend on Warning 
Tongue Lane creating visibility problems, and acces sibility issues due to location. There 
are also sustainability issues to be overcome with location  – there is poor access to local 
centre, services and amenities, and limited bus service provision. A Transport Assessment 
& Travel Plan will be required. The  site may require a routing agreement during 
construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The hedge across the centre of the site (running north to south) is present on an 1842 map 
of 'Brampton in the Parish of Cantley'. Depending upon its condition it should be 
consi dered for retention and enhancement and linked to an enhanced network of internal 
green corridors. Trees are restricted to the boundaries and a BS5837 survey will be 
required, the findings of which should inform, amongst other constraints, the design 
proce ss.

Archaeology  The extent of sub -surface disturbance within the site may be limited. The potential for 
the preservation of unrecorded buried archae ology is considered to be moderate. 
The possible route of a Roman road is depicted on historic mapping within the

southern part of the buffer, though is not recorded in the SMR. Further archaeological 
investigations may be required to inform development pr oposals.  
Conservation & Heritage  New development should be 2 storey to retain subservience to listed buildings. 
Retention of limestone boundary walls would retain local character.  
Design  New development should front toward Carr House Road and seek to cre ate 
pedestrian linkages through the site between Carr House Road and Benne tthorpe. 
New properties should back onto existing rear gardens to lock them together with 
appropriate separation distances between existing properties.  
Education  A contribution towa rds education will be required.  
Public Open Space  Due to the site being severed from other local open spaces, on -site open space 
suitable for play provision would be required.  
Transport  There will be a need for a closure to the gap in the central reserve  on Bennetthorpe 
located opposite the new access. There should be closure of the redundant vehicular 
access into the site. Access from both Bennetthorpe and Carr House Road to be left 
in left out only. Access should be from Carr House Road (access adjacent  to toilet 
block is preferred). This access should be redesigned with visibility requirements in 
accordance with Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. A routing agreement will be 
required during construction; a Transport Assessment and Travel Plan will also  be 
required due to proximity and potential impact on Racecourse Roundabout (capacity 
assessment will be required).  
 
Site MUA53; Hungerhill , North of Thorne Road, Edenthorpe; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 542 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Potential archaeolog ical impacts. The application area is of archaeological interest but 
work must be done to inform this. A geophysical survey of the site is recommended.  
Biodiversity  An overall ecological survey of the site is required to assess ecological impacts and ensu re 
species protection, no net biodiversity loss, and the application of a mitigation hierarchy.  
Design  New homes should front towards Barnby Dun Road, Hungerhill Lane and Thorne Road – 
with the existing character of the latter (TPO’d  trees and set back h ouses) reflected on 
this site. Depending on the access solution from Thorne Road, it will be important to create 
 
264   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA53; Hungerhill , North of Thorne Road, Edenthorpe; MUA  
a welcoming gateway to the site here, with homes and landscaping addressing the 
entrance. Homes on the western edge will require larger than av erage rear gardens to 
offset the overshadowing of the treed railway embankment, and consideration must be 
given to overhead power lines on the site.  
 
Prior to the submission of any reserved matters application a design guide is to be agreed 
with the Local Planning Authority which will inform all subsequent reserved matters 
applications on the site.  
 
Many of the trees around the edges of the site and along Hungerhill Lane appear worth of 
retention, a tree survey should be undertaken. There should be pedestri an and cycle 
connectivity across the site in all directions.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space should be provided and be suitable for children’s play. There is the 
opportunity for this to f orm a central feature of the site. Given the scale, smaller open 
spaces should also be provided across the site in addition to this.  
Transport  The points of connection to the highways are existing – a fourth arm on Sandall Stones 
Road roundabout and Hera ld Road, a fifth arm stub end arm on the (Sainsbury’s) 
roundabout at the junction of the A18 and A630. With improvements to West Moor Link, 
the Herald Road access may be subject to change. The design approach and highways 
technical requirements are to be i n accordance with those contained within the South 
Yorkshire Residential Design Guide. May require a routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  Access should avoid TPO’d trees, which can be done by using existing accesses. The 
layout of the proposed development shall be based on the need to retain all British 
Standard 5837: 2012 Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction – 
Recommendations category B trees within the site and overhanging / adjacent to the 
boundaries.

  Site MUA54 ; East  of Carolina Way , Lakeside (Plot 5A); MUA  
Archaeology  Uncertain archaeological significance. Further archaeological investigations are likely to 
be required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  The site has biodiversity value and forms part of a wider network of connected and 
biodiverse greenspaces Habitat losses would need to be accounted for and would 
require compensation, which should contribute to the quality of the ecological network. 
This coul d potentially be delivered via a biodiversity net gain  approach, subject to 
assessment of the habitats being lost and availability of suitable receptor sites   
Design  Proposals on this site should reflect the requirements of the Development Brief which 
has been prepared by the Local Planning Authority.  Existing pedestrian desire lines and 
routes should be accommodated in the layout. New development must be outward 
looking on all sides of the site, fronting toward Carolina Way, Lakeside Boulevard, the 
lake basin and footpaths / greenways to the west and southern edges. A landmark 
development response to the Lakeside Boulevard / Carolina Way roundabout corner is 
desirable. Homes should be set back from the existing landscaped edges by sufficient 
distance and existing vegetation with trees subject to survey and retained where ever 
possible.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The site will require onsite open space; consideration should be given to the likely needs 
of the residents based on the type of development delivered.  
Transport  Access to be taken from Carolina Way, designed in accordance with the technical 
requirements contained in the South Yorkshire Residential Design Guide.  
 
Visibility splay – 2.4m x 43m re quired and appears achievable. Linkages to existing 
network of footpaths required as part of any forthcoming application.  
 
Design of access junction to consider existing bus stop location.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The advance planted avenue of trees along Caroli na Way should be retained and 
allowed adequate tree -to-development distances for future growth.

Archaeology  The site is assessed as having ‘Uncerta in archaeological constraint’. Further 
archaeological investigation may be required when the site is brought forward for 
development. The assessment summarised that the site was part of fields in 1779, 
and by the 1930s the site was located on the eastern e dge of Doncaster Airport . 
Modern aerial photographs show that a lake was constructed around the turn of the 
century, immediately outside the western site boundary. In order to clarify the 
likelihood that buried archaeological features survive here, it is r ecommended that a 
more detailed desk -based assessment be prepared in the first instance, taking into 
consideration both information on the construction of the lake and associated land -
forming, as well as an archaeological review of any ground investigation  works. This 
assessment should then be discussed with South Yorkshire Archaeology Service to 
determine the need for and scope of any further archaeological investigation that may 
be required in relation to any planning proposal.  
Biodiversity  The site has biodiversity value and forms part of a wider network of connected and 
biodiverse greenspaces. Habitat losses would need to be accounted for and would 
require compensation, which should contribute to the quality of the ecological 
network. This could potenti ally be delivered via a biodiversity net gain  approach, 
subject to assessment of the habitats being lost and availability of suitable receptor 
sites.  
Conservation & Heritage  No conservation requirements.  
Design  Proposals on this site should reflect the r equirements of the Development Brief which 
has been prepared by the Local Planning Authority. The central part of the site should 
be laid out as an area of public open space. The open space should be overlooked 
by development and meet relevant guidance and  standards. In addition there may 
need to be further open space contribution in the local area. Existing footpaths 
through the centre of the site and around the edges of the plots / lake should be 
retained and overlooked by the fronts of new development wi th new footpath / cycle 
linkages provided connecting to these from within the new development parcels at 
convenient points. The layout should provide properties fronting outward on all sides 
of the two main development parcels creating a robust block struc ture. Fronting 
Lakeside Boulevard, properties should echo the scale, siting, building lines and 
enclosure of those homes and apartments on the opposite side of the street. 
Properties must front toward the lake, exploiting the attractive views in that direc tion 
and providing active frontage and surveillance to the lakeside promenade.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space should be provided, with consideration given to the likely users 
(based on th e types of dwellings delivered) and their likely needs. The pre -existing 
central section gives opportunity for this. An additional contribution to an offsite open 
space may also be required.  
Transport  Pre- formed accesses to the site. Transport Statement required. May require a routing 
agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The advance planted boundary landscaping and tree planting should be retained and 
allowed adequate tree -to-development distances for future growth; the same goes 
for the adva nce planted avenue of trees along Carolina Way. Tree surveys should 
inform the layout.

Archaeology  This site has a high potential for the survival of significant archaeologi cal remains 
associated with Roman period pottery production and associated settlement, agriculture 
and pottery production. Given this evidence, further consideration of the impact on these 
will be required to establish the site’s capacity for development.  
 
A programme of archaeological evaluation (expected to be a combination of geophysical 
survey and trial trenching) will need to be discussed and agreed with the South Yorkshire 
Archaeology Service at an early stage. It will be key that this evaluation is completed at 
the design stage. The evaluation will characterise the nature, extent and state of 
preservation of the archaeological remains present on the site and provide information to 
ensure the design minimises any impact upon significant archaeological  areas.  
 
A Heritage Statement detailing how the results of the evaluation have informed the design 
of the scheme can then be submitted alongside any planning application. This Heritage 
Strategy will also detail the proposed mitigation measures where less significant 
archaeological evidence will be impacted by the proposed scheme. The proposed 
mitigation will be designed to ensure that an understanding of the archaeological evidence 
affected is gained before that evidence is lost or damaged.  
Biodiversity  The woodland / Local Wildlife Site to the northern part of the site should be protected with 
a buffer zone of planting.  Similarly the corridor along the railway line could be enhanced 
with additional planting. The site has biodiversity value and forms part  of a wider network 
of connected and biodiverse greenspaces. Habitat losses would need to be accounted for 
and would require compensation, which should contribute to the quality of the ecological 
network. This could potentially be delivered via a biodivers ity net gain  approach, subject 
to assessment of the habitats being lost and availability of suitable receptor sites  
Design  Proposals on this site should reflect the requirements of the Development Brief which has 
been prepared by the Local Planning Autho rity. New development should connect to the 
Avenue. Existing informal footpath routes, desire lines and connections should be 
incorporated into the layout.  Buildings should front toward the racecourse set back behind 
a soft landscaped edge.  Sufficient se paration should be maintained from the northern 
boundary to reduce overshadowing and impact on existing trees, and from the eastern / 
 
268   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA56; Rosehill, Cantley ; MUA  
southern boundary to minimise noise from the railway. Existing properties at site edges 
should be backed onto with suffici ent separation and rear gardens locked together for 
security. Public open space should be located to the north of the site adjacent to the 
woodland.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space includi ng play should be provided, given severance from other open 
spaces in the area.  
Transport  The site is potentially accessed through the existing Rose Hill Rise and The Avenue cul -
de-sacs. A Transport Assessment & Travel Plan will be required. Section 6.6 o f the 
disposal brief states that the concentration of outbound traffic at peak times is likely to 
result in excessive queuing on Rose Hill and potential unacceptable queuing and delays 
for motorists. The Transport Assessment will assess the operational cap acity of the 
network and identify any measures required to mitigate against this. A residential travel 
plan will be required, and a routing agreement may be required during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The existing site boundaries include mixed species  hedgerows with numerous mature 
trees within them. It will be a requirement of the development that these hedgerows and 
trees are retained and enhanced through additional and appropriate planting. Boundary 
oaks should be designed in as per the design brief . Layout should be informed by a tree 
survey.  
 
Site MUA57; Former Wheatley Hills Middle School, Leger Way, Wheatley ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 134 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The site has been assessed as of ‘Uncertain archaeological constraint’ to futu re allocation. 
Further discussion with South Yorkshire Archaeology Service, archaeological advisers to 
Doncaster MBC, suggests that the area of the former school (the western portion of the 
site) can be considered to have a low archaeological potential but  that the area of former 
playing fields (the eastern portion of the site) can be considered to have an unknown 
archaeological potential. As the site lies close to the projected route of the Cantley spur, 
the Roman road running north towards Long Sandall, f urther consideration of the 
archaeological potential of this part of the site will be required. South Yorkshire 
 
269   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA57; Former Wheatley Hills Middle School, Leger Way, Wheatley ; MUA  
Archaeology Service advise that archaeological evaluation will help to establish the 
presence/absence, significance and condition of any archaeo logical heritage assets 
surviving on the site and should be undertaken prior to the submission of any planning 
application. Any planning application can then be supported by a report that discusses the 
results of the evaluation and outlines the impact of t he development proposal on any 
identified archaeological evidence, as well as any mitigation measures proposed. 
Evaluation is expected to take the form of trial trenching.  
Biodiversity  The site borders a designated local wildlife site. Landscaping should be used to buffer this. 
Biodiversity compensation for habitat losses should be steered towards enhancing the 
quality of neighbouring Local Wildlife Site.  
Design  Proposals on this site should reflect the requirements of the Development Brief which has 
been  prepared by the Local Planning Authority. New development should front toward 
Leger Way and out from the site in a southerly and easterly direction toward the Golf 
Course. Development should be set back from existing trees and hedgerows at the edges 
of the site. Rear gardens should lock together with boundaries to the employment area to 
the north. Pedestrian linkages should be provided between Leger Way and Shaw Wood 
Way. Properties should either front or be side on to Shaw Wood Way to help enliven this 
street with a mixed use character.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space should be provided. Sport England have also suggested a sum in the 
region of £255,000 should be provided to mitigate the lo ss of the playing fields, with the 
money to go to improving other local playing fields.  
Transport  It is expected that access from Leger Way will need to be more than just a simple priority 
junction. Access to sites to the east of Leger Way have prohibited  right turns and therefore 
consideration needs to be given to the most appropriate type of junction and the potential 
issues in proving an acceptable design should not be underestimated. Access may be 
possible from Shaw Wood Way subject to agreement with t he landowner, and the road 
being brought up to adoptable standards.  
 
Any access proposals are to be supported by a full technical operation analysis using the 
most appropriate methodology, considering the local context and level of congestion that 
occurs o n this part of the network at times. The access(s) shall also be subject to Road 
Safety audits in accordance with DMRB HD 19/15.  
 
The development will need to ensure that safe, secure pedestrian and cycle linkages are 
provided within and to the existing lo cal network.  
A robust Transport Assessment and Travel Plan will be required. A cumulative developer 
contribution will be sought for the A630 Westmoor Link Improvement scheme.  
Trees & Hedgerows  There are few internal trees – a decent pine and two squat you ng-mature oaks; the more 
notable features would appear to be the mature boundary trees which should, as 
appropriate, be straightforwardly retained within any scheme. Very important are the 
highways’ trees on the verge – these are an important feature of a larger landscaping 
scheme and efforts to minimise their loss and maximise mitigation/compensation will need 
to be demonstrated. All should be subject to BS5837 tree surveys.

  Site MUA58; West of Sandy Lane, Doncaster ; MUA  
Indicative Site Capacity: 39 d wellings  
 
Archaeology  The potential for survival of significant buried archaeology within the site is 
considered to be low.   Further archaeological investigations are unlikely to be 
required.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses would require compensation. This could be delivered via biodiversity 
offsetting. The site is part of a large network of greenspace which includes the 
lakeside POS and LWS, parcels of woodland and allotments. Development on this 
site should retain the mature treeline along the southern and  eastern boundaries, and 
possibly others subject to site survey. Biodiversity Offsetting could be used to deliver 
necessary compensation.  
Conservation & Heritage  The heritage assets on site should be subject to a historic and architectural analysis. 
This should in particular include the two pumping station and piers and railings to the 
entrance. Any scheme should look in depth at the potential to retain all or some  of 
these heritage assets and full justification provided for the final form of the 
developme nt. 
Design   New development should seek to retain the existing frontage composition of trees 
and boundary railings / pillars. The layout should include provision for east west 
pedestrian and cycle linkages to enable routes to be created to the land and 
development sites to the west.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum will be required to improve open space at Rufford Road.  
Transport  Issues with right turning vehicles from Sandy Lane to Carr House  Road and 
associated capacity / road safety concerns. Access from Sandy Lane designed in 
accordance with Manual for Streets. Major congestion issues along Sandy Lane due 
to the proximity of 2 primary schools. Transport Assessment & Travel Plan may be 
requi red due to proximity to school. Routing agreement during construction required . 
Trees & Hedgerows  The site contains linear plantings of mature trees along the eastern and southern 
boundaries and part of the northern boundary, which should be retained. The  siting 
and orientation of dwellings and size of gardens should take account of shading 
issues from trees and allow adequate tree -to-development distances.

Archaeology  The site has been drained and in agricultural use since probably the 17th century, and this 
may have impacted on the preservation of archaeological remains, though excavation 
within the western part of the site has indicated that buried archaeology does surv ive below 
the zone impacted by ploughing. Further remains are likely to survive within the 
undisturbed areas of the site. The footings of Carr Lodge may also survive. Some 
archaeological evaluation has already been undertaken within the site, and it is hig hly likely 
that further archaeological investigation will be required when the site is brought forward 
for development.  
Biodiversity  This site represents a substantial proportion of the green corridor that runs through to 
Potteric Carr SSSI. Important wil dlife features include the numerous hedgerows, 
woodlands, Division drain and extensive grasslands. Biodiversity impacts will need to be 
accounted for and compensation provided. Ecological buffers will be required along 
Division drain and along retained woo dlands, and mature tree lines and hedgerows.    
Design  The Carr Lodge Design Code Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) exists for this site 
and seeks to maintain the high quality design principles secured in a now lapsed outline 
consent. In order to co -ordinate the delivery of community facilities, the local centre, parks 
and areas of public open space a refreshed masterplan and delivery strategy for the 
remaining phases of development shall be developed in consultation with the local 
community and Counci l, and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to the 
determination of any further applications for development on this site. Unless otherwise 
agreed by the LPA, the refreshed Masterplan and Delivery Strategy should accord with the 
main design and l ayout principles for the site contained within the adopted Carr Lodge 
SPD.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space will be required across the site.  
Transport  Subject to outline approval and sub sequent reserved matters applications. There may be 
issues to resolve from the first phase related to development platforms and the size of 
ditches running through the site. A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan will be required. 
Links onto Woodfield Gree nway should be provided.   Bus accessibility is a concern which 
must be addressed. Development may require a routing agreement during construction.

Conservation & Heritage  The buildings on site are considered to be of local interest and add to the current 
townscape. Retention and sensitive conversion of these should be undertaken.  
Design  Ideally new development will re -use, adapt or partially redevelop the existing on -site 
buildings and retain existing boundary w alls in whole or part. If this is unfeasible, new 
development should front toward King Edward Road, Victoria Road and Florence 
Avenue to complete the block, with buildings positioned and designed to respect 
existing building lines of surrounding streets, p roperty heights, boundary treatments 
and local character.

Archaeology  The presence or otherwise of significant archaeology on the site is unknown.  Contact 
the South Yorkshire Archaeological Service (SYAS) as to whether any further 
archaeolo gical investigations are required if the site is brought forward for 
development.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses should be accounted for and appropriate compensation provided.  
Mature trees on site should be retained where possible subject to the results of a tree 
survey.  The buildings proposed for demolition would require bat surveys.  
Conservation & Heritage  Due to its elevated location the distinctive white tower and dome of the listed church 
of St Peter is visible from Cedar Road across the open grounds o f the site. 
Maintaining some open space and/or building in sightlines from Cedar Road towards 
the church above and around any new buildings should mitigate any impact on views.  
Design  New development should be of a suburban character appropriate to the ar ea. The 
layout should incorporate semi -detached properties fronting Cedar Road. Rear 
gardens of new homes should back onto existing rear gardens to the north and west 
in a secure layout.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be required.

Archaeology  The layout and design should be informed by a programme of archaeological evaluation 
to be agreed with South Yorkshire Archaeology and undertaken at an early stage.  
Biodive rsity  Along the southern / south -western boundary of the site there should be a significant 
wildlife corridor, a minimum of 25 -30m in width. This should form part of the public space 
on the site rather than being enclosed in gardens so that wildlife value can be maximised. 
The loss of wildlife on the site should be assessed using a biodiversity net gain calcuation  
metric in order to quantify the habitat loss and calculate an appropriate amount of 
compensation. Given the size of the site it is expected that a good proportion of the 
compensation would be delivered off site.  
Design  A development brief has been produced for the part of the site owned by  the Council. 
Access to the site should predominantly be from Sandringham Road, with a secondary 
connection no rthward to Cross Bank  and to access the northern part of the site . The 
northern side of the access road will require landscape screening to the rear of the existing 
terrace properties alleyway. There is the potential for this site to provide access to 
neighbouring sites to the east and the layout should make provision for this. The southern 
part of the site should be laid out as an area of public open space to meet local 
requirements and to act as a buffer to the sewage works. Although the green infrastruct ure 
corridor of 25 -30m width which should be developed along the site’s southern / south -
western edge. This buffer should include informal recreation routes which provide potential 
future linkages to the land to the east through the green wedge to Carr Lod ge. The open 
space should be overlooked by development. It should provide screening along the 
southern edge as part of the ecological corridor along this edge. There is a need to provide 
appropriate stand -off distances from existing residential development  along the northern 
and southern edges of the site.  New housing should provide a frontage to Cross Bank.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space is required with the potential to locate this to th e adjacent open space 
to create a larger area.  
Transport  Vehicular access should be taken from Sandford Road / Sunningdale Road by extending 
the existing turning head into the site. The principle of this is considered acceptable subject 
to pedestrian / c ycle connectivity to Cross Bank, and a satisfactory technical assessment 
 
275   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MUA 63; Cross Bank , Balby; MUA  
being undertaken. Street layout should follow guidance in the South Yorkshire Residential 
Design Guide. There should also be convenient linkages from the site to the adjacent 
footway and cycleway networks including retaining the potential for connection to the 
informal footpaths across land to the east of the site.  
Trees & Hedgerows  A tree survey is required. This site includes a potentially valuable piece of urban woodland. 
Tree loss  is only justifiable if the trees survey poorly.  
Other  Yorkshire Water are unlikely to support residential development within 200m of the 
Sewage Works due to the potential for odour nuisance and loss of amenity. Therefore any 
application for this use sho uld be informed by an odour assessment and include suitable 
mitigation where appropriate. New development would need to accommodate or divert the 
existing sewers and overhead power lines which cross the site, and the ditches at the 
edges, with suitable eas emen ts provided if retained in situ.  Potentially a landscape / 
acoustic barrier may be required adjacent the employment uses, subject to surveys.

Indicative Site Capacity: 26 dwellings  
 
Biodiversity  Habitat losses should be accounted for and appropriate compensation provided.  Mature 
trees on site should be retained where possible subject to the results of a tree survey.  The 
buildings proposed for demolition would require bat surveys.  
Design  New development should back rear gardens onto existing rear gardens and the adjacent 
school to create a secure layout. The site layout lends itself to the creation of a small area 
off POS in the centre of the site as a focal point for new homes aro und the edges.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space would be the preference for this site.  
Transport  A 2.4m x 43m visibility splay would be required at the junction with Cusworth Lane.  
 
Access  into the site could be via a footway crossover (similar to what is there now for a 
relatively minor development) and the width for a conventional residential street would be 
5.5m wide carriageway with 2m wide footways. For the access into the site this co uld be 
reduced to a 5.5m carriageway, 2m wide footway to one side and a 700mm wide hard

with consideration given to the amount of traffic on Cusworth Lane itself. See e xtract from 
South Yorkshire Residential Design guide below:  
 
“B.3.3.12  Junctions with 30mpg streets:  
 Design vehicle to be determined based on local land use considerations.  
 Where the average 2 way peak hour traffic flows on both the major and minor arm 
are less than 500vph, the design vehicle should be able to turn with the vehicle 
body leaving a 0.5 metres clearance to the carriageway edge on both the major 
and minor arms.  
 Where average peak hour 2 way traffic flow on the major arm exceeds 500 vph, 
the de sign vehicle should be able to turn without crossing into the opposing lane 
on the major arm.  
 When the average peak hour 2 way traffic flow on both arms exceeds 500 vph, 
the design vehicle should be able to turn without crossing into the opposing lane 
on both arms.”

The buildings proposed for demolition would require bat surveys.  
Design  New development should front toward May Avenue and Tickhill Road, with properties set 
back from Tickhill Road to respect established building lines and front boundaries retained 
as far as possible. A pedestrian / cycle route should be developed through the site between 
May Ave and Tickhill Road to improve pedestrian permeability and movement in the local

Biodiversity  Habitat losses should be accounted for and appropriate compensation provided.  
Mature trees on site should be retained where possible subject to the results of a tree 
survey. Th e site layout should provide an appropriate buffer from the woodland 
corridor to the south of the site.  
Conservation & Heritage  There is a thick belt of trees to the west and south boundaries of the proposed 
allocation site and these should be retained an d buildings kept to a maximum of two 
storeys to ensure there is no impact on the neighbouring Park and Garden of Local 
Historic Interest – Cusworth Hall and its historic parkland/grounds.  
Design  New development must front toward Thelluson Avenue. The matu re trees are a key 
characteristic of this site and any layout must be informed by a tree survey and

Archaeology  The site is of uncertain archaeological significance. Further archaeological investigations 
are likely to be required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  Mature trees should be retained where possible.  Habitat losses, would requi re 
compensation, and depending on the number of units proposed this may need to be offsite.  
Biodiversity net gain should be demonstrate d. 
Design  New development should back onto rear gardens of existing houses on all the boundaries 
of the site to ensure rear gardens are locked together. Properties should front onto 
Lutterworth Drive on the currently open part of the northern edge.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space should be provided or pote ntially a contribution towards improving an 
off-site open space.  
Transport  Access can be taken from Lutterworth Drive. Design in accordance with Manual for Streets. 
There may need to be re -location of the existing bus stop. Development may require a

Archaeology  Below the plough zone the potential for the survival of buried archaeological remains is 
considered to be high. Further archaeological investigations may be required to inform 
development proposals. The extent and scope of any requirement should be discussed 
with South Yorkshire Archaeology Service.  
Biodiversity  The layout and design of the development should provide for a broad green corridor with 
diverse vegetation structure, including tree cover, to enhance the connectivity of Shaw 
wood (8.23) and Long Plantation (8.20) Local Wildlife Sites, both of which are publically 
accessible.   
Design  New development should create a substantial well defined, multi -functional high quality, 
green wedge POS to the northern ha lf of the site adjacent West Moor Link Road. A high 
quality gateway area consisting of higher density housing should be formed around the 
access from Hatfield Lane. The layout should ensure convenient and overlooked 
pedestrian / cycle linkages to the exist ing housing areas to the south via connections to 
the existing pedestrian routes at Holly Dene, Fernbank Drive and Mere Lane. It should be 
designed to create a legible and secure block structure with a hierarchy of streets including 
a generously landscaped  main loop street with treed verges and focal spaces at key nodes. 
Rear gardens of new properties should lock together with existing rear gardens along the 
southern edge to provide a secure layout, albeit this may include landscape buffering / 
screening al ong this edge. New homes must front toward Hatfield Lane, Mere Lane  and 
the Green Wedge POS.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The site will require on site open space suitable for children’s play.  
Transport  This site was approved subject to S106 Agreement (16/02224/OUTM – Outline for up to 
400 dwellings). Access is to be taken from a new roundabout on Hatfield Lane to serve 
this site and land to the East of Hatfield Lane (granted under 12/00188/OUTM).  
 
Based  on the 400 dwellings there is a S106 contribution requirement towards the West 
Moor Link Improvement Scheme totalling £387,855. Furthermore there is a travel plan 
bond amount of £42,020

Site CD06; Between  Sheffield Road and Old Road, Conisbrough ; Conisbrough & Denaby  
Indicative Site Capacity: 200 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Due  to  the  relative  lack  of  deep  ground  disturbance,  the  potential  for  the  
survival  of  unrecorded  buried archaeological  remains  on  the  site  is  
considered  to  be  moderate. Further archaeological investigations may be 
required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  Refer to design section in terms of landscaping.  Species -rich hedgerows 
and/or a woodland belt should be incorporated into the landscaping to support 
nearby hedgerow networks some of which are Local Wildlife Sites, and the 
wooded corridor that stretches from Ravenfield Lakes throug h to Conisbrough 
North Cliff and Denaby Wood Local Wildlife Sites.  
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
accessibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council.  
Design  Considering the site's prominent location in the landscape, new development 
shoul d front toward both Sheffield Road and Old Road but be set back behind 
landscaped frontages. Buildings should have appropriate separation distances 
between existing properties on the edges of the site. The layout should seek to 
develop footpath connections  to existing streets to the north where possible.  
Pedestrian and cycle connections through the site should be developed 
between Sheffield Road and Old Road. Building heights should be limited to 2 -
2.5 storey.  
Education  A contribution towards education wi ll be required.  
Public Open Space  On site Green Infrastructure and children’s play space will be required, 
including play equipment.  
Transport  Access from C762 Old Road designed in accordance with DMRB resulting in

Site CD07; East of Hill Top Road, Conisbrough; Conisbrough & Denaby  
Indicative Site Capacity: 125 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Due to the relative lack of deep ground disturbance across the site, the potential for the 
survival of unrecorded buried archaeological remains is considered to be moder ate. 
Further archaeological assessment may be required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  The site forms part of a local wildlife site and the Dearne Valley Nature Improvement Area 
and development will be required to provide significant mitigat ion and compensation for 
any habitat and ecological connectivity losses. In addition the existing woodland needs to 
be retained and buffered from built development by at least 10m. The design of this site 
also needs to include a significant wide grassland/ habitat corridor through the development 
connecting the habitat in the north to the wider countryside. Biodiversity net gain should 
be demonstrate d. 
Design  Properties should front toward Hill Top Road and Bolton Street. The site is crossed by 
pedestrian r outes and desire lines which should be taken into account in the layout and 
fronted by new development. New homes should back onto existing bungalows at Hill Top 
Gardens and lock together rear gardens in a secure layout. Properties should front outward 
on the sites northern and eastern edges.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  The skate park which is currently on site should be retained, and this requires a 30 buffer 
to be maintained around it. Properties will n eed to front this to provide some surveillance. 
Additional on -site open space, or improving / making the space within the skate park buffer 
useable would also be welcome  – consideration would need to be given in this case to any 
additional buffers . 
Transp ort Access should not be taken from Hill Top Road, rather it should be taken from Bolton 
Street. This would require a footway along the site frontage. Visibility requirements in

  Site CD07; East of Hill Top Road, Conisbrough; Conisbrough & Denaby  
accordance with 85%ile WWS. A Transport Assessment & Travel Plan are required,  and 
the site may require a routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The site contains linear plantings of mature trees along the eastern and southern 
boundaries and part of the northern boundary, which should be retained. The siting and 
orientation of dwellings and size of gardens should take account of shading issues from 
trees and allow adequate tree -to-development distances and the PROW needs to retain 
its green character to both sides. Layout to be informed by a tree survey.

Archaeology  The remains of a mediaeval windmill are present as a grassy mound and is of local 
archaeological significance; otherwise t here is uncertain archaeological significance. 
Further archaeological investigations are likely to be required to inform development 
proposals.  
Biodiversity  Compensation should be directed towards the boundaries of the site that border the wider 
countrysi de. 
Design  Development should provide a set back frontage to Doncaster Road as per approved site 
to the south. Houses should back onto existing gardens along Lings Lane to create a 
secure layout with rear gardens locked together. Open space and footpath l inkages should 
be provided along the southern boundary. Footpath / cycle links should connect to open 
space to south on the adjacent site.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be required.  
Public Open Space  The site should provide onsite open s pace, and there is also an opportunity to link this to 
the proposed open space on the adjacent site.  
Transport  Access on to Doncaster Road. A transport statement required.  
Trees & Hedgerows  A good quality 1825 Hatfield, Thorne, Fishlake, Sykehouse & Stai nforth Enclosure Award

appropriate survey data).    
 
Site DDHS14; East of Cuckoo Lane, Hatfield ; Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield, Stainforth  
Indicative Site Capacity: 36 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Due to the relative lack of deep ground distur bance on the site, the potential for the 
survival of any previously unrecorded buried archaeological remains is considered to 
be moderate in the eastern part of the site. Within the footprint of the factory at the 
western end of the site, the survival of a ny previously unrecorded buried archaeology 
is considered to be low. Further archaeological investigations are likely to be required 
to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses would require compensation. The boundary hedgerows, particula rly to 
the north and east of the site should be retained and enhanced. Biodiversity net gain 
should be demonstrate d.   
Conservation & 
Heritage  To mitigate any adverse impact on heritage assets new development should retain 
and reinforce the historic bound aries and its green character to the field side; be set 
back to the line of the adjacent bungalow; and maintain green character and trees to 
the front of the site. Buildings should be no higher than 2 storeys and take into 
account local building materials (brick/pantile).  
Design  New development should front toward Cuckoo Lane. Pedestrian and cycle linkages 
should run through the site and connect to the Public Footpath which runs along the 
eastern edge.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be req uired.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum will be required, to be used on the adjacent open space Jubilee 
Park.  
Transport  Access should be in accordance with Manual for Streets / South Yorkshire 
Residential Design Guide. There is some concern over addition al traffic loading onto 
the Station Road / Cuckoo Lane junction to its poor horizontal alignment. The site is 
in close proximity to a school so a robust Construction Traffic Management Plan is 
 
284   [go to Contents ] 
  Site DDHS14; East of Cuckoo Lane, Hatfield ; Dunscroft, Dunsville, Hatfield, Stainforth  
required. A Transport Assessment will be required due to the pr oximity of a number 
of schools and the potential impact on vulnerable users. The site may require a 
routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The historic eastern & northern  boundaries are present on the 1843 tithe map for the 
parishes of H atfield and Thorne; the east hedge  line appearing to be fairly intact 
(unlike the north hedge  line). No real tree issues subject to findings of a tree survey.  
 
Site MEX09; Leach Lane, Mexborough ; Mexborough  
Indicative Site Capacity: 16 dwellings  
 
Archa eology  Within the majority of the site, there is the potential for the survival of buried features 
relating to the former works. The site’s location on the alluvial plain suggests that 
there is also the  potential  for  earlier  (prehistoric  to  medieval)   remains  to  survive  
at  a  significant  depth  below  the  current ground levels. Further archaeological 
investigations are likely to be required to inform development proposals. Assessment 
of the historic character and significance of the derelict war ehouse may also be 
required.  
Biodiversity  The existing poor habitat corridor along the river needs to be enhanced by 
development on this site, thus improving the existing ecological network.  
Conservation & Heritage  The development should improve the sett ing of the conservation area and the 
approach to and from the station. It should also provide an attractive waterside 
frontage to the canal.  
Design  New development should respond to and turn the corner of Station Road and Greens 
Way. Development should r espond to the canal and open up the potential for public 
access to the waterside. Where possible it should provide pedestrian links to the 
adjacent housing area to the east. The site is potentially suitable for a taller building 
and should provide an attra ctive outlook adjacent the canal . The site is supported 
above the canal by an existing retaining structure. The final design and layout shall 
incorporate measures to prevent any increase in risk to land instability caused by 
loading onto any existing or new retaining structures on site.

Site MEX10; Windhill Avenue, Mexborough ; Mexborough  
Indicative Site Capacity: 112 dwellings  
 
Biodiversity  An area of potential value for invertebrates. Compensatory habitat should be provided to 
account for losses.  
Design  Proposals  on this site should reflect the requirements of the Development Brief which has 
been prepared by the Local Planning Authority.  New development should respect the 
established street pattern, pedestrian routes and desire lines. New properties should front 
toward Windhill Avenue, Pitt Street and Clayfield View. Homes should provide high levels 
of natural surveillance over the pedestrian route through the site from Windhill Crescent. 
Rear gardens of new homes should back onto existing rear gardens at the site edges with 
appropriate separation distances to enable a secure layout. New homes should be 
arranged in a stepped format which reflects the underlying topography of the site. Any 
proposed POS should be located in an accessible, prominent and well surveyed l ocation 
to safely serve existing and new residents.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space would be preferred, although given the site is adjacent to Pitt Street 
Park, there may be opportunity to  contribute towards improving this open space as well.  
Transport  The site layout should be designed to maximise and encourage safe, sustainable 
movement through walking and cycling, maintaining existing links or providing new links to 
the wider networks. Existing or new roads on the development must be constructed to / or 
brought up to adoptable standard and any roads damaged by site construction vehicles 
reinstated to an acceptable condition. Street design should follow the guiding principles 
and technica l requirements of the South Yorkshire Design Guide.

Archaeology  The layout and design should be informed by a programme of archaeological evaluation 
to be agreed with South Yorkshire Archaeology and undertaken at an early stage;  
Biod iversity  A strong landscaping scheme must be developed that is designed with to deliver the best 
possible outcome for wildlife. Biodiversity net gain  can be used to deliver some off site 
compensation for the habitat losses.  
Design  A development brief has been produced for this site by the Council. A pedestrian / cycle 
route should be created through the site linking the POS to Willow Drive. The layout should 
create a robust block structure with properties fronting toward streets, providing dual 
aspect at c orner locations, and creating houses backing onto or side onto adjacent 
residential edges and the allotment gardens. There is a need to provide appropriate stand -
off distances from existing residential development along the northern, eastern and 
western ed ges of the site New homes should front toward the POS to the south in order to 
improve natural surveillance of this area and provide outlook.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be required.  
Public Open Space  It is apparent this western part o f the site has not been used as an allotment for a number 
of years, and as such in principal the Local Planning Authority do not have an issue with 
this derelict open space being lost if this can be of benefit to the local community. Given 
the number of lo cal open spaces in the vicinity of this site, a commuted sum should be 
provided to improve these as part of an application.  
Transport  Vehicular access to the site should be from Willow Drive. May require a routing agreement 
during construction.  
Trees & H edgerows  Any proposal needs to be subject to a tree survey following the guidance in BS5837:2012 
Tree works recommendations carried out by a suitably qualified and competent arborist. 
 
287   [go to Contents ] 
  Site MEX11; West o f Schofield Street ; Mexborough  
The survey should be carried out on the site at the feasibility stage of  any development 
and create a survey report, a categorization of the trees on and adjacent to the site and a 
tree constraints plan. This information should then be carried forward and used to inform 
the design brief and design of the subsequent development . 
 
Site ROS02; Former Rossington Colliery, (south) , Rossington ; Rossington  
Indicative Site Capacity: 349 dwellings  
 
Biodiversity  The development should protect and enhance the wetland habitat corridor along the River 
Torne and contribute to local prior ities identified in the Torne Catchment Plan. Wet 
woodland interests in Holmes Carr Wood should also be protected and enhanced. Holmes 
Carr Wood should be separated from the development by an appropriate buffer zone of 
landscape planting. This should inclu de retention of the woodland area within the proposed 
allocation. Opportunities to deliver habitat connectivity between Holmes Carr Wood and 
the river Torne should also be explored.  
Design  Further development to the south of the permitted Rossington Colli ery development / Torne 
Park must ensure integration with the approved illustrative masterplan and design code for 
the area to the north. These documents and plans must be updated and accompany the 
submission of any planning application for this site ( ROS0 2). The layout for this area must 
ensure housing is locked together with the proposed housing to the north to create a 
secure block structure. Landscaped pedestrian and cycle links will need to be created 
through the site to link the permitted Torne Park h ousing area to the proposed country park 
to the south. Preferably this will be a continuation of the route provided adjacent to the 
drain. New housing along the southern boundary of the site should integrate with and front 
southward toward the country park . Housing should be set away from Holmes Carr Wood 
with appropriate separation distances between new development and the woodland. The 
southern site boundary will be delineated by the point at which the new development 
platform meets the sloping hill, howe ver, in the interests of creating a new strong, 
defensible, and likely to be permanent Green Belt boundary in this location, opportunities 
should be explored for enhancing this and forming a clearly defined site boundary, using 
suitably tall, dense and con tinuous hedgerow or tree planting.

Biodiversity  Will require an up to date great crested newt survey and a reptile survey to establish how 
reptiles are using the site.  Any mitigation measures for great crested newts should be 
indicated, if there are parts of the sites reptiles use particularly, consideration should be 
given to their retention. Proposals should ensure there is  suitable biodiversity net gain . 
Design  There are opportunities to integrate the existing site green infrastructure into the site 
design, creating pleasant ecology areas which will green the character of the scheme. 
There should be varied house types, suitable visitor parking and avoid parking domin ated 
streets. Open space need to be sufficient and could be incorporated into the centre of the 
site. Pedestrian connectivity needs to be fully considered. All corner locations should be

Public Open Space  There should be a dedicated on site open space suitable for children’s play. Existing on 
site green infrastructure could be enhanced to create an additional area for recreation and 
an attractive site feature.  
Transport  No issues with development in principal, site details to be refined through the planning 
process. May require a routing agreement during construction.  Access is via a Lands End 
Road, which would require improvements including widening to achieve this.

Site TM15; South -West  of St Nicholas Road, Thorne ; Thorne & Moorends  
Indicative Site Capacity: 12 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Due to the lack of deep ground disturbance, the potential for the survival of any 
previously unrecorded buried archaeology is considered to be modera te to high.  
Archaeological investigations within the buffer zone have identified evidence relating 
to the historical development of Thorne from the medieval to the modern periods, and 
the site represents land to the rear of medieval burgage plots on King Street. Further 
archaeological investigations are likely to be required.  
Biodiversity  Layout and design will need to be informed by a tree survey and bat survey.  Mature 
trees should be retained where possible and compensation provided for habitat 
losses.  
Conservation & Heritage  Appropriate tree planting and landscaping should be incorporated into the 
development contribute to the green wedge through the area and filter existing poor -
quality views towards the retail units on Darley Road. Low density devel opment would 
be expected towards St Nicholas Road. The reinstatement of the stone boundary wall 
onto St Nicholas Road to its former height would  also be expected . The existing stone 
and brick wall boundaries to Thorne House where they adjoin the site shoul d be 
retained. The existing mature trees providing enclosure to the western boundary of 
Thorne House should be retained. Development should be set back from the sites 
eastern boundary and be of appropriate scale so as to avoid visual impacts on views 
out from Thorne Conservation Area, including the grounds of Thorne House.  
Design  The feeling of openness of the site shall be retained by providing a central open space 
within the site, reinforcing the visual edge of the conservation area. The site is 
suitable  for a low density scheme. Pedestrian / cycle connections are to be provided 
through the site to link St Nicholas Road and Darley Road  to provide and improve 
pedestrian connectivity to local services and facilities.

  Site TM15; South -West  of St Nicholas Road, Thorne ; Thorne & Moorends  
Public Open Space  A contribution to improve a local open space will be required.  
Transport  Access should be taken from St Nicolas Road. There should be a minimum 
separation distance of 20m with junction of St Nic holas Road  / Mansion  Court 
Gardens. Visibility should be in accordance with Manual for Streets (based on 85th 
percentile wet weather speed). Access will require bus stop re -siting, and may also 
impact on the small brick structure near to the road.  
Trees & Hedgerows  Thorne Ru ral District Council Tree Preservation Order (No.2) 1959 Thorne is in force

Indicative Site Capacity: 53 dwe llings  
 
Archaeology  The potential for the preservation of unrecorded buried archaeological remains is currently 
unknown. Further archaeological investigations may be required to inform development 
proposals.  
Biodiversity  The site borders a designated lo cal wildlife site.  A habitat/landscaping zone should be 
used to buffer and enhance the local wildlife site. Compensation would be required for the 
loss of habitats on the site. Biodiversity net gain should be demonstrate d. 
Design  Proposals on this site s hould reflect the requirements of the Development Brief which has 
been prepared by the Local Planning Authority. Development  should be set back from 
existing trees and hedgerows worthy of retention at the edges of the site. Rear gardens 
should lock togethe r with boundaries to the existing housing along the southern edges. 
Pedestrian and cycle linkages should be provided through the site with the layout ensuring 
there is potential to connect in future to possible housing sites to the north and west. 
Existing  footpaths and pedestrian desire line routes through the site should be 
accommodated in the layout.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Flood Risk  A sequential approach to layout of the development is required so that there is no  ‘more 
vulnerable’ built development on the parts of the site that is flood zone 3. This area would 
be appropriate for ‘water combatable’ uses such as Public Open Space as also indicated 
below.

Public Open Space  A commuted sum is required to improve local  Public Open Space.  
Transport  A Transport Statement will be required. The site has good links to the Railway Station and 
should improve the route to this on foot. There is only a single point of access via the end 
of cul -de-sac on Millcroft Close. May req uire a routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  No arboricultural issues; the site is characterised by degraded field boundaries to the South

Archaeology  No further archaeological investigation is likely to be required if this site is brought forward 
for development.  
Biodiversity  Development should seek to retain and enhance the ecological connectivity along  the 
railway corridor and the boundary hedgerow at the north of the site.  Any unavoidable 
habitat losses should be accounted for and b iodiversity net gain should be demonstrate d. 
Design  Opportunity exists to connect the scheme to the station, which will also provide natural 
surveillance and make it more attractive to pedestrians.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be required.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum is required to improve local Public Open Space.  
Transport  The site area includes T horne South Station, access road and parking area. Visibility 
splays for the site entrance are to be in accordance with Manual for Streets (30mph) or 
recorded 85th percentile wet weather speeds. Furthermore, forward visibility along South 
End Road is of co ncern and there is a need to ensure adequate visibility exists along South 
End Road. These are to be provided as part of any forthcoming application.  
 
The site could possibly be served by Southfield Close, subject to a minimum carriageway 
width of 5.5m bei ng achieved. This may require footway narrowing to achieve. An existing 
public footway linking Southfield Road and rail station may require stopping up under 
Section 247 of TCPA to facilitate the development.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The retention of the hedger ows, whilst preferred, may be problematic in reality. The best 
approach is therefore to seek ecological compensation.

The site will require some good amenity tree planting at the entrance and lining the street, 
ideally within the public realm. If the appl icant wishes to avoid pre -commencement 
condition that would be used with any future consent then landscaping should be given 
early consideration.

Archaeolo gy The site can be assessed as having uncertain archaeological constraint and if brought 
forward for development further archaeological investigation may be required. The scope 
and nature of any archaeological investigation, if required, should be discusse d with the 
South Yorkshire Archaeology Service (SYAS).   
Biodiversity  Development will result in the loss of an area of habitat used by a range of species. 
Prospective developers will need to show how this can be compensated ensuring 
biodiversity net gain.  Any application should be supported by an ecological appraisal.  
Design  There is an opportunity to open up access to the station with a pedestrian / cycle footway 
connection to the existing footway to the east of this site and the adjacent Site TM18.  
Natural surveillance over the adjacent footpath and the station access road to the south 
should be improved through the siting of new homes on the site.  
Education  A contribution to education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum will be require d to contribute towards improving a local open space.  
Transport  Access will need to be taken from South End, via Site TM18, or potentially via Southfield 
Close, subject to a minimum carriageway width being achieved. Both access options via 
either South En d Road or Southfield Close will require land outside the potential 
development plot to deliver a new access road and therefore will probably require 3rd party 
land to facilitate this.  Visibility splays for the site entrance are to be in accordance with 
Manual for Streets (30mph) or recorded 85th percentile wet weather speeds. Furthermore, 
forward visibility along South End Road is of concern and there is a need to ensure 
adequate visibility exists along South End Road. These are to be provided as part of an y 
forthcoming application.

Indicative Site Capacity: 44 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  Any remaining standing buildings or buried remains associated with the World War II 
barracks are likely to be of local archaeological significance. The extent of sub -surface 
disturbance caused by the  construction of the barracks is currently unclear, therefore the 
potential for the survival of unrecorded buried archaeological remains pre -dating the mid -
20th century is considered to be low to moderate. Further archaeological investigations 
may be requi red when the site is brought forward for development.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses should be accounted for and appropriate compensation provided.  The 
buildings proposed for demolition would require bat surveys.  
Design  New development should front toward Moss Road and Newmarche Drive, with properties 
set back from Moss Road to respect established building lines and front boundaries 
created as per the existing street character. A pedestrian / cycle route should be 
developed through the site between Moss Roa d and Newmarche Drive to improve 
pedestrian permeability and movement in the local area.  The pedestrian route to the 
west of the site should benefit from natural surveillance from new properties with a 
connection made from the site.  A landscaped and acou stic buffer may be required along 
the eastern edge as attenuation from adjacent potential employment uses.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A contribution towards Improving the adjacent open space at Coniston  Road will be 
required.  
Transport  New access from Moss Road will likely result in loss of hedgerow. The design standard 
will be determined by recorded 85th percentile WWS. Development may lead to 
increased queueing and delay at Station Road level crossing . The site should provide for 
pedestrian linkage to south for access to bus service. A Transport Statement will be 
required. The site may require a routing agreement during construction.

Archaeology  The potentia l for the preservation of unrecorded buried archaeological remains is 
considered to be moderate. Further archaeological investigations may to be required to 
inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses should be compensated for and any ecolog ical compensation should be 
situated to the northern part of the site bordering the wider countryside to enhance 
ecological networks  
Design  New development should integrate with the street pattern and access points provided by 
the Keepmoat development tak ing place to the east and south. Rear of new houses 
should back onto existing homes on east south and western edges with appropriate 
separation distances from existing properties. Footpath routes and desire lines through 
the site should be maintained. Land scape buffering is required on the northern edge of 
the site with properties set back and fronting in that direction.  
Education  A contribution towards education may be required.  
Public Open Space  The site is adjacent to Warren House Park. Green Infrastru cture is required linking to 
Public Open Space plus commuted sum specifically for improvements to adjacent site.  
Transport  The approved layout for the Askern colliery site protected pedestrian and vehicular 
access to this land. Concerns over access by co nstruction traffic through an existing 
residential estate, CTMP required. The site may require a routing agreement during 
construction.  
Trees & 
Hedgerows  No real arboricultural issues. The northern boundary of the site derives from the 
Campsall, Askern an d Norton Enclosure Award of 1818. The remnant vegetation here is

Indicative Site Capacity: 140 dwellings  
 
Biodiversity  Habitat and species impacts would need to be fully as sessed to avoid, mitigate and 
compensate for biodiversity losses. Retaining ecological connectivity to the land to the 
north of the site beyond the railway line and along the development edge alongside the 
railway line, would deliver the greatest benefits for biodiversity. Reptile populations are 
present in the area and replacement habitat would need to be provided. Biodiversity net 
gain should be demonstrate d. 
Design  New development should front toward the main access Street from Hayfield Lane. Houses 
should back toward existing properties on the eastern edge locking rear gardens together. 
Likewise the response should be the same backing onto Hayfield Business Park. 
Pedestrian and cycle connections are required to Hayfield Lane and the adjacent open 
space facilities. Layout should seek to provide some surveillance over land to north as this 
is identified as a location for a rail station and associated parking area.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open  space should be provided as well as links to the proposed open space on the 
adjacent land to the south west of the site.  
Transport  The site benefits from pre -formed access points. Off -site improvements are needed to the 
footways on the north of Hayfield Lane between Walnut Ave and Hawthorne Road (where 
there is currently no footway) to improve access to facilities. The site may require a routing 
agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The frontage trees form an attractive and visually coherent ‘ boulevard’ feature consistent 
with much of the street scene of Hayfield Lane; whilst the condition of these trees remains 
to be assessed, frontage trees should be considered as a desirable design feature in this 
location and be subject to tree surveys.

Indicative Site Capacity: 66 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The lack of substantial sub -surface development indicates that the potential for 
the survival of unrecorded buried remains is high.  Further archaeological 
investigations are likely to be required to inform development proposals.  
Biodiversity  From a wildlife point of view habitat compensation should be provided along 
the southern boundary of the site. To enhance the wildlife cor ridor that runs 
further to the south along the River Dearne.   
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
acce ssibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council.  
Design  New development should front toward Doncaster Road echoing building lines 
opposite. N ew houses should back onto existing houses along the eastern and 
western edges with rear gardens locked together. Houses should front 
southward. In the interests of creating a new strong, defensible, and likely to 
be permanent Green Belt boundary in this l ocation, a clearly defined site 
boundary should be formed to the southern limit of the site, using suitably tall, 
dense and continuous hedgerow or tree planting. This could form the periphery 
to wider on site efforts to provide a visual softening between c ountryside and 
urban forms, or be used as plot boundaries, but must define the actual site 
limits in a clear and linear fashion. The design of the southern boundary will 
also need to take account of the electricity pylons and the required stand -off 
needed.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site open space provision suitable for children's play will be required, 
including play equipment.  
Transport  The site can be directly accessed from Church Lane. Access sh ould be

Archaeology  Cropmarks showing a track way of probable Iron Age  to  Roman  da te  have  been  
recorded  within  the  site,  and  associated  field  boundaries  and  enclosures  are recorded 
in the surrounding area, suggesting there is a good potential for similar remains to extend 
into the site.  Further archaeological investigation s will be required to inform development 
proposals.  
Biodiversity  Support design comments in terms of location of landscape planting. Woodland planting 
within the layout design would enhance an area where woodland cover and quality has 
been eroded. It woul d improve ecological connectivity – particularly if focused towards the 
northern and eastern edges of the site adjoining the railway corridor.  
Design  New development should be outward looking and front toward Hatfield Lane and 
countryside to the north. Bu ildings should back onto existing Parkhill Road and Brosley 
Avenue properties to lock rear gardens together, with appropriate separation distances to 
existing properties. Landscape planting and buffering is required to the northern and 
eastern edges of the  site, to soften the visual impact adjacent the countryside.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Flood Risk  A sequential approach to layout of the development is required so that there is no ‘more

be required to inform development pro posals.  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses on this site would require compensation.  If this cannot be 
accommodated within the site boundaries then offsite compensation would be 
required. Biodiversity net gain  should be demonstrate d. Woodland planting 
would be r equired along the southern boundary of the site to link the 
woodlands to the west and east.   
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the  environmental quality and 
accessibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details

Biodiv ersity  Layout and design will need to be informed by appropriate tree and ecology surveys, to 
retain existing features of substantive biodiversity interest. Off -site compensation for 
biodiversity losses may be appropriate. Biodiversity net gain should be d emonstrate d. 
Design  New development should back onto rear gardens of existing houses on the north, east and 
south boundaries of the site to ensure rear gardens are locked together. Properties should 
front westward onto Great North Road possibly set back f rom the edge of the site behind 
frontage private drives and any retained trees / hedgerows along that edge.

Archaeology  The potential for buried archaeological remains below the level impacted by 
ploughing is considered to be high. Further archaeological investigation will be 
required to inform development p roposals.  
Biodiversity  Habitat creation and a buffer zone is best positioned along the northern 
boundary and north eastern corner of the site.  This should aim to help 
strengthen links between the Skelbrooke Rein and Harry Wood Local Wildlife 
Site and Bur ghwallis Grange Banks candidate Local Wildlife Site and Skellow 
Mill Pond Local Wildlife Site. The planting corridor along the A1 should also be 
retained.  
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
accessibility of remaining Green Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council.  
Design  New development should be set back from the western edge of the site with an 
appropriate substantial visual and acoustic buffer adjacent the A1. Buildings 
should front toward Green Lane and Crabgate Lane, and toward the A1 set 
back behind the buffer  . 
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  On site Green Infrastructure (including buffer) and children's play space will be 
required. Buffer to the A1 does not constitute open space provision.  
Transport  Access to be taken from Crabgate Lane. Visibility standards to be in 
accordance with Manual for Streets. Any private accesses to classified routes 
require turning facilities within the site curtilage. There is no vehicular access 
to Green Lane. There is currently a sustainability issue with the site location, 
given distance to local centre, services and amenities, as well as limited bus 
service provision / infrastructure which must be overcome. Development would 
require bus provision. A Transport Assessment & Travel Plan will be required. 
A routing agreement during construction will be required.  
Trees & Hedgerows  Mature boundary trees dotted around site along with ex -hedgerow trees within

Indicative Site Capacity: 7 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The foundations of buildings are likely to have cause d significant below -ground 
disturbance and as such, the potential for the survival of unrecorded buried 
archaeological remains on the site is considered to be low. Further archaeological 
investigation is unlikely to be required.  
Conservation & 
Heritage  The adjacent park to the south contains a war memorial which is of local heritage 
significance and currently being assessed for listed status. It would complement the 
park and the setting of the memorial if the green edge and the trees at the front of the 
allocation site were retained.  
Design  New development should front toward Edlington Lane with appropriate stand -off 
distances from the frontage trees. The rear of any new properties should lock together 
existing rear gardens on the western edge with appropr iate separation distances from 
existing properties.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum is required to improve local Public Open Space.  
Transport  The access point / points need careful considerat ion to prevent conflict with existing 
opposing access to filling station / supermarket. The site may require a routing 
agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  There are prominent frontage trees along with a prominent tree at the north eastern 
end of the site. Subject to BS5837 survey information, these should be retained as 
appropriate. Taking account of below and above ground constraints would be 
expected.

Archaeology  No development or significant ground disturbance has been recorded within the site.  The 
potential for the survival of unrecorded buried archaeological remains is considered to be 
moderate.  Further archaeological investigation may be required.  
Biodiversity  The site appears to have biodiversity value and forms an extension to Edlington Brick Pond 
LWS and the new community woodland/park, forming a series of connected habitat parcels 
of biodiversity interest. The loss of habitats on site and ecolo gical connectivity through the 
landscape would require compensation. It is likely that compensation would be required 
off site in order to deliver the net gain in biodiversity required by national policy. Biodiversity 
net gain should be demonstrate d. 
Desi gn Development layout should maintain a green edge and buffer to Howbeck Dike, with 
development fronted outward in a westerly direction toward this edge set back from the 
existing trees and hedgerows. Rear gardens of new properties should lock together 
existing rear gardens on the eastern edge with appropriate separation distances from 
existing properties.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A commuted sum is required to improve local Public Open Space.  
Transpor t There are only 2 possible access points to this land via Church View and Lake Close - 
potential issue as the roads are fairly narrow and this will require access through a 
sheltered housing scheme, this will need careful consideration. Edenthorpe 
Neighbo urhood Plan raised issues about traffic calming measures along Howbeck Drive. 
May require a routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  Within the site it would appear to be predominantly scrub; the main feature is the mature 
field boundary s eparating the site from the agricultural land to the west. It will be important 
in the landscape for this feature to be retained to screen/soften development from views 
across the open countryside (subject to a BS5837 tree survey).

Education  A contribution towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  Given the site is adjacent to an existing open space, a commuted sum would 
be required to improve this. Green infr astructure should be present on the site 
itself, with access to the adjacent open space provided.  
Transport  Access to be designed to DMRB standards with visibility to 85%ile WWS 
resulting in loss of hedgerow. There is a need to provide a footway along sit e 
 
305   [go to Contents ] 
  Site SPR01; Betwee n Cadeby Road  and Melton Road , Sprotbrough ; Sprotbrough  
frontage to connect to existing to the west of the site (circa 100m).  There may 
be a need to alter the TRO to move change in speed limit and gateway feature 
(currently in middle of site frontage to Melton Road. Secondary access from 
Cadeby Road can be c onsidered although visibility to 85%ile WWS may prove 
difficult to achieve and result in loss of hedgerow (if achievable).  There will 
need to be an extension of the existing footway to site access Melton Road 
and/or Cadeby Road, latter is quite narrow. Ca deby Road is busy at school 
start and finish times/proximity to Copley Junior School. A Transport 
Assessment & Travel Plan is required. Development may require a routing 
agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  The eastern boundary (light) hedgero w can be traced back to an untitled late 
18th-early 19th century estate plan; the north and western boundaries can be 
traced back to the much earlier (1711) wider estate plan for Bilham, Marr, 
Scawsby, Cusworth, Newton, Sprotbrough and Cadeby. Whilst the N  hedgerow 
appears rather 'flimsy', the western hedgerow appears bulkier. No 
arboricultural issues. Boundary hedgerow retention dependent on structural 
condition, highway visibility and secure boundaries. The western boundary 
should be retained and enhanced .  
 
Site TIC01; South of Sunderland Street, Tickhill ; Tickhill  
Indicative Site Capacity: 74 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  The presence or otherwise of significant archaeology on the site is 
unknown.  Contact the South Yorkshire Archaeological Service (SYAS) a s to 
whether any further archaeological investigations are required if the site is 
brought forward for development.  
Biodiversity  The field boundaries and wooded strip along the motorway edge should be 
protected and enhanced.  Habitat losses should be acco unted for and 
compensation should contribute to local priorities identified in the Torne 
Catchment Plan in which the Paper Mill Dyke corridor to the south of the site is 
 
306   [go to Contents ] 
  Site TIC01; South of Sunderland Street, Tickhill ; Tickhill  
identified. The southern boundary of the site should include native hedgerow 
planting as a buffer to the wider countryside.  
Compensatory Green Belt 
Improvements  As the site allocation results in the loss of Green Belt land, this must be 
compensated for by contributing to improving the environmental quality and 
accessibility of remaining Gr een Belt land within the vicinity of the site. Details 
of specific sites and projects will be established in discussion with the Council  
Conservation & Heritage  The northern tip of the site contributes to the wider setting of Sunderland Farm 
and the moder n development of 7 cottages here has taken this into account in 
terms of design and materials. Careful consideration of the form and character 
of the buildings as seen from Sunderland Street and the approach to the listed 
farm would be required. Reinforcin g green/open character here would also help. 
Provided buildings are no more than 2 storeys high there would be no 
conservation constraints on development to the rear of these 7 cottages.  
Design  New development should incorporate appropriate stand -off from  the Motorway 
edge and include noise attenuation measures. If open space is to be provided 
it may be appropriate to locate POS along this edge. Rear gardens of new 
homes should back onto existing rear gardens to the north and west in a secure 
layout. In th e interests of creating a new strong, defensible, and likely to be 
permanent Green Belt boundary in this location, a clearly defined site boundary 
should be formed to the southern limit of the site, using suitably tall, dense and 
continuous hedgerow or tre e planting. This could form the periphery to wider on 
site efforts to provide a visual softening between countryside and urban forms, 
or be used as plot boundaries, but must define the actual site limits in a clear 
and linear fashion.  
Education  A contribu tion towards education will be required.  
Public Open Space  A dedicated on site open space will be required.  
Transport  Access to Sunderland Street is possible, but ultimately may require the 
relocation of the existing garages to accommodate suitable acces s on to this 
site. Development may require a routing agreement during construction.  
Trees & Hedgerows  As Tickhill would appear to have been enclosed prior to the main period of 
parliamentary enclosure acts (mid -18th to mid -19th centuries) the hedgerows 
that bisect/surround the site may be considered as ancient hedgerows. 
Hedgerow planting should be undertaken on the southern boundary.

Indicative Site Capa city: 1,200 dwellings  
 
Archaeology  There has been little recorded below -ground disturbance within the site. As such, the 
survival of any previously unrecorded heritage assets within the site is considered to be 
moderate. Consequently, further archaeologi cal investigations are likely to be required.  
 
The site has not been assessed separately but was assessed in the archaeological 
scoping report as part of the wider site, and the following would still apply if allocated.  
 
Due to the lack of deep ground dis turbance the likely survival of buried archaeological 
remains associated with the complex of Iron Age to Romano -British field systems and 
settlement is considered to be high. Areas where quarrying has taken place have no 
potential for the survival of archa eological remains. Given the evidence for extensive 
buried archaeological remains on this site, further consideration of the impact on these 
would be required to establish whether there was capacity for housing on this site.  
 
The extent and scope of any f urther investigation for all parts of the site should be 
discussed with the South Yorkshire Archaeology Service  
Biodiversity  Habitat losses would need to be accounted for and an application would need to 
demonstrate how it would deliver a net gain for bio diversity.  Also of exceptional importance 
in this area is the habitat network and connectivity of this would need to be enhanced 
through very careful design.  New planting would be required to strengthen connections 
between the matrix of woodlands. Curren tly, while much of the site is agricultural, wildlife 
will still be able to use this to move between the woodland sites. Once housing is built this 
will provide a much bigger barrier to dispersal of species. This is why improving the existing 
habitat conne ctivity would be essential component of the design.  
 
The site spans the area between two Local Wildlife Sites (Hurst Plantation, Savage Brooks, 
and Marr Flatts Wood (4.32) and Hurst Wood (4.31b), and woodland is a valuable 
biodiversity feature of the wider  landscape. In particular, the wet woodland components of 
these neighbouring sites need to be protected from loss or degradation as a result of the 
development. All woodlands and wetland features on or adjacent to the site (whether 
 
308   [go to Contents ] 
  Sites DSA02  (Initial Airport Housing ) & DSA03  (Airport Reserve Housing ); Auckley – Hayfield Green  
designated or not) would  need protecting thorough the provision of appropriate landscape 
buffer zones.  
 
Similar principles will need to be applied to further phases of development to protect and 
enhance the ecological connectivity and quality of the woodlands and their individual  
features of interest.  
Design  Development proposals for this site must be informed by comprehensive airport area -wide 
masterplanning as required by Policy 6. This must include  production of an agreed design 
code for this si te and further potential housing areas south of the Airport Access Road / 
Great Yorkshire Way. The design must meet the quality aspirations of Policy 6 and Local 
Plan design policies. The masterplan and code are to be prepare d and agreed with the 
Local Planning Authority in advance of any development on this land. The design code 
and layout for this site must ensure pedestrian and cycle connectivity through this site, to 
the proposed Plaza and existing community to the north. This must include links to the 
proposed railway station to the north if this comes forward. The layout should ensure a 
high quality gateway is provided on arrival to the site from the north, which may include 
provision of a primary school.  It should be de signed to create a legible and secure block 
structure with a hierarchy of streets. The principal spine road access must be designed to 
incorporate a high quality tree lined avenue in verge treatment and be fronted by new 
development.   New development must  also front toward Hurst Lane, albeit development 
could be set back behind a green edge to reflect the existing character. New homes should 
be set away from existing woodland by sufficient distance.  
Education  A contribution towards education will be requi red. The wider site if it comes forward is 
projected to require at least one new school.  
Public Open Space  The site will require onsite open space, and consideration will need to be given as to how 
this can connect with and relate to the wider master plan  area, and open spaces which will 
be required as part of this.  
Transport  The D oncaster Sheffield Airport  draft masterplan (Plan 6) shows access to residential 
development via new roundabouts at the junctions of A638 / Hurst Lane and A638 / High 
Common La ne. If it is intended that the o range shaded area is to be served by priority 
junction on to Hurst Lane, design is to be in accordance DMRB with visibility splay of 4.5m 
x 215m. Due to the visibility constraint caused by the bend at the northern end of the site, 
the location of the access may conflict with the position of the existing bus stop which 
therefore may need moving.  
 
M18 junction 3 capacity constraints raised by H ighways England  as part of nearby current 
application (currently unresolved).  
Trees & Hedgerows  There are major woodland blocks connected by remnant hedgerows deriving from the 
1778 Blaxton, Auckley with Finningley Enclosure Award. Any layout proposals will,need to 
be informed by tree surveys and include appropriate stand -off from woodlan d where 
required.  
Other  This site needs to be considered in the wider context of the Airport and other proposed 
airport development, and will form part of the Airport Masterplan and residential design 
code required under Policy 6.

Archaeology  The potential for the survival of buried archaeology below the zone impacted by ploughing 
is considered to be moderate to high. Further archaeological inv estigation is likely to be 
required if the site is brought forward for development.  
Biodiversity  New habitat creation landscaping should be provided along the eastern boundary of the 
site to enhance the ecological corridor along the nearby River Don. Give n the proximity of 
Thorne Moors habitats attractive to foraging nightjar would be beneficial.   
Design  A masterplan and design guide will need to be developed with the Council prior to 
submission of a planning application.  The existing Public Right Of Wa y from North 
Common Road should be extended westward from its southern end to link with Selby 
Road. The site layout should be led by a robust landscape and visual impact assessment 
of the surrounding environment.  Views and viewpoints to be agreed with the  Council.  
There is a requirement for significant landscape buffering around the edges of the site and 
/ or the locating of smaller buildings adjacent the open countryside.  Likewise green 
corridors through the site are desirable to create a ‘green grid’ G I framework utilising 
existing drains where possible. Buildings should front onto public roads and create a high 
quality appearance from the motorway. Any large floor plate / large volume buildings 
should include quality architectural detailing which seeks  to either break down the scale of 
the building or celebrate its prominence as a landmark building.  Highest quality materials 
and detailing should be focused on the active, publicly viewable building elements, 
particularly those elevations that are visibl e from the motorway.  
Transport  A Transport Assessment will be required. Previous comments have been made to the 
planning application on this site. Depending on whether this iteration of the scheme comes 
forward, these either need to be taken account of, o r revised comments will be given as 
part of any future application.  
Trees & Hedgerows  A prairie -type landscape where the vast majority of the 1825 Enclosure hedgerows have

Archaeology  Given the evidence for extensive buried archaeological remains on this site, further 
consideration of the impact on these would be required to establish whether there was 
capacity for housing on thi s site.  
 
There has been little recorded below -ground disturbance within the purple site which was 
assessed in the archaeological scoping report as site 753; as such, the survival of any 
previously unrecorded heritage assets within the site is considered t o be moderate. 
Consequently, further archaeological investigations are likely to be required.  
 
The extent and scope of any further investigation for all parts of the site should be 
discussed with the South Yorkshire Archaeology Service. Archaeological imp lications – a 
written scheme of investigation must be approved by the Local Authority prior to 
development.  
Biodiversity  Further survey work will be required related to badgers which are using the site and the 
status of their sett. Would not like any acce ss or pipelines to go through Finningley Big 
Wood. Green Infrastructure Plan is required which considers relationships with the wider 
ecological network. Would wish to see new woodland planting as compensation for any 
woodland loss. Need to demonstrate bio diversity net gain on this site and how it can be 
delivered.  
Design  Need to integrate the scheme within the wider proposals at the Airport and  this site should 
form part of the proposed masterplanning in this location, including firm commitments to 
routes  and connections with the wider proposed site. There needs to be suitable routes to 
encourage movement on foot or bike between the wider site. Assessment must be made 
of opportunities and constraints. Need to consider the impact of building heights given t he 
countryside location of the site, including views on to the site. Landscape buffers are 
required to the edges of the site.  
Transport  No objections in principle to site, but technical details will need to be discussed and refined 
through the application  process.  
Trees & Hedgerows  Information about precise access arrangements and their impact on trees / the TPO’d 
woodland will be required. Layout should be informed by a tree survey. Trees at the 
northern tip of the site are deemed to be the best trees an d should be considered for 
retention. Would wish to see woodland W50 preserved. No development through the most

Archaeology  The construction of Bentley Grange may have destroyed any sub -surface archaeological 
deposits associated with the mid -19th-century brick kiln at that site. The site of Bentley 
Grange has not been redevelo ped and the likely survival of sub -surface assets associated 
with the building is considered to be high. The excavation of the clay pit will have destroyed 
any sub -surface archaeological deposits that may have been present at that location.  
 
Due to the la ck of deep -ground disturbance in the remainder of the site, the likely survival 
of any previously unrecorded heritage assets is considered to be moderate. Further 
archaeological investigation may be required if the site is brought forward for development.  
Biodiversity  The site is close to a network of Local Wildlife Sites (to the north) and proposals should 
seek to enhance the wildlife corridor extending south and west along the Old Ea beck and 
along any connecting drains within the site. The impact of pro posals on farmland birds 
should be accounted and compensated for.  
Design  A masterplan and design guide will need to be developed with the Council prior to 
submission of a planning application.  New pedestrian routes should be developed through 
the site to  link up to recreation routes and existing footpaths at the edges. This should 
include a diagonal ped estrian  / cycle route through the site from Tollbar to link to Bentley 
Moor Lane near the bridge. The site layout should be led by a robust landscape and v isual 
impact assessment of the surrounding environment.  Views and viewpoints to be agreed 
with the Council. This will likely result in a requirement for significant landscape buffering 
around the edges of the site and / or the locating of smaller building s adjacent the open 
countryside.  Likewise green corridors through the site are desirable to create a ‘green 
grid’ GI framework utilising existing hedgerows, drains and waterbodies where possible.

  Appendix 3: Doncaster Sheffield Airport Policy Area  
 
Policy 6 proposes the release of housing linked to delivery of jobs within the Airport Policy Area or jobs 
closely related to airport functions.  This Appendix clarifies how this is calculated.  
Site DSA02  is allocated for a development of 280 houses on land adjacent to the Airport.  A Reserve 
Housing Site is earmarked for up to a maximum of 920 houses on land adjacent to this (Site DSA03 ) 
meaning a total of 1,200 homes could be brought forward overall at the Airport.  (Both sites are shown 
on the Policies Map).  
The release of houses on Site DSA03  will be strictly controlled and linked to the proven delivery of jobs 
within the A irport Policy Area (or jobs closely related to airport functions).  
In the following e xample, it is assumed that in 2018 the Airport employ ed approximately 1,000 people.   
The ratio of jobs : houses (i.e. the number of houses allowed per job created) for calculation purposes is 
1: 0.11.  For clarification, 500 jobs, 1,000 jobs or 2,000 jobs  would result in 55, 110 and 220 houses 
respectively (jobs number x 0.11).  The delivery of approximately 9 jobs would therefore result in 1 
house.  
To support the economic expansion of the Airport, 280 of the 1,200 houses will be allocated ‘up front’ 
(Site DSA02 ) in lieu of delivery of jobs.  However, the Council will expect the jobs related to this initial 
tranche to be delivered.  Therefore, before any of the remaining 920 houses are permitted  on Site 
DSA03 , it must be evidenced that a number of jobs equi valent to the 280 houses has actually been 
delivered:  
 Using the ratio of 1 : 0.11, 2545 jobs is the equivalent of 280 houses.  
 
 The base date for this policy is 2018.  The Local Plan runs to 2035, which is 17 years  from 2018 .  
The 2,545 jobs equivalent to t he up -front 280 houses will be split between the 17 years.  2,545 / 17 = 
150 (rounded);  
 
 Before any further release of land is permitted for housing development beyond the 280 upfront 
houses, the applicant must demonstrate, at the time of an application fo r planning permission, that:  
 
a) the level of airport related jobs existing in 2018  has been maintained; and  
b) an additional 150 net jobs per annum (based on the number of years since 2018 at the point of 
application) have been delivered.  
 
Should the applicant be able to robustly evidence that this has been achieved, then a calculation can be 
made to determine how much housing can be permitted.  Any net full time equivalent (FTE) jobs 
delivered above this figure at that point in time will allow housing to be per mitted at a rate of 0.11 houses 
per additional job.

 x 0.11  
For example, should an applicant wish to apply for housing on Site DSA03  in 2028 , the amount 
permissible would be calculated as follows:

for any jobs delivered 
above figure in column  
D 
2028 (10 
years)  1,000  1,500 2,500 0.11 per job  
 
Using this example, should an applicant wish to apply for housing on Site DSA03  in 2028 , they must 
show that the number of jobs at the Airport is over 2, 500, or in other words, since the policy base date  of 
2018, 1,500 new jobs have been delivered in addition to the agreed number of existing jobs as at 2018 .  
For any jobs over 2, 500 jobs, houses would be permitted at a rate of 0.11 houses per additional job.  
Using the table above, the figures below are pr esented to illustrate how the calculation would work:  
 In 2028 , the applicant robustly proves that the Airport is directly responsible for the employment of 
8,000 people within the Airport Policy Area (or via jobs in the Borough closely related to airport 
functions).  
 1000 jobs (actual number to be confirmed at Local Plan adoption) must be deducted as they 
already existed at 2018  (8,000 – 1,000 = 7,000).  
 10 years’ ( 2018 – 2028 ) worth of jobs related to the split of the upfront housing allocation (Site 
DSA02 ) must also be subtracted to account for houses already delivered up front (1 50 x 10 = 
1,500; 7,000 – 1,500 = 5, 500 jobs).  
 5,500 net additional jobs must then be translated into houses using the ratio of 1 job : 0.11 houses. 
(5,500 x 0.11 = 605 houses).  
 In this scenario 605 houses would therefore be permitted  on Site DSA03 . This is in addition to the 
280 which were permitted up front  on Site DSA02 . 
 The overall site (Sites DSA02  & DSA03 ) would therefore, at this point, be capable of delivering 885 
houses out o f a maximum of 1200 ( 605 + 280).  
 The remaining 315 (1,200 – 885) houses could only come forward on the remainder of Site DSA03  
were an applicant to be demonstrate delivery of any further net additional jobs beyond those 
assumed above, and using the calcula tion above.  
 
There are some very important caveats to this policy:  
 The maximum number of up -front houses permitted in the initial tranche on Site DSA02  is 280.  
 The 2,545 jobs that would otherwise result in 280 houses on Site DSA02  (using the ratio of 1 : 
0.11) must be delivered in lieu of this.  This must be taken into account when an application for 
additional housing comes forward  on Site DSA03 . 
 The maximum number of houses that may come forward dependent on the delivery of jobs is 920  
on Site DSA03  - in addition to the initial 280  on Site DSA02 .  This means there will be a maximum 
of 1,200 houses permitted on Sites DSA02  & DSA03  related to the proven delivery of jobs.  Should 
the number of jobs exceed the related equivalent number of houses (10,910 jobs (1,200 / 0.11)), 
no further housing will be permitted related to the additional jobs.  
 Jobs figures are net.  They factor in gains and losses over time.  They must be robustly evidenced 
and shown as actually delivered before housing release related to this can be considered.  
 The final list of the types of directly related jobs that it is acceptable to count towards this 
calculation will be agreed following discussions between the Council and the Airport.  However:  
 
o Jobs created must be within Doncaster Borou gh. 
o Jobs must be Full Time Equivalent (FTE).  
o Jobs must be directly related to the Airport Policy A rea (or jobs closely related to airport 
functions).  For example, new FTE jobs at an off -site Doncaster based supplier of specialist air 
related goods directl y procured by Doncaster Sheffield Airport.  
  
315   [go to Contents ] 
  The Council considers that this strikes the right balance between supporting the Airport and its economic 
aspirations, which are also important to the Borough and the City Region, and capturing the benefits for 
Doncaster.  Additional housing acts as both support for the Airport’s  development and an incentive to 
deliver jobs to boost the local economy.  
The initial tranche  of housing is designed to help the Airport begin to realise its economic ambitions and 
potent ial.  However, the jobs related to this must be delivered.  This is the only time that housing will 
come before jobs in this location.  For subsequent applications, jobs delivery must be clearly 
demonstrated before housing is released.  This means the impe tus is with the Airport operator, if it 
wishes to enable housing development, to deliver its economic ambitions, which are also important for 
the Borough.

  Appendix 6: Parking Standards  
 
The pa rking standard s set in this appendix have been developed in line with the overarching objectives 
of the Sheffield City Region Transport Strategy (2018 -2040) and aligned to those developed by other 
local authorities within South Yorkshire.  
The Council recog nises that parking requirements vary based on location and land use.  In particular, it 
is important to acknowledge that accessibility, in terms of travel distances and availability of public 
transport, have a significant impact on the need for car use and  parking.  To reflect this, parking 
standards have been set for the Borough based on different land use classes and location of 
development.  In line with the NPPF, it is also acknowledged there is a need to reflect local 
circumstances, context and require ments of individual developments when assessing applications.  
Minimum parking standards have been set for residential developments in order to overcome issues 
associated with low parking provision.  In determining the right levels of parking we will consid er the 
anticipated demand from the type of housing proposed, the likely occupiers, the design of the public 
realm and highway, the proposed parking design solutions, and any local restrictions will be considered.  
Although uniform standards have been estab lished for the whole borough, residential developments 
within Doncaster Town Centre will be assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account 
accessibility, context and the requirements of individual development.  As highlighted in the 2018 
Parking Strategy, Doncaster Town Centre is highly accessible with good public transport connections. As 
such, lower parking provision may be acceptable in some circumstances in residential development 
within Doncaster Town Centre.  
Conversions of existing dwellings o r non -residential into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) can 
have the potential to increase the demand for parking in an area, particularly on -street provision.  Where 
planning permission is required, adequate parking provision should be provided, takin g account of the 
standards set below alongside guidance set in relevant Supplementary Planning Documents.   
A zoned approach has been adopted for non -residential development with maximum parking standards 
for Doncaster Town Centre and set parking standard requirements for the rest of the Borough.  This 
approach reflects need to ensure functional developments which maximises opportunities for use of 
sustainable modes of transport in urban locations well served by public transport.  
The NPPF states that maximu m parking standards for development should only be set where there is a 
clear and compelling justification for adoption.  The 2018 Doncaster Town Centre Car Parking Strategy 
contained a strategic review of parking consider current provision, occupancy, acc essibility, car usage 
and future demand.  The review found a surplus of parking provision in the town centre when 
considering average occupancy and bench marking.  The Strategy highlighted the need to ensure a 
balanced approach with respect to the provisio n of car parking in Doncaster Town Centres as an area 
well served by public transport with congestion and car related air quality challenges.  
The use of maximum parking standards in Doncaster Town Centre is justified by the findings of the Car 
Parking Str ategy and looks to optimise the density of development in the town centres and encourage 
sustainable travel choices in line with the NPPF.  To ensure this approach remains appropriate in light of 
regeneration and development in the town centre, reviews of demand and supply will be carried out 
annually to monitor changes.  The approach adopted by the parking strategy will be reviewed in line with 
these changes to ensure Doncaster has adequate provision.  
A set parking standard requirement has been set for the  rest of the Borough to ensure appropriate 
parking provision.  Where a development looks to provide more or less parking than the set standard, 
robust justification for such variation would need to be provided by the applicant, which would be subject 
to rigorous assessment.  
Where proposals look to depart from the parking standards, Transport Statements and Assessments 
would be expected to include the following items:   
319   [go to Contents ] 
   Surveys of parking capacity and occupancy levels on surrou nding streets and parking areas.  
 Consideration of likely trip generation and parking accumulations for the proposed devel opment 
evidenced as appropriate.  
 Details of how the parking will be managed and how that will mitig ate any under or over -
provision.  
These above items are not an exhaus tive list and in cases where proposals look to depart from the 
standards, applicants would be encouraged to discuss specific requirements with the Council.  
Parking and access requirements for service and delivery vehicles shall be additional to the 
require ments set out within these standards.  Where required, the quantity and design of Heavy 
Commercial Vehicles (HCV’s) will be assessed on a site by site basis.

Residential Development  
The following minimum parking standards will be applied to new residential developments.  
Apartments  1.5 spaces, where 1 space is allocated  and another is provided for every 2 dwellings in communal 
parking areas . 
2+ bed 
units  2 allocated spaces per dwelling, plus 1 visitor space per 4 dwellings unallocated and provided in 
defined bays within the public highway or private drive . 
Integral or  standalone garages will not be counted as a parking space unless they are an 
adequate size (currently 3 x 6 metres minimum clear internal dimensions).  
 
Residential developments within Doncaster Town Centre will be assessed on an individual basis, taking 
into account accessibility, context and individual development requirements.  Lower parking provision 
may be acceptable in some circumstances in residential development within Doncaster Town Centre.  
Additional Standards  
The following standards will be appl ied for other parking users.  
Disabled 
motorists  The recommended spaces for disabled motorist parking are contained within the latest 
guidance from the department of transport. The recommended proportions of spaces for blue 
badge holders are as follows.  
 
For car parks associated with new development premises, 5% of the total parking capacity 
should be designated (includes both employees and visitors).  
 
For car parks associated with shopping areas, leisure or recreational facilities and places open 
to the gen eral public, a minimum of one spaces per disabled employee, plus 6% of the total 
capacity for visiting disabled motorists.  
Pedal cycles  For residential developments, dedicated cycle storage for each property should be provided. 
For houses this could be in  adequately sized garages or bike sheds and for flats or apartments 
this may be shared dedicated secure facilities.  
 
For non -residential developments, a minimum ratio of 1 cycle space per 10 parking spaces 
should be applied.  Any departure from the standar ds for car parking provision should not be 
reflected in the reduction of cycle parking provision and, where appropriate, this should be 
increased in locations where cycling infrastructure encourages higher levels of cycling.  
 
For schools, cycle parking wil l be determined by an agreed school travel plan which will set out 
targets for cycling.  The most appropriate facility for cycle parking will be a ‘Sheffield stand’.  
The siting of the stand should be in a location that is convenient, under cover and secur e 
through natural observation . for example, at entrance to the building . 
 
Location of pedal cycle parking facilities should be agreed in writing by the Local Planning 
Authority.   
322   [go to Contents ] 
  Motorcycles  A ratio of 1 motorcycle space per 20 parking spaces should be ap plied. Anchor points should 
be provided and the space should be convenient and secure through natural observation.  
Electric 
vehicles  For residential developments, 1 charging point should be provided per unit (dwelling with 
dedicated parking for private u sage).  
 
For any public usage (such as retail) 1 charging unit per 20 parking spaces. For business/staff 
usage 1 charging point per 10 staff parking spaces. These ratios may change as electric 
vehicle usage increases where there is an increased demand for v ehicle recharging . 
 
In developments where short stay parking is likely, fast charging infrastructure should be used 
to promote high turnover of charging spaces.  
 
Grants may be available through the Office of Low Emission Vehicles.  
   
323   [go to Contents ] 
  Appendix 7: Transport Statements, Assessments and 
Travel Plans  
 
New developments will need to provide, as appropriate, Transport Statements  (TS), Transport 
Assessments (TA) and Travel Plans (TP) to ensure the delivery of travel choice and sustainable 
opportunitie s for travel in line with the latest government guidance and best practice.  Thresholds for

The Transport Assessment is a technical assessment which considers how the development will impact 
on the existing trans portation conditions at the year of opening/occupation and under future year 
conditions.  The assessment of the development impact should use existing site information together 
with network conditions at the year of planning application submission, to esta blish a baseline.  On top of 
this, potential person trips to and from the development by individual modes of transport are estimated 
and applied to the baseline and future year conditions. Analysis of public transport, walking / cycling and 
the road networ k, together with safety considerations and accident analysis is undertaken.  The 
Transport Assessment must consider sustainable modes of travel to link in with the site specific 
initiatives within the Travel Plan in order to carry out a full assessment of the relevant infrastructure and 
provision.  This should be compared against a future year assessment of plus 10 years.  The Local 
Planning Authority may in some instances ask for the Transport Assessment to demonstrate more 
extensive future year’s network conditions.  These requests are in line with DfT circular 02/2013 The 
Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development.  
  
325   [go to Contents ] 
  The Transport Statement is a simplified Transport Assessment; it can be used where transport issues 
arising from a de velopment may not require a full Transport Assessment.  A Transport Statement will 
include an audit and appraisal of the existing conditions, baseline traffic data and existing site use and 
means of access.  The statement should also provide information on  the proposed land use and scale of 
development, means of access, person trip generation and distribution of trips by mode.  It should also 
consider proposed improvements to site accessibility by sustainable travel modes, proposed parking and 
residual vehi cle trip impact.  
 
The use of Travel Plans is an essential measure to mitigate the impact of development traffic.  Travel 
Plans must feature alongside any Transport Assessment prepared in support of a planning application.  
 
The Transport Assessment and Tr avel Plan provide a basis for the travel forecasts, as set out in the 
government’s latest guidance.  Thus, enhancements to sustainable transport networks and services 
need to be considered before the implications of car trip forecasts are considered.  
 
Travel Plans should form a stand -alone document and should include:  
 a clear commitment by developers and occupiers to reduce the number of single occupancy 
vehicle trips generated by, or attracted to, the site;  
 accessibility details, setting out options for travel by all modes available for travel to the site; and  
 clear objectives and targets. Targets should be set out both in terms of mode share and number 
of vehicle trips.  
The Travel Plan should set out the baseline situation as well as the target so it is clear what reduction in 
vehicle trips is being sought.  Clear timescales for the achievement of targets should also be included, 
with a clear programme of measures that will be implemented, setting out how the developer will fund 
them.  It should also incl ude clear details on how the Travel Plan will be delivered and how the Travel 
Plan Coordinator role will be provided by the developer and a monitoring strategy setting out what will be 
monitored, by whom and what reporting processes will be in place. The T ravel Plan should be very clear 
on the process to be followed if targets are not met, and set out what additional measures will be funded 
by the developer.  
 
The Travel Plan should include monitoring proposals based on twice yearly counts at each vehicular 
entrance point, or annually, where an automatic traffic count is undertaken in a neutral month for a 
period of 5 years.  
 
A Bond will be required to mitigate any traffic in the event that targets are not met.  The purpose of the 
TP Bond is to ensure that th e targets within the Travel Plan towards sustainable travel (bus, walk, cycle 
etc.) can be met, and if not met the Council would step in with sustainable measures using the Bond. 
The Council needs to be assured that the Travel Plan is effective and has rea sonable targets that can be 
met. The standard formula for calculating the bond is as follows:  
 
Residential Development:  
No. of dwellings x the current cost of a 28 day SY Connect+ ticket  x 1.1.  
 
Non-Residential Development:  
No. of employees x the current  cost of a 28 day SY Connect+ ticket  x 1.1.  
 
Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss and agree the scope of Transport Assessments, Travel 
Plans and related work with The Council before any assessments are undertaken to avoid abortive work.  
 
There wi ll be a need for early engagement with Highways England in the development of Transport 
Assessments and Travel Plans for sites which are likely to have a material impact on the Strategic Road 
Network.  
 
Proposals which impact on the strategic transport net work and require new projects will be expected to 
make a proportionate financial contribution.  Further details can be found in Policy 65.

1. Introduction  
 
These guidelines underpin the selection of Local Wildlife and Geological Sites in Doncaster Borough, in 
support of Policy 31 of the  Local Plan.   
The guidelines are divided into three parts based upon; habitat; s pecies  and g eological selection criteria. 
Each of the three parts includes the relevant site selection criteria, guidance on how they should be 
applied and a rationale for the significance of the feature in the context of Doncaster’s biological and 
geological resource.  
It is only necessary for one criterion to be met , for a site to be designated and Local Site s can be 
selected  based on both wildlife and geological interest s. 
 
2. Wildlife Site Selection Guidelines: Habitats  
 
Both quantita tive and qualitative features are used as a basis for assessing L ocal Wildlife Sites and 
these are incorporated into criteria based upon habitat and s pecies  attributes.  
The habitat criteria are broadly based on those defined by Ratcliffe35 for designating S ites of Special 
Scientific Interest,  but adapted to include  notable features of the Borough’s local biodiversity . The 
habitats and features reflect those identified in Doncaster’s Local Biodiversity Action Plan36, which 
include locally occurring Priority Ha bitats for England37 as well as local biodiversity priorities. Species 
highlighted in bold (see unabridged document) within the descriptive text for each habitat  chapter,  are 
those of conservation importance identified in Doncaster’s Species Audit38.  
Nation al Vegetation Classification (NVC)39 and Phase 1 Habitat Survey40 data, is used  as a basis for  
identify ing, map ping, measuring  and classifying  semi -natural habitats. Some selection  criteria may also 
include a minimum habitat size  attribute , which may be asso ciated with survey methodology and 
standards .

  Local ‘ Habitat Character ’ lists have also been created to assess habitat quality. These lists for key 
communities , help to define local  habitat typicality  and provide a means of assessing their quality 
through  a measure of species diversity. The lists consist of indicator species; more typical community 
components (the presence of which scores one point) and rarities and/or indicators (locally ) of high 
quality and highly distinctive habitat (these score 2 point s). To qualify for Local Site status, sites must 
achieve the threshold score for the habitat being assessed.   
Site assessme nt makes use of the entire dataset  managed by Doncaster’s Local Records Centre. The 
data used is both site -specific and attached to 1 km grid squares and attributed to sites by location 
names . 
 
3. Woodland and Scrub Habitats  
 
Doncaster Borough supports a diversity of woodland and scrub habitats. The following guidelines are for 
the selection of sites of broadleaf semi -natural woodland and s crub, and broadleaf and coniferous 
plantations on former ancient , or long -standing semi -natural woodland sites . 
Site Selection Criteria  – Woodland and Scrub  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site desi gnation.  
WD1  Stands of semi -natural woodland or scrub larger than 0.25ha that have an affinity to the 
following National Vegetation Classification communities:  
W1 Grey Willow – Marsh Bedstraw Woodland  
(Salix cinerea - Galium palustre)  
W2  Grey Willow – Downy Birch – Common Reed Woodland  
(Salix cinerea - Betula pubescens - Phragmites australis)  
W7 Common Alder – Ash – Yellow Pimpernel Woodland  
(Alnus glutinosa - Fraxinus excelsior - Lysimachia nemorum)  
Application  
This criterion selects sites exceeding th e minimum area requirement for the habitat unit and 
demonstrating an affinity to the above listed National Vegetation Classification communities. The 
minimum area is based upon knowledge of the existing habitat resource. As site data is not generally 
recor ded on a habitat compartment basis, the site boundary should relate to recognisable management 
units for the selection attribute and to semi -natural landscape features.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify semi -natural woodland communities of a nationally recognised type 
that are rare in Doncaster. Their rare and fragmented distribution locally necessitates appropriate 
protection, and this is also reflected in the minimum area requirement. Sites supporting more commonly 
occurring National Veget ation Classification communities i.e. W8, W10 and W16, along with non -
assignable habitats will be assessed using alternative woodland criteria.  
 
   
329   [go to Contents ] 
  WD2  Woodland sites of 0.5ha or more that support field evidence of features of ancient or long -
standing wood land. Evidence includes:  
(a) If it is an acidic woodland a score of 14 or more derived from the ‘Lowland heathy oak 
woodland’ habitat character list (Table 3.2)  
(b) If it is a calcareous woodland a score of 20 or more derived from the ‘Limestone 
woodland’ habitat character’ list (Table 3.3)  
(c) If it is a wet woodland a score of 16 or more derived from the ‘Wet woodland’ habitat 
character list, (Table 3.4)  
(d) If it is a scrub community a score of 18 or more derived from the ‘Scrub’ habitat 
character list, (Tables 3.5), an d a scrub stand of 0.5ha.  
 
Application  
This criterion selects woodland sites, including semi -natural and plantation woodland, scrub and habitat 
mosaics, which exceed the minimum area requirement for the site unit. Sites must attain or exceed the 
specified score for the corresponding Habitat Character lists. The species listed do not have to be 
present throughout the entire woodland and the site boundary should relate to recognisable 
management units and to semi -natural landscape features. The minimum site a rea is based upon 
knowledge of the existing woodland. For sites qualifying under (WD2d) the scrub habitat stand should be 
at least 0.5ha, to discount small patches of scrub, that are not part of a larger woodland site.  
Rationale  
This criterion assesses s ites in terms of botanical diversity and local habitat typicality and provides a 
basic measure of the diversity of the Borough’s woodland resource. Sites that are long -standing and 
therefore potentially species -rich, due to longevity or traditional managem ent should score highly. This 
criterion should identify ancient woodlands and replanted ancient woodland sites where associated 
botanical features and diversity have prevailed and need to be protected from further degradation or 
loss. The species lists for  the woodland types have varying scoring thresholds, based upon the differing 
nature of the habitats and their botanical attributes. A sample of sites of varying quality but representing 
each of the woodland types has been assessed to establish an appropri ate scoring threshold for each.  
WD3  Areas of woodland that support:  
(a) 68+ species of native woodland vascular plants or  
(b) 5+ species of fern, or  
(c) ‘notable’, old or veteran trees  
 
Application  
This criterion selects areas of woodland and scrub that support the s pecial attributes identified. A 
minimum habitat area has not been specified as some attributes are associated with individual features. 
Site boundaries should relate to recognisable management units for the qualifying selection attribute, 
where this is not  part of a larger designated site. A notable tree is defined by being of great age for its 
species, a rare species or of particularly high visual amenity and this will be subject to assessment by a 
local expert.  
Rationale  
The habitat features identified in this criterion provide an indication of woodland diversity, rarity and 
naturalness. Some of the features, such as veteran trees, provide specialist microhabitats supporting 
niche biodiversity and are therefore important in their own right. Generally hab itat communities that 
reflect such characteristics are long -standing and species -rich.  
WD4  Bluebell woodlands (locally usually NVC W10, and sometimes W8 and W16) greater than 
0.5ha.  
 
   
330   [go to Contents ] 
  Application  
This criterion selects semi -natural woodland, scrub and ha bitat mosaics, exceeding the minimum area 
requirement for the habitat unit and supporting a significant bluebell population. As a guide, the ground 
cover of bluebell should be 40% or greater in at least 10% of the woodland area. Site boundaries should 
relate to recognisable management units and to semi -natural landscape features.  
Rationale  
The UK supports a significant proportion of the European population of bluebell and, as such, has a 
particular duty to ensure the survival of this species through the pro tection of bluebell woodlands.  
WD5  Woodland sites of 0.5ha or more, which have a score within 20% of the scoring threshold 
for any of the different local woodland types (see WD2)  and which adjoin, or lie within 
0.5km of an existing woodland, scrub or hedge row statutory site or Local Wildlife Site.  
Application  
This criterion selects sites supporting woodland, scrub and hedgerow habitats, and mosaics of the 
above, exceeding the minimum area requirement for the habitat unit. This is a multi -factor assessment,  
based upon the identification of sites of lesser, yet substantive biodiversity value, which function as an 
effective wildlife corridor based upon their proximity to other statutory and Local Wildlife Sites of a similar 
type. In accordance with Defra’s Loc al Sites guidance 41, where a site has a number of small fragments 
of semi -natural habitats that together could be managed to provide linkages for natural colonisation or 
movement, a local site boundary can be defined to take in a wider area and include disc ontinous 
patches.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify sites with substantive biodiversity value, which themselves may 
reflect the former extent of an area of continuous semi -natural woodland, and which through their relative 
position are capa ble of supporting a wider network of statutory and non -statutory sites. The relative 
position of sites within the wider ecological unit is essential in supporting the effective functioning of 
habitats and in facilitating the natural population dynamics of species that live and move within and 
between them. This criterion is designed to support the maintenance of networks of natural habitats.

4. Parkland and Wood Pasture Habitats  
 
Historic, formal and pastoral landscapes supporting assemblages of semi -natural habitats are scattered 
across Doncaster Borough. The following guidelines are for the selection of sites supporting parkla nd 
and lowland wood pasture habitats (along with their associated features).  
Site Selection C riteria  – Parkland and Wood Pasture  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
PK1 Parkland or wo od pasture sites greater than 5 ha that support habitats and species 
traditionally associated with parkland or wood pasture and/or support individual, 
groupings or scattered old, notable or veteran trees.  
  
333   [go to Contents ] 
  Application  
This criterion selects  parkland and wo od pasture sites exceeding the minimum area requirement for the 
site unit, irrespective of designation or listing. The site should exhibit a combination of semi -natural 
habitats or man-made features (see unabridged document ), supporting related biodiversit y interest. Site 
boundaries should reflect landscape and habitat management units and features and may therefore 
incorporate estate buildings and infrastructure. Arable land u nits should be excluded from  site area  
assessments , but may be included within th e site boundary.  
Rationale  
Parkland sites supporting traditionally associated habitats provide a diverse range of biodiversity 
features. As a result of relative habitat continuity, lack of modification and traditional land management 
practices they can sup port a range of species that may no longer occur in the wider countryside or that 
are specifically associated with niche habitats related with long standing features. Of particular 
significance are old and veteran trees, which themselves provide stable hab itats a t a micro -habitat and 
landscape -scale.  
PK2 Groupings of relatively old and/or veteran trees in former parkland, wood pasture or 
similar sites, and known to support fungi and/or invertebrates and/or lichens which are 
either characteristic or speciali st species of veteran trees.  
Application  
This criterion selects  former and existing parkland and wood pasture sites, irrespective of condition, 
altered use, management or fragmented nature. Eligible sites are required to support groupings of 
relatively old42 and/or veteran trees (either native or exotic) and their associated specialist biodiversity. 
Site boundaries will reflect landscape and habitat management units for the feature of interest.  
Rationale  
Veteran trees characteristically support features incl uding; cavities and crevices, rot holes and hollows, 
pools, dead wood and sap runs, and such provide microhabitats and resources for a range of specialist 
species. Long -standing groupings of such can support a significant variety of wildlife and afford gre ater 
stability than individual specimens.  
 
5. Hedgerow Habitats  
 
The following guidelines are for the selection of sites supporting ancient and/or species rich hedgerows.  
Site Selection C riteria  - Hedgerows  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criter ia will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
HD1 A hedgerow that is at least 30 metres in length, pre -dates 1845 and supports;  
(a) 5 or more species (per 30 metre sample),  of native hedgerow trees and shrubs 
listed in the ‘Ancient and/or Species Ri ch hedgerows’ character list for woody 
species (Table 5.2), or  
(b) 4 or more species (per 30 metre sample), of native hedgerow trees and shrubs 
(Table 4.2), and has a score of 5 or more from the ‘Ancient and/or Species Rich 
hedgerows’ character list for non -woody species (Table 5.3), or  
(c) Supports ‘notable’43, old or veteran tree/s, or  
(d) Is remnant ancient woodland of hedgerow dimension  
                                                           
42 Read, H. (2000) Veteran Trees: A guide to good management. Peterborough: English Nature.  
43 Pretty E., et al. (2001), Notable and Venerable Trees in the Doncaster Borough, Doncaster Metropolitan Council.   
334   [go to Contents ] 
   
Application  
This criterion selects  hedgerows exceeding 30m in length and believed to pre -date 1845, as determined 
by map and field  evidence. This milestone is taken to represent the pre -dating of enclosure acts 
(irrespective of the existence of the Act), as supported by the Amended Hedgerow Regulations 199744. 
This criterion is in many provisions compatible with the hedgerow regulatio ns, but focuses on biodiversity 
value. The minimum linear site length is 30m, although site boundaries will relate to recognisable 
management units and semi -natural landscape feat ures. In this instance, species scoring two points  on 
the hedgerow species li sts, also include those species associated with hedgerows on limestone 
substrates, which are considered to be of particular local biodiversity value.  
Rationale  
Pre-enclosure Act hedgerows are considered to be ancient hedgerows by the UK Habitat Action Pla n for 
Hedgerows. Such long -established semi -natural features of the landscape can exhibit great structural 
diversity, support features of great biodiversity value, such as veteran trees and even represent 
remnants of the  original wildwoods. Particular emph asis has been awarded to hedgerows with an 
associated limestone flora, which tend to be more botanically diverse, are of limited distribution and have 
suffered more from degradation and removal on the fertile limestone plateau and river valley areas. 
Despi te this a geographical weighting has not been adopted, and sites will be required to meet the 
criterion on age and biodiversity attributes.  
HD2 Hedgerow/s connecting statutory sites or Local Wildlife Sites, which are at least 30 metres 
in length, 0.5km or less apart and support 3 or more native tree and shrub species (Table 
5.2) and/or has a score of 3 or more for non woody species (Table 5.3).  
Application  
This criterion selects any stretch of ‘connecting’ hedgerow of a more or less continuous nature, where  
gaps should not account collectively for more than 25% of the hedge line. The criterion targets 
hedgerows of lesser, yet substantive biodiversity value, which can to function as an effective wildlife 
corridor based upon their proximity to other statutory and Local Wildlife Sites . Sites meeting the above 
assessment criteria will be proposed for Local Wildlife Site designation, with boundaries based upon 
habitat management units and semi -natural landscape features.  
Rationale  
Hedgerows are a significant wild life habitat in their own right, and also provide a network of structured 
vegetation corridors across the wider landscape. The connectivity and relative position of habitat 
features within a wider ecological unit is important in supporting the effective fu nctioning of particular 
habitats and the natural population dynamics of the species that live and move within and between them. 
Hedgerows themselves may reflect the former extent of semi -natural woodland, however their value as a 
wildlife corridor linking a range of habitats is extremely important, particularly when the sites are statutory 
or other Local Wildlife Sites. This criterion is designed to support the maintenance of networks of natural 
habitats.

6. Grassland Habitats, including Lowland Heathland / Acid Grassland Mosaics  
 
Doncaster Borough supports a diversity of grassland habitats ranging from v egetated limestone crags, 
through to lowland heath and scrub communities.  
Site Selection Criteria  – Grassland and Heathland  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
GR1 Areas of ancient or  long established semi -natural grassland of at least 0.1ha in 
size, or at least 50m in length if along a linear feature (drain, verge, bank, hedge, 
way leave), that support stands of one or more of the following National Vegetation 
Classification community  types:  
U1 sheep’s fescue – common bent – sheep’s sorrel grassland  
(Festuca ovina -Agrostis capillaris -Rumex acetosella)  
U2 wavy hair -grass grassland  
(Deschampsia flexuosa)  
U4 sheep’s fescue – common bent – heath bedstraw grassland  
(Festuca ovina -Agrostis  capillaris -Galium saxatile)  
MG4  meadow foxtail – greater burnet grassland  
(Alopecurus pratensis -Sanguisorba officinalis)  
MG5  crested dog’s -tail – common knapweed grassland  
(Cynosurus cristatus -Centaurea nigra)   
337   [go to Contents ] 
  CG3  upright brome grassland  
(Bromus erectus)  
CG4  tor grass grassland  
(Brachypodium pinnatum)  
CG5  upright brome – tor grass grassland  
(Bromus erectus -Brachypodium pinnatum)  
 
Application  
This criterion selects grasslands exceeding the minimum area or length requirement for the habitat unit 
and supporti ng grassland with an affinity to the above listed National Vegetation Classification 
communities.  The minimum dimensions have been based upon knowledge of the existing habitat 
resource, however as site data is not generally recorded on a habitat compartmen t basis, the boundary 
will relate to recognisable management units for the selection attribute and to semi -natural landscape 
features. This criterion excludes recently created grasslands.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify semi -natural grass land communities of a nationally recognised type 
that are rare in Doncaster. Their rarity and limited extent, both in terms of size and isolation, necessitates 
appropriate protection and this is also reflected in the relatively small minimum area requireme nt. 
Determination of an appropriate site boundary should correspond with management units, rather than 
distinct habitat types, as this is likely to be fragmented or of varying NVC affinity. The designation of a 
broader management unit will also ensure that  the valuable associated bryophyte interest is protected. 
Affinity to a characteristic NVC assemblage should reflect relative long -standing and therefore identify 
established and often species -rich grasslands, which are not of recent origin. Sites supporti ng more 
commonly occurring NVC communities and non -assignable habitats will be assessed using alternative 
grassland criteria.  
 
GR2 Areas of semi -natural grassland of at least 0.25ha or 50m if along a linear feature (drain, 
verge, bank, hedge, way leave), scoring:  
a) 45 or more from the ‘Neutral and wet grassland habitat character’ list (Table 6.2) or,  
b) 26 or more from the ‘Limestone grassland habitat character’ list (Table 6.3) or,  
c) 20 or more from the ‘Lowland heathland/Acid grassland mosaic habitat character’  list 
(Table 6.4).  
 
Application  
This criterion selects grassland and heathland mosaic sites including composite areas of bryophyte turf, 
scrub, bare ground and habitat mosaics, which exceed the minimum area or length requirement for the 
habitat unit. Habi tats are required to attain the score specified for each of the corresponding Habitat 
Character lists. The species listed do not have to be present throughout the entire grassland. The 
species lists combine indicators of both local habitat typicality and q uality, though do include rarities, 
which are highlighted in bold and generate a double score. Grasslands should not have been recently 
created. The minimum site dimensions have been based upon knowledge of the existing habitat 
resource. Site boundaries sh ould relate to recognisable management units and to semi -natural 
landscape features.  
Rationale  
This criterion assesses sites in terms of botanical diversity and local habitat typicality and provides a 
basic measure of the biodiversity of the Borough’s gras sland and heathland mosaic resource. Sites that 
are long -standing and therefore potentially species -rich, due to longevity or traditional management 
should rank highly. The species lists for the grassland types have varying scoring thresholds, based  
338   [go to Contents ] 
  upon t he differing nature of the habitats and their botanical attributes. A sample of sites of varying quality 
but representing each of the grassland types has been assessed to establish an appropriate scoring 
threshold for each.  
GR3 Areas of semi -natural grassl and of at least 0.25ha or 50m if along a linear feature (drain, 
verge, bank, hedge, way leave), which have a score within 20% of the qualifying threshold 
for any of the different local grassland types (see GR2) and which adjoin or lie within 
500m of an exi sting grassland, heathland, or fen statutory site or Local Wildlife Site.  
Application  
This criterion selects sites supporting grassland habitats and heathland mosaics, exceeding the 
minimum dimensions for the habitat unit. This is a multi -factor assessmen t, based upon the identification 
of sites of lesser, yet substantive biodiversity value i.e. assessed as within 20% of the scores specified 
for qualification, and which can function as an effective wildlife corridor due to their proximity to other 
statutor y and Local Wildlife Sites of a similar type. In accordance with Defra’s Local Sites guidance45, 
where a site has a number of small fragments of semi -natural habitats that together could be managed 
to provide linkages for natural colonisation or movement, a  site boundary can be defined to take in a 
wider area and include discontinous patches. Sites meeting the above assessment criteria will be 
proposed for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
Rationale  
Sites identified for selection using this criterion have sub stantive biodiversity value, and support the 
ecological function s of the wider network of statutory and non -statutory sites. The relative position of 
sites within the wider landscape is essential in supporting networks of similar habitats and their 
communi ties. The retention and enhancement of wildlife corridors and  linking of fragmented habitats  is 
extremely significant when the sites are statutory or other Local Sites of a similar type.  
LH1 Areas greater than 0.1ha of dry or wet heath, which score 14 or m ore from the ‘Lowland 
heathland/Acid grassland mosaic habitat character’ list (Table 6.4).  
Application  
This criterion selects  heathland sites wet or dry, exceeding the minimum area requirement for the habitat  
unit and attaining the score specified from th e corresponding Habitat Character list. The species list 
reflects the ecological character of Doncaster’s heathland communities in light of their geographical, 
geological and landscape context, rather than assigned NVC categories . The species listed are no t 
required to be present throughout the entire site. The site boundary may include other habitats 
considered to support the integrity and management of the heathland feature.  
Rationale  
This criterion targets sites in terms of their botanical diversity and  local habitat typicality. These sites are 
important due to the rarity of the habitat within the region. In addition, this habitat type supports a large 
number of species of conservation importance, many of which are uniquely associated with these 
habitats . The relatively small area requirement has been assigned to stress the rarity of the habitat in 
size and distribution.  
LH2 Areas greater than 0.1ha of dry or wet heath, which have a score within 20% of the 
qualifying threshold for LH1 and which adjoin or lie within 500m of an existing grassland, 
heathland, or fen statutory site or Local Wildlife Site.  
Application  
This criterion selects sites supporting heathland habitats, which exceed the minimum area requirement 
for the habitat unit, attain a score withi n 20% of the qualifying threshold for heathland sites and is in 
close proximity to other statutory sites or Local Wildlife Sites of specified type. The site boundary can be 
                                                           
45 Defra, 2006, Local Sites: Guidance on their Identification, Selection and Management   
339   [go to Contents ] 
  defined to take in a wider area and include discontinous patches. The site boundary  should be drawn to 
protect the sites interest as part of a management unit, and consider means of physical connectivity to 
neighbouring wildlife sites.  
 
Rationale  
Sites identified for selection using this criterion have substantive biodiversity value, and  through their 
intrinsic value and relative position, can support the wider network of statutory and non -statutory sites. 
Due to the rarity of heathland habitats within the region it is important to identify sites that exhibit some 
biodiversity interest an d can also be targeted for enhancement and restoration.

  7. Fen and Mire Habitats  
 
A range of fen  and mire habitats are present throughout the borough, supporting a rich diversity of 
aquatic and terrestrial communities.  
Site Selection Criteria  – Fen and Mires  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Si te designation.  
LM1 Lowland raised mire sites greater than 0.1 ha that support at least 1 species from the 
following indicator list and a further 3 species from the ‘Lowland raised mire habitat 
character’ list (Table 7.3);  
Erica tetralix  – Cross -leaved hea th 
Eriophorum angustifolium – Common cottongrass  
Vaccinium oxycoccos - Cranberry  
Drosera rotundifolia – Common sundew   
Narthecium ossifragum – Bog asphodel  
Sphagnum species  
Molinia caerulea – Purple moor grass  
Calamagrostis canescens – Purple small reed  
Application  
This criterion selects sites exceeding the minimum area requirement for the site unit and supporting 1 
lowland raised mire indicator species (listed above) as well as at least 3 species associated with the 
community type as listed in Table 7.3. The minimum area requirement is based upon knowledge of the 
existing resource and allows for the inclusion of associated habitats, which support mire development 
and ecology. Determination of the site boundary should consider hydrological function and rela te to 
recognisable management units and to semi -natural landscape features.  
Rationale  
Doncaster’s lowland raised mires are not in pristine condition and therefore are unlikely to be detected 
using NVC community definitions. This criterion has therefore be en adapted to use a series of key 
indicator species, rather than community assemblages, to avoid discounting valuable sites. This criterion 
is designed to identify a nationally rare habitat, present in Doncaster Borough. The rare and fragmented 
distributio n of this habitat outside statutory sites necessitates appropriate protection for the site itself and 
habitat network supporting Natura 2000 sites and this is reflected in the small site area and inclusion of 
supporting habitats.  
 
 FE1 Stands of tall -herb fen and/or reedbed that are greater than 0.25ha in area and are 
predominantly comprised of one or more of the following NVC communities:  
 
S4 Common reed (Phragmites australis)  swamp and reed -bed. 
S25 Common reed – Hemp agrimony (Phragmites australis - Eupa torium cannabinum)  
tall-herb fen  
S26 Common reed – Common nettle (Phragmites australis - Urtica dioica)  tall-herb fen  
S28 Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea ) tall-herb fen  
M27 Meadowsweet – Wild angelica (Filipendula ulmaria - Angelica sylvestris)  mire 
(Doncaster’s ‘Fenny Fields’)  
 
   
343   [go to Contents ] 
  Application  
This criterion selects sites supporting fen habitats that have been established for more than 5 years. 
Sites of this age are more likely to exhibit enhanced habitat structure (normally associated with larger 
sites), and may support a diverse faunal interest. The transient nature of the habitat should be taken into 
account in establishing an appropriate site boundary, which can include a combination of other fen, 
swamp, mire, grassland, scrub, wet woodland and op en water communities. Site eligibility based upon 
minimum area, should however be based upon the area of fen habitat rather than that of the entire site.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify characteristic National Vegetation Classification ha bitat types that 
are locally and regionally rare.  The minimum area requirement reflects the limited extent of local habitats 
exhibiting this character, which have suffered fragmentation and isolation. This criterion specifically 
targets the inclusion of lo cal peculiarities.  
FE2 Mixed fen sites greater than 0.25 ha scoring 23 or more from the ‘Mixed fen habitat 
character’ list (Table 7.4):  
Application  
This criterion selects sites exceeding the minimum area requirement for the  site unit, and supporting fen 
habitat (rich or poor) that exhibit a characteristic species assemblage and attain a diversity score above 
the qualification threshold. The site can comprise a combination of fen and associated habitats, and the 
boundary should relate to recognisable managem ent units and to semi -natural landscape features.  
Rationale  
Fen sites have suffered fragmentation and degradation, largely as a result of changes in landuse and 
land management. Existing fen sites greater than 0.25ha exhibiting a typical and diverse fen sp ecies 
assemblage should be selected to help protect their integrity and continuity.

8. Standing Water Habitats  
 
Standing waters include both natural and man -made features , such as lakes, ponds, drains, and gravel 
pits. Whilst many of Doncaster’s standing water habitats appear quite natur al, they owe their origin to 
activities such as mineral extraction, industrial processes, construction of canal, railway and road 
embankments, fishing, power generation, stock watering, and ornament. They include the sluggish 
waters of canals, features for merly part of f lowing waters, i.e. oxbow lakes and also drains, where they 
dry out or have an intermittent flow or are reliant on pumping.  
Site Selection Criteria  – Standing Water  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for L ocal Wildlife Site designation.  
SW1  Eutrophic and mesotrophic standing water , that scores 25 or more from the ‘Standing 
water habitat character’ list (Table 8.2).  
Application  
This criterion selects sites which exhibit a neutral to nutrient enriched water q uality and attain the score 
specified for the corresponding Habitat Character list. The species listed do not have to be present 
throughout the entire waterbody. Site boundaries should relate to recognisable management units and to 
semi -natural landscape f eatures. They should include areas of marginal vegetation fringing the 
waterbody, for which the associated species are included in the Habitat Character list, although 
bordering semi -natural habitats should be considered under the Mixed Habitats and Struct ural Mosaic 
criteria. For linear waterbodies species diversity should be assessed over a 30m stretch of habitat, 
although the site boundary may extend beyond the survey section to clear landmarks. This is particularly 
important within drain networks, where  individual channels are subject to routine vegetation clearance, 
justifying the designation of a greater area of eligible habitat to support their biodiverse regeneration.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify sites in terms of their botanical  diversity and local habitat typicality. 
The species listed in the Habitat Character list are indicative of the vegetation found in good quality 
standing open water habitat. A minimum area requirement has not been assigned in reflection of the 
rarity of sp ecies rich standing water habitats, particularly small ponds.  
SW2  Standing water that supports one of the known rare aquatic habitats in Doncaster, as 
listed below:  
a) Mesotrophic standing water  
b) Oligotrophic standing water  
c) 5 or more submerged nativ e aquatic species  
d) Stable charophyte communities  
e) Inland brackish waters and saltmarsh  
f) Spring -fed calcareous waterbodies  
   
346   [go to Contents ] 
  Application  
This criterion selects  sites known to support the listed features, and again should include areas of 
marginal veg etation fringing the waterbody.  
 
Rationale  
These habitat attributes are considered locally rare and worthy of protection through site designation.  
Biodiversity interest for selected features will also be entomological and therefore sites will be identified  
through nomination rather than Habitat Character lists.

9. Flowing Water Habitats  
 
Natural rivers and flowing waters are dynamic, biodiverse sys tems, undergoing constant modification of 
course and form. They form vital wildlife corridors and their associated floodplain wetlands support a 
mosaic of aquatic habitats including; swift and slow flowing open waters, marshes, fen, damp grassland, 
wet woo dland and swamp. They also exhibit characteristic physical features associated with hydrological 
processes, e.g. riffles and pools, which support a range of aquatic species, and exposed sediments 
(whether tidal or draw -down), shingle beds and sand bars, wh ich are important for a number of 
invertebrates. Doncaster borough supports a number of biodiverse flowing water and associated 
habitats . These guidelines may also be applied to drains with a determinable flow.  
  
348   [go to Contents ] 
  Site Selection Criteria  – Flowing Water  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
FW1   A stretch of river or smaller water course that supports 2 or more of the following a) -
d): 
 
a) regularly supports a high and/or near natural water qua lity as determined by Biological General 
Quality Assessment methodology used by the Environment Agency,  
 
b) a suite of 3 or more features of natural river habitats, that should normally occur in the stretch of 
watercourse being evaluated from those listed be low:  
i. Cascades  
ii. Islands  
iii. Oxbows  
iv. Pools  
v. Rapids  
vi. Riffle and run systems  
vii. River cliffs (earth or rock)  
viii. Exposed estuarine sand or mud banks  
ix. Shingle banks/gravel shoals  
x. Unmodified bank profiles  
xi. Unvegetated point bars  
xii. Vegetated point bars  
xiii. Accum ulations of coarse woo dy debris  
 
c) A score of 20 or more from the ‘Flowing water habitat character’ list (Table 9.2)  
 
d) Significant water -crowfoot beds  
 
Application  
This criterion selects  flowing water sites  and associated wetland habitats of natural and artificial origin. 
There is  no minimum area requirement, however the linear nature of flowing water habitats necessitates 
that assessments should be undertaken in sections between landmark features. Botanical diversity 
should be measured across a sample distance of 30m within the de signated stretch.  
Rationale  
Rivers play a vital role in providing habitats, feeding grounds and wildlife corridors on a major scale, yet 
their semi -natural character and water quality has been eroded by external pressures. Flowing water 
sites exhibiting th e features listed above are eligible for designation. The features listed in b) can offer 
specific conditions for a variety of fauna and d) is of locally restricted distribution and associated with 
base -rich substrates and indicative of unpolluted water.  
 FW2  Any stream or spring originating from calcareous substrata in the Southern Magnesian Limestone 
Natural Area that supports a characteristic calcareous invertebrate fauna as verified by an 
invertebrate ecologist.  
Application  
This criterion selects  streams or spring s originating from the Southern Magnesian Limestone Natural 
Area, which supports a characteristic calcareous invertebrate assemblage . There is no minimum area 
requirement, and the site boundary should contain a distinct management unit between  landmark 
features.  
Rationale  
It is difficult to specify a characteristic calcareous stream flora for Doncaster, although possible indicators 
include water -crowfoot. Therefore calcareous invertebrate fauna should be used as an indicator of 
appropriate and  favourable condition, for this locally notable habitat.

10.  Mixed Habitats and Structural Mosaics  
 
Wildlife sites rarely comprise ve getation of homogenous type, cover or structure, but exhibit variation 
within and between habitats at all scales. At a macro -scale habitat mosaics and structural features can 
significantly contribute to the overall biodiversity of an area, whilst at a micr o-scale they can provide 
specific ecological requirements to support the different life stages and habits of a particular species. 
Mixed habitats and structural mosaics are therefore considered particularly important for invertebrate 
species and assemblage s, as the structural heterogeneity they provide within a small area supports 
greater species -richness and opportunities for specialist and niche diversity.  
The following guidelines are for  the selection and designation of Local Wildlife Sites supporting h abitats 
and features that are both individually and collectively of conservation value. The guidelines aim to 
identify : 
 Sites supporting habitats  of substantive nature conservation value, which just fail to meet the 
selection criteria for their specific ha bitat components, yet which together with other features , 
present an enhanced array of ecological resources for biological communities. This includes 
areas adjoining, or in close proximity to other Local Wildlife Sites or statutory sites.  
 
 Sites that suppo rt varied macro -habitats and provide more structural variation  than individual 
habitats in isolation.  
Site Selection Criteria  – Mixed Habitats and Structural Mosaics  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife  Site designation.  
SM1  Sites of 0.5ha or more in size, or 50m if along a linear feature, where the predominant 
habitat is of borderline Local Wildlife Site quality and adjoins or lies within 500m of an 
existing Local Wildlife Site or statutory site.  
 
Appl ication  
This criterion selects mixed habitat sites exceeding the minimum area requirement for the site unit, 
where the predominant habitat is of borderline Local Wildlife Site quality. Habitat quality is based upon 
attainment of a score within 20% of the q ualifying threshold set for any of the various Habitat Character 
lists. The site should lie within 500m of an existing Local Wildlife Site or statutory type of any habitat 
type. The site boundary should relate to landscape features associated with the mosa ic, which can 
include contributing artificial structures.  
Rationale  
This criterion is designed to identify sites that due to component habitat size or quality are ineligible for 
Local Wildlife Site designation on their own merit, yet whose substantive nat ure conservation value is  
351   [go to Contents ] 
  elevated given their proximity to other Local Wildlife Sites and statutory sites. Such sites support 
connectivity within the wider landscape and provide features of interest, which attract and support the 
species ecology of neighb ouring wildlife sites of recognised value.  
SM2 Sites of 5ha or more in size that support a mosaic of the semi -natural habitats listed in 
Table 10.2, which  collectively have a habitat mosaic score of 6 or more.  
Application  
This criterion selects  sites exce eding the minimum area requirement for the site unit that support a 
mosaic of semi -natural habitats, including geological features such as rock faces, and therefore 
potentially incorporating Local Geological Sites. Two of the habitats present should in com bination cover 
at least 25% of the total site area, to ensure adequate semi -natural habitat coverage, although the site 
may incorporate other artificial habitats. Individual habitats have been attributed a score based upon 
their local significance, conside ring status, distribution and quality. Site boundaries relate to landscape 
features associated with the mosaic, which can include contributing artificial structures.  
Rationale  
Sites supporting mixed semi -natural habitats and structural mosaics on this scal e and exceeding the 
habitat mosaic score make a significant contribution to the borough’s biodiversity. Such sites play an 
important role in providing opportunity and resources to protect and conserve the biodiversity and 
character associated with their re spective Natural Area. Large expanses of semi -natural and other 
habitats are particularly important for their faunal interest, especially where animal species require an 
extended territory to provide for and play -out different aspects of their life cycle.

SM3 Sites supporting 10 or more species of bryophyte listed in Table 10.3  
Application  
This criterion s elects sites that support at least 10 bryophyte species from those listed in Table 10.3. The 
site can include geological and artificial features and site boundaries should relate to habitat and 
lands cape features associated with the mosaic.  
Rationale  
Bryop hytes are non -vascular plants which grow in mats or cushions on rocks, soil, or as epiphytes on the 
trunks and leaves of trees, generally flourishing in moist conditions.  Mosses, liverworts and hornworts 
provide structural diversity on a micro -scale, provi de seed beds for larger plants, they capture and 
recycle soluble nutrients and bind the soil to keep it from eroding. Sphagnum mosses  are particularly 
important bryophyte components of peatland and wetland communities. Sites supporting a variety of 
                                                           
46 Adapted from: North Yorkshire SINC Panel, 2002, Guidelines for Site Sel ection   
352   [go to Contents ] 
  bryophy tes are likely to be structurally diverse and exhibit a range of conditions and habitats that may 
similarly be favorable for the niche ecology of invertebrates.

11. Habitats of Artificial Substrates  
 
The following guidelines are for  the selection and designation of Local Wildlife Sites supporting distinct 
habitats of biodiversity interest and value associated with artificial substrates.  
Site Selection Criteria  – Artificial Substrates  
Sites that meet one or more of the following criteria will be eligible for Local Wildlife Site designation.  
AS1 A former coal mine, spoil disposal, or coking/processing site of at least 0.25ha that scores 
10 or more from the ‘Species of Artificial Substrates’ list (Table 11.1).  
AS2 Settlement lagoons and waste sites of the glass processing industry of 0.25ha or more in 
size, scoring 10 or more from the ‘Species of Artificial Substrates’ list (Table 11.2).  
AS3 Sites greater than 0.25ha where foundry sand and resins have been used in industrial 
moulding processes, and which score 10 or more from the ‘Species of Artificial 
Substrates’ list (Table 11.3).  
Application  
These criteria select the relevant industrial sites of at least 0.25ha, attaining the associated species 
diversity and habitat typicality score. There should be a good distribution of the species present from the  
353   [go to Contents ] 
  ‘Species of Artificial Substrates’ throughout the designated areas. Site boundaries can incl ude a 
combination of habitats of semi -natural and artificial substrates and other man -made features, if the 
qualifying habitats are dispersed across large or mixed character sites.  
 
Rationale  
The Artificial Substrates criteria tend to focus on sites of sel ected historical industrial processes, where 
distinctive wildlife communities associated with specific industrial wastes are supported. These sites are 
diminishing in number and their habitats are inherently susceptible to transition, which could result in  the 
loss of an element of their biodiversity interest, therefore the ir localised and special characteristics 
should be recognised through site designation.

  12. Wildlife Site Selecti on Guidelines: Species  
 
Background  
The designation of Local Sites on the basis of qualifying habitats will result in the protection of a wide 
range of species of conservation importance and interest. However, not all sites of importance for key 
species wil l qualify for Local Site designation based on their habitats alone. It’s also important to 
recognise the biodiversity interests of individual sites to conserve them appropriately – especially if these 
relate to a specific species. A set of criteria have th erefore been developed, to help assess sites that 
may be of importance for the conservation of particular species.  
Use of the Doncaster Biodiversity Audit  
Doncaster’s Species Audit47 was originally compiled as part of Doncaster’s Local Biodiversity Action 
Plan, to highlight species of conservation concern and interest in the Borough. These species were 
identified using a series of national, regional and local selection criteria agreed by Doncaster Biodiversity 
Action Partnership. The criteria were based upon  published conservation listings , reflecting the known 
distribution and abundance of species and changing population trends, and therefore includ ed the most 
threatened species requiring conservation action.  
The Species Audit is designed to be updated to r eflect species status changes and this will ensure the 
continued relevance of the document in highlighting species of local and national conservation interest 
and concern. Using the Audit to underpin the species -based selection criteria provides an opportu nity to 
designate Local Sites that support relatively stable populations of key species.  
Population size assessment  
Several of the species criteria use the term ‘significant’ in relation to population size, when determining if 
a Local Site should be desig nated. The significance of a population on a particular site will be 
determined through consultation with an appropriate expert, e.g. relevant county recorder for a species 
group or an advisor from Natural England. This approach allows for consideration of  both discrete and 
meta -populations in determining the importance of the site, based on expert knowledge of the area and 
species in question. It also allows for a more flexible consideration of data availability, recording effort 
limitations and potential population shifts linked to climate change etc.  
Population data  
Local Sites designated on account of their species interest should ideally be evidenced by population 
data recorded within the last five years, that has been provided by, or verified by, a rel iable source and 
indicate a stable presence of the species concerned.  Stability will be inferred when a species has been 
recorded at a site in at least two of the previous five years. For a site to qualify, the species population 
should be considered to b e of significant size, for one of the two recording events. If it is deemed that the 
population on a site has declined between survey visits, but that this is as a result of inappropriate 
management, then efforts will be focused on bringing the site into a ppropriate management and 
achieving favourable condition ( in accordance with Defra guidelines ). Similarly,  a site will not be 
automatically de -designated due to lack of data. Instea d, sites will only be assessed for de -designation if 
sufficient survey effo rt has established that the species is no longer present.   
13. Site Selection Criteria – Mammals  
 
M1     (a)  Any single hibernation roost that regularly supports 2 or more species of bat and/or 
15 or more individuals.  
(b) Any series of smaller bat hibernation roosts that while individually would not qualify 
under criteria M1(a) are together considered of significance.  
(c) Any roost that regularly supports three or more species of bat.  
                                                           
47 A Species Audit of Doncaster Borough (2007)   
356   [go to Contents ] 
  (d) Any breeding roost that regularly supports a significant population of a bat species.  
Application  
These criteria will be used to select sites that support significant populations of bats within Doncaster. 
The criteria will not be applied to industrial buildings, agricultural buildings or domestic dwellings. Other 
man-made  struc tures such as bridges, tunnels and mine shafts will be eligible for designation, as well as 
natural features such as trees and caves. Foraging areas, which have been identified by surveys as 
supporting the roost site, will also be eligible for inclusion wi thin the designated area. Sites considered 
for inclusion under criterion M1(b) will be assessed through appropriate consultation.   
Rationale  
All species of bat found within the UK are protected by legislation (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and 
The Con servation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations. This protection has stemmed from the serious 
declines that these species have undergone in the last 50 years. Bats have a slow reproductive rate, 
females having only one offspring in a year, and hence are vuln erable to population crashes if breeding 
colonies are destroyed or damaged. An ideal breeding roost may be used repeated over many years and 
hence is appropriate for designation as a conservation site. Hibernation roosts can also be used 
repeatedly over ma ny years. A good roost has to provide a variety of environmental conditions and be 
suitable in a range of prevailing weather conditions. Roosts that support large numbers of bats or a 
variety of species are therefore particularly important. In addition, si tes with a series of smaller roosts, 
that may provide differing environmental conditions, are equally important.  
 
Table 13.1 Numbers of bats that indicate a significant breeding roost in Doncaster.  
Bat Species  Significant roost  
Barbastella barbastellus  30 or more animals  
Myotis brandtii  30 or more animals  
Myotis daubentonii  30 or more animals  
Myotis mystacinus  30 or more animals  
Myotis nattereri  30 or more animals  
Nyctalus leisleri  30 or more animals  
Nyctalus noctula  30 or more animals  
Pipistrellus pipistrellus  100 or more animals  
Pipistrellus pygmaeus  100 or more animals  
Plecotus auritus  30 or more animals  
 
M2 Any site known to support an otter breeding holt.  
Application  
This criterion will be used to designate sections of watercourse and surroun ding habitat that show 
evidence of use by breeding otter.  
Rationale  
Protection of otter breeding sites is important to ensure conservation of the species.  
 
14. Site Selection Criteria – Birds  
 
B1 Any cliff, crag or sand bank that supports a breeding bird spec ies present on the 
Doncaster Species Audit.  
Application  
This criterion will be used to identify any geological features, such as cliff faces resulting from minerals 
extraction works, which support a breeding bird species present on the Audit. The criterion  may result in 
the identification of areas within active minerals sites. Due to the industrial nature of these sites a  
357   [go to Contents ] 
  specific cliff face may be altered over time. It is envisaged that designation will be used as a tool to 
highlight the importance of the habitat for use by birds and ensure encourage its maintenance within a 
site as a whole rather than for the protection of one very specific area. It is also envisaged that this 
criterion will be used to protect sites important for breeding sand martins.   
Rationale  
Cliff faces provide important nesting habitat for bird species such as peregrine falcon. Highlighting the 
importance of the cliff habitat for such birds will be used to help guide quarry restoration as well as day to 
day management of these import ant sites.  
 
B2 Wet meadows that support at least 3 species, or 6 pairs of breeding wader.  
 
Application  
This criterion will be used to protect wet areas that are important for breeding wader species.  
Rationale  
Wet meadows can provide important habitat for a  variety of wading birds.  
 
 
15. Site Selection Criteria - Reptiles  
 
 R1 Any site that regularly supports a population of two or more reptile species.  
 
Rationale  
Four species of reptile are recorded in Doncaster:  
 
  Grass Snake - Natrix natrix  
  Adder - Vipus berus  
  Common Lizard - Lacerta vivipara  
  Slow Worm - Anguis fragilis  
 
The presence of two or more reptile species is considered a good reptile site.  
 
 
16. Site Selection Criteria - Amphibians  
 
 A1 Any site that regularly supports four or more species of amph ibian native to Doncaster.  
 
Rationale  
Five species of amphibian are known to be present within Doncaster.  A site containing four of these five 
therefore represents a good amphibian assemblage.  
 
 
17. Site Selection Criteria - Multiple Species Groups  
 
Sites tha t meet the following c riteria will be eligible for Local Site  designation.  
 MS1 Any site that supports a significant population of a species included on one of the following lists 
within the Doncaster Biodiversity Audit:  
 
   Amphibians  
   Birds   
358   [go to Contents ] 
     Reptiles  
   Mammals (not including bats)  
   Ants 
   Bees  
   Wasps  
   Beetles  
   Butterflies  
   Crickets/Grasshoppers  
   Moths  
   Fungi  
   Fish 
   Crustaceans and Molluscs  
   Vascular Plants  
   Mosses and Liverworts  
   Lichens  
   Stoneworts  
 
Application  
The presenc e of a species on the site should ideally  be verified in at least two of the preceding five years  
to indicate a stable population; however variable recording effort and data availability mean that this is 
not always possible . Appropriate advice will be sought to determine whether the site contains a 
significant population either in terms of the number of individuals present or in terms of the sites 
contribution to the distribution of the species across a wider area . For species where population size is 
difficult to assess, such as many invertebrates, then records that simply indicate the presence of a 
species on site will be sufficient to allow the site to be designated. The boundaries of the site will be 
determined by considering the ecological requirements  of the species concerned , alongside the size of 
the relevant habitat management units.   
Rationale  
The species listed  on Doncaster ’s Species  Audit are selected on the basis of national, regional and  local 
conservation priorities.  Sites that support signif icant populations of these species are worthy of  
protection.  
 MS2 Any site that supports a good population of a species that has undergone a significant decline, 
documented at a national, regional or local level.  
 
Application  
This criterion is designed to apply to all species groups and to species not present on the Audit. It will be 
used to identify sites that are important for declining species. The decline must be documented, either 
nationally regionally or locally.  
Rationale  
Species undergoing significa nt declines are at risk of extinction unless action is taken now to help 
address the problems they face. Identifying and protecting strongholds for these species is an important  
359   [go to Contents ] 
  aspect of species conservation. For example, many farmland birds have undergon e serious declines 
over the last 30 years as a result of changing agricultural practises 48  The protection of sites that support 
a range of farmland species is therefore important.  
 
18. Geological / Geomorphological Selection Guidelines   
 
An area’s geodiversi ty can be considered against a number of natural features including its geology, 
landform, soils and processes creating the features evident today.  Geodiversity features can 
encompass:  
 Important sites or natural features worthy of designation or protectio n for the quality of the earth 
heritage feature.  
 Sites or natural features where a representative example of a n earth heritage feature can be seen.  
 Sites or features currently used for interpreting earth science.  
 Areas or features with a potential for geo -tourism and education.  
 The whereabouts and nature of past and present mineral products and workings.  
 How earth science can influence the shaping of the man-made  environment, urban landscape, and 
architecture.  
 Hazard management.  
 Inter-relationships and inte r-dependence between other areas of interest such as biodiversity, 
archaeology and history.  
 
Site Selection Criteria – Geodiversity  
In accordance with Defra guidance49 the resurvey criteria used in the 2007 resurvey was the (RIGS) 
Regionally Important Geolo gical / Geomorphological Sites criteria, which incorporates the ‘Geological 
Conservation Review’ (GCR) criteria developed for identifying nationally important sites. The overarching 
emphasis of the GCR and RIGS criteria is the value of the site for educati on, research and aesthetics.  
 G1 Local Geological Sites, including RIGS, are currently selected on the local and regional 
basis using four nationally agreed criteria (1990):  
 The value of the site for educational purposes  
 The value of the site for study for  both professional and amateur earth scientists  
 The historical value of the site in terms of important advances in earth science 
knowledge, events or human exploitation  
 The aesthetic value of the site in the landscape, particularly in relation to promoting  
public awareness and appreciation of earth sciences  
 
The UK RIGS site assessment form incorporates all the above criteria .

  Appendix 9: Criteria for the Selection of Parks and Gardens 
of Local Historic Interest  
 
Evidence Base Summary  
 
Title:  
Parks and Gardens of Local Historic Interest  
Date Produced:  To be produced  
Author:  DMBC/external specialist consultants  
Key Messages  
 
13 Parks and Gardens of Local Historic Interest were  identified within the Doncaster UDP  
 The character and sign ificance of these and of any other potential entries will be analysed to 
justify inclusion . 
 Criteria will be established through consultation . 
 Additional nominations will be invi ted through public consultation.  
 Boundar ies will be identified on a map.  
 The d atabase will be used as a material consideration in the determination of planning 
applications . 
 It will be subject to periodic review . 
 
Summary of Methodology  
 
The methodology will involve, for each park and garden:  
 a brief description . 
 a summary analysi s of its historical development (based on information obtained from desk -
top research, consultations and site visits) .  
 where relevant, written and cartographic identification of the wider historic designed 
landscape setting of Registered Parks and Gardens  and of Parks and Gardens of Local 
Historic Interest . 
 an assessment of the significance of the park or garden, based on relevant established 
criteria .. 
The database will be prefaced by a succinct, overarching statement of significance setting out local 
historic distinctiveness in parks and gardens.  
The criteria for inclusion will reflect those for the national Register of Parks and Gardens of Special 
Historic Interest in England,  but adapted for the local historic environment.  They will also take into 
account advice contained in English Heritage’s Good Practice Guide for Local Listing:  Identifying and 
Managing Significant Local Heritage Assets (Consultation Draft, February 2011).   
The criteria, which are not mutually exclusive, are likely to be: - 
  
361   [go to Contents ] 
  Age  
(Complex sites may meet more than one criterion, and dates should not be too rigidly interpreted.  
Interest may derive from a single period or from a series of phases of development varying in their 
impact on the landscape and in their degree of interest.  With sites of multiple phases, it is the sum of 
the developments as seen in the landscape today which is considered.  The value of a site can rest in 
the fact that its present form is the outcome of a series of phases of development or of a more or less 
continuous sequence of change).  
1. Sites formed before about 1750 where at least a proportion of the original layout is evident  
2. Sites laid out between about 1750 and about 1840 where enough of the layout survives to 
reflect the original design  
3. Sites with a sig nificant phase of development dating from after about 1840 which are of 
interest and which are relatively intact, the degree of interest and integrity needing to be 
greater as the site becomes closer in time  
4. Careful selection of sites from the period after  1945  
5. Sites less than 30 years old, normally only where they are of special quality or interest  
Aesthetic Value  
6. The intrinsic design value of the park or garden relating to local styles  or any other distinctive 
local characteristics  
Landscape or Horticult ural Interest  
7. Parks and gardens which are of importance locally for the interest of their landscape or 
garden design, or style, including layout and form  
8. Parks and gardens which include designed associated structures (such as ha -has, statuary, 
follies etc. ) 
9. Woodland, tree belts, stands, clumps or landscape features identified as part of the wider 
designed historic estate setting of a park or garden  
10. Parks and gardens which are important locally for their tradition of planting or plantsmanship  
11. Locally importa nt examples of parks or gardens of a particular type or having a particular 
function ( NB:  omit unless distinct from 7 or 16)  
12. Parks or gardens displaying interesting or unusual trees or plants  
Designer  
13. Parks or gardens laid out by landscape architects, des igners, gardeners or plantsmen of 
national or local renown with their original form surviving to an extent which makes them of 
interest  
 
14. Rarity  as judged against local characteristics  
Group Value  
15. Parks and gardens which are important to the setting of List ed buildings, buildings of local 
historic interest, or Scheduled Monuments, or which form a wider part of a Registered Park 
or Garden, or which contribute positively to the character or appearance of a Conservation 
Area, having a clear visual, design or hi storic relationship  
 
  
362   [go to Contents ] 
  Historic Interest  
16. Parks or gardens which illustrate or commemorate important aspects of local economic, 
cultural, social or military history (e.g. public parks, town squares, cemeteries, parks 
incorporating public memorials, grounds o f institutions)  
Historical Association  
17. Parks and gardens having strong associations with nationally or locally important figures or 
events.  The links will need to be documented or supported by a strong local tradition  
Social and Communal Value  
18. Parks and g ardens perceived as a source of local identity, distinctiveness, social interaction 
or coherence;  often residing in intangible aspects of heritage contributing to the “collective 
memory” of a place  
Evidential Value  
19. The significance of a park or garden may  be enhanced by a significant contemporary or 
historic written, drawn or photographic record.  
 
Consultations  
 
Consultation on the draft criteria will be carried out with professional colleagues, Doncaster Civic 
Trust, the Local History Society, the South  Yorkshire Archaeology Service (HER), the Yorkshire 
Gardens Trust, the Garden History Society, Friends of Hyde Park Cemetery, Friends of Cusworth 
Park, English Heritage and other interested parties.

  Appendix 10: Criteria for Locally Lis ting Buildings and 
Structures  
 
The following criteria are for assessing unlisted buildings and structures for inclusion in a 
Doncaster list of buildings or structures of local historic interest.  
Any locally listed building must meet following ‘exclusive’ c riteria before it can be assessed against the 
‘inclusive criteria’ below. The purpose of this is to exclude any nominations of candidates that would not 
qualify as an ‘undesignated heritage asset’ under the definition of the NPPF or buildings that have no 
more than personal significance. In addition it is to exclude buildings already of national significance i.e. 
listed buildings. If a building is suspected of, or, can be deemed to have national significance it should be 
submitted to the listing branch of H istoric England for assessment as such.  
Exclusive criteria  
For any nominated candidate to be considered for inclusion in the local list;  
1. It must be capable of being a heritage asset within definition of National Planning Policy 
Framework. This defines a he ritage asset as ‘A building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning 
decisions, because of its heritage interest. Heritage asset includes designated heritage assets 
and asset s identified by the local planning authority (including local listing)’.  
 
2. It must have heritage interest that can be conserved and enjoyed.  
 
3. It must have value for the local character and identity of the Borough beyond  family or personal 
connections.  
  
4. Its significance must be greater than the general positive value of its surroundings . 
 
5. It must not be a building of national significance (listed building) . 
 
6. The building is not a dangerous structure . 
If a building or structure which meets these ‘Exclusive C riteria’ it will be considered against the following  
Inclusive criteria;  
Age / Rarity  / Integrity  / Authenticity  
There should be elements of the building or structure that it is desirable to conserve; consequently the 
building or structure must be able to  be placed in one of the following categories.  
1. The building or structure reflects the earliest phase of development of one of Doncaster’s 
communities.  
2. The building or structure is a rare or important surviving example of a particular type or form, 
material , or style.  
3. The building or structure survives in something like its original form i.e. its style, form and 
construction are easily identifiable.  
In addition it must also be shown that it contributes to the character of an area and is valued by local 
peop le in accordance with at least one of the criteria detailed below. These criteria broadly reflect the 
different types of heritage significance identified by Historic England.  
Historic interest  
(a)  Historical Association   
364   [go to Contents ] 
  i.  The building or structure has  a well authenticated historical association with a notable 
person(s) or event of national significance.  
ii.  The building or structure has a prolonged and direct association with figures or events of 
local interest.  
(b)  Social Importance  
The building or structure has played an influential role in the development of an area or the life 
of one of Doncaster’s communities. Such buildings may include churches, schools, village and 
town halls, chapels, public houses, memorials, places of employment and workh ouses, which 
formed a focal point or key social role in the historical development of the area.  
(c)  Industrial Importance  
The building or structure clearly relates to traditional or historic industrial processes or important 
businesses or the products of  such industrial processes or businesses in the history of 
Doncaster, for example the mining or railway industry, or are intact industrial structures, for 
example bridges.  
Architectural interest  
(a)  Sense of place  
i.  The building or structure is repre sentative of a style that is characteristic of settlements in 
Doncaster borough, for example, limestone barns.  
(b)  Innovation and Virtuosity  
i.  The building or structure has a noteworthy quality of workmanship and materials.  
ii.  The building or struc ture is the work of a notable local/national architect/engineer/builder.  
iii.  The building or structure shows innovation in materials, technique, architectural style or 
engineering.  
(c)  Group Value  
i.  The buildings/structures form a group which as a whole has a unified architectural or 
historic value to the local area for example terraces, uniform rows, farmsteads.  
ii.  The buildings/structures are an example of deliberate town planning from before 1947, for 
example, planned colliery settlements  
Townscape Value  / Landmark status  
(a)  Buildings which contribute significantly to townscape appearance e.g. pubs, churches, factories, 
cinemas, banks, etc.  
(b) The buildings/structures have prominence and a landmark quality that is fundamental to the 
sense of a particular locality or form a landmark, from within or from outside an area.  
(c)  Buildings that are a focal point of social or visual interest e.g. prominent corner sites.   
   
365   [go to Contents ] 
  Archaeological interest  
Some existing buildings have older foundations, w hich have evidential significance, and such buildings 
can be included on the list. Archaeological interest may include the presence of features of evidential 
value within a later building such as mullioned windows. For the purposes of the local list archae ological 
interest would excluded conventional below ground archaeology which cannot be defined as a building 
or structure.  
 
Notes  
(a) The significance of a local historic asset of any kind may be enhanced by a significant 
contemporary or historic record  
(b) Whilst  local listing provides no additional planning controls, the fact that a building or site is on a 
local list means that its conservation as a heritage asset is an objective of the NPPF and a 
material consideration when determining the outcome of a planning  application (NPPF, 
paragraph 17).  
(c) If consideration is given to withdrawing permitted development rights then local heritage assets 
located outside conservation areas may enjoy relatively strong protection from demolition.  
(d) A Neighbourhood Plan may indicate  buildings and sites which merit inclusion on the local list.

  Appendix 11: Noise  
 
Understanding When Noise Could Become a Concern  
Planning Practice Guidance : Noise identifies a noise exposure hierarchy which provides broad guidance 
on the  levels at which noise exposure could become a concern.  
At the lowest extreme, when noise is not noticeable, there is by definition no effect.  As noise exposure 
increases, it crosses the No Observed Effect Level .  This is the stage at which noise becomes 
noticeable, though it has no adverse effect as it does not cause any change in behaviour or attitude.  If 
the noise level is at this level, no specific measures are required to manage the acoustic environment.  
As noise exposure increase it crossed the Lowe st Observed Adverse Effect Level , and may reach the 
Observed Adverse Effect Level .  At this level noise can start to cause small changes in behaviour and 
attitude.  For example, this could cause people to turn up the volume on the television or needing to 
speak more loudly to be hard.  The noise level starts to have an adverse effect where consideration 
needs to be given to mitigating and minimising those effects.  
Continued increase in noise exposure will at some point cause the Significant Observed Adverse  
Effect Level  to be crossed.  Above this level, noise causes a material change in behaviour, for example 
necessitating that windows are kept closed most of the time.  If noise exposure is above this level, the 
planning process should be used to prevent thi s effect occurring through the use of appropriate 
mitigation such as design and layout.  
At the highest extreme noise exposure would cause extensive and sustained changes in behaviour, 
without an ability to mitigate the effect of noise.  At this level the i mpacts on health and quality of life are 
such that, regardless of the benefits of the activity causing the noise, the situation should be prevented 
from occurring.  
Managing Noise in Doncaster: Guidance to Support Local Plan Policy 54 
Noise Sensitive Development Affected by Noise from Transport Sources  
Local Plan Policy 54 outlines that noise sensitive uses will only be permitted where users of the 
development will not be exposed to unacceptable  noise disturbance from existing or proposed uses.  
This section provides guidance to determine the threshold at which noise exposure from transport -based 
sources (air, road, rail and mixed sources) is considered to become significant or unacceptable in a 
Doncaster context.  
Building on the noise exposure hierarchy identified in Planning Practice Guidance: Noise , and using the 
guidance of PPG24, the Annex identifies measurable local values through which to determine the 
acceptability of noise sensitive propos als where noise exposure from transport is a factor.  
In particular, it identifies a measurable threshold for the Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(SOAEL), i.e. the noise level at which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occu r.  It 
also outlines a measureable threshold to identify the level at which noise exposure is considered to 
become unacceptable.  
In determining the acceptability of noise sensitive proposals where noise exposure from transport 
sources is a factor, the stan dards set out in Table 1 below should be applied;

N.B. All figures quotes above are free -field levels.  
In interpreting the categories for the purposes of Local Plan Policy 55 noise exposure is considered to be 
significant at the Significant Observed Effect Level (SOAEL) of between 63dB L Aeq,16hr and 72dB L Aeq,16hr  
daytime  and between 57dB and 66dB LAeq,8hr  at night.  
Unacceptable Adverse Effect is considered to occur where noise exposure is above 72dB L Aeq,16hr 
daytime and 66dB L Aeq,8hr  at night.  
For private amenity areas (private and communal gardens), Unacceptable Adverse Effect is considered 
to oc cur at 55dB  LAeq,16hr for roads, and 60dB L Aeq,16hr for aircraft and rail noise.  This is so that they can 
be enjoyed as intended.  
Where noise exposure is significant (SOAEL) a Noise Impact Assessment will be required in support of 
planning applications t o demonstrate how noise impact will be made acceptable.  For further information 
on the requirements of a Noise Impact Assessment please see section 5 of this Annex.  
Noise Sensitive Development Affected by Industrial or Commercial Noise Sources  
Local Plan Policy 54 outlines that noise sensitive uses proposed in areas that are exposed to noise from 
existing or planned industrial or commercial sources, will only be permitted where future users will not be 
exposed to an unaccept able noise impact that would result in a poor standard of amenity or the creation 
of a statutory nuisance.  
This is based on the recognition that to introduce new noise sensitive receptors into locations where they 
may be affected by noise from established businesses can create conflict between those two uses.  
NPPF paragraph 123 expands upon this recognising that development will often create some noise and 
outlining that existing businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should not have  
unreasonable restrictions put on them because of changes in nearby land uses since they were 
established.  
It is also recognised that some industrial or commercial uses may be planned in the sense that they are 
subject to extant planning permission, or hav e been identified for economic use through the Local Plan.  
For this reason, the policy approach also has regard to future planned developments.  
To ensure that proposed noise sensitive uses do not conflict with existing or planned 
industrial/commercial use s, noise sensitive development will only be considered acceptable where future 
users would not be exposed to noise impact that would result in a poor standard of amenity or in a 
statutory nuisance.  In determining the acceptability of noise sensitive propo sals where noise exposure 
from industrial or commercial sources are a factor the standards set out in Table 2 will be applied;

Level  
Baseline level +10dB  SOAEL  Mitigate and reduce to below 
+5dB, or avoid  
 
Where there is risk that the noise se nsitive proposals would be adversely affected by noise a Noise 
Impact Assessment will be required to support the planning application and to demonstrate how noise 
impact will be made acceptable.  For further information on the requirements of a Noise Impac t 
Assessment please see Section 5 of this Annex.  
If it cannot be demonstrated that appropriate mitigation will be provided to manage significant or 
unacceptable impacts to an acceptable level the proposal will be refused.  
Noise Generating Development  
Local  Plan Policy 54 outlines that noise generating development will be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that any nearby noise sensitive uses (existing or planned) will not be exposed to noise 
impact that will adversely aff ect the amenity of users of surrounding noise sensitive premises.  
To ensure that the proposals are acceptable in noise terms development should comply with 
BS4142:2014 Method for Rating and Assessing Industrial and Commercial Sound.  In determining the 
acceptability of development proposals the standards set out in Table 2 will be applied.  
Around town centre, neighbourhood parades and mixed use commercial/residential areas the high 
density if industrial plant and air -handling units (including kitchen extrac ts, air conditioning units and 
refrigeration plant) has a cumulative effect of increasing the overall background noise level.  To minimise 
this effect, and to protect residential amenity in those locations, all new noise sources would be expected 
to operat e at a Rating Level (as defined by BS4142) of 0dB above the existing background noise level 
measured as an L 90 over the specified reference period.  
Where the risk is that development would adversely affect the amenity of users in surrounding noise 
sensitiv e properties, a Noise Impact Assessment will be required to support the planning application and 
to demonstrate how noise impact will be made acceptable.  If it cannot be demonstrated that appropriate 
mitigation will be provided to manage significant or un acceptable impacts to an acceptable level the 
proposal will be refused.
