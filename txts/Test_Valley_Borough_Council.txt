Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1Foreword 
A Local Plan is one of the most important documents a local authority can produce. It plays a 
significant role in how our communities will live, work, communicate, do business, and shop 
which are evolving more rapidly than we ever thought. This along with impacts from the 
Coronavirus and evolving national policy present challenges for the Local Plan which we will 
need to address. 
To reflect the views gained from the two previous stages of public consultation, we have set 
out draft strategic planning priorities for the Borough.  These reflect the priorities raised by our 
communities, including the need to counter climate change, helping to sustain communities’ 
vitality, protecting our historic and rural features. Test Valley is rich in community, 
environmental and economic assets and our draft strategic priorities seek to build on this. 
We need your input on whether the draft strategic planning priorities do reflect what is 
important to our communities and ultimately aim to improve the quality of life across Test 
Valley. Does the scale of growth and overall distribution of development reflect the local 
needs in helping to maintain the places where our communities wish to live. This is your 
opportunity to input into helping us to refine these proposals, along with helping to guide 
what detailed policies and sites we consider for the next stage of drafting the Local Plan.
The opportunity to have your say on matters will continue as we progress with drafting the 
Local Plan.  
Councillor Phil Bundy
Portfolio Holder for PlanningDraft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 15
 Chapter 1: 
Introduction
1.1 The context for preparing the Test Valley 
Local Plan 2040 (LP40) is a challenging 
one, as there have been recent changes to 
how we live, work and what is considered 
important to our communities. Countering 
our changing climate, uncertainty of 
planning reforms, and evolving national 
legislation on protecting and improving 
our environment will need to be taken 
account of and will significantly shape the 
Local Plan 2040. So will the impact of the 
Coronavirus pandemic, which is affecting 
us all. 
1.2 Our evidence base will need to take 
account of the impacts of the pandemic 
and there may be longer term changes 
into the future, for example, to working 
patterns, travel and consumer behaviour. 
Addressing the impacts of the pandemic 
will be a challenge as they are still 
emerging, and the Council will need to 
take into account the most up-to-date 
information at each stage of the Local 
Plan. 1.3 Alongside this, and fundamental 
to preparing the Local Plan, are 
consideration of the local issues and 
challenges that are specific to Test 
Valley which we will need to address. 
Test Valley is one of the larger Boroughs 
in Hampshire and is predominantly 
rural in character. There are a few large 
cities or towns surrounding Test Valley, 
including the presence of Southampton 
City adjacent to the southern boundary 
which can create development pressure 
in this area. T he market towns of Andover 
and Romsey provide key centres in the 
north and south of the Borough for our 
communities. They are surrounded by 
countryside with a dispersed variety of 
villages and settlements. At the centre of 
the Borough is Stockbridge, on the River 
Test, which acts as a centre for many of 
our more rural communities.
1.4 There is a strong economy in Test Valley 
which our rural and visitor economy plays 
a key role. Test Valley has a rich variety 
of high-quality landscapes and habitat, 
including farmland, woodlands, chalk 
downland and river valleys. Test Valley 
also includes part of the North Wessex 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, to the 
North of Andover and numerous rivers, 
tributaries, rivulets and chalk streams 
across the Borough.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 What is a Local Plan
1.5 The Test Valley Local Plan 2040 will 
provide a planning policy framework 
for the future of the Borough, and more 
specifically how we intend to deliver 
sustainable development, which is at 
the heart of the planning process. It will 
set out planning policies which will be 
used as the starting point for determining 
planning applications. On Adoption, it will 
replace the Revised Local Plan 2029.
1.6 The Local Plan 2040 will set out the level 
of new homes, jobs and infrastructure to 
be provided to support the Borough’s 
communities and meet their future 
needs, whilst also protecting the local 
environment. This relates to both 
strategic issues, such as the amount of 
growth proposed, how it is distributed, 
and how the Borough moves towards 
achieving net zero carbon, through to 
more detailed issues, such as the design 
and layout of new development and how 
environmental assets are to be protected. 
It will also help to implement the spatial 
aspects of the Council’s priorities and 
delivery of infrastructure, as set out in the 
Corporate Plan. 1.7 Following Adoption of the Local 
Plan 2040, we will seek to deliver the 
Local Plan 2040 however this can be 
influenced by many factors. Partnership 
and collaborative working with many 
stakeholders including both public 
agencies and private sector will be 
necessary. There are delivery risks that are 
outside of our control. Such as in recent 
years, we have seen the effects of the 
economic crisis and the consequences 
of the Coronavirus are unknown. In 
preparing the Local Plan 2040, we 
will consider how we can incorporate 
flexibility and resilience into our strategy 
and policies.  
1.8 The Local Plan is part of our Development 
Plan. A Development Plan comprises of 
planning policies which guide decision 
making on development (planning 
applications). The Development Plan 
also comprises any other relevant 
Development Plan Documents such as 
documents relating to minerals and waste 
and made Neighbourhood Plans which 
are prepared by our parishes and their 
local communities. 
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 17
1.13 Neighbourhood Plans provide an 
opportunity for parishes and local 
communities to plan for their local 
community and reflect their aspirations 
for their area. Neighbourhood Plans 
must be prepared in general conformity 
with the strategic policies currently set 
out in the Adopted Revised Local Plan 
2029 however this will change to the 
Local Plan 2040 once adopted. The 
Council will continue to provide support 
for communities wishing to prepare a 
neighbourhood plan. 
1.14 Other local planning policy documents 
can be prepared by the Council, such 
as Supplementary Planning Documents 
(SPDs) and Village Design Statements. 
Supplementary Planning Documents 
can help to provide further guidance 
regarding strategic policies set out in 
a Local Plan. The Council already has 
several SPDs in place and these will 
remain in use if they are based on a 
strategic policy in the Local Plan 2040 
on Adoption, if not the Council may seek 
to review these SPDs. Village Design 
Statements can be prepared by parishes 
and residents in consultation with 
the Council, to provide guidelines for 
developments to be in keeping with the 
village’s essential character. 
 How the Local Plan fits 
with the Corporate Plan
1.15 Our Corporate Plan 2019-2023 ‘Growing 
Our Potential’ was approved in April 2019, 
setting our vision and strategic priorities 
for 2019-2023. This includes for our:
a. Town centres to adapt and be 
attractive, vibrant and prosperous 
places;
b. Communities to be empowered, 
connected and able to build upon 
their strengths;
c. People to be able to live well and fulfil 
their aspirations; and our 
d. Local environment working together to 
care for and maintain our outstanding 
natural and built assets in Test Valley. 1.9 The Test Valley Development Plan is 
currently comprised of the Adopted 
Revised Local Plan 2029, which will 
be replaced by the Local Plan 2040 
on Adoption, along with the Adopted 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Local 
Plan 2013 and a number of made 
Neighbourhood Plans. 
1.10 The Local Plan 2029 reached the five-year 
anniversary of its adoption on 27 January 
2021. The Council is legally required 
to review its local plan five years from 
adoption to ensure that policies remain 
relevant. This does not mean that a new 
local plan needs to be adopted within five 
years, but that the review should either be 
underway or triggered, depending on the 
issue. We therefore undertook a review of 
the Adopted Local Plan 2029 to ensure its 
policies remain effective and to identify 
any areas which need to be reviewed. 
1.11 The review concluded that the spatial 
strategy is considered to remain sound, 
and plan polices remain up to date and 
continue to provide a robust basis for 
decision making in the determination of 
planning applications. The review was 
approved by the Council’s Cabinet on 
10 March 2021. This demonstrates that 
whilst the new Local Plan 2040 is being 
prepared, the Council’s existing Adopted 
Local Plan 2029 still provides a robust 
basis for decision making on planning 
applications.
1.12 A small area of the Borough is within the 
New Forest National Park. The New Forest 
National Park Authority is responsible 
for planning of this part of the Borough, 
with the Adopted New Forest National 
Park Local Plan 2016-2036 forming the 
Development Plan for this area.8
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 11.16 The Corporate Plan is important in the 
Council’s overall strategic planning 
framework as the Local Plan 2040 has a 
central role in the delivery of the spatial 
aspects of actions under each of the 
Corporate Plan’s priorities. This includes:
 Town Centres: Providing a long-
term strategic overview of what is 
needed in our town centres, within an 
ever-changing environment, putting 
in place the mechanisms to enable 
delivery. 
 Communities: Strengthening 
our community-led approach to 
spatial planning so that people can 
play an active part in shaping their 
communities. This will include our 
ongoing commitment to undertake 
the preparation of the Local Plan 
2040 in an inclusive way, and support 
communities who will benefit from 
developing a Neighbourhood Plan 
or Village Design Statement to do so. 
More specifically, the Local Plan 2040 
will explore opportunities to deliver 
more new affordable homes in urban 
and rural areas.
 People: Supporting our communities 
to ensure that the right infrastructure 
at the right scale is secured that 
delivers homes and employment 
growth, enabling people to access a 
job, live in a decent home and fulfil 
their aspirations. 
 Local Environment: Identifying 
opportunities to increase access to 
the countryside and green spaces for 
Test Valley residents.
1.17 During the course of the production of the 
Local Plan 2040 the Council’s Corporate 
Plan will be reviewed and a new version 
will be adopted. The Local Plan 2040 
is key in the delivery of the Council’s 
priorities, and we will need to ensure 
we reflect the priorities in the updated 
Corporate Plan in the Local Plan 2040. 
  How the Local Plan fits 
with the Climate Emergency 
Action Plan 
1.18 Climate change is one of the greatest 
challenges which we face. The 
Government has set a statutory target for 
the country to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050. Reflecting this and 
since the latest Corporate Plan was 
approved, the Council has declared a 
climate emergency in September 2019 
and approved its first Climate Emergency 
Action Plan1 (CEAP) in 2020. The Climate 
Emergency Action Plan concentrates 
on what the Council can do to make a 
difference. It will ensure we meet the 
targets identified by Government but 
also exceed these where we can. The 
Local Plan is a mechanism to deliver this 
and move towards neutrality and help 
promote more sustainable living. 
 
1.19 Central to this Local Plan, is addressing 
and countering our changing climate 
through minimising impact of new 
development and adaptation as set out 
in our CEAP. This relates to many of the 
matters that will be addressed in the Local 
Plan 2040, from the location, design and 
layout of building to using nature-based 
solutions. The Council is committed to 
working with communities and partners to 
reduce emissions and support adaptation 
to reduce the effects of a changing 
climate. 
 How does this fit with the Town 
Centre Masterplans 
1.20 To deliver our Corporate Priority of 
adapting our town centres to be 
attractive, vibrant and prosperous places, 
Masterplans have been approved by the 
Council for Andover and South of Romsey 
Town Centres. These Masterplans set out 
objectives and specific projects to aid 
regeneration of the town centres.

tedirection/environmentandsustainability/climate-emergen-
cy-action-plan Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 19
  Both Masterplans have an emphasis 
on introducing a wider range of mixed 
uses within the town centres and were 
informed by extensive public engagement 
and consultation. 
1.21 Future proofing Andover and Romsey 
Town Centres to create cultural, 
adaptable, diverse and vibrant centres 
is a key matter to be addressed in the 
Local Plan 2040. The Local Plan 2040 
will be a mechanism to help set out and 
deliver our long-term strategic overview of 
what is needed to regenerate these town 
centres. The respective Masterplans are 
mechanisms to aid delivery of specific 
projects and will be supported by 
ongoing co-operation with key partners 
and delivery bodies. 
1.22 Both towns have established partnerships 
between residents, community groups, 
businesses and public bodies; these 
are Andover Vision and Romsey Future. 
The Council will continue to engage 
with Andover Vision and Romsey Future 
regarding the delivery of regeneration. 
 How the Local Plan fits 
with the Statement of 
Community Involvement
1.23 Effective engagement and consultation 
are key to ensuring the Local Plan 2040 
takes account of what is important to our 
communities and stakeholders. To do 
this, our communities and stakeholders 
need to understand how to get involved 
and express their views. Our Statement 
of Community Involvement (SCI) (2017) 
describes how they can get involved in 
the plan making process. This includes 
Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans, 
and the various methods the Council will 
use and consider in undertaking public 
consultation. 
1.24 The consultation undertaken for the 
Local Plan 2040, has to be undertaken 
in accordance with the SCI, as this is 
a legal requirement. The Coronavirus 
pandemic restrictions have had an 
impact on how we consult and the ability of our communities and stakeholders 
to get involved. We have produced an 
Addendum (2020) to our SCI setting 
out the changes that would be needed 
regarding the methods we use to consult 
when restrictions are in place to take 
account of this but still ensure we provide 
opportunities for our communities to get 
involved. These methods are evolving, 
and the use of various digitals means is 
becoming helpful in reaching parts of our 
communities and stakeholders. 
1.25 There is a national requirement for SCIs 
to be reviewed within five years of their 
Adoption. Our Statement of Community 
Involvement was adopted in 2017. We will 
need to review the SCI by the end of 2022. 
The preparation of the Local Plan 2040 
will need to be in accordance with any 
changes made to the SCI. 
 Progress of the 
Local Plan 2040
1.26 The current Local Plan 2029 was adopted 
in January 2016. The Council has 
commenced preparation of the Local Plan 
2040, with two informal stages of public 
consultation having already taken place. 
1.27 The first stage of public consultation was 
undertaken on an ‘Issues and Options’ 
document in summer 2018 which aimed 
to seek views on issues that the Borough, 
and those that live and work in Test 
Valley will face in the future, together 
with how best to deal with them. This 
has helped us to better understand what 
our communities see as the key planning 
issues going forward. 
1.28 The second stage of public consultation 
was a ‘Refined Issues and Options’ 
document in summer of 2020 which 
sought to build upon the outcomes 
of the initial consultation and to also 
recognise and take account of recent key 
changes and trends through presenting 
more detailed and specific policies and 
proposals. The comments received are 
helping us to develop and draft more 
detailed policies and proposals. 
 10
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 11.29 The next step is our Regulation 18 public 
consultation which will be undertaken 
in two stages. The first stage (Stage 1) of 
our Regulation 18 public consultation 
provides more detailed proposals 
than that presented in our previous 
consultation documents and focusses 
solely on strategic matters. The second 
stage (Stage 2) of our Regulation 18 
public consultation will include all draft 
proposals, including all strategic matters 
set out in the Stage 1 of our Regulation 
18 Local Plan, which will have been 
developed taking into account your 
comments and further evidence. Stage 
2 will also include detailed proposals for 
our site allocations and development 
management policies. 
1.30 Our approach to preparing the Local 
Plan builds upon the Council’s 
commitment to greater engagement 
and partnership working with local 
communities. The timetable for the 
preparation of the Local Plan, in particular 
the two stage Regulation 18 public 
consultation, enables focus on our 
strategic priorities and aspirations. We 
can seek the communities’ views upon 
this first which can feed into the detailed 
assessment of sites and development 
management policies. Alongside this, 
and fundamental to preparing the Local 
Plan, are consideration of the local issues 
and challenges that are specific to Test 
Valley which we will need to address. 
Test Valley is one of the larger Boroughs 
in Hampshire and is predominantly 
rural in character.  There are a few large 
cities or towns surrounding Test Valley, 
including the presence of Southampton 
City adjacent to the southern boundary 
which can create development pressure 
in this area. The market towns of Andover 
and Romsey provide key centres in the 
north and south of the Borough for our 
communities.
1.31 The timetable for the Local Plan is set out 
in Figure 1.2, which is also set out in our 
Local Development Scheme.

1.32 The Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, Stage 
1 focuses solely on strategic matters, 
setting our draft policies, proposals, 
and future challenges. These strategic 
matters seek to address the strategic 
priorities for Test Valley firstly by setting 
out our draft vision and objectives 
which guide the Local Plan’s policies 
and proposals. It then sets out our draft 
spatial strategy which is our overall 
strategy to guide the distribution and 
type of development. Following on from 
this, our draft strategic proposals are 
explained, including achieving high 
quality of design, a net zero carbon future, 
supporting regeneration of our town 
centres, ensuring sufficient provision to 
meet our needs for housing, employment, 
infrastructure alongside conserving and 
enhancing the natural, built and historic 
environment. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 111
1.33 The Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, 
Stage 2 will be a comprehensive Local 
Plan which will include all of our draft 
proposals. This will include the strategic 
matters set out in the Local Plan 2040 
Stage 1 Regulation 18 document which 
will have been further refined to take 
account of your comments and further 
evidence. The document will set out draft 
proposals on our site allocations and non-
strategic matters including development 
management policies. These policies 
will be used to determine planning 
applications and will cover topics such as 
the provision of specific infrastructure and 
the conservation and enhancement of the 
natural environment. 
1.34 Following public consultation of our 
Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, Stage 
2, we will consider your comments and 
undertake and collate further evidence 
where needed, to inform and prepare our 
final draft of the Local Plan 2040. This 
will be our Regulation 19 document. All 
comments made on the Local Plan 2040 
at the Regulation 19 stage will be collated 
and submitted alongside the Local 
Plan 2040 to the Secretary of State for 
Examination. 
1.35 Some of our draft policies and 
proposals will require to be illustrated 
geographically on our Policies Maps. At 
this stage, there are only a couple of draft 
policies which propose geographical 
boundaries, which we have shown in this 
document, and thus a draft Policies Map 
has not been produced. We will produce 
a draft Policies Map to accompany our 
Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, Stage 2 
and we would welcome your comments 
on the draft Policies Map at that stage. 
 Plan Period
1.36 The plan period is the timescale that the 
local plan policies cover, particularly in 
terms of the amount of development 
needed. Adopted local plans are reviewed 
before the end of their plan period and 
therefore we cannot start the timeframe 
for this Local Plan 2040 at the end of the 
plan period of the current Adopted Local Plan 2029, as we need to make sure there 
is an overlap in timescales, otherwise 
there will be a gap in the planning 
framework. 
1.37 The current Local Plan (adopted January 
2016) covers a plan period of 2011-2029. 
We are proposing the plan period for the 
Local Plan 2040 starts in 2020. Although 
we have previously suggested an end 
date of 2036 in our Refined Issues and 
Options Local Plan, we are now proposing 
an end date of 2040. The plan period has 
been amended to reflect the change in 
the timescale to prepare the Local Plan 
and the need to be in conformity with 
national policy. National planning policy is 
clear that the Council needs to look ahead 
over a minimum of 15 years from the date 
of adoption of the plan. As the adoption of 
the Local Plan is expected to take place in 
2025, the Local Plan end date is proposed 
to be 2040. 
 Evidence Base
1.38 The evidence base2 is used to help 
understand the background of any issues 
which a Local Plan needs to address. The 
evidence base is an important element for 
the justification for the Council’s policies 
and proposals and will evolve throughout 
the preparation of the Local Plan 2040. 
Where appropriate, evidence base studies 
have and will be prepared jointly with 
neighbouring authorities.
1.39 The time period for the production of 
our evidence base is dependent upon 
available data both in regard to the 
start base date and reliability of future 
forecasts. Ideally a consistent base date 
(start date) will be used for evidence base 
studies, which will be consistent with 
the start date of the plan period, of 2020. 
As we get further into the future, it can 
become more difficult to set out the level 
of certainty for our development needs.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 11.40 The Council has prepared some evidence 
base studies to inform the policies and 
proposals within this Local Plan 2040, 
while some studies are still in preparation. 
To ensure our policies and proposals 
are justified, we have outlined the next 
steps for those strategic matters where 
this is the case rather than pre-empt the 
outcomes of our evidence base studies. 
In addition, the Council has prepared a 
series of Topic Papers to explain how the 
Council has derived the draft proposals 
and policies in the Local Plan 2040. These 
Topic Papers will be updated as the Local 
Plan 2040 progresses.
1.41 There are a few appraisals or assessments 
that are critical to inform the preparation 
of the Local Plan 2040. These include 
the Sustainability Appraisal, Habitats 
Regulations Assessment, Equalities 
and Health Impact Assessments. These 
appraisals or assessments ensure 
sustainability is embedded within the 
Local Plan 2040, as well as ensuring the 
impacts from the proposals or policies in 
the Local Plan 2040 on protected habitats, 
equality and health are fully considered 
and reflected in the Plan. 
1.42 The Sustainability Appraisal assesses the 
policy options that have been considered 
and sets out the main impacts that are 
expected to result from each of these 
options, including on the environment, 
communities and the economy. This helps 
to identify the preferred draft options 
that have then been incorporated into 
the Local Plan 2040. To assess these 
options, a sustainability framework has 
been prepared, informed by gathering 
background information about the area, 
so that key issues could be identified. 
From this, sustainability objectives have 
been established which are set out in 
the Sustainability Framework. These are 
different to the objectives for the Local 
Plan 2040 itself. 1.43 The Council published a Scoping Report3 
in 2020 which sets out our Sustainability 
Framework. This is the Sustainability 
Framework which has and will be used to 
assess our policy options for inclusion in 
the Local Plan 2040. We have undertaken 
a Sustainability Appraisal4 to inform the 
Local Plan 2040, which has considered 
and assessed potential policy options 
to inform our draft policies. Only policy 
options which have been considered 
reasonable for Test Valley have been 
assessed. The preferred policy options 
have been taken forward in the Local Plan 
2040. The Sustainability Appraisal Report 
has been made available alongside the 
Local Plan 2040 and is part of the public 
consultation, along with the Equalities 
Impact Assessment and Health Impact 
Assessment.
1.44 The Council is also required to undertake 
a Habitats Regulations Assessment on 
the Local Plan 2040. This will assess if 
the Local Plan 2040 proposals could 
significantly harm the designated features 
of protected sites identified by the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2017 (as amended) which 
comprise of Special Areas of Conservation 
and Special Protection Areas. The Council 
will shortly be procuring consultants to 
undertake this assessment which will 
inform the preparation of draft policies 
and proposals for inclusion in the Local 
Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 2.

Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, Stage 
2 by the end of 2022.14
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Chapter 2:  
Vision, Key 
Challenges and 
Objectives
 Introduction
2.1 Central to preparing the Local Plan is 
understanding the key challenges and 
opportunities facing the Borough and our 
communities, which in turn informs the 
Plan’s Vision and Objectives. Part of this, is 
the changing national and regional policy 
context which preparation of the Plan 
must take account of. 
2.2 The Vision summarises the Council’s 
aspirations for the Borough and projects 
this over the plan period. It describes 
the broad overarching and ambitious 
philosophy of the plan. 2.3 The Objectives set out our planning 
priorities for Test Valley reflecting the 
challenges we face and the issues that 
resonate with our communities, as 
identified in consultation responses. They 
provide the connection between how we 
will deliver the Vision through providing 
specific priorities for the plan’s policies. 
2.4 Alongside the Vision and Objectives, is 
our Spatial Strategy which is set out at 
Chapter 3. The Spatial Strategy provides 
the overarching direction on where 
development will be supported in the 
Borough including the type and shape. 
 National Planning Policy 
and Guidance 
2.5 We must frame our Local Plan, and our 
Vision and Objectives against national 
planning guidance. The National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and 
Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) provide 
guidance for the preparation of local 
plans. They set out key national priorities 
that must be taken into account in the 
preparation of local plans and when 
determining planning applications. The 
NPPF requires that all development needs 
are met in the Local Plan, in terms of 
housing, economic growth, the provision 
of new infrastructure, facilities and services.
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 115
2.6 At the heart of the NPPF is a presumption 
in favour of sustainable development. 
This reflects the requirement, in the 
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 
2004 (as amended), that Local Plans are 
prepared with a view to ‘contributing 
to the achievement of sustainable 
development’5. It confirms that the  
planning system has three overarching 
and interdependent objectives; economic, 
social and environmental. The NPPF 
definition of sustainable development 
states that ‘sustainable development is 
development that meets the needs of the 
present without comprising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own 
needs’.6
2.7 The Government identifies the tests which 
the Local Plan will be assessed against. 
The tests ensure Local Plans can be 
considered ‘sound’ and thus Adopted. 
For the Local Plan 2040 to be ‘sound’, 
we must demonstrate the following tests 
have been met: 
• Positively prepared and based 
on a strategy which seeks to meet 
objectively assessed development and 
infrastructure requirements for its area, 
including any unmet requirements 
from neighbouring authorities, and 
that is consistent with achieving 
sustainable development.
• Justified in that it must set out an 
appropriate strategy (when considered 
against reasonable alternatives) which 
is based on proportionate evidence. 
• Effective – the plan should be 
deliverable over its period and based 
on effective joint working on cross-
boundary strategic priorities. 
• Consistent with national policy to 
enable the delivery of sustainable 
development in accordance with the 
policies in the NPPF. 
5 Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (as amended) 
Section 39(2).
6  Brundtland Commission definition as per Resolution 
442/187 of the United Nations General Assembly and refer-
enced at paragraph 7 in the NPPF2.8 In August 2020, the Government 
published ‘Planning for the Future’ White 
Paper which sought views on a number of 
packages regarding proposals for reform 
of the planning system in England, to 
streamline and modernise the planning 
process. A Planning Bill was confirmed in 
the Queen’s speech in May 2021 to take 
forward these changes. However, the full 
extent of the reform is currently unknown, 
as is the timetable for any changes that 
result from the future Planning Bill. 
2.9 Potential changes from the Planning 
Bill, and any other potential changes to 
legislation such as relating to the future 
Levelling Up White Paper and the recently 
enacted Environment Act 2021, present 
significant risk that national legislation is 
likely to change during the preparation 
of the Local Plan 2040 and will have an 
impact on it. If this were to take place, we 
may need to pause plan preparation and 
consider any implications for the Local 
Plan 2040. 
2.10 At the same time as progressing potential 
planning reforms, the Government is 
encouraging local planning authorities 
to continue reviewing and updating 
their local plans and to not await the 
outcome of the reform proposals. The 
Government’s target remains for all local 
planning authorities to have an up-to-date 
local plan in place by the end of 2023. 
2.11 We want to ensure the preparation of 
the Local Plan 2040 is informed by 
appropriate evidence, which takes 
time to collate, and understand and 
provide plenty of opportunities for 
public consultation to gain the views 
of our communities. It is important that 
we listen and consider the views of our 
communities and evidence to ensure 
the Local Plan 2040 reflects these but 
at the same time ensuring we can meet 
the tests to demonstrate a ‘sound’ Local 
Plan. Nonetheless, we will have made 
significant progress towards a final draft 
Local Plan 2040 (which is the Regulation 
19 stage) which we are aiming for public 
consultation by the end of 2023.16
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 12.12 Whilst the Local Plan 2040 is being 
prepared, the Council’s existing Adopted 
Local Plan 2029 still provides a robust 
basis for decision making on planning 
applications. This was demonstrated 
through the Council’s five-year review of 
the Adopted Local Plan 2029. 
2.13 Following the United Kingdom 
withdrawing from its membership of 
the European Union on 31 January 
2020, the relationship between UK and 
EU law has changed. EU law as of 31 
December 2020 is now ‘retained EU 
law’ as part of domestic legislation. The 
UK now has separate and independent 
policies in areas such as the environment, 
whilst maintaining a commitment to 
broad equivalence in environmental 
standards. It is not yet clear what specific 
implications there might be for the Local 
Plan 2040, or the wider planning system 
and the framework in which it operates, in 
the future. The uncertainty of this presents 
a challenge to the preparation of the 
Local Plan 2040, and one we will need to 
monitor. 
2.14 The recently enacted Environment Act 
2021 became law on 10 November 2021 
and covers a range of topics linked to 
the protection and improvement of the 
natural environment. The preparation of 
the Local Plan 2040 will need to accord 
with this Act with many of the topics 
needing to be addressed in the Local Plan 
2040, such as water resources, air quality 
and biodiversity, and nature recovery. 
Addressing the requirements in the Act 
will be a challenge as further legislation 
and guidance will be evolving alongside 
the progression of the Local Plan 2040. 
The timescale to address these may be 
limited or we may need to consider a 
change in the Local Plan 2040 timescale. 2.15 We are preparing the Local Plan 2040 at 
a time where the Coronavirus pandemic 
is affecting us all. We will need to take 
account of any potential changes arising 
from the pandemic on the way we live 
and work, as these emerge and noted in 
Chapter 1. 
 Regional Context and the Duty 
to Cooperate
2.16 National policy places a duty on local 
planning authorities to co-operate with 
external organisations and stakeholders 
on strategic matters that cross over 
boundaries, such as transport corridors, 
infrastructure projects, or housing needs. 
2.17 We are engaging with external 
organisations and stakeholders, including 
statutory consultees, such as Hampshire 
County Council and Natural England 
through the preparation of the Local Plan 
2040. This will help to ensure the Local 
Plan 2040 is informed by the expertise, 
priorities and requirements of other key 
agencies and authorities on strategic or 
cross boundary matters. It also provides 
opportunities for coordinated delivery of 
projects, policy and infrastructure.
2.18 We are also engaging with our 
neighbouring authorities. Our 
neighbouring authorities are shown 
in Figure 2.1. The Council works with 
authorities across South Hampshire, 
including Hampshire County Council, 
through the Partnership for South 
Hampshire (PfSH) voluntary partnership7 
on a range of strategic planning matters, 
including on a joint evidence base. The 
joint Statement of Common Ground 
(SoCG) in preparation by PfSH will look 
forward to 2040, with a possible long-
term vision to 2050. This will replace the 
Spatial Position Statement (SPS) for the 
sub-region for the period to 2034, with 
some of its evidence covering the period 
to 2036. 
7 Test Valley is part of the PfSH Partnership together with East 
Hampshire, Eastleigh, Fareham, Gosport, Hampshire County, 
Havant, New Forest, Portsmouth, Southampton, and Win-
chester Councils and New Forest National Park Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 117
2.19 The Council is also working closely with 
Basingstoke and Deane, Rushmoor and 
Hart councils and a collective narrative 
for North Hampshire was endorsed by the 
Council Cabinet on 27 October 2021. This 
identifies each authority’s existing plans 
for growth and identifies opportunities 
and issues to achieve those aspirations. 
It demonstrates joint commitment by the 
Council and the other authorities on co-
operation at a strategic level on planning 
matters and sets out joint support for any 
future bids for external funding that may 
arise.
 Figure 2.1: Map showing Neighbouring Authorities18
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
2.20 The Council is jointly working with 
neighbouring authorities and agencies on 
a range of wider strategic, cross boundary 
environmental matters that will need to 
be addressed in the Local Plan. These 
include:
• addressing and mitigating the 
recreational impact of new residential 
development on the New Forest 
international nature conservation 
designations;
 Vision
2.21 The Vision summarises the Council’s aspirations for the Borough looking towards the end of 
the plan period, to 2040. It describes the broad overarching and ambitious aim of the plan. 
It provides a balance of being aspirational, whilst also being realistic and distinctive to Test 
Valley Borough. 
 
By 2040, Test Valley Borough’s communities will be prosperous and resilient by: 
Providing access to good quality homes that will meet a range of needs and aspirations, 
including affordable housing. Countering our changing climate through mitigation 
and adaptation and delivering well designed developments to a high standard that 
encourage inclusivity, health and security. High quality of life will be experienced by our 
communities, and they will enjoy a strong sense of identity. Development will take place 
in sustainable locations and support the delivery of infrastructure. 
The Borough’s economy will be thriving and supported by a skilled workforce. The 
economy will experience sustainable growth across a range of sectors, including 
the high technology and green industries and the visitor economy. Residents will 
have access to training, education and work opportunities and enjoy well-connected 
working environments. The Borough will continue to be known for its varied, green and 
distinctive landscapes, heritage and rich ecology. 
Our natural, built and cultural resources will be safeguarded for future generations to 
enjoy. The character of our individual settlements will be maintained and their sense 
of place enhanced. The market towns of Andover and Romsey will have thriving town 
centres, offering high quality connected green and public spaces and a mix of leisure, 
shopping and cultural facilities and homes, with sustainable transport connections. The 
smaller local centres will provide for the needs and aspirations of residents and visitors. 
The vibrancy of our rural communities will have been retained through sustaining 
access to facilities and services they need to support healthy, active lifestyles and 
wellbeing and enjoy access to our diverse and outstanding countryside.• mitigating the impacts of recreational 
pressures on the Special Protection 
Area designations around the Solent, 
through the ‘Bird Aware Solent’ 
scheme; and
• mitigating the impacts of nutrients 
from new development on the 
environmental designations, within 
and around the Solent.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 119
2.22 The Vision identifies the need to 
deliver the homes, employment and 
supporting infrastructure that will be 
needed to support our community’s 
needs, whilst balancing the protection 
and enhancement of our precious and 
unique natural assets and distinctive 
heritage which our communities 
highly value. It includes our corporate 
priorities of countering climate change 
and regeneration and enhancement of 
our town centres, and support for the 
Borough’s local centres. It sets out the 
need to facilitate and support healthy 
active lifestyles with high quality design 
playing a key role in achieving this. 
2.23 We are seeking your comments on the 
Vision, in particular are there any other 
local priorities that you consider should 
be highlighted in the Vision. 
 Objectives and Challenges
2.24 The  starting point for developing 
our objectives has been to identify 
and consider the key challenges 
and opportunities Test Valley faces. 
Addressing these in our objectives will 
ensure a framework is provided for our 
policies to collectively help address 
these. We have also considered what 
is important to our communities and 
how we meet their needs, through 
consideration of consultation responses, 
along with local priorities set out in the 
Council’s Corporate Plan and national 
policy priorities.
2.25 The draft objectives are set out by theme. 
They focus on what could be improved 
about living and working in Test Valley 
and our aspirations for the future of the 
Borough.
  Climate Change
 Countering climate change through 
transition to a net zero carbon future, 
where new development and local 
environments are adaptable and resilient 
to the changing climate. Seek to reduce 
emissions from new development, 
facilitate more sustainable living, and 
manage the risks of flooding, whilst 
seeking to protect our water resources.
2.26 Climate change is one of the greatest 
challenges which we face. The 
Government’s statutory target for the 
country to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 and requirements in 
national planning policy for Local Plans 
to mitigate climate change emphasise 
the importance of Local Plans playing 
a fundamental role in addressing this 
challenge. The Council’s Climate 
Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) confirms 
this, in establishing the key role the Local 
Plan 2040 can make to influencing our 
impact on our changing climate. It is 
likely national policy will evolve over the 
preparation of the Local Plan 2040, which 
we will need to take account of. 
2.27 The Local Plan 2040 will have an impact 
on cutting our emissions through 
minimising the impact development has 
on emissions and adaptation to manage 
impacts. It is fundamental this objective 
is embedded in the Local Plan 2040. 
Consultation responses have confirmed 
that this is a priority for our communities. 
The Local Plan 2040 influences the 
location of development, shape, design 
and orientation of development. It 
will facilitate and support sustainable 
transport modes, sources of energy 
used, reduce our vulnerability to weather 
conditions, integrate nature-based 
solutions and aid the transition to a low 
carbon economy. Collectively these can 
have a significant impact on reducing our 
emissions. 20
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
 Our Communities 
 Deliver and strengthen sustainable, 
cohesive and healthy communities 
in our towns and villages. Secure 
enhancements to social, green, health, 
educational and other local infrastructure 
through new development in sustainable 
locations. Support the viability of the 
Borough’s town and local village centres 
in meeting many of the daily needs of our 
communities and residents. 
2.28 The sustainability of our communities 
is linked to their ability of having easy 
and safe access (by active or sustainable 
modes of transport, where possible) to 
facilities, services and amenities to serve 
economic and social needs, including 
shopping, recreation, education, and 
employment. 
2.29 Our Market Towns provide central hubs 
in the north and south of our Borough 
to meet many of the needs of our 
communities through having a range 
of infrastructure, services and facilities. 
There is an opportunity to strengthen and 
enhance the roles of our Market Towns 
and ensure further growth is integrated. 
Whereas in our rural areas, sustainable 
access and the level of facilities and 
service varies between settlements. It can 
be a challenge to help sustain the range 
of existing facilities and infrastructure and 
to facilitate the enhancement of them is 
an even bigger challenge. 
2.30 This objective is seeking to sustain 
and where possible, strengthen the 
sustainability of our communities. The 
Local Plan 2040 will be able to identify 
the location of new development and 
the resultant increase in population can 
help to sustain the vibrancy of our rural 
communities through helping to keep 
existing facilities and services to meet 
daily needs. Meeting our daily needs is 
considered to be through access to key 
services and facilities such as a food 
store, place of worship, community hall or 
meeting place, recreation ground or park, 
a public house and a primary school. 2.31 The Local Plan 2040 will play a role 
in helping to provide and facilitate 
new infrastructure that supports a 
healthy lifestyle. This includes access 
to digital infrastructure (including high 
speed broadband connectivity) and 
infrastructure to facilitate the use of 
electric vehicles. 
2.32 The opportunity exists for the Local 
Plan 2040 to seek to strengthen the role 
of community led planning through 
supporting communities in bringing 
forward Neighbourhood Plans, Village 
Design Statements, and locally driven 
schemes. These can deliver community 
benefits and support the delivery of more 
affordable housing in our communities. 
This have been highlighted as important 
to our communities through the 
consultation responses. 
 Town Centres
Create cultural, adaptable, diverse 
and vibrant town centres in Romsey 
and Andover, including through 
regeneration schemes, and by securing 
high quality design and accessible 
mixed-use development that will 
increase vitality, whilst protecting and 
enhancing their historic and green 
assets.
 2.33 The market towns of Andover and 
Romsey are unique, attractive and 
distinctive. Both town centres offer a 
mix of shopping, leisure, entertainment, 
employment, services, culture, open 
spaces, and heritage. They both have 
a wealth of listed buildings and benefit 
from conservation areas and river 
frontages. However, they also include 
areas (and in the case of Andover, 
some highway infrastructure) that 
are undervalued and under used, or 
which could be enhanced and better 
integrated within the town centre.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 121
2.34 Across the Country, the role of town 
centres is changing, and the retail 
sector in particular is facing challenges. 
Shopping activity and retail businesses 
have been impacted by the pandemic. 
On-line shopping and the growth in 
home delivery services, for example, 
have impacted footfall and shopping 
behaviour in many towns. Andover and 
Romsey will need to adapt over the plan 
period in order to maintain their vitality 
and prosperity, and likely in different 
ways. This presents both challenges and 
opportunities for the Local Plan 2040. 
2.35 There is also growing evidence that 
people increasingly visit town centres to 
enjoy wider leisure and social experiences 
rather than solely for shopping or 
necessity purposes. Our high streets can 
build in resilience and capitalise on these 
changing behaviours, by offering a more 
varied mix of uses and activities than they 
might have in the past. Digital innovation 
and technology may also play a larger 
role in how people interact with their town 
centres and retail providers in future. 
2.36 Enabling our town centres to adapt and 
to be attractive, vibrant and prosperous 
places, is a corporate priority8 with the 
Local Plan being a key mechanism to 
deliver this. The future of our town centres 
was identified as a key theme in our 
consultation responses. 
2.37 Regeneration of the town centres in line 
with the respective Andover and South 
of Romsey Town Centre Masterplans has 
already begun. The Masterplans are being 
delivered proactively, with our partners, 
key agencies and landowners. A key 
opportunity for the Local Plan 2040 is to 
help guide and enable the regeneration 
process over the lifetime of the plan. 
8 Test Valley Borough Council Corporate Plan 2019-2023: 
Growing Our Potential, 2019 (available: http://testvalley.gov.
uk/aboutyourcouncil/corporatedirection/corporate-plan-for-
2019-to-2023). Built, Historic and 
Natural Environment
 Conserve and enhance the built, historic 
and natural environment within Test 
Valley, including local character, identity, 
cultural heritage, the variety of local 
landscapes and the special landscape 
character of the Borough.
2.38 The built environment and rich heritage 
within our towns, villages and rural areas 
is of a high quality, often enhanced by 
the attractive and varied wider landscape 
setting. The Borough has many chalk 
streams and wide green river valleys 
and floodplains, pockets of ancient and 
managed woodland, undulating chalk 
downland, and expanses of attractive 
farmland. There are 36 designated 
Conservation Areas, just under 
2,100 listed buildings, 96 scheduled 
monuments9 and 8 registered local 
historic parks and gardens10.
2.39 These many and varied characteristics 
mean that the Borough’s built and 
natural environment is highly desirable 
and valued, as highlighted through 
consultation responses. There is an 
opportunity for the Local Plan 2040 to 
deliver a positive strategy to protect, 
conserve and enhance the environment. 
However, there is always the challenge 
and pressure to meet the development 
needs of our communities and the impact 
this may have on the built and natural 
environment.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
2.40 The impact of nutrients on internationally 
designated nature conservation sites in 
and around the Solent is a challenge. The 
high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus 
entering the water environment has 
resulted in dense mats of green algae. 
This is having an impact on a wider scale 
than just Test Valley. Natural England 
have advised that new homes and 
overnight accommodation within the 
River Test catchment area should achieve 
nutrient neutrality. This will ensure new 
development does not add to the existing 
nutrient levels. Ensuring mitigation 
solutions are available to support the 
development needs of our communities 
will be a challenge for the Local Plan 
2040. 
2.41 Some areas of the Borough have 
experienced periods of localised flooding, 
often associated with rising groundwater. 
This presents risks to the safety of 
residents and communities, businesses, 
wellbeing, ecology and habitat (for 
example, when associated with pollution 
to rivers or groundwater). This objective 
will seek to conserve and protect the 
natural environment and mitigate the risk 
of flooding and ensure a sufficient water 
supply. 
 Ecology and Biodiversity
 Conserve and enhance biodiversity, 
by taking opportunities to promote, 
and secure clear and measurable 
improvements to habitats and biodiversity. 
Enhance the connectivity, quantity 
and quality of ecological and green 
infrastructure networks, to help maintain 
and enhance the condition of protected 
nature conservation sites, protected 
species and the resilience of biodiverse 
environments to the changing climate.2.42 The Borough has numerous areas of 
special ecological or habitat value and 
supports a wealth of species of flora 
and fauna, some of which have legal 
protection. There is a pressing need to 
maintain and enhance our rich and varied 
biodiversity, particularly in the light of 
climate change, and the gradual loss of 
species and habitat that has taken place 
in the UK over several decades. 
2.43 The recently passed Environment 
Act 2021 introduces various changes 
to the legal framework for a range of 
environmental matters and sets out 
requirements for new development. The 
Act will require that new development 
both minimises any impacts on 
biodiversity and habitat and ensures that 
measurable biodiversity net gains are 
delivered. This will have very significant 
implications for biodiversity. This presents 
a challenge for the Local Plan 2040 in 
meeting these new requirements along 
with responding to evolving legislation. 
2.44 There will be opportunities for the Local 
Plan 2040 to encourage nature and 
increased biodiversity within many of 
our landscapes, streets, public spaces, 
parks, leisure facilities and open spaces. 
This will not only have benefits for 
ecological reasons but also for the health 
and wellbeing of our communities, and 
in helping to contribute towards climate 
change resilience and mitigation11. 
2.45 The Local Plan 2040 will recognise 
the importance of local biodiversity as 
set out in the Environment Act 2021. 
Enhancement of resilient ecological 
networks, including all forms of green 
and blue infrastructure will be supported. 
Existing designated habitats need to 
be preserved, protected from harm and 
relieved of recreational pressures in order 
to support and maintain biodiversity. 
11 For example, Building with Nature set out a standard and 
good practice for delivering greater biodiversity, wildlife and 
nature within new development and green infrastructure, 
see http://www.buildingwithnature.org.uk/aboutDraft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 123
 Health, Wellbeing, Culture, 
Leisure and Recreation
 Encourage active lifestyles and enhance 
health and wellbeing, by providing 
opportunities for recreational, cultural 
and community activities, through the 
provision of open spaces, access to the 
countryside, sports, leisure and other 
community facilities and services. Work 
with the Council’s partners to secure 
access to healthcare for all, including the 
Borough’s most vulnerable residents.
2.46 Health and wellbeing in Test Valley is 
generally better than the national average, 
although there are some variations 
across the Borough. The importance 
of our health and wellbeing has been 
heightened due to the Coronavirus 
pandemic. 
2.47 As a whole, the Borough is not deprived, 
ranking in the 20% least deprived areas in 
the country12. The Borough has an ageing 
population with 22% of the resident 
population estimated to be aged 65 and 
over13 compared to the national average 
of 19%. T his will increase pressure on 
health and social care infrastructure. 
This is a not just a local challenge but a 
national one too. Supporting our ageing 
population will require places that are 
accessible to all and ensure people living 
in our community have access to the 
services and facilities they need to reduce 
social isolation. 
2.48 Test Valley has a vibrant range of 
arts, cultural and leisure facilities, 
theatres, galleries, museums and other 
amenities. Our towns, villages and rural 
communities host a variety of cultural 
and creative events which benefit the 
lives and wellbeing of our residents. The 
Council’s support for cultural and arts 
provision in the Borough is valued by our 
communities. 
12  2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation assessment, MHCLG
13 2019 data 2.49 Access to open spaces, the countryside, 
recreational and sports provisions 
is important to residents, and the 
pandemic has further highlighted how 
vital these provisions are to mental and 
physical health and wellbeing. The 
Council’s sports and pitch strategies 
and public open space audits14 provide 
detailed evidence about our sports and 
recreational infrastructure, needs and 
requirements. There is an opportunity 
in the Local Plan 2040 to protect 
and facilitate enhancement of these 
provisions. 
2.50 Various emergency provisions and 
services (including the police and fire 
brigade) are also essential to the safety, 
health and wellbeing of our communities 
and need to be planned for. These are 
forms of social and health infrastructure 
that contribute to the social sustainability 
of the Borough’s settlements and 
communities. 
2.51 The Local Plan 2040 will help to 
encourage and facilitate healthy lifestyles. 
The delivery of health infrastructure will 
be reliant on partnership working with 
many other stakeholders, in particular 
Clinical Commissioning Groups, 
Hampshire County Council, the National 
Health Service. 
 Design
 Deliver safe, attractive, integrated and 
well-designed environments that take 
account of and respond positively to local 
context and character. Strengthen the 
sense of belonging and identity within 
Test Valley by supporting enhancements 
to the distinctive towns and villages 
of the Borough. Place-making will be 
integral to our design approach, helping 
to strengthen our connections between 
people and place.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
2.52 Test Valley benefits from a rich variety 
of landscapes, towns, villages and 
buildings. Development will need 
to respect and enhance our built 
and natural environment for future 
generations to enjoy, whilst contributing 
to the delivery of healthy, inclusive, and 
attractive, places. Design plays a key 
role in tackling these challenges and 
delivering development that can support 
and celebrate nature and biodiversity, 
enhancing and creating high quality 
accessible places for those who live and 
work in them and in countering climate 
change through creating buildings that 
are durable, flexible and built for life.
2.53 In recent years, national policy and 
guidance has attached increasing weight 
to the role of good design in planning. 
The National Design Guide, National 
Model Design Code and recent reports 
of the Building Better, Building Beautiful 
Commission all set out guidance on 
how to ensure high quality design. This 
includes through the use of design 
principles and standards in planning 
policies and decision making, including 
through the use of design codes, 
masterplans and design briefs. 
 Housing 
 Provide a range of homes that are fit for 
purpose and designed to meet the needs 
and aspirations of different groups within 
the community, including a range of 
affordable housing and homes that meet 
the needs of an ageing population.
2.54 National policy requires local housing 
needs to be planned for within local plans, 
based on the nationally set 'standard 
method'. For Test Valley, the local housing 
need figure is currently 541 homes per 
annum, which provides the minimum 
housing need to be identified in the 
Local Plan 2040. The identification of an 
appropriate and continuous supply of 
land for new homes to meet our needs 
will need to be provided in the Local Plan 
2040. A further challenge for the plan is 
to ensure it offers a resilient strategy to enable delivery of a continuous supply of 
homes over the plan period as a whole. 
2.55 Test Valley has an ageing population. 
There are affordability issues and housing 
needs vary in the north and south of the 
Borough. Meeting a range of housing to 
meet the needs of our communities is a 
key challenge for the Local Plan 2040.
 Economy, Employment and Skills
 Promote a vibrant and resilient local 
economy, including the visitor economy, 
where future sustainable growth and 
innovation in green, high technology 
and other sectors can provide for a 
range of job opportunities and where 
businesses and individuals can thrive. 
Support a skilled and diverse workforce 
so that local people can access learning 
opportunities and jobs and benefit from 
greater prosperity. 
2.56 Test Valley is part of a wider sub-regional 
and regional economy. The Borough 
has benefited from economic growth in 
recent years. Employment floor space 
has increased significantly, contributing 
to meeting both a local and sub-regional 
need. We have delivered approximately 
36 hectares of employment land between 
2015/16 and 2020/21. Recent delivery 
has been strong however the impact of 
the Coronavirus pandemic nationally 
on our economy is still unclear going 
forward. 
2.57 To support economic sustainability in 
the local and sub-regional economy, 
it is important that employment land, 
including a varied supply of high-
quality premises is provided to meet 
our needs. An opportunity for the Local 
Plan 2040 will be to seek to build on the 
current strengths in the local economy 
and facilitate appropriate future levels 
of provision at the most suitable and 
sustainable locations. A challenge is to 
provide skilled employment and suitable 
training opportunities, to suit the evolving 
needs and demands of the local and 
regional economy, for local people. This Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 125
will support our communities in providing 
job opportunities and provide businesses 
with access to the skilled labour they 
require. 
2.58 The Local Plan 2040 will need to take 
account of the trends in the knowledge-
based, green, and higher technology 
industries, the role of our rural businesses 
and the visitor economy, and growth in 
more flexible working, including working 
from home. This will help our economy 
and workforce to be prepared to adapt 
and benefit from future opportunities.
 
2.59 Our key partners in supporting economic 
development and employment 
opportunities will play a key role in 
helping to deliver this objective. The 
Council will continue to work with 
the Enterprise M3 Local Enterprise 
Partnership (EM3 LEP), Hampshire 
County Council, the Partnership for South 
Hampshire (PfSH) and other agencies to 
meet our needs and support business 
growth.
  Transport and Movement
 Encourage active and sustainable modes 
of transport, that are accessible, safe and 
attractive to use, whilst also seeking to 
reduce the impact of travel in particular 
by private car. Ensure new development 
facilitates improvements to accessibility, 
safety and connectivity in our transport 
infrastructure.
2.60 An efficient and integrated transport 
network is important to help deliver 
sustainable economic growth, to reduce 
congestion, and to enable residents and 
visitors to enjoy good access. Test Valley 
is well placed in this regard, enjoying 
a good strategic road and rail network, 
access to local airports and ports and a 
wide range of local bus services. However, 
some of our rural areas, have limited 
access to public transport. Car ownership 
in the Borough is higher than the UK 
average and most journeys in Test Valley 
are made by private car.2.61 It is anticipated that transport and 
movement will evolve in response to 
the challenges presented by climate 
change. The transport sector will change 
dramatically as we approach 2050. In the 
UK, transport is the biggest contributor to 
greenhouse gas emissions. By increasing 
the availability, connectivity and 
attractiveness of more sustainable modes 
of transport the Local Plan 2040 can 
help to contribute to the goal of net zero 
carbon development. 
2.62 Facilitating access to public transport, 
enabling an increase in sustainable 
movements and use of low carbon 
transportation along with having large 
rural areas in the Borough, presents a 
significant challenge for the Local Plan 
2040. Partnership working with key 
stakeholders will assist in the delivery of 
this objective including with Hampshire 
County Council, Network Rail, and public 
transport providers. 
2.63 Focusing development in the most 
sustainable locations can help to reduce 
the need and impact of travel. It can also 
promote opportunities for increased 
use of sustainable modes of transport, 
including walking and cycling. While 
walking and cycling infrastructure is 
improving in Test Valley, including 
through the Local Cycling and Walking 
Infrastructure Plans15 (LCWIPs) currently 
being prepared by Hampshire County 
Council and SUSTRANS, it needs further 
enhancement throughout the Borough.
2.64 We are seeking views on our Objectives 
and whether they reflect the priorities for 
the Community.
15   An LCWIP is in preparation for Southern Test Valley, and 
another will be prepared for the Andover area in due course, 
to promote a series of priority routes and measures for in-
vestment, to seek to deliver better, safer and more attractive 
cycling and walking infrastructure. See https://hampshire-
lcwips.commonplace.is/about26
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Chapter 3: 
Spatial Strategy
 Introduction
3.1 We are committed to ensuring the 
borough’s growth is delivered in the 
most sustainable way which benefits 
our communities. The Local Plan’s 
Objectives set out the overarching 
sustainable priorities to guide the 
Plan’s policies. The spatial strategy sits 
alongside this by setting out the direction 
for the location, types and shape of 
development. It identifies where and 
what sustainable development looks 
like for our communities in Test Valley. 
Key to delivering our spatial strategy is a 
settlement hierarchy which identifies the 
sustainability and role of settlements by 
grouping settlements by tiers.
  Sustainable Spatial Strategy
3.2 To ensure the overarching sustainable 
objectives are at the heart of Local 
Plans and decision making on planning 
applications, the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF) sets out a presumption 
in favour of sustainable development. 
As set out in the NPPF, sustainable 
development is meeting the needs of 
the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet our 
own needs and has three overarching 
objectives. To deliver this, we must 
balance these objectives; economic, 
social and environment, which can be 
challenging.
3.3 The spatial strategy sets out an 
overarching pattern of sustainable 
development, taking account of our 
local needs, and character. It has been 
informed by evidence, which is set out in 
the Spatial Strategy Topic Paper. 
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 127
3.4 The spatial strategy sets out Test Valley’s 
approach to promoting a sustainable 
pattern of development:
• It sets out key factors to guide the 
shape of sustainable development 
with a focus on ensuring health, 
high quality design, addressing our 
changing climate and green networks 
are at the heart of development
• Identifies the distribution of 
development in the Borough setting 
out where we will meet our various 
needs, ensuring infrastructure is 
aligned with development and 
supporting opportunities for local 
communities to plan to meet their 
needs. 
3.5 Taken as a whole, the spatial strategy 
and the plan’s policies will balance 
the delivery of the three sustainability 
objectives and how we positively deliver 
the presumption in favour of sustainable 
development for our communities. 
Reflecting this, we are not proposing 
to have a policy in this Local Plan 2040 
that sets out the presumption in favour 
of sustainable development. Rather 
alongside the national policy requirement, 
we have expressed what sustainable 
development looks like for Test Valley 
in our spatial strategy alongside our 
objectives. This will ensure there is a 
golden thread of achieving sustainability 
throughout the Local Plan 2040. 
3.6 Since our current Local Plan was Adopted 
in 2016, there has been a significant 
change in national policy on Local Plans 
playing a key role in helping to counter 
climate change, deliver beautiful places, 
and improve our natural environment. 
Our Local Plan 2040 objectives identify 
how we will tackle and address these 
factors appropriately for Test Valley. 
The consultation responses received 
emphasised the importance of addressing 
these issues for our communities. 
Therefore, the spatial strategy identifies 
key factors that reflect this which 
are fundamental to maintaining and 
enhancing a sustainable and attractive 
Borough. 3.7 Alongside this, the spatial strategy 
sets out the importance of providing 
infrastructure and sustainable active 
travel which will ensure integration of 
new developments with our existing 
settlements providing opportunities for 
healthy and active movements. 
 Spatial Options 
3.8 The previous Issues and Options 
document put forward several options 
for the distribution of development. 
We have developed these options and 
undertaken a robust assessment. This is 
set out in the Spatial Strategy Topic Paper 
and demonstrates assessment of the 
sustainability of the options. This includes 
consideration of alignment with national 
policy, our corporate priorities, resilience 
of the strategy to deliver over the plan 
period and meet our housing needs, and 
whether it is deliverable reflecting the 
capacity and character of Test Valley. 
3.9 The assessment resulted in a hybrid 
of three options presenting the most 
sustainable option for Test Valley. This 
has been informed by the Sustainability 
Appraisal of these options. These 
options combined, focus on supporting 
regeneration of Andover and Romsey 
town centres, supporting growth at 
our key employment areas along with 
supporting growth at our larger urban 
and rural communities throughout the 
Borough. Overall, this supports focus 
at our two market towns with a wider 
distribution of development to a larger 
number of settlements. Enabling growth 
at our larger number of settlements 
including at our rural communities was 
supported through responses received to 
the Refined Issues and Options. 
3.10 The market towns of Andover and 
Romsey are our largest settlements in 
the Borough, with the widest range and 
number of facilities. They are at the core of 
our spatial strategy and will continue to be 
a focus for development. Central to this, 
is the regeneration of the town centres 
through requiring high quality design and 
providing a mixture of uses to support day 28
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1and evening economies which will benefit 
our communities and attract visitors. The 
respective Masterplans are delivering this. 
Development will need to maximise the 
use of land in the town centres however 
there will still remain a need to look at 
greenfield sites at these settlements. The 
scale of these will be considered through 
our site assessment work. This will inform 
the draft site allocations which will be set 
out at the next stage of the Local Plan 
2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2.
3.11 Significant growth has already taken 
place at Andover and Romsey in the form 
of large scale housing allocations, as 
identified in the current Adopted Local 
Plan 2029. We will take account of this 
growth in considering site allocations at 
the next stage of the Local Plan 2040. 
There is only one Local Plan allocation 
outstanding (has no planning permission) 
at Whitenap, Romsey (1,300 homes). We 
will also consider how we take forward 
this outstanding allocation at the next 
stage.
3.12 To support and sustain vibrant and 
healthy communities, the spatial 
strategy identifies a wider distribution of 
development than set out in our current 
Local Plan 2029. The focus is to support 
an appropriate level of development 
at our largest range of sustainable 
settlements where there are key facilities. 
Much of the Borough is rural with some 
villages meeting immediate needs. 
This strategy will support these rural 
settlements to develop in a sustainable 
manner. Our rural areas do face 
challenges in terms of housing supply and 
affordability, in which this strategy can 
help to overcome. 3.13 This strategy aligns with national policy in 
recognising developments, in particular 
housing, can support opportunities for 
villages to grow and thrive. This can 
improve the broader sustainability of 
rural communities along with providing 
benefits in sustaining and enhancing 
facilities and infrastructure and potentially 
attracting new ones. Communities already 
have the opportunity to shape their 
areas through Neighbourhood Plans, 
Neighbourhood Development Orders and 
Village Design Statements. This strategy 
supports communities in identifying and 
shaping site allocations to meet their local 
needs. 
3.14 There is a strong and diverse rural and 
visitor economy in the Borough and the 
spatial strategy recognises the need to 
support this. These types of economies 
play a crucial role in supporting and 
sustaining vibrant communities, and 
the support for a wider distribution of 
development will enable this to grow, 
where it is sustainable to do so. In 
considering site allocations, we will 
assess whether a balance of homes 
and employment can be provided in 
appropriate locations. 
3.15 For the smaller settlements in the rural 
area, the spatial strategy identifies that 
development will be enabled where it 
supports their role. 
 Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 129
Test Valley Sustainable Spatial Strategy 
 Maintaining and enhancing a sustainable and attractive Borough through:
• Reducing our impact on our changing climate and integrating ecological 
 networks and improving biodiversity.
• Providing inclusive growth that creates green, safe, and well-designed places
• Supporting new or improved infrastructure which positively responds to its setting, 
local needs, and our changing climate.
• Promoting access to the countryside and conserving and enhancing the Borough’s 
diverse landscape character
• Providing developments that promote active travel and invest in infrastructure to 
enable clean travel that reduces our impact from travel. 
• Working with our communities and organisations to deliver this
 Delivering vibrant and resilient towns at Andover and Romsey through:
• Promoting the town centres as destinations through delivering well designed, 
accessible, mixed-use developments with improvements to our public realm, 
maximising the use of previously developed land, to support the day and evening 
economies in accordance with our Masterplans
• Being a key focus for sustainable growth along with supporting infrastructure which is 
integrated with the towns
• Working jointly with Andover Vision and Romsey Future to deliver improvements to the 
town centres
 Sustaining vibrant and healthy communities through:
• Maintaining and enhancing the roles of our larger urban and rural settlements through 
accommodating development that meets the needs of local communities and supports 
existing accessible facilities. 
• Supporting our strong and diverse economy including the rural and visitor economy. 
• Development being supported elsewhere in the Borough to support the role of smaller 
rural settlements
 
• Providing opportunities for communities to be empowered and plan for new 
development, through neighbourhood plans. 
 30
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1Next Steps
3.16 We are seeking comments on the spatial 
strategy, and these will be taken into 
account in refining the spatial strategy for 
the next Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18, 
Stage 2. This next stage will include our 
draft site allocations in accordance with 
this strategy and a series of more detailed 
policies, as part of the Development 
Management policies. We have published 
our Strategic Housing and Economic 
Land Availability Assessment 2021 
(SHELAA) which provides our baseline 
for our site assessment process. We are 
seeking for any additional sites or further 
evidence on the sites already identified in 
the SHELAA to be submitted during the 
public consultation on this Plan. 
3.17 Neighbourhood Plans can play a role in 
delivering the spatial strategy and allocate 
sites to help meet the Borough wide 
and local housing need. We are seeking 
comments on the role Neighbourhood 
Plans could play in allocating sites, in 
particular from Town and Parish Councils. 
If Neighbourhood Plans do play a role 
in allocating sites, there would still be a 
role for the Local Plan to allocate sites, in 
particular for larger scale sites. 
3.18 We will be considering a mixture and 
range of sites in our site assessment. 
We are required by national policy for a 
minimum of 10% of our total supply of 
sites of 1 hectare of less. We will need 
to ensure we meet this requirement in 
identifying our draft site allocations at 
Stage 2. 
 Settlement Hierarchy
3.19 A key part of delivering our spatial 
strategy is our Settlement Hierarchy. 
The Settlement Hierarchy identifies and 
groups together towns and villages based 
on their sustainability and their role and 
function. This is identified in terms of the 
access to services and facilities within 
each settlement or in nearby larger towns 
or villages. 
 
3.20 The National Planning Policy Framework 
states that strategic policies should set 
out an overall strategy for the pattern 
and scale of development and that 
the purpose of the planning system 
is to contribute to the achievement of 
sustainable development. Sustainable 
development provides strong, vibrant and 
healthy communities by ensuring that a 
sufficient number and range of homes can 
be provided in appropriate locations, with 
accessible services and open spaces. 
3.21 National guidance identifies 
that settlements with a variety of 
characteristics can play a role in delivering 
sustainable development, particularly in 
rural areas. Test Valley is predominantly 
rural in nature and has a number of 
smaller settlements. In rural areas, 
planning policies and decisions should 
be responsive to local circumstances, 
support housing developments 
that reflect local needs and identify 
opportunities for villages to grow and 
thrive, especially where this will support 
local services. Where there are groups 
of smaller settlements, development in 
one settlement may support services in 
a settlement nearby. National guidance 
recognises that people living in rural 
areas face challenges in terms of housing 
supply and affordability and new 
housing can be important for the broader 
sustainability of rural communities.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 131
3.22 The spatial strategy identifies a 
distribution of development to support 
and sustain vibrant and healthy 
communities. The focus is to support an 
appropriate level of development at our 
more sustainable settlements both in 
urban and rural areas where there are key 
facilities and services. 
 Settlement Assessment
3.23 In order to identify where settlements 
sit in the settlement hierarchy, we 
need to undertake an assessment of 
the sustainability, role and function of 
our settlements. The more sustainable 
settlements are located in the higher 
tiers of the hierarchy as residents are 
able to access a greater range of services 
and facilities more easily without the 
need to travel as far by car. The smaller, 
less sustainable settlements with fewer 
facilities are located towards the bottom of 
the hierarchy.
3.24 The ranking of each settlement in the 
hierarchy does not indicate whether there 
is suitable land for development in that 
location, or that environmentally it would 
be appropriate. Although the Settlement 
Hierarchy is a key policy to deliver the 
spatial strategy, it sits alongside a number 
of other policies which collectively will 
help deliver the spatial strategy. 
3.25 In order to collect up to date information 
on facilities and services, a Rural Facilities 
Survey was undertaken. This Survey 
focused on the rural settlements in 
the Borough, rather than Andover and 
Romsey, as the services and sustainability 
of the towns are established. It gathered 
information about the existing services 
and facilities e.g. number of facilities such 
as a food store, primary school and level of 
bus service, within the rural settlements at 
a snapshot in time, in order to assess their 
sustainability and compare the facilities of 
different settlements. 3.26 The survey was sent to all of the rural 
Parish Councils for them to complete for 
each of the settlements in their parish. 
Parish Councils hold the most up to 
date information on the facilities in their 
areas. We received 37 responses from 
our Parish Councils. The Parish Profiles 
(produced by the Borough Council in 
2021), Council officers’ knowledge and 
gathering of desktop information were 
also used to fill in any gaps. This data was 
used to establish the list of settlements 
assessed. A copy of the data collected 
for each settlement has been provided to 
the relevant Parish Councils to enable a 
review process to be undertaken. Further 
details of the process involved, and the 
information collated is set out in the 
Settlement Hierarchy Topic Paper. 
3.27 The survey gathered data on 19 types of 
facility. To assess the sustainability and 
role of our rural settlements, we have 
identified six that provide ‘key facilities’ to 
meet the day to day, basic needs of our 
communities along with the level of public 
transport service. These ‘key facilities’ are:
• Food store;
• Public house;
• Primary school;
• Outdoor sports facility;
• Community or Village Hall; and a
• Place of worship. 
3.28 It is important to note that the assessment 
of the sustainability of settlements is 
based on a snapshot in time of services 
and facilities and may be subject to 
change in the future. We have identified 
the key facilities that provide the 
opportunity for our communities to meet 
their daily needs sustainability. The 
behavioural patterns of our communities 
may differ from this. However, we are 
aware there are other facilities that are 
becoming much more important to the 
sustainability of settlements and our 
communities, including infrastructure to 
support electric vehicles and superfast 
broadband. At present, the provision of 
these is evolving and thus has not been 
included as a key facility. We will keep this 
under review whilst preparing the Local 
Plan 2040. 
 32
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1Settlement Assessment Outcomes 
3.29 The towns of Andover and Romsey stand 
out as being the most sustainable, each 
with a full range and number of services 
and a high level of accessibility by public 
transport. These towns also play a key 
role in supporting the needs of the wider 
population in Test Valley and potentially 
beyond the Borough reflecting the high 
level of services available. For these 
reasons the two towns are placed in the 
tier 1 of the settlement hierarchy. 
3.30 The next sustainable locations provide a 
range of facilities and services which are 
not to the level provided in Andover or 
Romsey but above that provided in our 
more rural settlements. They also play a 
role in supporting the needs of nearby 
communities including those in adjoining 
authorities. These are Charlton, Chilworth,

3.31 Chilworth does score lower than the 
other settlements in this tier. However 
the role and function of Chilworth 
due to its proximity to the University 
of Southampton Science Park and 
neighbouring settlement of Eastleigh, 
Chandler’s Ford and Southampton, 
justifies it being in tier 2. It benefits from 
accessing the facilities and services at 
these neighbouring settlements. 
3.32 The assessment shows that the more rural 
settlements vary in the amount and type 
of facilities that they offer. The settlements 
that have all 6 key facilities and have a 
good level of public transport16 have been 
identified as our more sustainable rural 
settlements and are identified in tier 3. 
Settlements that have five or less of each 
of the key facilities and have a public 
transport service have been identified in 
tier 4.
16 A good level of public transport has a medium or high level 
of bus service as defined in the Settlement Hierarchy Topic 
Paper. A medium level includes a daily service to a larger 
town and a high level includes a public transport service half 
hourly, hourly or includes a journey to and from key work 
locations3.33 Other rural settlements within the 
Borough, which have not been 
identified in the settlement hierarchy, are 
considered the least sustainable. These 
will have limited facilities and services 
and/or public transport service. Therefore, 
these settlements are not included in 
the settlement hierarchy table and are 
considered as part of the countryside.
3.34 There are settlements which benefit from 
and have access to services and facilities 
within a nearby settlement. This can have 
an impact on the sustainability of the 
settlements. Where this exists, we have 
grouped these settlements together in the 
assessment. 
3.35 The scores of the assessment are 
provided in the Settlement Hierarchy 
Assessment but also a summary table is 
provided at Appendix 1.

Next Steps
3.36 We are seeking comments on the 
proposed Settlement Hierarchy. In 
particular; 
• Whether the identification of existing 
facilities and services is accurate and 
up to date, particularly from Parish 
Councils. 
• Feedback on whether the use of the 
6 key facilities and levels of public 
transport service are appropriate to 
differentiate our rural settlements in 
the hierarchy
• Feedback on how we have assessed 
settlements that can access services 
and facilities available in a nearby 
settlement due to their proximity. 
3.37 Consultation comments will be taken 
into account in refining the Settlement 
Hierarchy for the next Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2. The next stage 
of the Local Plan 2040 will include our 
draft site allocations and a series of 
more detailed policies, as part of the 
Development Management policies. 
Additionally, the settlement hierarchy will 
evolve to include guidance on the level, 
type and scale of growth appropriate at 
each of the tiers in the hierarchy.36
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Chapter 4: 
Strategic Policy 
Framework
 Introduction
4.1 Alongside our spatial strategy there is a 
need to set out a strategic policy framework 
to guide development reflecting our 
economic, social and environmental 
priorities for Test Valley. These strategic 
policies deliver our priorities as set out 
in our objectives. They address the 
regeneration of our town centres, the need 
to counter climate change, delivery of 
high quality development, conserving and 
enhancing Test Valley’s high quality natural, 
historic and built environment. These 
combined will enhance the quality of life for 
our communities. 
4.2 Not all strategic policies have been set out 
at this stage of the Local Plan 2040. We 
consider it would be premature to draft 
strategic policies where our evidence has 
not been completed or where national 
policy is significantly evolving. We will be 
able to take account of this when we draft 
these policies for the next stage of the Local 
Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
  Climate Emergency 
4.3 Climate change is one of the biggest 
challenges we face. It has implications 
from an international to local level, and cuts 
across social, environmental and economic 
themes. Not only do we need to think about 
how to significantly reduce greenhouse 
emissions (referred to as mitigation) but 
also to ensure we adapt, counter and are 
resilient to future conditions. 
4.4 The planning system has an important role 
to play, as is recognised in the national 
Net Zero Strategy17 and the NPPF. Climate 
change is a key theme running through 
the Local Plan 2040 in order to ensure it 
contributes to achieving the commitments 
at a national level.
4.5 There is a duty18 for Local Plans to 
include policies that are designed to 
secure development and use of land 
that contributes to the mitigation of, 
and adaptation to, climate change. The 
Climate Change Act 2008 sets out the legal 
framework for emissions reduction, as well 
as the mechanisms for identifying and 
acting on the risks of a changing climate. 
17 Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, Department for Busi-
ness, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2021.
18 Section 19(1A) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase 
Act 2004 (as amended)
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 137
 It establishes that by 2050 the UK’s net 
emissions need to be 100% lower than the 
1990 baseline. Therefore we need to be 
at net zero emissions by this date and the 
Council are seeking to do this sooner. That 
means that the amount of greenhouse gas 
emissions produced is balanced with the 
amount removed from the atmosphere. 
4.6 Carbon budgets are established to act 
as stepping stones on the journey to net 
zero19. Therefore before the end of the plan 
period (2040) there will need to have been 
significant changes in the way buildings 
(including homes) are designed, heated 
and powered; the way we travel; the way 
our economy operates; and how we use the 
environment around us. 
4.7 National data on carbon dioxide emissions20 
indicates that the average emissions per 
person occurring in Test Valley are higher 
than the equivalent figures for Hampshire 
and England, particularly in relation to 
transport sources. In part, this will reflect the 
rural nature of the Borough. 
4.8 In broad terms, climate change is 
anticipated to result in a greater chance of 
warmer, wetter winters and warmer, drier 
summers across the UK in the future. It is 
also expected to result in more extreme 
weather events, including heatwaves, 
droughts and storms, along with increased 
incidence of flooding. Test Valley has 
experienced flooding events, including 
in 2014 when multiple areas within the 
Borough were affected. The Borough 
is also within an area of serious water 
stress21, when considering the needs of the 
environment and for public water supplies. 
Additional risks identified at a national 
level, include implications on health and 
wellbeing, biodiversity and ecosystems, and 
food production22.
19 For example, for 2033-2037 emissions should have reduced 
by 78% relative to the 1990 position.

22 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, HM Government, 2022.4.9 The NPPF sets out some of the ways that the 
planning system can support the transition 
to a low carbon future in a changing 
climate, such as through shaping places 
in ways to contribute to radical reductions 
in emissions, minimise vulnerability and 
improving resilience. The NPPF has recently 
been updated, with further changes 
expected in relation to climate change. The 
preparation of the Local Plan 2040 will need 
to reflect these changes as they emerge. 
 Test Valley Climate Emergency 
Action Plan and Evidence
4.10 The Council has declared a climate 
emergency, and in 2020 approved its first 
Climate Emergency Action Plan23. This 
includes a specific action to ensure that 
policies in the Local Plan 2040 are written 
to facilitate the move towards carbon 
neutrality. The Council is committed to 
working with communities and partners to 
reduce emissions and support adaptation 
to the effects of a changing climate. The 
Local Plan 2040 has a role to play in 
achieving this.
4.11 Taking a holistic approach can support 
wider objectives and maximise other 
benefits that such actions can deliver. For 
example, we can also seek to conserve 
and enhance the environment around 
us, facilitate the transition to a greener 
economy and enhance health and 
wellbeing of those living and working in 
the Borough. All of these opportunities 
support the vision and objectives of the 
Local Plan 2040 and the delivery of the 
priorities in the Council’s Corporate Plan. 
The approach to the climate emergency 
is particularly relevant to achieving the 
objective directly relating to climate 
change. 
4.12 While much of the context and evidence 
on the approach to countering, mitigating 
and adapting to climate change is 
available at a national level, there are 
important resources and evidence 
available on a more local level.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 14.13 Some evidence is already available, 
such as the Renewable and Low Carbon 
Energy Study24 and a companion 
assessment of landscape sensitivity in 
relation to wind and solar developments25. 
Additional evidence will be collated 
as part of the preparation of the Local 
Plan 2040. This includes the updating 
of evidence in relation to flood risk, to 
include consideration of risks when 
accounting for climate change and may 
also include an additional assessment of 
the implications of the proposals of the 
Local Plan 2040 overall.
4.14 Key local strategies, policy and evidence 
in relation to climate change include, but 
would not be restricted to:
• Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
(currently being updated). The 
Council is currently working with 
other authorities in south Hampshire 
to update evidence in relation to flood 
risk, to include consideration of risks 
when accounting for climate change.
• Policies, strategies and guidance on 
flood risk, including the Lead Local 
Flood Authority’s Local Flood and 
Water Management Strategy26
• North Solent Shoreline Management 
Plan (2010)27 provides the strategic 
policy approach for the management 
of the coast, including in relation to 
coastal flood risk and erosion risk, for 
a 100-year period. A small area of the 
Borough, in the vicinity of Nursling, 
has a strategic policy approach of ‘no 
active intervention’. These means that 
the coastal areas would be allowed to 
change and evolve naturally.

work provides the evidence to inform 
future planning policies on renewable

within the Borough. It includes 
consideration of the potential for a 
number of different types of renewable 
energy resources within Test Valley.
• Local Transport Plan (currently being 
reviewed by Hampshire County 
Council28). The work to date on the 
new Local Transport Plan highlighted 
climate change, both in terms of 
reducing emissions and ensuring a 
resilient and reliable transport network, 
as a key theme.
• Local Ecological Network. The 
Hampshire Biodiversity Information 
Centre (HBIC) has prepared a local 
ecological network on behalf of the 
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local 
Nature Partnership. This mapping 
can help to identify opportunities to 
conserve and enhance the biodiversity 
and ecological connectivity. This 
mapping will be kept under review.
 Delivering a Net Zero Carbon 
Future
4.15 The priority of countering climate change 
by significantly reducing our carbon 
emissions and ensuring resilience to 
anticipated future changes, is a key matter 
for the Local Plan 2040 and it is appropriate 
to set out a strategic approach. This will also 
help to set the framework for more detailed 
policies that will be presented at the next 
stage of the Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 
Stage 2. This policy also needs to be read 
alongside other policies and proposals 
within the Local Plan 2040.
28  For more information, see: http://www.hants.gov.uk/trans-
port/localtransportplan/visionsandoutcomes Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 139
4.16 It is essential that all development is 
designed so as to minimise greenhouse 
gas emissions, this spans from the 
location of proposals to the way it is 
constructed, how it operates and is used 
throughout its lifecycle. Development will 
need to be ready for net zero and reduce 
the needs for retrofitting to achieve this. 
This relates to new development, the 
infrastructure that serves it, and the wider 
environment (including the effective use 
of land and resources). There is also an 
opportunity to ensure the links between 
climate and ecological considerations are 
accounted for, so as to ensure that new 
development is planned and designed 
recognising these connections. 
4.17 The energy hierarchy advocates an 
approach where the reduction in demand 
for energy (including for heating, cooling 
and lighting) is prioritised; followed by 
ensuring that energy is used and supplied 
efficiently; then looking at renewable and 
low carbon energy sources to meet the 
resultant energy needs. Opportunities 
should also be explored to manage peak 
energy loads. The energy hierarchy 
should inform the design, construction 
and operation of new development. 
Offsetting any residual emissions should 
be a last resort, after the energy hierarchy 
has been followed.
4.18 In reducing demand for energy (including 
in relation to heating and cooling), a 
‘fabric first’ approach should be taken. 
Ventilation and ways to manage the 
potential build-up of heat will need to 
be considered alongside energy and 
thermal performance. As part of the next 
step in preparing the Local Plan 2040 we 
will be considering options for energy 
performance standards for buildings, with 
more information set out below on this. 4.19 The transport sector is a key source of 
the carbon dioxide emissions occurring 
within the Borough. The planning system 
has a role in promoting more sustainable 
travel, including through the location of 
new development and the infrastructure 
that is secured to support it. Therefore, it is 
also appropriate to be recognised within 
the strategic approach to climate change. 
4.20 The Government has made 
announcements about the timing of 
phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles29, 
however there is also a need to reduce 
travel overall and increase the share of 
journeys undertaken by walking, cycling 
and public transport.
4.21 The location of development30, the way 
developments are planned (including 
the mix of uses proposed), laid out and 
designed, and the infrastructure that 
supports them, all have the potential 
to affect transport and travel related 
emissions. This includes through the 
patterns of development that enable 
the prioritisation and encouraging of 
walking, cycling and the use of public 
and / or community transport; ensuring 
appropriate connectivity within and 
beyond sites; and seeking to minimise the 
need for unnecessary travel by private 
vehicles. 
4.22 It is vital that development, along with 
the associated facilities and infrastructure 
that supports it, is designed to be resilient 
for its anticipated lifecycle, not just the 
short term. A key consideration will be 
accounting for the implications of the 
changing climate, but regard also needs 
to be had to designing in flexibility 
for changing needs and changing 
technologies. 
29 Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, Department for Busi-
ness, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2021.
30 This includes in relation to access to facilities and services, 
as well as public and community transport links.40
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 14.23 Development needs to be designed to 
respond to locally important matters, 
such as water management (including 
the efficient use of water and flood risk), 
as well as those issues that are likely 
to apply more broadly, such as risks of 
overheating. 
4.24 When designing proposals to avoid risks 
of overheating (indoor and outdoor), 
careful consideration will need to be 
given to the layout, orientation, and 
design of proposals; the materials used; 
and the provision or enhancement of 
green infrastructure and other means of 
providing shading where appropriate. 
Where relevant, passive ventilation (and 
cooling)31 should be prioritised alongside 
minimising excess heat generation. 
4.25 The approaches taken should avoid 
increasing energy use and greenhouse 
gas emissions. Where possible, 
nature-based solutions32 should be 
utilised, including in relation to water 
management.
4.26 Green infrastructure can deliver 
multiple functions, including storing 
carbon, providing cooling and shading, 
helping manage flood risk (including 
through sustainable drainage systems), 
conserving and enhancing biodiversity, 
and supporting opportunities for 
improvement to health and wellbeing. 
In considering green infrastructure and 
how it integrates into new development, 
regard should be had to its extent, quality, 
the level of connection to the network, 
and the functions it is delivering.
31 Also known as natural ventilation, this approach seeks to 
avoid the use of mechanical system to provide adequate 
ventilation levels.
32 Nature based solutions involve the restoration of ecosys-
tems for the long-term benefit of people and nature, this 
could include natural floodplain management, and habitat 
restoration that may have consequential benefits for carbon 
storage. 4.27 Ecological networks form part of the 
green infrastructure network but also 
need to be considered in their own 
right. Such networks are important 
to help conserve biodiversity, enable 
migration and dispersal of species, and 
potentially play a role in enabling habitats 
and species to respond to a changing 
climate. Factors that will need to be 
considered in seeking to conserve and 
enhance coherent and resilient ecological 
networks, include scale, quality and 
connectivity. Further detailed policies on 
the approach to biodiversity, including 
ecological networks and delivering 
biodiversity net gain, will be set out in 
the Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 
2, which will also take account of the 
implications of the Environment Act 2021. 
4.28 The promotion of the sustainable use of 
resources and a circular economy33 can 
also be a means of reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions that are embodied through 
their production, during construction 
processes, and at end of life (seeking 
to maximise opportunities for waste 
products to be seen and used as a 
resource). Additionally, land should 
be used effectively, reflecting on the 
opportunities and benefits available 
through appropriate mixed or multi-
functional uses, including how proposals 
are laid out, and taking account of 
local character. Developments will 
need to be designed and planned to 
take these matters into account. Views 
would be welcome on approaches for 
demonstrating how such factors can 
be taken into account in designing 
proposals.
33  A circular economy seeks to design out waste, by keeping 
products and materials in use, including through reusing, 
repairing and recycling as much as possible.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 141
 Strategic Policy 1: Countering Climate Change
 Development will deliver a net zero carbon future through both mitigation and adaptation 
to a changing climate. In order to achieve this, development will be permitted provided 
that:
a) Greenhouse gas emissions have been minimised in line with the energy hierarchy 
principles, including reducing energy demand and utilising renewable and low carbon 
technologies;
b) Opportunities have been taken to maximise the potential for active and sustainable 
travel and minimise unnecessary travel;
c) The development, including associated facilities and infrastructure, is designed to be 
adaptable to changing needs, technologies, and a changing climate; 
d) It is designed to provide appropriate resilience and reduce vulnerability to extreme 
weather conditions (including drought), flooding and overheating, and makes efficient 
use of water; 
e) It conserves and enhances coherent and resilient ecological networks and green 
infrastructure networks, while delivering net gains for biodiversity; and
f) Appropriate opportunities have been taken to use or reuse land efficiently, minimise the 
use and promote the sustainable use of resources and promote a circular economy.
 Next Steps
4.29 We are seeking comments on this policy. 
As noted above, it is anticipated that 
the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2, will include a 
series of more detailed policies that will 
support the overarching approach, as 
part of the Development Management 
policies. Additionally, the above policy on 
the approach to climate change is likely to 
evolve as the Local Plan 2040 develops, 
as changes in national policy or guidance 
are likely.
4.30 Detailed policy matters that are likely to be 
set out at the next stage are summarised 
below:
• Application of the energy hierarchy, 
potentially including through energy 
performance requirements for new 
development.• Policies relating to applications for 
renewable and low carbon energy 
proposals, including supporting 
infrastructure – this could include 
criteria-based policies, the 
identification of suitable areas for 
specific technologies, and / or other 
policy approaches. 
• Policies relating to managing 
movement and sustainable travel, 
including regarding walking, cycling 
and public transport, as well as parking 
and storage provisions including 
securing electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure where new parking is 
to be provided34. This is also likely 
to include our approach to securing 
travel plans for specific developments.
34 In relation to electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the pol-
icy approach may depend on provisions introduced through 
other mechanisms. It is recognised that the Government 
has announced that legislation will be introduced requiring 
new homes and buildings to install electric vehicle charging 
points from 2022.42
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1• The approach to conserving, 
enhancing and / or providing 
high quality green infrastructure; 
conserving and enhancing ecological 
networks; securing biodiversity net 
gain; tree retention and potentially 
tree canopy cover; prioritising nature-
based solutions where possible.
• Policies relating to the efficient use 
of water and the approach to flood 
risk (to include all types of flooding, 
the application of the sequential and 
exception tests referred to in the NPPF, 
and the use of sustainable drainage 
systems).
4.31 A key part of improving the energy 
performance of buildings is the increase 
in requirements set out in Building 
Regulations. The Government has 
announced proposals to increase the 
requirements of Building Regulations, 
working towards the Future Homes 
Standard and Future Buildings Standard. 
The Future Homes Standard is due to 
be in effect from 2025, with an interim 
increase in energy performance standards 
coming into effect in 2022. 
4.32 At present, local authorities have 
the opportunity to introduce energy 
performance standards that exceed 
Building Regulations. Such policy 
options would be considered as part of 
the preparation of the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
Any such policies would be likely to focus 
on the intended outcomes, rather than 
specific technologies or approaches. 
This could include the use of recognised 
benchmarks or design frameworks / 
standards. The focus on outcomes gives 
greater flexibility as we see innovations in 
technologies and solutions for reducing 
emissions, as well as recognising that 
the options available may depend on the 
specific proposal.4.33 As the preparation of the Local Plan 
2040 progresses, we will be considering 
whether energy masterplans, whole 
lifecycle carbon emission assessments, or 
similar statements would be required in 
conjunction with certain scales or types 
of development to demonstrate how this 
policy has been satisfied. Views would be 
welcome on taking this approach. 
4.34 It is recognised that some of these 
policy proposals may increase costs 
for delivering development. National 
planning policy and guidance sets out 
the approach to considering viability. A 
viability assessment of the Local Plan 
2040 will be undertaken to ensure 
policies are deliverable. We will also be 
seeking to ensure that climate change 
considerations have been embedded 
throughout the Local Plan 2040 to ensure 
we counter climate change as much as 
possible and taking account of the legal 
duty on this matter.
 Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 143
 Environment
4.36 Our community places great value on 
the protection and enhancement of 
the Borough’s environment including 
our landscape, countryside and 
biodiversity. Test Valley’s built and natural 
environment is rich and varied, with parts 
of the Borough being of international 
wildlife importance, national landscape 
importance and important heritage value. 
4.37 Central to the Local Plan 2040 is to 
conserve and enhance our environment 
and is key to the delivery of the 
environmental objective in achieving 
sustainable development. Ensuring high 
environmental standards and addressing 
wider environmental concerns, 
particularly in relation to climate change, 
cuts across the whole of the Local Plan 
2040. 
4.38 The recently enacted Environment Act 
2021 (November 2021) introduces various 
changes to the legal framework for a 
range of environmental matters. It makes 
provisions for targets, plans and policies 
for improving the natural environment; 
including improvement to environmental 
protection regarding waste and resource 
efficiency; air quality; water; nature and 
biodiversity conservation.
4.39 The Act introduces a system of mandatory 
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) in relation to 
certain planning applications (a minimum 
of 10% net gain on new schemes). This 
is over and above the consideration of 
potential effects on habitats and species 
of importance. Details on the application 
of BNG are still to be refined35, including 
how they relate to sites of different scales. 
It will be essential that Biodiversity Net 
Gain is considered from a very early stage 
of development, including consideration 
of opportunities to meet this requirement 
on-site where this is appropriate to do so. 
35 Biodiversity Net Gain requirements through the Environment 
Act 2021 are likely to come into effect in autumn 2023, in line 
with transition arrangements within the legislation.4.40 There will be lots of legislation that 
evolves as a result of this Act which 
the Local Plan 2040 will need to be in 
accordance with. We have not included 
strategic policies on environmental 
matters at this stage of the Local Plan 
2040 to reflect the need to appropriately 
take account of this recent Act and 
emerging legislation. We will be drafting 
strategic and detailed development 
management policies on the environment 
in the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18, Stage 2. 
4.41 The key environmental topics which will 
be addressed further in the next stage of 
the Local Plan 2040, are as follows:
• Landscape: we will need to think 
about our approach to the protection 
and enhancement of our valued 
landscapes. This includes the design 
of new development to ensure it is in 
keeping with the character of the local 
landscape, with regard to its location, 
siting and design. This includes 
the approach to conserving and 
enhancing the North Wessex Downs 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB) and the setting of the New 
Forest National Park.
• Local Gaps: we will need to consider 
whether we need local gaps to help 
conserve the identity and character 
of communities by retaining space 
between settlements. We know there 
is strong support for local gaps from 
our communities however concern 
was also raised as to whether they 
were necessary. If local gaps are to be 
included, we would need to robustly 
justify the principle and location as 
national guidance does not contain 
specific requirements for local gaps. 
This includes whether we define 
boundaries or criteria approach for all 
development to adhere to. 44
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1• Green Infrastructure: we will need 
to consider our approach to the 
conservation and enhancement of 
our network of green infrastructure 
ensuring the multi benefits are 
maximised for our communities and 
the environment. We will need to 
consider the role Green Infrastructure 
can play in helping to adapt to our 
changing climate and the role of 
nature-based solutions to restore our 
ecosystems, such as expansion of tree 
and woodland cover.
• Public Open Spaces: we will need 
to think about our approach to 
the protection, enhancement and 
increased provision of public open 
spaces (including for indoor and 
outdoor sport) as a result of new 
development. 
• Local Green Spaces: we will need 
to consider the role of the Local 
Plan 2040 in designating Local 
Green Spaces which are areas that 
can only be designated in certain 
circumstances, including that they 
hold a particular local significance. 
• Biodiversity: we will need to consider 
our approach to development 
minimising impacts on biodiversity 
and habitats, as well as ensuring the 
delivery of Biodiversity Net Gain. In 
addition, we will set out our approach 
to maintaining and enhancing 
networks of habitats and the Local 
Plan’s role in contributing to the 
Nature Recovery Network (NRN) and 
Local Ecological Network36. 
36 This has been mapped by the Hampshire Biodiversity 
Information Centre on behalf of the Hampshire and Isle of 
Wight Local Nature Partnership. The mapping of the Local 
Ecological Network, as it relates to Test Valley, can be seen in 
the Council’s Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report (2020), 
within Appendix 3.• Protected Sites, Habitats and Species: 
we will need to consider our approach 
to the conservation, enhancement and 
integrity of internationally, nationally 
and locally designated wildlife sites, 
together with ancient woodland, 
protected species, and priority 
habitats and species. In some cases, 
this will be based on joint work with 
other local authorities and partner 
organisations. Examples include how 
we are addressing the issues of excess 
nutrient inputs (notably nitrogen) from 
new development into the Solent, and  
in relation to pressures on the New 
Forest and Solent from recreational 
use as these affect internationally 
designated sites.
• Water Management: we will consider 
our approach to planning for the 
provision of appropriate future water 
supply and wastewater treatment 
capacity. This will ensure the 
necessary water infrastructure can 
be put in place, whilst ensuring the 
environment is protected and water 
quality is conserved. The Council is 
working with other local authorities 
on these matters, including as part of 
PfSH.
• Historic Environment: we will need 
to identify a positive strategy for the 
conservation and enhancement of the 
historic environment.
• Environmental Health: we will need 
to consider and address the types of 
pollution and environmental harm 
that could arise from development, 
including land, air and water, as well as 
noise and light pollution. 
• Minerals and Waste: we will need to 
consider the impact of development 
on minerals and waste planning, which 
is the responsibility of Hampshire 
County Council37.

4.42 We will need to consider the evidence 
required to justify our approach on these 
matters in preparing the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 
2. We will be undertaking a Habitats 
Regulations Assessment alongside the 
preparation of the next stage of the Local 
Plan 2040 to assess if the Local Plan 
proposals could significantly harm the 
designated features of Special Areas of 
Conservation, Special Protection Areas, 
and / or Ramsar sites.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Delivery of Sustainable and 
High-Quality Development
4.43 High quality design has many positive 
benefits for Test Valley and our 
communities. Design goes beyond the 
look of an area, but also how it impacts 
the way places function and how we 
feel about them. Well-designed places 
can help us to positively meet our 
development needs and take advantage 
of the opportunities brought by 
development. It enables our communities 
to be sustainable, healthy, inclusive, and 
resilient to climate change. 
4.44 Good design is a key aspect of 
sustainable development, it creates 
better places in which to live and work 
and creates healthy environments for our 
communities.
4.45 The National Planning Policy Framework 
advises that Local Plans should set out a 
clear design vision and expectations, so 
that applicants have as much certainty 
as possible about what is likely to be 
acceptable. Strategic Local Plan policies 
need to set the overall strategy for the 
design quality of places. Development 
that is not well designed should be 
refused, especially where it fails to reflect 
local design policies and government 
guidance on design, such as design 
guides and codes.
4.46 There is growing national emphasis 
on good design and the role of design 
in planning, as set in recent guidance, 
including the National Model Design 
Code38 and National Design Guide39. 
These documents provide more detailed 
guidance on how places can be designed 
to achieve healthy and sustainable places. 
These documents set out guidance on the 
role and principles of design in planning 
developments, buildings and places and

file/962113/National_design_guide.pdf  the use of design codes. It also promotes 
design that seeks to enhance personal 
safety and minimise opportunities for 
crime and anti-social behaviour. 
4.47 This strategic design policy seeks 
to ensure development is to a high 
standard of design and that it reflects the 
local character of Test Valley. It will be 
supplemented by detailed Development 
Management policies on more specific 
design matters at the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
4.48 This approach to achieving high quality 
design was supported by a number 
of your consultation comments which 
favoured strong policies which are not 
too prescriptive; taking account of local 
distinctiveness. 
 Design Considerations
4.49 The policy incorporates a range of design 
principles and requirements to guide 
future development in the Borough. 
Development will need to respond 
positively to local context and character 
through an understanding of the local 
environment and landscape. This 
includes the built form, building finishes, 
materials and styles, street patterns, 
ecology, history, landscape and land uses. 
It should also be informed by local and 
national design guides and the National 
Model Design Code to demonstrate 
acceptable and appropriate design 
principles have been embedded in the 
proposal.
4.50 Test Valley already has examples of 
well-designed places rich in heritage. 
Future development will need to reflect 
this high standard and complement 
what we already have throughout the 
Borough. These are the places we enjoy 
as residents and users and make us feel 
at home, while others enjoy Test Valley as 
passers-by and visitors. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 147
4.51 Improvements to the public realm ensures 
areas throughout the Borough from our 
town centres to our villages are well cared 
for and respected places. Quality public 
realm can make a difference in whether 
our communities will want to spend time 
in a place. By ensuring development 
adopts approaches with increased natural 
surveillance, appropriate boundary 
treatments and cycle and car parking 
close to buildings they serve could 
prevent anti-social behaviour and crime. 
4.52 Ensuring development is resilient to the 
changing climate is extremely important. 
Design of places can have a big impact 
on our carbon emissions. Sustainable 
design practices will need to form part of 
the design process, to improve resource 
efficiency and to reduce environmental 
impacts. For many schemes, approaches 
like building orientation for natural 
heating and cooling, Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SuDS), greywater 
recycling, and tree or other forms of 
strategic planting can have a positive 
impact on reducing carbon emissions. 
Detailed Development Management 
policies on these approaches, will be 
considered at the next stage of the Local 
Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
4.53 Development will need to be designed 
to maximise access to green and outdoor 
space. Accessing green and blue spaces 
and being closer to nature can help 
improve our mental health and wellbeing. 
The importance of access to the outdoors 
was highlighted more than ever as we 
were presented with challenges as part of 
the Coronavirus pandemic.
4.54 The policy requires permeable street 
layout. This can encourage walking 
and cycling through providing a well-
connected environment. Legibility 
is critical to the quality of a place by 
ensuring easy and effective navigation 
within our communities. It will also be 
important that development takes into 
consideration accessibility for those who 
are less physically able, including those 
who are partially sighted or blind people 
and people with dementia.4.55 Achieving healthy places is at the heart 
of this policy; by shaping the built 
environment so that healthy activities and 
experiences can be integral to people’s 
everyday lives. Many factors will influence 
the long-term health and wellbeing of our 
communities, including the nature of the 
places that people live, work and spend 
leisure time. 
4.56 A masterplan, design code or design and 
access statement will be a requirement, 
to support planning applications for 
major development. The requirements for 
design codes and supporting statements 
will vary, depending on the scale and 
nature of the development and its 
location. 48
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
 Strategic Policy 2: Delivering Healthy, Well-Designed 
Development
 All development will achieve high quality design which will conserve and enrich the 
character and identity of the Borough’s towns, villages and landscape. To achieve this;
A. Development will be based on comprehensive design principles, derived from a 
contextual analysis of the site and its surroundings;
B. Development will maintain or enhance the sense of place and distinctive character of 
the locality, through taking account of the individuality of the Borough’s settlements, 
landscapes, buildings and heritage assets. 
C. Development will contribute positively to, and not detract from, the distinctive character 
of the immediate and wider landscape.
D. Development will take opportunities, wherever possible, to improve the public realm 
and minimise opportunities for anti-social behaviour and crime.
E. Development will be designed to be resilient to the changing climate by adopting 
sustainable design practices. 
F. High quality green and blue infrastructure will provide resilient hard and soft 
landscaping and integrate biodiversity enhancements.
G. The layout of new developments will be permeable and legible allowing for suitable 
access and movement for all users. Development will need to be designed to prioritise 
sustainable and active travel.
H. Where cycle and car parking infrastructure, utilities and services are required, it will 
be provided in appropriate and convenient locations for the users and designed to 
integrate positively. 
I. Major development will need to take account of, and respond positively to, relevant 
local and national design guidance and codes. Applicants will be expected to produce 
a masterplan, design code or design and access statement as part of the planning 
application depending on the nature and scale of development. 
4.57 Early discussion between applicants, 
the local planning authority and local 
community about the design of emerging 
schemes is important for clarifying 
expectations and reconciling local and 
commercial interests. Applicants should 
work closely with those affected by their 
proposals to evolve designs that take 
account of the views of the community. 
Applications that can demonstrate early, 
proactive and effective engagement with 
the community will be looked on more 
favourably.Next Steps
4.58 We are seeking comments on this policy. 
It is anticipated that additional detailed 
policies within the next stage of the Local 
Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2 will 
be set out as part of the Development 
Management policies. This is likely to 
include: 
• The quality of green infrastructure 
within new development; 
• The requirement and standard of 
private amenity for new development; Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 149
• Movement and access requirements; 
• More detailed guidance on the 
role and scope of design codes, 
masterplans and design and access 
statements;
• The role of public art;
• The role of the Local Plan 2040 in 
identifying Building standards; and 
• The role of the Council’s architecture 
panel, for determining the design of 
certain applications. 
4.59 The matter of securing good design and 
ensuring beautiful places has been a 
recent priority for the government which 
could result in more changes, for example 
to the NPPF. If in the future there are any 
changes to national policies surrounding 
design aspects; similarly, should any 
further design guidance accompanying 
or making changes to the national design 
guidance and national model design 
code be published, these would need to 
be taken account of.
4.60 Views on our design approach would 
be welcome at this stage, in order to 
help inform our policies in the Local 
Plan 2040, including whether it sets 
clear expectations for applicants and 
developers. 50
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Andover and Romsey  
Town Centres
4.61 Our town centres have evolved primarily 
as meeting places for people. They 
are places for social and economic 
interaction. The role of town centres is 
constantly changing to meet the habits 
and needs of their users. The aim of the 
Local Plan 2040 will be to ensure that 
Andover and Romsey town centres remain 
resilient and sustainable and fulfil their 
vital functions by being the focal points 
for their local communities. It is important 
we listen to our communities who use 
these town centres.
4.62 The greatest impact on town centres 
over recent years has been changing 
retail habits. The rise of on-line shopping 
has largely removed the necessity of 
town centre shopping. This has been 
exacerbated and accelerated recently 
by the Coronavirus pandemic, which 
forced people to stay at home and avoid 
crowded places. In recovering from the 
pandemic, and as a response to the 
convenience of on-line, town centres are 
being forced to re-evaluate their broader 
roles as places of entertainment and 
enjoyment, where people gather out of 
choice rather than necessity. 
4.63 Retail will always be an important core 
offer, as people will still choose to see 
and feel some of the goods they are 
buying. This will however be subject to 
major consolidation and diversification. 
The demand for retail floor-space has 
reduced significantly. Many towns are 
experiencing significant vacancies in 
units, and this in itself has a detrimental 
impact on the attractiveness of centres. 
4.64 As town centres struggle to attract people, 
two factors will be critical to address as set 
out in the two strategic policies proposed:
• The quality and diversity of activity that 
takes place within our town centres 
and • The quality, attractiveness and 
accessibility of the place 
4.65 Activity will include provision for food 
& drink, culture & entertainment, a 
diverse evening economy, health & 
community uses, civic functions as well 
as a consolidated and fit for purpose retail 
core.
4.66 Place-making will include creating 
attractive, flexible and safe public realm. 
This will include focussing on heritage, 
green spaces, movement, spaces for 
entertainment and spaces to rest. High 
quality, sensitive and coordinated design 
and use of materials, lighting, signage etc. 
will be essential.
4.67 In order to ensure that the town centres 
remain vibrant and relevant to their 
intended users it will be important to work 
with, and listen to all those who will shop, 
live, work or enjoy leisure time there. 
4.68 Supporting the role that town centres 
play at the heart of local communities, 
by taking a positive approach to their 
growth, management and adaptation 
is required by national policy. The 
Council prioritises town centres in its 
Corporate Plan. This includes the need 
for Andover and Romsey town centres to 
be accessible places where people live, 
shop, work and spend their leisure time. 
The Local Plan 2040 will reinforce this and 
include strategic and detailed policies 
to safeguard the role of the town centres 
and enable their ongoing adaptation and 
improvement.
4.69 Romsey and Andover are the two 
principal market towns in Test Valley and 
provide a wide variety of existing facilities. 
Both towns have established partnerships 
between residents, community groups, 
businesses and public bodies; these 
are Andover Vision and Romsey Future. 
The Council will continue to engage 
with Andover Vision and Romsey Future 
regarding the delivery of regeneration. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 151
4.70 In 2020, the Council adopted 
Regeneration Masterplans for both 
Andover and South of Romsey Town 
Centres. These masterplans set out 
ambitious visions for the future of 
both towns and propose a number of 
key developments that would ensure 
the centres remained attractive and 
sustainable. The delivery of both 
Masterplans will be a priority for the 
Council over the plan period. 
4.71 Two masterplans have been produced 
respectively for Andover and Romsey 
which seek to regenerate the town centres. 
Both have an emphasis on introducing a 
wider range of mixed uses within the town 
centres and were informed by extensive 
public engagement and consultation. We 
have used these objectives to inform our 
policies, and we will consider whether 
further detailed policies are required at 
the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2.
4.72 The objectives of the Andover masterplan 
are;
a) Social and inclusive: A town centre 
that is relevant to its local community. 
This is accessible to all, by foot, 
wheelchair, cycle, bus, rail or car. 
With a range of health services and 
community facilities to meet the needs 
of all its residents. With an affordable 
and diverse housing mix suitable for 
the elderly, young people and families.
b) Green and Ethical: A town centre that 
addresses the climate emergency, 
helping to increase its biodiversity and 
eliminate its carbon footprint. That 
recognises the importance of ethical 
and local trading. That prioritises 
walking and cycling and encourages 
electric vehicles.
c) Creative and Enterprising: Improved 
facilities and a modern campus for 
Andover College. A new and improved 
Lights Theatre in the centre of town, 
promoting local arts and creative 
organisations and supporting the 
evening economy. Sustainable 
workspace for small businesses and 
new office space.d) Unique and Independent: A town 
centre that values its heritage assets, 
placing the Guildhall and St Mary’s 
Church at the centre of civic and 
community life. That ‘curate’ local 
markets and events and designs 
bespoke stalls, seating and public art.
4.73 Delivery of the Andover Masterplan has 
begun. Detailed feasibility and design 
work is currently underway. This will 
determine the detailed cost and benefit of 
the measures put forward in the adopted 
Masterplan. This will ensure both that 
the investments are attractive and that 
the benefits to the local community and 
economy are safeguarded.
4.74 The objectives of the South of Romsey 
Town Centre masterplan are;
a) Make Romsey an attractive, vibrant 
centre of excellence including green 
spaces and wildlife corridors.
b) More green spaces in the area to 
enhance, protect and increase our 
natural environment, which includes 
wild animals and plants.
c) Well planned, connected and 
accessible infrastructure (including 
travel, access, public spaces, 
education, tech and business) 
with good flow for transport and 
pedestrians to encourage business 
and tourists.
d) Improved transport infrastructure to 
encourage a sense of community – 
with viable options for moving around.
e) Community hub and green spaces 
that bring people together (across 
generations).
f) Design an integrated transport and 
parking plan that includes walking, 
cycling, public transport and cars and 
think about all the different kinds of 
people coming into town (accessible 
parking, but still encourage bus use, 
especially by younger people).
g) Lots of things in town centre that are 
affordable and accessible for all, which 
everyone living in Romsey knows 
about and can take part in. 52
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 14.75 Delivery of the South of Romsey 
Masterplan has begun. Work is underway 
on the detailed design and costing of 
the public realm works and linkages that 
will provide the framework for future 
development. In addition, feasibility work 
is being procured for the development 
of the Bus Station site and the future 
potential reprovision of Crosfield Hall. 
These are the first two developments that 
will need to come forward as a first phase 
to unlock the remainder of the proposed 
development sites.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 153
 Andover and Romsey Town 
Centres Uses Strategic Policy
4.76 This strategic policy identifies the 
boundaries for the town centres and 
primary shopping areas in both Andover 
and Romsey. It is an NPPF requirement to 
identify these boundaries, and in doing 
so, we have reviewed the town centre 
and primary shopping area boundaries 
from the current Adopted Local Plan 
2029. The town centre boundaries for 
Andover and Romsey have both been 
revised to reflect the extent of both of 
the town centre masterplan boundaries. 
The primary shopping areas have been 
altered to reflect where the concentration 
of shops and other types of town centre 
uses are in both town centres. The revised 
boundaries are in accordance with 
national policy as explained in the Town 
Centre Topic Paper. 
4.77 This policy sets out the roles and 
appropriate uses of the three zones 
identified within our town centres. 
• Zone A is the primary shopping area 
and allows ground floor uses to 
support the retail core but also other 
uses to support active frontages and 
keep the towns busy throughout the 
day and evening which will improve 
the vitality and vibrancy of these areas.
 
• Zone B is the remainder of the town 
centres (outer town centre) which will 
support a wider variety of main town 
centre uses at ground floor level such 
as offices alongside residential uses. 
• Zone C comprises the upper floors 
across both Zones A and B. There will 
be flexibility to allow a range of uses 
similar to the uses in Zone B. These 
uses are supported at the upper floors 
in the primary shopping area (Zone A) 
because it does not impact the active 
frontage. 4.78 The policy supports the provision of 
homes within Zone B and C in the town 
centres of both Andover and Romsey 
recognising this can play a role in 
regenerating our town centres and 
provide a sustainable location for our 
residents through having easy access to 
services and facilities in these towns. This 
reflects the NPPF which recognises the 
role of residential development within 
town centres in ensuring the vitality 
of centres and encourages residential 
development in appropriate sites. 
4.79 The policy supports uses which would 
increase the tourism offer for both town 
centres, such as cultural and hospitality 
provision in both the primary shopping 
area (Zone A) and the outer town centre 
(Zone B) as this can increase visitor 
numbers through developing the Town 
Centres as destinations. 
4.80 The Council will require developments 
to demonstrate the masterplans 
have been taken into account. Both 
masterplans were developed through 
extensive consultation with the local 
community and other stakeholders, this 
should be continued as applications for 
development come forward.54

 Strategic Policy 3 Delivering Development  
and Regeneration in Andover and Romsey Town Centres 
 Development will promote an efficient and mixed use of land and buildings within Andover 
and Romsey town centres. Development will need to be provided in accordance with the 
Town Centre zones as set out in Table below and Figures 4.1 and 4.2. Development will 
need to: 
• Take account of the respective town centre Masterplan. 
• Demonstrate it forms part of the wider comprehensive redevelopment of the Town

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Delivering High Quality Design 
in our Town Centres
4.81 To continue to attract visitors and 
customers to our town centres, it is 
essential the regeneration creates well 
designed, attractive centres that are 
welcoming, vibrant and encourage 
activity. The effort invested in the design 
of buildings and public realm in Andover 
and Romsey Town Centres will help 
to ensure the long-term resilience and 
viability of the towns. 
4.82 This strategic policy will ensure new 
development in Romsey and Andover 
town centres will be designed in a 
sensitive way that both supports and 
encourages vibrancy while enhancing 
and protecting the historic and 
architectural qualities of the Town 
Centres. Schemes will be required to 
properly address and make full use of 
public realm opportunities. This will add 
value to our town centres and enhance 
their existing character and heritage 
assets. 
4.83 The Council is currently in the process 
of producing two pieces of guidance for 
Andover Town Centre:
• Public Realm Design Manual
• Design Guide for Developers and 
Occupiers
4.84 These two guides will set out detailed 
principles that the Council will expect 
to see in order to preserve the integrity 
of Andover Town Centre. However, we 
also do not wish to stifle creativity and 
progress through overly prescriptive 
design guidance. 
4.85 The Council will encourage positive 
engagement in the design process. 
Where appropriate developers should 
seek to engage the services of reputable 
architects and other design professionals. 
4.86 The historic cores of both Andover 
and Romsey are each covered by 
conservation areas. The protection and conservation of heritage assets and 
overall character of the town centre is 
important to encouraging increased 
visitors through an increased offering. 
Both conservation areas have recently 
approved Conservation Area Appraisals 
and Management Plans which alongside 
advice from the Council will be essential 
to ensure there are no adverse impacts on 
the historic character of the town centre 
as a result of any new development.
 Key Design Considerations
4.87 The Borough wide strategic design policy 
(Policy SP2) will apply to development in 
our Town Centres alongside this specific 
strategic design policy. This strategic 
policy identifies the design considerations 
that are specific to delivering the 
regeneration of the Town Centres. The 
emerging guidance for Andover (Public 
Realm Design Manual and Design Guide 
for Developers and Occupiers) will 
provide detailed guidance on the shape 
of development. 
4.88 To demonstrate good design has been 
a core consideration, there will be a 
requirement for developers to produce 
a well-researched and thought-out 
Design Statement to support planning 
applications for development within 
both Andover and Romsey town centres. 
The Design Statement will show how 
development will respond positively to 
its surroundings and how it is informed 
by its context and local character. This 
will include the demonstration of an 
understanding of that context and how 
the proposed development responds to 
it in terms of built form, building finishes, 
materials and styles, street patterns, 
history and land uses. 
4.89 Where this policy refers to development, it 
is only applications for new construction, 
or which result in a material change to a 
property that would apply. Applications 
for a change of use where there are no 
physical alterations being proposed, 
would not be required to complete a 
design statement.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 159
4.90 There is an important relationship 
between well-designed places and the 
health of local users. Access to nature 
and green spaces can make a significant 
contribution to the health and wellbeing 
of the community. Green spaces are 
important and provide numerous 
benefits. Green space, or the greening of 
urban landscapes through contextually 
appropriate use of trees or planting 
can also improve the attractiveness of 
town centres. The creation of new green 
space may not be appropriate in all 
circumstances. For example, in historic 
town centre streets where the sensitive 
enhancement of the heritage architecture 
may be the priority. Advice should be 
sought from the relevant Council officers 
before proceeding.
4.91 It is important to create and maintain 
active frontages ensuring visual 
engagement between those on the street 
and those on the ground and upper floors 
of buildings and the front of buildings are 
facing towards and open onto the street. 
This has the added benefit of creating 
natural surveillance onto the public realm 
and increasing the safety of the public 
throughout the day and into the evening.
4.92 A basic principle of active and attractive 
public frontages and private and 
defensible rears should be adopted. 
Service areas for both residential and 
commercial uses are essential for the 
operation of businesses and residences, 
however these should be hidden from 
view of the public realm. 
4.93 With regard to the inclusion or 
improvement of existing green 
infrastructure, advice from the Council 
will be required to provide the necessary 
guidance as to what sort of planting will 
be considered appropriate in a given 
location including new trees and green 
roofs and walls. It will also be important 
that such additions are sustainable, 
and that long term maintenance and 
management is identified and deliverable.4.94 It is important that public realm 
improvements and new public art 
installations are complementary to the 
character and local distinction of both 
town centres. Such improvements provide 
added value to the cultural, aesthetic and 
economic vitality of a community. The 
Council’s Public Art Strategy40 provides a 
framework and will be updated.
4.95 New residential uses within town centres, 
especially those permitted on upper 
floors within the primary shopping area 
may be subjected to increased noise 
which comes with being located within 
an urban location. The Council is seeking 
to encourage an evening economy 
which should be taken into consideration 
by developers when applications are 
submitted.

 Strategic Policy 4: Delivering High Quality Development in Town 
Centres 
 Town centre development in Andover and Romsey will be of a high quality and will have 
to take into consideration how it impacts on the existing character and setting of the town 
centre. In order to achieve this; 
a) Developers will produce design statements including a contextual analysis of the 
character area to show how elements including the historic environment, street 
patterns, building scale, size and placement, architectural styling and building materials 
have been reflected in their projects. 
b) Design statements will be produced in accordance with design guides and 
development briefs produced by the Council 
c) Contextual analysis will take account of the Andover and Romsey Conservation Area 
Appraisals and Management Plans. These documents identify views to, from and 
including, important buildings and landmarks and key views to be protected, listed 
buildings, architectural style, building materials and details and archaeology. 
d) Applicants will demonstrate that ground floors use within town centres will maintain 
attractive, functional and accessible active frontages in order to increase activity and 
promote a vibrant and safe environment throughout the day and into the evening 
through increased surveillance. 
e) Town centre development shall be visually attractive and use high quality materials 
creating welcoming places and enhance a well-connected, functional and high-quality 
public realm to minimise opportunities for anti-social behaviour and crime. 
f) Private amenity spaces and service areas will be well designed to ensure they are fit for 
purpose and kept functionally separate from public spaces. 
g) Existing green spaces within the town centres will be improved or enlarged unless 
any loss can be justified, and alternative provision provided. Contributions will be 
sought toward the creation of appropriate, sustainable new green spaces or green 
infrastructure and biodiversity, being integrated throughout the town centre. 
h) Contributions will be sought toward the production of high quality, strategic, integrated 
public art which will help to enrich the quality, culture, heritage and vibrancy of town 
centres. Installations will provide in accordance with the Public Art Strategy.
4.96 Early discussion between applicants, 
the local planning authority and local 
community about the design of emerging 
schemes is important for clarifying 
expectations and reconciling local and 
commercial interests. Applications that 
can demonstrate early, proactive and 
effective engagement with the community 
will be looked on more favourably. Next Stage
4.97 We are seeking your views on our 
strategic approach to Andover and 
Romsey Town Centres. It is anticipated 
that additional detailed policies within 
the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2 will be set out as 
part of the Development Management 
policies. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 161
4.98 Other policy matters that are likely to will 
be set out at Stage 2 are summarised 
below:
• Consider whether any site allocations 
are required to support the delivery of 
the regeneration of the Town Centres 
• Consider policies that minimise the 
impact from development that is 
located outside of our Town Centres 
having a detriment to the role of 
the Town Centres. This will be in 
accordance with national policy, in 
relation to sequential tests and impact 
assessments. 
• Consider whether more detailed 
design policies are required
• The role of public art and the Public Art 
Strategy
4.99 We will also investigate the potential 
introduction of Article 4 directions 
to remove certain national permitted 
development rights in the town centres. 
This specifically relates to the change 
from non-residential use to residential use 
to avoid the diminishing the role of the 
primary shopping area within Andover 
and Romsey which could undermine their 
vitality and viability.
4.100 Due to the changing nature of town 
centres and the impact from the 
Coronavirus pandemic, national guidance 
and evidence could evolve which 
will need to be reflected further in our 
strategic policies as plan preparation 
continues.62
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Delivering Infrastructure 
4.101 The delivery of infrastructure is important 
to determine how places are shaped, the 
environment is enhanced and protected, 
and how quality of life in existing 
communities is maintained and improved. 
It also helps ensure that development has 
a positive effect on the social, natural and 
built environment. 
4.102 Infrastructure is used to describe facilities 
and services needed by people in order 
to meet their daily needs and ensure a 
good quality of life. This includes public 
infrastructure such as roads, cycle ways, 
footpaths, schools, leisure centres and 
areas for recreation. It also includes 
utilities such as supply and mains 
connections to water, drainage, electricity 
and telecommunications to homes and 
businesses.
4.103 New development places additional 
pressure on existing infrastructure 
therefore it needs to mitigate its impact. In 
other words, new development needs to 
contribute to providing greater capacity 
to existing infrastructure either through 
the delivery of new or enhancement to 
existing services and facilities.
4.104 The NPPF requires the Council to align 
infrastructure and growth by identifying 
and making sufficient provision for 
infrastructure to support development 
over the plan period and mitigate the 
impact of development. 
4.105 Th is Local Plan 2040 will set out how 
the Borough will develop over the plan 
period, identifying the number of homes 
and jobs needed and where they, as 
well as all other forms of development, 
will be accommodated. The aim of 
this policy is to mitigate the impact of 
development and ensure development 
has a positive effect, including addressing 
climate change, and thus it is important 
that infrastructure is secured alongside 
development. 4.106 Consultation comments highlighted 
concerns from the community that 
new development should not increase 
pressure on existing facilities and services. 
Infrastructure should be delivered 
early to support the integration of new 
development with existing communities.
4.107 There are various types of infrastructure. 
These are broadly grouped into the 
following categories. 
• hard infrastructure that includes 
connectivity such as pedestrian 
and cycle routes, roads, 
telecommunications, electricity and 
water supply. 
• green infrastructure includes 
protecting and enhancing biodiversity, 
green spaces for recreation, access 
to the countryside and preserving the 
Borough’s landscape. 
• social infrastructure extends to, but 
is not limited to, sports and leisure 
facilities, education, community 
facilities and healthcare. 
4.108 Of emerging importance is infrastructure 
that enables climate change to be 
addressed and carbon emissions to 
be reduced. Climate change is a key 
objective for the Local Plan 2040 and 
signals an evolving picture in the type 
of infrastructure that will be required as 
new technologies emerge and national 
policy on carbon reduction and neutrality 
is shaped. The Council will seek to secure 
infrastructure to help residents live more 
sustainable lives in combating climate 
change.
4.109 The provision of infrastructure has a role 
to play in protecting and enhancing Test 
Valley’s unique landscape and features 
such as chalk streams, through the 
provision of green infrastructure.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 163
4.110 The delivery of infrastructure can be 
provided through various means and a 
range of providers. Developers may be 
required to provide certain infrastructure 
directly, such as a community centre, on 
the development itself. In other cases, 
it may be appropriate for a financial 
contribution to be made to the Council to 
deliver or contribute to the enhancement 
of infrastructure locally, such as a leisure 
centre. 
4.111 There are instances where some 
infrastructure providers will make 
provision themselves such as water 
and electricity supply companies. 
The Council is committed to working 
with these providers to understand 
their requirements and align their 
strategies and plans with the evidence 
underpinning the Borough’s plans for 
growth and subsequent infrastructure 
requirements. However, there are other 
infrastructure providers that are unable 
to provide specific details on capacity of 
infrastructure until details of schemes are 
available at a later stage in the design of 
a scheme, for example at the planning 
application stage. 
 Delivering Infrastructure 
Requirements
4.112 This strategic policy sets out our approach 
to ensuring the timely delivery of 
appropriate infrastructure to mitigate the 
impact of development. It encompasses 
all types of infrastructure in all locations 
across the Borough. This includes types of 
infrastructure delivered on-site and off-site 
and those delivered either by the Council 
or other organisations through the use of 
developer contributions or other sources 
of funding. 
4.113 Alongside on-site delivery of infrastructure 
and securing monies through developer 
contributions to deliver infrastructure, 
the Council does charge a Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL)41. CIL is a locally 
set levy charged per square metre of net 
additional floor area of new development. 
41 Add reference to CIL Charging Schedul e CIL charges vary depending on the type 
and location of development within the 
Borough. The purpose of CIL is to mitigate 
the impact of development or enable 
development to come forward. CIL will be 
used towards facilitating infrastructure in 
line with the Council’s corporate priorities. 
4.114 While this policy identifies the strategic 
approach to infrastructure delivery, further 
policies regarding our site allocations will 
need to identify site specific infrastructure 
potentially detailing their scale, timing 
and where necessary, how relevant 
infrastructure should be delivered. This 
will be set out in the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2.
4.115 Development will need to provide for 
the necessary on-site infrastructure and 
where appropriate off-site infrastructure 
requirements. Reflecting the scale and 
nature of some types of infrastructure 
that the Council has secured, such as 
Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace 
(SANG) land and public open space, 
the Council need to ensure the long-
term maintenance and management are 
secured to ensure the benefit of the land 
remains available in the long term. The 
developer will need to factor these costs 
in. 
4.116 Infrastructure will need to be phased in 
tandem with the progress of the build out 
of the development. This is to ensure that 
as the development comes into use and 
occupations increase, there is sufficient 
and appropriate infrastructure that meets 
their needs. 
4.117 Some development sites may be required 
to provide infrastructure of a scale and 
cost that may affect the viability of the 
development. We will be undertaking 
a viability assessment of all of the Local 
Plan 2040 policies to inform our next 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 
2 to ensure the policies will not impact 
the viability of development and are  
deliverable. 
 64
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1
 Strategic Policy 5: Delivering Infrastructure
 To mitigate the impact of development on infrastructure, development will be required to: 
a)  Provide for the necessary on-site infrastructure requirements and where appropriate off-
site infrastructure requirements; 
b)  Directly provide infrastructure and/or a financial contribution which will be secured 
through a legal agreement; 
c)  Provide a suitable mechanism, subject to approval by the Borough Council, to ensure 
the long-term maintenance and management of infrastructure, such as a financial 
contribution or a management plan;
d)  Ensure the timely and phased delivery of infrastructure to serve development, especially 
where new development is dependent on this infrastructure to support it. 
 Next Steps 
4.118 We are seeking comments on this policy. 
It is anticipated that the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 
2 will include other policies setting out 
more detail about particular infrastructure 
types and potentially how they need to 
be delivered, as part of the Development 
Management Policies. Also, we will 
consider whether further strategic policies 
are required to secure necessary social 
and green infrastructure. 
4.119 Detailed matters that are likely to be set 
out in the Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 
Stage 2 are:
• Identification of infrastructure 
requirements to support our site 
allocations in delivering sustainable 
development. This will be identified in 
our site allocations policies supported 
by the Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
• Policies on healthcare infrastructure, 
cycling and walking, education, 
sustainable transport and connectivity, 
parking standards, leisure and 
recreation, green infrastructure, 
biodiversity and nature recovery, and 
utilities; • Policies regarding retention of services 
and facilities; and
• Further policies may be required 
that support the delivery of new 
technologies to enable the move to 
net zero carbon emissions to combat 
climate change. 
4.120 Additionally, this policy could evolve as 
the Local Plan 2040 develops. There were 
changes proposed to national policy and 
guidance in the Government’s White 
Paper ‘Planning for the Future’ in August 
2020 regarding how infrastructure is 
funded. We will keep this under review as 
we progress the Local Plan 2040. 
4.121 As part our site assessments, the capacity 
of existing provision will be assessed 
alongside identifying the need for new 
infrastructure to meet the development 
needs of the Borough. This will be set out 
in an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). 
Working with relevant stakeholders and 
infrastructure providers is fundamental to 
the co-ordination, phasing and funding of 
development and infrastructure. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 165
4.122 The Council has an adopted Infrastructure 
and Developer Contributions 
Supplementary Planning Document 
(SPD) which is currently being updated. 
This sets out precise requirements for, 
or contributions towards, the delivery of 
infrastructure. On adoption of the Local 
Plan, this SPD will apply in providing more 
detailed information on the mechanisms 
for securing infrastructure however the 
Council will review whether a further 
update is required. 
 66
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Sustainable Transport 
and Movement
4.123 Encouraging opportunities for cycling 
and walking in Test Valley, particularly for 
shorter journeys and as an alternative to 
car journeys is key to maintaining healthy 
lifestyles and reducing congestion and 
carbon emissions. As much of Test Valley 
is rural, this can be challenging to achieve 
alongside balancing the need for housing.
4.124 National policy requires Local Plans to 
identify sustainable patterns of growth. 
This will support promotion of sustainable 
travel by locating development where 
transport infrastructure exists or can be 
delivered and where use of new transport 
technologies can be enabled. Local 
Plans should set out policies on how 
development can be designed to make 
movement and connectivity sustainable 
while avoiding or mitigating the impact of 
traffic on the environment. 
4.125 It is anticipated that transportation and 
movement in the South East will evolve 
considerably over the plan period, 
particularly in response to the challenges 
of climate change. It is recognised that in 
the UK, transport is the biggest contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions and the 
primary vision of Hampshire County 
Council’s emerging Local Transport Plan 
(L TP4) is a resilient and carbon neutral 
transport strategy. The County Council 
will need to work with Transport for South 
East on any improvements to the strategic 
network.
4.126 There is a shift in emphasis in national 
policy around how local government can 
enable infrastructure that supports active 
travel. The Department for Transport 
published its vision42 alongside technical 
guidance43, for better cycling and walking 
infrastructure that is placed at the centre 
of transport, place-making and health 
policies. Hampshire County Council are 
producing a series of Local Cycling and 
42 Set out in Gear Change – A bold vision for cycling and walk-
ing 2020, Department for Transport
43 Set out in Cycle Infrastructure Design – Local Transport Note 
1/20, Department for Transport Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIP) for 
Southern Test Valley and the Andover 
area. These will identify opportunities 
for investment to improve local cycling 
and walking connections and other 
infrastructure (such as cycle storage) 
within a specific geographical area to 
encourage safe and attractive active travel 
for shorter journeys. 
4.127 Managing patterns of growth will focus 
development at our more sustainable, 
and accessible locations. Our spatial 
strategy focuses development at Andover 
and Romsey which have the widest 
range of facilities along with distributing 
development across a larger range of 
settlements in our rural areas.
4.128 Sustainable growth in our rural areas can 
help to sustain public transport services, 
and other facilities and services, such as 
shops, through increased populations 
using these services. This can also reduce 
the need and impact from travel. As a 
predominantly rural Borough, getting 
around by car is likely to be a necessity for 
many to access work, education, services 
and leisure facilities. The spatial strategy 
will ensure development is located where 
access to services/facilities to meet the 
daily needs of our rural population can be 
undertaken by sustainable modes.
4.129 The impact of delivering sustainable 
transport and facilitating active travel cuts 
across many of the Local Plan objectives 
and will be referred to in many of our 
strategic policies. 
4.130 The Council will continue to work with 
various stakeholders and partners, 
to deliver infrastructure. Public 
transport and highway infrastructure, 
including pedestrian and cycle links, 
is predominantly the responsibility of 
Hampshire County Council, National 
Highways, and other transport 
organisations, such as Network Rail. 
The Council will be working with these 
organisations to identify infrastructure 
that is needed to enable the overall levels 
of need identified in the Local Plan 2040 
to be delivered sustainably. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 167
4.131 We will be identifying draft site allocations 
in the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2. Detailed transport 
modelling will take into account the 
wider impacts of traffic from development 
to inform the site assessment and 
identification of draft site allocations. We 
will also consider access to sustainable 
transport that minimises the number and 
length of journeys. Also, whether new 
infrastructure is needed or enhancement 
to existing infrastructure to facilitate more 
sustainable modes of travel. 
4.132 The next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2, will include a 
series of detailed policies that cover 
transport infrastructure, movement and 
connectivity, as part of the Development 
Management policies. The need 
for strategic policies on promoting 
sustainable transport will also be 
considered reflecting consultation 
outcomes and the preparation of the 
detailed policies.
4.133 Detailed policy matters that are likely to be 
set out at the next stage of the Local Plan 
2040 are summarised below.
• Strategic and site-specific transport 
infrastructure requirements. This 
includes the requirements for the 
regeneration of Andover and Romsey 
Town Centres and our site allocations. 
• Provision and requirements of new 
technologies that support low-carbon 
modes of travel. During 2022, electric 
vehicle charging points, will be 
required on all new build homes and 
offices.
• Detailed design requirements 
for the layout and design of new 
development, such as segregated 
cycle ways and pedestrian priority 
areas, to maximise opportunities for 
active travel and reduce reliance on 
the private car. • Provision and requirements for 
adequate and safe parking in town 
centres and within new development 
with reliable access to charging 
points for plug-in or ultra-low emission 
vehicles.
• Detailed parking standards for 
residential and non-residential 
development. 
4.134 In addition, we will consider whether there 
are any proposals that are in the emerging 
Local Transport Plan 4 or LCWIPs that 
require inclusion in the Local Plan 2040. 
We will continue to work with Hampshire 
County Council on these matters 
including opportunities to identify and 
protect sites and routes which could be 
critical to widen transport choice as well 
as consideration of the need to retain the 
Bargain Farm, Nursling Park & Ride facility 
which is set out in the current Adopted 
Local Plan 2029. 68
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Meeting our Housing Needs
5.3 Meeting future housing needs 
appropriately is one of the greatest 
challenges for the Local Plan. The plan 
should in doing so provide for the right 
number of homes, of the right type and 
in the right locations. There is also a need 
to ensure that as part of the overall scale 
of provision, that the needs of different 
household groups are met, including for 
affordable housing and for those with 
specialist needs. 
5.4 The policies in the Local Plan 2040 will 
need to identify the number of new 
homes to be planned for as a housing 
requirement and make sufficient provision 
to meet this need. 
5.5 Increasing overall housing delivery is 
one of the Government’s key priorities 
for the planning system and a target has 
been set to raise housing completions to 
deliver 300,000 homes per annum each 
year in England by the mid-2020s. Test 
Valley has made a significant proportional 
contribution towards this in recent 
years given our local circumstances as 
a predominantly rural area and size of 
our settlements. We have consistency 
exceeded our current local housing 
target.  Chapter 5:  
Meeting our 
Needs
 Introduction
5.1 A key part of delivering a sustainable 
pattern of development, is meeting the 
development needs of our Borough. 
National policy is clear that we have to 
identify a framework for addressing our 
needs and make sufficient provision to 
meet this. This will meet our longer term 
needs for our community. This includes 
our needs for housing, employment, retail 
and other uses. 
5.2 This stage of the Local Plan 2040 
identifies our housing needs. It sets 
out our current position on identifying 
our employment needs and the needs 
of the Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople communities. We are 
currently undertaking evidence to 
identify these needs. We will be assessing 
whether we need to identify needs for 
retail, leisure and other uses, for the next 
stage of the Local Plan 2040, Regulation 
18 Stage 2. 
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 169
5.6 Over the last five years the Council has 
delivered just over 4,300 homes and 
over 1,300 affordable homes. Housing 
delivery meets the housing needs of 
the community and supports delivery 
of associated infrastructure. In 2019 
Test Valley was ranked 31 out of 326 
local authorities in England for housing 
delivery. 
5.7 National planning policy requires us 
to meet our housing needs to support 
the Government’s objective of boosting 
supply. This should be informed by 
a local housing need assessment to 
determine the minimum needed. A 
housing requirement figure should then 
be established for the plan area which 
shows the extent to which identified 
housing need can be met over the plan 
period. A sufficient supply and mix of sites 
should then be identified to meet this 
requirement. 
 Housing Need
5.8 Since the current Local Plan was adopted 
in 2016, the Government has amended 
national policy and published a standard 
method44 to calculate our local housing 
need. This provides the starting point 
and minimum amount for establishing 
our housing requirement. The standard 
method takes account of the number 
of new homes that are needed to meet 
demographic changes in the Borough 
and then applies an affordability 
adjustment to take account of prices 
signals and to boost housing numbers. 
5.9 To inform and evidence our housing 
requirement, two studies are included 
within our evidence base; a new Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) and 
a Housing Market Area Study (HMAS). The 
SHMA provides evidence regarding our 
overall housing need, affordable housing 
needs and specialist housing needs. The 
HMAS provides evidence regarding the 
housing market areas that exist in the 
Borough. 
44 This uses national projections on the future number of 
households in each local authority and data on how afford-
able housing is compared to local earnings5.10 The SHMA sets out our local housing 
need assessment45, and this concludes 
using the standard method that our 
local housing need figure is currently 
541 homes per year from 2020 onwards, 
which would apply until the end of the 
plan period. The local housing need 
assessment is provided in Appendix 2.
5.11 The SHMA has also assessed whether 
there are any exceptional circumstances 
that exist to justify an alternative 
approach to using the local housing need 
assessment as our housing requirement. 
Such approaches would be based on 
growth funding, strategic infrastructure 
improvements or addressing unmet 
housing needs from surrounding areas, as 
set out in national policy.
5.12 The SHMA concluded none of these 
approaches currently apply to Test Valley 
and therefore there are no exceptional 
circumstances. At present there is no 
evidence of any unmet housing need 
in neighbouring local authority areas; 
this will need to be kept under review. 
For the purposes of the Sustainability 
Appraisal, we don’t consider there are any 
reasonable alternatives to assess.
5.13 The Council is currently seeking to meet 
the local housing need figure in full 
through identification of sufficient supply 
of sites in the next stage of the Local Plan 
2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. We will 
need to monitor whether future evidence 
indicates that an alternative housing 
requirement is needed, or if evidence 
emerges that the standard method figure 
cannot be accommodated. It should also 
be noted that there are variables used 
in calculating the standard method and 
therefore the current figure of 541 homes 
per year could change over the course of 
preparing the Local Plan 2040.

requirement for the plan period 2020 -

  Housing Market Areas
5.15 One of the key decisions regarding 
the strategy of the Local Plan 2040 is 
how the provision of new housing is 
distributed. This includes how it can 
be broadly divided across different 
Housing Market Areas (HMAs). This also 
concerns the balance between the scale 
of development in Andover, Romsey and 
the other settlements, as informed by the 
Settlement Hierarchy. 
5.16 The Council has had a long-standing split 
regarding housing needs recognising the 
distinct geography of Test Valley and that 
it contains two distinct housing market 
areas (HMA). This is set out in the current 
Adopted Local Plan at Policy COM1. A 
HMA is a geographical area defined by 
household demand and preferences. 
It reflects the key functional linkages 
between places where people live and 
work. In Test Valley, there is a strong 
distinction between Andover and the 
northern part of the Borough, and Romsey 
and the southern part of the Borough 
which has a close relationship with 
South Hampshire. In meeting housing 
need it has therefore been appropriate to 
consider the two areas separately. 5.17 The HMA study has reviewed our 
approach set out in the Adopted Local 
Plan and recommends a continued split 
with two separate HMAs, but with a 
revised boundary. The revised boundary 
takes account of the wider extent of the 
HMAs on a regional and sub-regional 
basis. This recommends a boundary split 
around the route of the A30 (with a best fit 
approach based upon parish boundaries). 
Figure 5.1 shows this.
 Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 171
Figure 5.1: Northern and Southern Housing Market Areas by Parish
72
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 15.18 It is therefore proposed that a split of 
the housing requirement between the 
two HMAs remains and that this should 
continue to be based upon the amount of 
population within each HMA. This would 
be consistent with the Government’s 
local housing need assessment which is 
derived from a demographic basis.
5.19 As set out in Table 5.2, this would provide 
a split of 57% of the housing requirement 
being met in Northern Test Valley and 
43% in Southern Test Valley. This split is a 
change from the 67:33 split in the current 
Adopted Local Plan, which takes into 
account the change in HMA boundary.5.20 The HMA Study also concludes that the 
two HMAs could be further split into four 
sub areas reflecting the more urban and 
rural areas of the two HMAs46. The role 
of these sub areas will be considered 
further as we begin to think about how 
we distribute the number of homes 
throughout the Borough in the next Local 
Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
5.21 It is proposed the HMAs would be used 
as separate areas for the purpose of 
calculating the five-year housing land 
supply, continuing the long-standing 
approach which is used for the current 
Adopted Local Plan.

 Strategic Policy 6: Housing Provision
 The housing requirement for the Borough is a minimum of 10,820 homes, to be delivered 
over the plan period of 2020 to 2040. The housing requirement is split between the 
Northern and Southern Test Valley Housing Market Areas as identified in Figure 5.1 and as 
shown in the table below. For the purposes of housing land supply, each Housing Market 
Area will have its own supply position.

  Housing Supply
5.22 We have assessed how much housing 
supply is needed to meet our housing 
requirement. This is undertaken by 
assessing how much existing housing 
supply we have committed as of 1 April 
2021, against the housing requirement. 
This will begin to identify the residual 
amount of housing that we will need to 
make provision for in the Local Plan 2040. 5.23 Table 5.3 provides this assessment, both 
borough wide and for the respective HMA 
areas. These supply figures provide a 
snapshot at this current time and there will 
be variables within these figures which we 
will need to further investigate to ensure a 
sufficient number of homes is planned for 
and to maintain a resilient housing land 
supply position.

Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 15.24 Table 5.3 demonstrates the approximate 
residual housing supply will be a total of 
4,560 homes reflecting the plan period 
up to 2040. This currently shows our 
existing housing supply delivers over 50% 
of our housing requirement. This means 
we will need to allocate, as a starting 
point, sufficient sites to meet this residual 
housing supply figure. 
5.25 We will consider whether we need to 
allocate for a higher number of homes 
above our minimum housing requirement 
in order to provide for greater resilience 
in maintaining a sufficient supply of sites. 
We will need to make sure we provide for 
a sufficient supply of homes to meet our 
needs otherwise, there is an increased 
risk that homes could be permitted on 
sites not preferred by the Council and our 
residents, including as a result of planning 
appeals. The Council will continue to 
monitor our housing supply position as 
the preparation of the Local Plan 2040 
progresses and how this affects the 
residual requirement.
 Next Steps
5.26 We are seeking comments on this policy. 
The next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2 will include a series 
of more detailed policies that will support 
the overarching approach, as part of the 
Development Management policies. 
Additionally, there will be new strategic 
policies on the types of housing to be 
provided, where considered necessary, 
reflecting progression of evidence. These 
strategic matters along with the detailed 
matters are explained in further detail 
below. 5.27 The distribution of future housing will 
be addressed at the next stage of the 
Local Plan 2040 through setting out 
our draft site allocations. Account will 
also be made for the opportunity of 
provision of housing to be delivered 
through Neighbourhood Plans (and other 
community led development) particularly 
to meet the housing need of individual 
local communities. The need for housing 
requirements figures for designated 
neighbourhood plan areas will also be 
considered. 
5.28 As mentioned in the Introduction, there 
are potential risks to delivery of the 
Plan, including housing. We will need 
to consider contingency mechanisms 
if monitoring indicates that delivery is 
falling short. Alongside this, we need to 
ensure the Local Plan 2040 has sufficient 
flexibility and resilience to respond to 
delivery risks. Contingency measures will 
be set out in the next stage of the Local 
Plan 2040. 
 Affordable Housing
5.29 Providing affordable housing to meet 
local needs is a key priority for the Council 
and our communities. The delivery of 
affordable housing has in recent years, 
exceeded the Council’s target of 200 
per year. There is support for the current 
approach of seeking up to 40% affordable 
housing from larger market developments 
(15 homes or more). In September 
2020, the Council adopted an updated 
Affordable Housing Supplementary 
Planning Document (SPD) to provide 
further guidance on how the Adopted 
Local Plan policy will be interpreted.
5.30 The new SHMA has assessed the need 
for affordable housing and for housing 
to meet the needs of different specific 
household groups, as set out in national 
guidance. This identifies a higher need for 
affordable homes per year, than identified 
in our Adopted Local Plan 2029. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 175
5.31 Before we can identify a threshold 
for delivering affordable housing to 
help address this need, we need to 
update our evidence on the viability of 
delivering affordable housing. We will 
be commissioning a study to review 
this, which will be part of the viability 
assessment on all of the proposals in the 
Local Plan 2040. This will take account of 
the work on future infrastructure provision 
and other policy requirements which 
apply to new development. 
 First Homes
5.32 First Homes is a new tenure of affordable 
low-cost home ownership. At least 25% 
of all affordable homes secured through 
developer contributions should now be 
First Homes. In October 2021 the Council 
adopted an Interim Policy Position on First 
Homes. A specific policy for First Homes 
will be considered for inclusion in the next 
stage of the Local Plan 2040 as part of the 
review of our affordable housing policy.
 Rural Housing
5.33 National planning policy provides for 
Rural Exception Sites (RES) for the 
development for affordable housing 
where this would not otherwise be 
permitted. The Adopted Local Plan 2029 
includes a policy on RES, Policy COM8. At 
present, only schemes of 100% affordable 
housing are permitted, although Councils 
can consider whether an element of 
market housing should also be included. 
This will be reviewed for Regulation 18, 
Stage 2
5.34 The Council will also consider the 
inclusion of a policy on First Home 
Exception Sites (FHES) which will only 
apply to certain parts of the Borough48. 
The Government has decided not to take 
forward the proposals for Entry Level 
Exception Sites and only First Home 
Exception Sites will be provided for in 
policy. Rural Exception Sites (RES) for 
affordable housing will continue to apply 
in the rural area where FHES will not. 
48 Areas outside of the Designated Rural Area, National Parks 
and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty5.35 Community led development can 
also deliver rural housing through 
Neighbourhood Plans or through the 
Adopted Local Plan Policy COM9. 
For Regulation 18 Stage 2 we will 
consider the role which community led 
development can play in meeting future 
housing need taking account of the 
spatial strategy, settlement hierarchy and 
housing distribution. 
5.36 For Regulation 18 Stage 2, we will also 
consider a review of the specific policies 
for rural housing including those for rural 
workers and replacement dwellings. 
  Housing Mix
5.37 The SHMA also assessed the size, type 
and mix of housing to meet local needs 
within different areas of the Borough. It is 
important to seek a mix of housing which 
reflects future housing need, and to take 
account of the composition of the existing 
housing stock. 
5.38 For Regulation 18 Stage 2 we will 
consider whether a specific policy is 
needed on the mix of homes, for both 
private and affordable housing, informed 
by the outcomes of the SHMA with regard 
to the number of bedrooms and type of 
housing. 
 Specialist Housing
5.39 For Regulation 18 Stage 2 we will 
consider whether specific policies are 
needed to meet the particular housing 
needs for example for older people and 
those who required specialist housing 
and housing for particular household 
groups. 
1.40 The Council will also consider whether 
the Local Plan 2040 should include a 
policy on internal space standards (higher 
national described space standards) and 
accessibility standards for new housing. 76
Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 1 Gypsies, Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople
5.41 We have a duty to meet the needs of all 
our communities, including the needs of 
different groups in the community. This 
includes the needs of Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople communities. 
We do have a number of Gypsy, Traveller 
and Travelling Showpeople sites in Test 
Valley. We will seek to ensure we develop 
a fair and effective strategy to meet future 
needs. 
5.42 National planning policy for Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople is 
set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller 
Sites. Its overarching aim is to ensure fair 
and equal treatment for travellers in a way 
that facilitates the traditional and nomadic 
way of life of travellers while respecting 
the interests of the settled community. 
5.43 To achieve this aim and provide a fair and 
effective strategy, we need to undertake 
an assessment of the Borough’s need 
which will inform our pitch targets for 
gypsies and travellers and plot targets 
for Travelling Showpeople. These targets 
will be set out in a Local Plan 2040 
strategic policy. To meet these targets 
and maintain a supply of Gypsy, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople’s sites, we will 
need to make appropriate and sufficient 
provision of land which will require 
identification of sufficient sites, in line with 
the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites. 
5.44 The Council previously intended to 
prepare a specific Gypsy and Traveller 
Development Plan Document (DPD), 
which was to be produced separately to 
the Local Plan 2040. However, changing 
national guidance and the need to further 
update the evidence meant it was not 
possible to progress with a separate 
Gypsy and Traveller DPD as quickly as 
hoped. Reflecting this, the Council’s 
planning policies for Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople will be 
included in this Local Plan 2040 rather 
than a separate DPD. 5.45 We have commissioned consultants 
ORS to prepare a Gypsy, Traveller and 
Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Assessment, to be undertaken in 
accordance with national policy. This will 
ensure we have robust and up to date 
evidence on our level of need which 
will inform our pitch and plot targets 
respectively. As this evidence is being 
undertaken, it is premature to include 
a policy at this stage. The evidence is 
currently being finalised and therefore 
we will have a policy identifying targets 
in the next stage of the Local Plan 2040, 
Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
5.46 Once the Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople Accommodation 
Assessment is finalised, we will seek to 
address the need through identifying 
sufficient provision. Depending on the 
type and level of need, we will seek to 
review various options of meeting this 
need, including consideration of whether 
existing sites can accommodate needs 
through intensification or reorganisation 
of sites, identification of new sites and 
whether vacant plots can be brought back 
into use. 
5.47 If needed, we will undertake further 
evidence to assess these options. 
Our approach to identifying sufficient 
provision will be set out at the next stage 
of the Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 
Stage 2 along with a criteria-based policy 
for determining planning applications 
for unknown or windfall need for Gypsy, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
sites. This will involve reviewing the 
current Local Plan Policy COM13. Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 177
 Meeting our Economic Needs
5.48 There is a strong and robust local 
economy in Test Valley. This is key to 
delivering prosperity and quality of life. 
However, the impact of the Coronavirus 
pandemic is affecting the way in which 
we work. Inevitably the pandemic has 
impacted the national economy and we 
will need to support recovery. 
5.49 National policy emphasises the role of 
the planning system in helping to create 
an environment in which businesses can 
invest, expand and adapt. A key part of 
delivering sustainable development is 
building a responsive and competitive 
economy, including by ensuring the 
appropriate availability of land to support 
economic growth, innovation and 
improved productivity.
5.50 The Borough is easily accessible by 
both road and rail to: London, the West 
Country, the Midlands and the south 
coast. This makes it an attractive location 
for businesses wishing to take advantage 
of this and access to these wider regional 
markets. Test Valley does not therefore 
form a single economic area but is rather 
made up of distinct parts. 
5.51 The Borough has experienced significant 
employment and business growth 
in recent years. We have delivered 
36.25 hectares of new employment 
development over the period 2015/16 to 
2020/2149. This has included significant 
growth at Andover Business Park, 
Nursling and Adanac. This is an indicator 
of confidence in the local economy and 
that of continued economic growth. 
5.52 The Local Plan 2040 will continue to 
support economic growth. We will need 
to set out our anticipated employment 
needs and approach to meeting this. This 
will need to take account and be flexible 
to the changes in the structure of the 
local economy as it continues to evolve 
particularly in response to the recovery 
from the pandemic. 
49 This breaks down to 15.0 hectares delivered in the south of 
the Borough and 21.25 hectares delivered in north of the 
Borough.5.53 There are growing trends for flexible 
working, including increased working 
from home, and increases in self 
employed/smaller businesses leading 
to a need for smaller and more flexible 
accommodation. 
 Future Employment Needs
5.54 We have undertaken the first step in 
assessment our employment needs. The 
Employment, Economic and Commercial 
Needs Study has been prepared jointly 
through the Partnership for South 
Hampshire (PfSH). The study covers 
the whole of Test Valley. It has split the 
assessment between the north and south 
of Test Valley50. 
5.55 This study uses the methodology 
set out in National Planning Practice 
Guidance (PPG). The methodology 
gives significant weight to recent past 
levels of completions, particularly in the 
last five years. This is further impacted 
by the nature in which employment 
development is delivered which is ‘lumpy’ 
i.e., a large factory or warehouse is usually 
completed in one go in a single year. 
Much of this is meeting a wider sub-
regional need. This results in a forecast 
of future economic needs which ‘bakes 
in’ this recent level of growth and will 
inevitably reflect a need that meets 
sub-regional need along with our own 
local need. The Study acknowledges 
this. It concludes the forecast for Test 
Valley may not be realistic or be able to 
be accommodated based on this trend-
based methodology. 
5.56 This results in a very high level of 
forecast future growth which is high in 
comparison to both past needs and those 
needs identified for the other PfSH local 
authorities, where there has been a lower 
scale of delivery. Table 5.4 sets out the 
level of economic land needs from the 
Study. 
50 Areas relate to the split in the Adopted Local Plan, with STV

51 Areas relate to the split in the Adopted Local Plan, with STV 
also corresponding to the area of Test Valley within South 
Hampshire and which is covered by the Partnership for 
South Hampshire (PfSH). 5.57 Reflecting the outcomes and conclusion 
of the Study, we consider further 
assessment and testing of our need 
figures is required. This will provide 
evidence to either confirm the outcomes 
of the Study provide our local need figure 
or this figure needs amending reflecting 
the limitations of using a trend-based 
model for Test Valley. In undertaking 
this further technical work, we will work 
with relevant neighbouring authorities, 
in considering whether any of this need 
meets a wider sub-regional need. 
5.58 This will potentially cover; level of 
commercial demand for Test Valley, 
market attractiveness and suitability 
of existing and potential sites, and the 
balance between the proposed housing 
requirement and the number of jobs this 
would support52. 
52 The draft Strategic Housing Market Assessment concludes 
around an additional 424 jobs per annum would be support -
ed by delivering 541 homes per annum.5.59 We will need to assess whether we have 
sufficient existing supply of employment 
land to meet our economic needs. 
Table 5.5 sets out our current supply of 
employment land. If we need additional 
supply of employment land, we will need 
to undertake a site assessment. The 
Strategic Housing and Economic Land 
Availability Assessment 2021 provides a 
starting point for this assessment.Draft Local Plan 2040 Regulation 18 Stage 179

Next Steps 
5.60 We are seeking comments on this 
approach to establishing our employment 
land requirements. The assessment 
and testing of our employment land 
requirement will inform the next stage of 
the Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 
2. A series of more detailed policies, as part 
of the Development Management policies, 
will be considered for inclusion in the 
Local Plan 2040, Regulation 18 Stage 2. 
5.61 Other policy matters that will be set out at 
Stage 2 are summarised below:
•	Following further assessment of our 
employment land needs, we will 
conside r whether further supply of 
employment land is needed. If so, 
we will need to undertake a site 
assessment. We will also consider 
opportunities to integrate this 
with housing, through mixed-use 
developments. 
• Consider whether there are policies or 
proposals in the Enterprise M3 Local 
Economic Partnership’s (LEP) Local 
Industrial Strategy (LIS) together with 
the LIS of the Solent LEP as relevant to 
the southern part of the Borough, that 
need inclusion in the Local Plan 2040. • Approach to protection of employment 
land and sites
• Consider our approach to continue 
to support our prosperous rural and 
visito r economy. This includes approach 
to re-use of buildings in the countryside 
and essential need for rural workers to 
live permanently at or near their place of 
work 
•	Consider our approach to support skills 
and training from new development, 
building on our existing approach. The 
Council has taken a dual approach 
of seeking employment and skills 
plans in the construction sector and 
where appropriate secured financial 
contributions towards supporting local 
workforce development from major 
commercial developments. 80
