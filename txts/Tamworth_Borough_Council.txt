 4 CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 
 
Context to the Tamworth Local Plan 
 
1.1 The Planning and Co mpulsory Purchase Act 2004 (as amended) requires the  
preparation of a development plan for each Local Planning Authority area in England.  
The Tamwo rth Local  Pl an will be  t he main do cument of Tamworth’s developmen t plan and it will set out  the policies and guidance for new development in Tamworth 
up to 2031. It sets out the vision and spatial planning strategy for Tamworth, it states 
the ambitions and principles to guid e the future of the area and allocate s parts of the town for new homes and employme nt land to 2031  required to meet local community 
and business needs . It also includ es policies to ensure that appropriate supporting 
infrastructure is delivered and the a rea’s built a nd natural environment i s protected 
and enhanced. The Local Plan aims to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to th e 
changing circumstances during its life.  
1.2   The Council has worked with a wi de range of stakeholder s, local com munities, the 
Local Strate gic Partnership and developers sin ce 2007 to p roduce the Local Plan.  
The Local Plan has been produced during a time which has seen significant reforms 
by Government to the planning system. 
 
1.3  The Nation al Planning  Policy Fra mework (March 2012)  sets out guidance fo r 
achieving sustainable development. Emphasis has been placed on the importance of 
ensuring that Local Plan policies co ntribute to achieving sustainable development, in  
terms of promoting sustainable e conomic growth. The Tamworth Lo cal Plan ha s been prepared to be consistent with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). 
 1.4  The Tamworth Local Plan (2006- 2031) was adopted in  2016 and r eplaces th e 
previous Local Plan (adopted in 2006). Further detailed guidance will be included in a Design SPD, De velopment Briefs  and Masterplanning, which will support the  implementation of the Plan. Planning applic ations will be d etermined in accordance 
with this Local Plan unless othe r material considerations (includin g the NPPF) indicate otherwise. 
 
How to read this Document 
 1.5  The Local Plan is divided into a number of cha pters, including a spatial portrait and  
vision for Tamworth. It sets out the  key charact eristics of th e area and identifies the  strategic issues and challenges that the Local Plan seeks to address. The vision sets out the type of place Ta mworth should becom e by 2031, taking into account existin g 
plans and strategies produced by both the Council and its partners. The vision results in a set of 12 spatial priorities which are set out in relation to the key themes to which they relate. 
 1.6 The policy chapters ar e summaris ed in four over-arching themes: a prosperous 
borough, st rong and vibrant neighbourhoods,  a high quality environment and a 
sustainable town. These chapters include policies to guide how the spatial vision and 
spatial priorities will be achieved in practical terms.   Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

Chapter Chapter Summary  Chapter Policies 
Chapter 3 – 
Spatial Strategy The spatial strategy is central to the Local Plan. It pro vides a guide to ho w the spatia l vision and strat egic ob jectives, 
namely ho w a prosperous 
town, stro ng and vibrant neighbourhoods, a high quality environment and a sustainable town will be achieved in 
practical terms. The role of the 
spatial strategy is to set out how much development there will be, broadly where it will go, when it will take pla ce and, where possible, wh o will 
deliver it. This chapte r includes p olicy 
SS1 (The Spatial Strategy for Tamwo rth) and p olicy SS2 (Presumption in F avour 
of Sustainable  
Development). 
 
Chapter 4  – A Prosperous Town This chapt er looks t owards delivering a prosperous Tamworth and involve s planning positively for sustainable economic growth  and focussing investment in 
the town centre a nd the 
network of defined local and neighbourhood centres.  New employment land allocated in accessible locations an d the 
protection of existing 
employment areas will ensure the retention of jobs and  attract new  jobs to Ta mworth which will support  the reduction of high levels of out-
commuting currently 
experienced in Tamworth. Directing investment in existing centre s and  accessible employment  sites 
will reduce the need to travel  
and make the most eff ective use of Tamworth’s limit ed land supply. This cha pter includes policies EC1 (Hierarch y of centres fo r town c entre uses), EC2 (Supp orting investment in Ta mworth town centre), EC3 (Pri mary 
and Secondary Fronta ges), 
EC4 (Supporting investment  in local an d neighbou rhood centres), EC5 (Culture and Tourism), EC6 (Sustainable 
economic g rowth) and EC7  
(Employment areas). 
Chapter 5 – Strong and Vibrant 
NeighbourhoodsDelivering new housing,  of the 
appropriate type, tenure and  cost and  in accessible,  
sustainable locations whilst 
focussing on areas requiring  regeneration will deliver strong and vibrant neighbourhoods. This cha pter includes policies HG1 (Housing), HG2 (Sustainable urban 
extensions), HG3  
(Regeneration priority 
areas), HG4 (Affordable  housing), HG5 (Housing mix), HG6 (Housing density) and HG7 (Gypsies,  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 6 Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople). 
Chapter 6  – A High Quality  Environment Delivering a high quality environment will i nvolve protecting and e nhancing 
Tamworth’s network of green 
and blue  infrastruct ure to provide sufficient opport unities for recreation and biodiversity. Through positive planning and 
understanding of the 
significance of Tamworth’s heritage assets, development will achieve high quality design that protect s and enh ances Tamworth’s historic character. This cha pter includes policies EN1 (Landscape  character), EN2 (Green belt), 
EN3 (Open space and green 
and blue links),  EN4 (Protecting and enh ancing biodiversity), EN5 (Design of new development), and EN6  
(Protecting the historic 
environment). 
Chapter 7  – A Sustainable 
Town Ensuring a combination of 
strong retail centres, 
accessible housing  and 
employment sites an d the  regeneration of existing developed sites lay the  foundation to deliver a  
connected, sustain able town. 
Making the  most of existing transport links, addr essing congestion and improving  public tran sport will ensure 
Tamworth’s centres, 
employment sites and housing  sites are  access ible by different methods of tra nsport and reduce reliance o n the private car. Maximising energy 
performance, renewable 
energy ge neration, reducing  flood risk,  preventing harm from pollution and providing accessible community facilities 
will help to deliver sustainable 
development. This cha pter includes policies SU1 (Sustainable 
transport network), SU2 
(Delivering susta inable transport), SU3 (Climate  change mitigation),  SU4 (Flood risk and water 
management), SU5  
(Pollution, ground controls and minerals and soils), SU6 (Community facilitie s) and SU7 (Sport and recreation). 
 1.7 The Implementation and Monitoring Chapter al ong with the  monitoring framework in 
Appendix D set out a se ries of monitoring indicators and targets against each policy to measure their delivery. The indicators w ill be monitored regularly and if it is shown  
that targets are not being achieved then contingency measures, also se t out in th e framework, will be implemented. Th e chapter also includes policy IM1 (Infrastructure 
and develo per contributions) which  brings together infrastructure requirements for 
new development set out through the Local Plan.  
 
1.8 The Local Plan’s success will depend on effective implementation of the policie s. 
Whilst the Council will play a major role  in implementin g the policies through its 
statutory planning functions, imple mentation will also rel y on a ran ge of partne r organisations including the Tamworth Strategic Partnership, Staffordshire County 
Council, sta tutory service providers, develope rs, Register ed Social L andlords an d Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 7 infrastructure providers amongst others. As such, an Infra structure Delivery Plan is 
included setting out what infrastructure is required and when, how it is going to b e delivered and by whom. Each ch apter is also accompa nied by a t able sett ing out  
what actions are needed to implement the p olicies and  who is responsible f or 
delivering them, as well as a timescale. 
 
Local Plan Evidence Base a nd Sustainability Appraisal 
 1.9 The Local P lan is closely related to the Tamworth Sustaina ble Community Strategy 
and associated strategic objectives which were produced by the Tamwo rth Strategic 
Partnership, a multi-age ncy partnership committed to improving the quality of life o f 
local people. 12 spatial priorities have been defined, which concentrate the vision into key specific issue s that need to be  addressed. A key element of the Local Plan  is how it will be delivered. 
 
1.10 The Tamwo rth Sustaina ble Commu nity Strategy is focussed on delivering specif ic 
strategic priorities. One  of it s key challenges is to de liver susta inable growth in  
Tamworth’s local economy and promote Tamworth as a Place.  
Its vision is of: “One Tamworth, Perfectly Placed” 
      (The people)         (The place) 
 Below this sit two strategic priorities: 
 
Strategic Priority 1: To Aspire and Prosper in Tamworth  
Primary Outcome: To create and sustain a thriving l ocal econo my and make 
Tamworth a more inspirational and competitive place to do business through: 
 Raising the aspiration and attainment levels of young people; 
 Creating opportunities for business growth through developing and usin g skills 
and talent; 
 Promoting private sector growth and create quality employment locally; 
 Branding an d marketing  “Tamworth” as a  great  place  to “live life to th e full”; 
and 
 Creating the physical and technological infrastructure necessary to support the 
achievement of this primary outcome. 
 
Strategic Priority 2: To be healthier and safer in Tamworth 
Primary Outcome : To create a sa fe environment in which local pe ople can rea ch 
their full potential and live longer, healthier lives through: 
 Addressing the causes of poor health in children and young people; 
 Improving the health and well being  of older people by supporting the m to live 
active, independent lives; 
 Reducing the harm and  wider consequences of  alcohol ab use on individuals,  
families and society; 
 Implementing ‘Total Place’ solution s to tackling crime and ASB in designated 
localities; 
 Developing innovative early interventions to tackle youth crime and ASB; and 
 Creating an  integrated approach to  protecting  those most vulnerable in our 
local communities. 
 
1.11  Tamworth Strategic Partnership has identified a numb er of factors, which may 
require targeting to achieve these strategic priorities: 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 8  Reduce the levels of u nemployment by reducing the nu mber of jobseeker 
allowance claimants and in particular youth unemployment; 
 Reduce alcohol misuse by tacklin g both the inappropriate availabilit y and 
consumption of alcohol; 
 Improve the location, quality, quantity, and types of housing; 
 Reduce the numbers of residents who live significantly more time in ill or poor 
health to the national average; 
 Improve the  quality, qu antity and stock o f suitable land and premises for  
economic development (enable expansion, start-ups and inward investment); 
 Develop a modern, future proofed infrastructure for residents and visitors; 
 Improve the capacity and generic skills and awareness of parents; 
 Reduce harm and inequalities caused by tobacco consumption; 
 Increase aspiration levels; 
 Increase the levels of physical activity; 
 Provide flexible, integrated and effectiv e public services that meets the n eeds 
of Tamworth’s communities; 
 Improve positive nutrition choices and promote healthy eating; 
 Increase self esteem levels particularly in vulnerable groups. 
 
1.12  The Local Plan’s spat ial vision is close ly aligned to T amworth’s Sustainable 
Community Strategy’s vision and priorities. The Local Plan policies and proposals will 
help deliver the spatial elements of the above strategic priorities. 
 
1.13 In order to make sure that the right issues are addressed and that the effects of th e 
strategy will have on T amworth are understood, an evidence base to  support the  
Local Plan has been prepared. This is made up of research and analysis, understanding the views of the local communit y and obtai ning expert and technical information from statutory bodies and agencies.

 9 CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND: SPATIAL PORTRAIT, 
VISION & OBJECTIVES 
 
Spatial Portrait 
 
Location, Physical Character and History 
 
2.1  Tamworth has ancient origins, first documented in the late 7th century and by the late 
8th century was one of the principal seats of the Mercian kingdom, and established as 
the Saxon Mercian Capital. It is lo cated in the  south-eastern corner of Staffordshire  bordered by Warwickshire to the south and east. Situated 18 mi les from the Birmingham conurbation and on the edge of the West Midlands Greenbelt, Tamworth Borough is only 12 squ are miles in  size  makin g it one  of t he smallest  in England.  Geographically the Borough is related to the neighb ouring distr icts of  North  Warwickshire and Lichf ield. Socia lly, Tamworth has many links with  Birmingham 
having received overspill in the 196 0s and 1970s which resulted in the  development 
of a series of planned housing est ates with associated ce ntres, green spaces and community facilities. Figure 2.1 illustrates this pattern of development in Tamworth.  
2.2 Consequently, Tamworth is a borough of cont rasts, being a modest market town until 
the 1960’s when it became an o verspill town  for Birmingh am and former farmland 
was transformed into a series of  planned neighbourhoods and resulted in substantial urban growth. The separate villages of Ami ngton, Wiln ecote and Dosthill were incorporated into the  expanding urban area and significant clearance a nd redevelopment of the t own centre saw the historic core  fr agmented and reshape d although the medieval street pattern is still more or less intact.  
 2.3 The surviving medieva l street patt ern in the t own centre dates from the Mercian 
period and was established by the Norman p eriod. It is well preserved within th e historic core and despite experiencing substantial redevelopment and c hange in the 1960’s/1970’s many hi storic build ings hav e survived. Beyond the town centre, 
several small settleme nts are also of known medieval origin, namely Amington,  Amington Green. Boleh all, Dosthill,  Glascote and Wilnecot e. These  se ttlements all expanded from the late 18
th century onwards in  response to the growt h of industry,  
which was mainly coal and clay and coincide d with the construction  of the canal  networks. 
 
2.4 The earliest  suburbs started devel oping to the north, we st and east of the town 
centre in t he 19
th century, as evidenced by a n umber of large detache d and semi-
detached houses on Upper Gunga te, Comberf ord Road, Lichfield Ro ad, Glascote  
Road and Amington Road. 
 
2.5 Tamworth Borough is almost exclusively urban with limited areas of countryside 
within the B orough boundary. The post war de velopment of the Borough, combined 
with natural features (including rivers, flood plains, biodiversity sites) has resulted in a unique legacy in the form of an ext ensive network of acce ssible green infrastructure which extends beyond the urban area and is complemented  by blue infrastructure in  
the form of the canal and river corridors. Th e close pro ximity of Ta mworth to t he 
countryside and the green and blue infrastru cture throughout Tamworth provides  opportunities for biodiversity as well as delivering benefits arou nd increased  community cohesion, education, regeneration and improved health and wellbeing. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

 2.6 There are two main river catchments in Tamworth, the River Tame  and the River 
Anker (a tributary of the river Tame), with a third smaller  catchment of the Kettle  
Brook. The majority of Tamworth Borough lies in the valley  of the Rive r Tame. The  bedrock geology is domi nated by Tri assic mudstones and sandstones, which, being relatively soft have eroded over thousands of years to form the wide flat valley of th e River Tame and its tributaries. Recent glaciation also influences the landscape seen today with deposits of glacial sands and gravels covering most of the river valley and 
unique to Tamworth are a series of coal measures. Much of the town's essent ial 
infrastructure lies within the Flood Zones and large areas of both re sidential an d 
industrial properties are at risk.  
2.7 There are t wo canals located in Tamworth: th e Coventry Canal, which runs through  
the area, a nd the Birmingham and  Fazeley Canal, which has its junction with the Coventry Canal on the southern border of the Borough. Liaison with t he Canal and River Trust indicated that there are  no recorde d incidents of breaches or any other flood risk instances associated with these canals. 
 
2.8 The location of the Norman Castle at the poin t where the Rivers Tame and Anker 
meet in the centre of Ta mworth is a focal point for the town. The Castle Grounds are a well-used and highly valued area of recreation, open space and sports facilities for residents a nd visitors t hat compli ment other important faciliti es in the town. The historic cor e of Tamworth surrounds the Ca stle, set out along a medieval st reet pattern. Much of the town centre is covered by conservation area designations.  
 2.9 Tamworth h as a long history as a successful market town and expe rienced hig h 
levels of prosperity in the 18
th Century when a  considerab le number of Georgian 
buildings w ere constru cted, including the Town Hall and Almshouses built by Sir Thomas Guy. Many of the buildings built during this time remain intact and contribu te 
to the strong character of the town centre. Fro m the 1960’s through to  the 1990’s, in 
conjunction with the in crease in population as a result of t he overspill designat ion, major redevelopments in the town centre took place such as the squa re next to St  Editha’s Church, the Middle Entry Shopping Centre, the former Gungat e Precinct and 
Ankerside Shopping Centre. Despit e these recent interventions and some sporadic infill develo pment, muc h of the historic fabri c of the town centre remains intact 
including the medieval street pattern. The recent discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard 
near Tamworth has created an opportunity for t he Borough to exploit its connectio n to Mercian history and increase its tourism role. 
 2.10 The town centre contains three conservation are as and a large number of listed and 
local listed buildings, many of whic h are key local landmarks. Tamwort h Castle and  
the Assembly Rooms are recognised attractions and it is important that all aspect s of the town centre are enhanced t o provide a welcoming and attr active visit or destination. Archaeolo gical remains are also present, the most obvious bein g Tamworth Castle which is a schedu led monument as well a s being a gr ade I listed  building, but there are other less obvious remain s including parts of Offa’s Dyke an d 
a medieval Deanery W all which su rvives in the rear yards of properties on Church 
Street and Lower Gungate. There is also potential for below ground archaeology and 
any development that in volves excavation in  th e vicinity of  known remains will be 
required to undertake appropriate investigation.  
 
2.11 Smaller conservation areas centred  on the core of the former villages of Dosthill, 
Wilnecote and Amington Green are now also part of the urban area due to the town’s 
expansion. Amington Hall Estate is the only semi-rural conservation area, located to  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 12 the north east of the urb an area and separated f rom Amington by open countryside 
and farmland. 
 
Population and Housing 
 
2.12  The popula tion of Ta mworth has tripled since the post-war years due to th e 
relocation o f Birmingham residents as a re sult of the ov erspill agre ement. The  overspill development raises ch allenges fo r the Borough, in particular t he preservation of Tamworth’s history,  historic core and ident ity, which has become  
overpowered by the  1960s and 1970s plann ed housing  estates. Many areas, in 
particular the social housing areas, contain housing stock which is sh owing signs of  stress, whilst being dated in design and uniform in appearance. As Tamworth ha s 
grown from its original h istoric core, su rrounding rural hamlets and villages such as Wilnecote and Amington have been enveloped into the urba n structure of Tamworth. 
This means that the to wn, which was largely confined to the historic core and riv er 
system, now spreads out into what was the rural hinte rland. Abso rbing various hamlets and villages has created small pocke ts of histori cal interest amongst the  newer housing and industrial develo pments, the most important of which have bee n recognised by various conservatio n area designations. T amworth's urban area is 
continuous with Fazele y and Mile Oak, both of which are situated  outside th e 
Borough in Lichfield District.  
 2.13 The population of Tamworth in 2012 was approximately 77,118 and projected figures 
based upon this Plan suggest Ta mworth will experience a population growth of approximately 7,717 pe ople. An ag eing popula tion requirin g increasin g care and  
support will need to be accommodated. Additionally house price inflation has led to a 
housing market that first time buyers find difficult to access. Affordable housing is 
also an issue that needs to be addressed to ensure that the young are retained within the Town. Tamworth’ s housing stock is skewed towa rds semi-detached and  detached housing, which does not necessarily reflect the needs of both younger and 
older groups. 
 
2.14 Tamworth’s housing m arket is rela tively self-contained, b ut shares strong ties wit h 
settlements surrounding Tamworth within other local authority areas. Ta mworth has links to Lichfield District and North Warwickshire and to a lesser extent Birmingham, demonstrating the historical links with the city.   Economic Activity and Vitality  
2.15 Part of a  network of strategic centr es encircling Birmingham, Tamworth is the focus  
of development that meets the needs of the  town and provides for the immediate 
rural catch ment. This extends into Lichfiel d Di strict, North  Warwickshi re and up t o 
South Derbyshire and includes a network of villages which rely on Tamworth for their services an d facilit ies. It is tradi tionally a working cla ss town with its roots in manufacturing until the late 1990s when the town experienced decline in what was a 
vibrant and buoyant employment sector. Em ployment restructuring is underway t o 
diversify the employment offer and move  away fro m the de pendency o n 
manufacturing. Whilst manufacturing is still important, the majority of jobs are now in  
the service industry. 
 2.16 The Council is a key partner in the Greater Birmingham an d Solihull Local Economic 
Partnership and works close ly with busine sses and ne ighbouring authorities t o 
capitalise on Tamwo rth’s stren gths to pro mote and deliver lo cal econ omic 
development.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 13 2.17 Tourism is one of the largest and fastest growing industrie s in the cou ntry. It is the 
largest gro wth industry in Staffordshire, gen erating £98 7 million per annum and 
providing the equivalent of over 40,000 full time jobs. The total expenditure 
generated by visitor trips to Tamworth in 2010 i s estimated to be £50 million with the  
major receiving sectors of all tourism spend being retail a t £19 million (35%) an d catering at £17 million (31%). It is estimated that from th e tourism expenditure in Tamworth of £50 millio n, a total  o f 1,362 jo bs are supported by to urism spen d, although not all of th ese jobs are f illed by Tamworth reside nts (Tamworth Touris m Economic Impact Assessment, 2011).  
 2.18 The town centre remains a pla ce where people want to live, work, visit and shop 
including spending time at leisure destination s and visiting the cultural and tourism offer. It fun ctions as a  service hu b for Tamworth, offering a range  of service s including banks, building societies, estate agents and health services and is a focu s 
for arts an d culture based events. It also  contains a significan t number of  
independent specialist r etailers, le isure operators and a th riving outdoor market,  which toget her create a distinct ‘T amworth’ of fer. Howeve r, it faces a  number of  threats to its vitality primarily arising from the changing nature of shopping and the  proximity to  large out of centre r etail parks including V entura, Jolly Sailor and  
Cardinal Point, along with Tame Valley in the east of Tamworth.  
 
2.19 The town centre performs relatively well but could improve with better re presentation 
from multiple retailers a nd leisure  o perators an d a more a ttractive environment to  enhance its role as a service hub and a focus for independent, specialist retailers. An improved town centre offer, particularly focussing on specialist retail and restaurants, 
combined with its status as a tourism and cultural hub is req uired to counter-balance 
the attractions of the out of centre shopping parks. These retail areas are  predominantly travelled t o by car causing conge stion and an unpleasan t pedestrian environment. As such, the Council is work ing to bring fo rward key development opportunities within the town centre together with proposals to improve the linkages 
between the town centre and the out of centre retail areas to attract more people t o 
visit the town centre.  
2.20 The rise in the popularity of internet shoppin g, together with the p reference of 
national ret ailers for  lar ger, purpose built stores and the  r ecent econ omic climat e, which has depressed consumer e xpenditure, poses challenges for tr aditional to wn 
centres such as Tamworth’s. In  particular, the tendency for town centr e units to b e 
smaller, as a result of restriction s created by the historic street patterns an d buildings, cr eates both challenges and opportunities which  require a co-ordinated approach between the Council and its partners. 
 
2.21 The popularity of the out of centre r etail areas has increased to such an extent that  
Tamworth is one of  the few towns where comparison expen diture in its out of centre 
retail areas is double th at of the town centre - with the town centre only attractin g 28% of comparison goods spending by Tamworth residents in contrast with the out of centre retail areas receiving 58% (Tamworth Town Centre and Retail Study, 2014).  It 
is predicted that this market share will increase at least in the short term as a result of 
recent development in the out of centre retail parks and the lack of new development 
in the town centre. However the rise of internet  shopping and its potential impact on out of centre retail is no t yet fully understood an d may have implications beyond the  short term.   
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 14 Community, Health and Education 
 
2.22 Healthy livi ng indicator s for Tamworth residen ts show low participation levels in  
physical activity, higher than average levels of  obesity, lower life expectancy, a less 
healthy diet and specific wards with high levels of multiple deprivation.  
 
2.23 The Council is working  to foster strong relatio nships with  the community and t o  
develop a long term programme of community engagement and participation, offering 
support and advice on education, training and funding for community projects. The 
health of people in Tamworth is varied compared to the  England average. Whilst life 
expectancy for both men and women is similar to the England average, it is 8 year s 
lower for men and 7 ye ars lower for women in the most de prived areas of Tamwort h than in the  least deprive d areas. Estimated adult healthy ea ting and ob esity levels  are worse than the England average. Levels of teenage pregnancy and GCSE 
attainment are also worse than the England average. 
 
2.24 Within the t own there are significan t pockets of  both affluence and deprivation; the  
latter espe cially in Glascote, Amington, Belgrave and  Stonydelph. There are  
concentrations of unemployment, poor health, poor literacy and numeracy, anti-social 
behaviour and poverty.  According  to the I ndices of Multiple Deprivation (2010),  
18.1% of the population live in areas that are amongst the most deprived in England. 
The Glascote ward of Tamworth h as the highest level of income deprivation in Staffordshire, where 4 5% of the  adult population is living in an  in come deprive d family. 
 
Transport 
 
2.25  Tamworth’s compact urban for m provides good op portunities for transpo rt 
accessibility, particular ly to and fr om the town centre wh ere the tow n’s retail and  leisure services are predominantly located.  
 2.26 Tamworth has good connection s to the nat ional transp ort network. The A5(T ) 
provides links to Cannock, Nuneaton, the M42  and the M6 Toll. The A51, A513 and  A4091 local routes also run north-south thro ugh the Borough. Tamworth’s close  proximity to  the nation al motorwa y network and to Birmingham makes it a n accessible place to live and work. It is estimate d that 50% of the working populatio n 
out-commute each day to work and 69% of employed residents drive to work which  
does not contribute to a sustaina ble lifestyle  where services, facilit ies, jobs a nd housing are all accessible without having to use the car for long journeys.   
2.27 Tamworth rail station is located in close pr oximity to the town centre, whilst Wilnecote 
station is to  the south of the town centre near Two Gates and within t he proposed Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor. Both rail stations are located on the Cross Country line between Birmingham / Tamworth / Burton upon Trent / Derby / Nottingham, and  Tamworth station is also located  o n the West  Coast Mainline. There is sign ificant passenger and freight demand along both corr idors, although there is no dedicated local service on the Cr oss Country line so demand is cat ered for by stops on  th e 
Nottingham to Birmingham service and by less frequent  stops of lo nger distan ce 
services. Passenger numbers at Tamwort h station incr eased by nearly 25.5 % 
between 2006/07 and 2 012/13. This incre ase is li kely to b e attributable to the  more 
frequent local services on the West Coast Main Line. 
 
2.28 Staffordshire County Council (SCC) currently has limited direct input  into the ra il 
industry. Train Operating Companie s (TOC’s) are private companies, paid to run an 
area’s services by cen tral government. The Government also pays Net work Rail t o Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 15 manage and maintain t he rail netw ork, and the  ORR (Office for Rail r egulation) t o 
regulate Network Rail a nd TOC’s. SCC theref ore works with TOC’s, Network Rail and other local authorities to invest in the rail network and improve connectivity. Both 
Tamworth and Wilnecote stations are currently managed by London Midland.  
 
2.29 Tamworth is served by a core bus network of local and inter-urban routes to Lichfield, 
North Warwicksh ire and the West Midlands conurbation, supported by community transport se rvices. According to 2 011 censu s data 4% o f resident s in Tamworth  travel to work by bus and 2% by train. 
 2.30 Tamworth has an extensive cycle n etwork covering 30 miles within a 1 2 square mile 
area, including a networ k of of f-road links. Accor ding to t he 2011 census data, only 2% of residents in Tamworth cycle to work and 9% walk.   
2.31 Despite the  high levels of commut ing and low use of pu blic transpo rt, evidence 
suggests that Tamworth’s transpor t related carbon emissions are one  of the lowest  per population in England which may be a result of its compact form and sustainable development pattern focused aroun d connecte d neighbour hoods and centres. This poses a challenge for future development to ensure this trend continues.
 
 
Issues & Challenges  
2.32 Tamworth is expected to  experience a high level of housing and economic growth in 
order to meet the ne eds and a spirations o f the town  and creat e sustain able 
communities. However, opportunities for expansion of the town are constrained by a tight administrative boundary, en vironmental constraints su ch as the flood plain and  the Green Belt and sections of th e highway n etwork limiting site cap acity. With the  exception of the su stainable urban extensions, a proportion of Tamworth’s hou sing 
and employment opportunities will come forw ard within the  existing urb an area with 
any remaining need being met within adjoining local authorities.  
 
2.33 Based upon the evidence base that has been collected and the characteristics of the 
area, the key issues and challenge s that need to be addressed through the Local  
Plan are outlined below: 
 
Housing 
 
2.34  Tamworth is projected to experience a significa nt level of p opulation growth and this 
is likely to result in a higher proportion of elderly people residing in the town.  
 2.35  Further, the supply of new housing has failed t o keep up with rising d emand which 
has created an imbalance in the market. This has created affordability problems for first time buyers who have been priced out of the housing market, as well as increasing the demographic imbalance in the area. 
 2.36  The Local Plan sets out an objectively assessed housing need for 6,250 homes. The 
key challenge for the strategy will be to increase the delivery of and the  right type o f housing, in order to create sustainable and mixed communities in the area. 
 
2.37  Key evidence:

Economic 
 
2.38  The local economy of Tamworth i s relatively stable and is expected to experience  
growth during the life of the Plan . It is currently diversifying from its tradition al reliance on  manufacturing to other employment sectors including business a nd 
financial services. It is relatively affluent with a low unemployment rate. 
 
2.39  However, th is masks th e fact that  employment is largely low-paid, un skilled and 
requiring few qualifications. To so me extent t hese factors also expla in the housin g affordability problems in the area. There are also pockets of deprivation that exist 
(low income, poor qualification levels and poor health) within Tamworth, mostly within the post w ar planned estates, some of which are among the most deprived in  England. 
 2.40  To address these issues, the Local Plan sets out that there is a need f or a minimum 
of 32 hectares of additional employment land from 2006 to 2031. The key challenge  
will be to en sure that th e right types, quantity a nd locations of employment land are  
allocated in order to attr act employers and investment and help the town to fulfil it s true economic potential. 
 2.41  There is also a need to regenerate and dive rsify the to wn centre and ensure it 
remains vibrant and viable.  To overcome this challenge, the Local Plan is seeking to increase th e delivery of new homes, leis ure d evelopment, convenience retail f loor 
space (2,900 sqm between 2021 a nd 2031) and comparison retail goods floor space (7,600 sqm after 2021) , together w ith supporting infrastru cture in the  town centr e. This will he lp to create  a sustaina ble and prosperous fu ture for Tamworth. An  additional challenge is to ensure that a successful mix of uses can be achieved which 
is fit for the future in terms of its quality and sustainable use of resources. 
 
2.42  Another key challenge  is to ensure development delivers benefits to all o f 
Tamworth’s communiti es to create strong and vibrant communiti es. Tacklin g deprivation and social exclusion through improving health and educational attainment 
and access to employment is therefore a key objective.

 17 Environmental 
 
2.44  Tamworth is expected to experience high levels of growth. This is constrained by the 
scarcity of development land due  to policy restrictions such as the  Green Belt an d administrative constraints arising from Tamworth’s tightly drawn  bo undaries an d planned neighbourhoods as a consequence of it s status as an expanded town. There 
are also extensive areas of flood plain, particularly around the town centre and to the south, areas of biodiversity importa nce and the historic nat ure of most  of the town  centre. 
 2.45  The key challenge will be the need to balance growth with the protection of natural  
and built assets to ensure it will not have a detrimental impact on the quality of life for Tamworth’s communities. Furthermore, it will b e important to ensure th at the policies within the strategy do not contribute to, or increase the effects of climate change.

Infrastructure  
2.47        The expected growth of the town is likely to incre ase pressure on, and in crease the 
demand for investment  in additional infrastructure (highways, open spaces, an d social community facilities ). This could potentially have a detrimental impact on th e 
well being of existing and future communities living within Tamworth. For instance, this is an issue for transport infrastructure which is unable to cope with the high levels of car usage during certain times of the day an d experiences congestion hot spots across Tamworth, particularly along the Gungate corridor, within the town centre, the out of centre shopping parks and some junctions along the A5. 
 
2.48  The key c hallenge for  the Local Plan is therefore to ensure that the existing  
infrastructure is utilised  efficiently and new infrastructure is delivered in location s 
where there is demand, in order to support the creation of sustainable communities and the growth of the town.  
 
2.49 This will be  achieved t hrough the measures in the Local Plan policies, su ch as 
ensuring traffic generating uses are placed in accessible locations to reduce the need 
to travel and carbon emissions. Delivering growth and future development will require the provision of adequate transport  links within  and outsid e of Tamwo rth; between homes to employment activity, town and lo cal centres, community facilitie s and t o 
centres and facilities in neighbouring towns, villages and beyond. Linked to this is the Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

Vision 
 In the context of deliveri ng the Council’s overall corporate vision for the Borough, as 
'One Tamworth Perfectly Placed', t he following  Local Plan  vision add s the spatial 
dimension and seeks to  set the futu re spatial direction for T amworth to address the issues and challenges identified.  
Vision - One Tamworth, Perfectly Placed 
 
By 2031  sustainable T amworth will have a  dynamic economy compri sing of a 
vibrant town centre consisting of a th riving retail and leisure offer supported by a 
local town centre community whic h complements its role as a sub  regional 
tourism hub. It will have a strong, distinctiv e identity equally known for its historic 
assets and  history as the Mercian Capital as for it s safe and  thriving  
neighbourhoods. The green and blue linkages which connect the town centre  
with its neighbourhoods and emplo yment areas will assist to project an image o f 
the Borough as ‘urban green’. 
 
Its economy will be thrivi ng as a result of improved communi cation links with the 
Greater Birmingham area. Investment in accessible employment areas will have 
provided an environment that en courages n ew and existing bu sinesses to  
remain and  locate in Tamworth. J ob opportunities and employment growth in  
business and professional services as  well as environmental and building 
technologies and general manufacturing will have helped to build on the town’s  
employment strengths and minimi sed outward commutin g. The tourism and 
leisure sectors will have continued to prosper.  
 
Investment in health and education  facilities and improvements to ope n spaces 
and leisure and sports facilities, combined with greater outdoor opportunities and 
ensuring development is located in sustainable locations, will have help ed make 
the town healthier and safer whilst improving qualification and aspiration levels. 
 
A total place approach to regeneration in those areas of most need  will have 
tackled pockets of  dep rivation by improv ing a ccess to bo th employment and  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 19 housing w hilst improving the general en vironment. Other vulnerable 
neighbourhoods will ha ve received housing le d regeneration to improve the  
quality of the stock and  support the vitality of e xisting local and neighbourhood  
centres. 
 
New house building will have responded to local need by increasing th e supply 
of affordable housing,  widening ho using cho ice and preventing homelessness. 
Appropriate housing  will have be en built  to  meet the needs of a n ageing  
population r equiring sp ecialist nee ds and sup port or care. The desig n of ne w 
housing an d the adapt ation and r enovation of the existin g housing  stock wil l 
have created safer, gre ener and accessib le living condition s in both the public 
and private sector. 
 
Sustainable urban extensions to the town will be created. These will have a mix 
of housing and community facilities where required, with excellent connectivity to 
the town centre and beyond. 
 
A balance b etween growth and the  protection of the natur al environment needs 
to be achi eved. It will be important; to protect and en hance biodi versity, 
geodiversity; that flood  risk is managed and reduced; new development is  
resilient to climate change; all resources are  used efficiently and the  quality of 
green and blue infrastructure is improved across the Borough.  
 
To promote  sustainable  modes of t ransport appropriate infrastructure must be 
put in place. Where ap propriate, new pedestrian and cycleways will be put in 
place and existing improved to widen the choice of travel to and fr om new 
development. The improvement of  existing public tran sport infrastruct ure and 
hubs will be supported. 
 
Together, this will have created Tamworth as a place which projects a positive 
image as a Borough where people want to live, work and invest.

Introduction                                                                                                                                   
 
3.1  The spatial strategy is central to the Local Plan.  It sets the context for shaping the  
future of T amworth an d how the spatial vi sion and priorities will be  achieved. It 
quantifies t he amount of nece ssary develop ment and explains ho w this will be 
achieved, including the broad directions of growth and provides a framework for the  
Local Plan policies.    
 
Overall Approach 
 3.2 Tamworth is a very sma ll compact borough with tightly drawn boundaries and only 
limited areas of undeveloped urban fringe and countryside. The overall approach of 
the strategy is to protect the Green Belt and concentrate development on land within  the existing urban area and a number of sustainable urban extensions to meet needs as far as possible wit hin Tamwo rth. The Council will work with neighbouring authorities to provide th e remainder of Tamwort h’s housing and employment needs.  Town centre uses will be accommodated within the town centre, followed by the local  
and neighbourhood centres, accor ding to the hierarchy of centres.  The natural and  historic env ironment wi ll be protected and enhanced and health and wellbeing promoted through the p rovision of accessible formal and informal open space s and facilities. 
 3.3 The strategy is set  out in SS1 be low and repr esented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. Th e 
background to and ju stification f or each element of t he strategy is set out in  paragraphs 3.4 to 3.36.  The rest of  the chapter  deals with duty to co-operate, th e evolution of  the Loca l Plan and h ow the Sust ainability Ap praisal ha s interacted t o guide the evolution and national planning policy on sustainable development.   
This policy aims to address all spatial priorities  
SS1 The Spatial Strategy for Tamworth 
The Council’s spatial str ategy is to p rovide development in the most accessible and  
sustainable locations, including within and around the town centre, within t he 
network of local and neighbourhood centres, regeneration priorit y areas an d 
employment areas. In addition to this the Local Plan will set out which areas of the  
urban area are to be e xpanded and ensure that these locations are accessible and  
sustainable. This will meet most of Tamworth’s housing  and employment need s 
whilst safeg uarding nat ural and bu ilt assets a nd addressing socia l a nd economic 
deprivation and exclusion.  
 
Outside of these speci fied areas, the majority of Tamworth will not experience 
significant change during the lifetime of the plan. The focus for these areas will be on 
protecting a nd enhancing environmental and heritage a ssets whilst  ensuring  t hat 
development has a positive impact on local amenity and character. 
 
Between 2006 and 2031 a minimu m of 4,425 dwellings will be built in  Tamworth, 
this sets the annual housing requirement to a minimum of 177 dwellings each year. 
Sustainable urban extensions and smaller sites within the  urban area have been  
allocated to meet this requirement. Following st rategic planning discussion   under   
the   Duty   to   Co-op erate, the Council recog nises that T amworth’s o bjectively 
assessed housing nee d cannot be fully met,  t herefore a minimum of  1,825 new 
homes will be delivered outside of  the Borough within locations which assist the Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 24 delivery of Tamworth’s strategy a nd those of its neighb ours. Lichfield District 
Council has committed to deliver at least 500 dwellings in  their Local  Plan, and  
North Warwickshire  Borough Council ha s committed to deliver a t least  500  
dwellings in their Core Strategy both to meet Tamworth’s needs. 
 
Allocations will be promoted within Tamworth to support th e delivery of at least  18 
hectares (ha) of B1 (b, c), B2 and B8 employment land t o meet an o verall minimum 
need of 32ha. A further minimum 14ha of employment land will be requi red outside 
of the Borough within locations which  assist the delivery of Tamworth’s strategy and 
those of its neighbours.  
 
The three local authorities have committed to continue this co- operation on strategic 
planning issues to del iver the remaining unmet need of 825 dwellings and a 
minimum of 14 hectares of employment land. However if it h as not been possible to  
propose sites for allocation through a statutory development plan for Lichfield District 
or North Warwickshire B orough or through  the granting of planning pe rmissions in 
either district by the  end of the year 2017/18 an early re view of the Ta mworth Plan 
will seek to  address an y outstanding issues. T his will ensure that the appropriate  
housing and employment land provision is allo cated within the relevant Local Plans; 
in susta inable locat ions in relation  to Tamwort h’s needs;  and that th e appropriate  
infrastructure is identified within agreed programmes. 
 
Tamworth Town Centre will be the primary focus for new retail leisure and tourism 
development complimented by appropriate re sidential de velopment to create a 
vibrant town centre community. The town centr e will b e the preferential location for 
7,800 sq metres of new comparis on retail floor space and 2,900 sq metres n ew 
convenience retail floor space between 2021 and 2031. 
 
Investment in local and neighbourhood centres will enable local needs to be met in a 
sustainable way whilst strengthenin g their role as community hubs. Re generation 
will be focussed in the most deprived ‘post war planned neighbourhoo ds’ and th e 
Wilnecote Corridor along Watling Street, with an emphasis on improvin g the quality 
of the physi cal environment, housing provis ion, employme nt and the availability of 
community facilities and services. 
 
The existing Green Belt will be strengthened and retained. High quality open spaces 
will be retained and wh ere possible enhanced, new open s paces will be provided  
through appropriate new development and an urban park created in  the east o f 
Tamworth. Sport and leisure facil ities will be  retained and provision enhance d 
through the provision of a new multi-purpose community sports centre. This will help 
to project a positive image of Tamworth and to provide opportunities fo r improving 
biodiversity and recreation, thus improving health and wellbeing.  
 
The existing network of green a nd blue linkages will be enhanced through the  
provision of  environme ntal and a ccess im provements to provide safe lin kages 
between Tamworth’s neighbourhoo ds, employment sites and to the town centre. 
Linkages between the urban area and areas of countryside outside of t he Borough 
will be developed and promoted. 
 
High quality development will be encouraged in all new development and the historic 
environment will be  protected and e nhanced with consideration of de signated and 
non-designated assets.

 25 Protecting the Green Belt 
 
3.4 The West Midlands Green Belt covers part of Tamworth and is located to the south of 
the Borough, 7% of Tamworth lies within the Gre en Belt. National plannin g policy on Green Belts is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land per manently open and once established, Green Belts should only be altered in exceptional circumstances through the preparation or review of a Local Plan. The Green Belt Review (2014) establishes that there are no exceptional circum stances to release land within the Green Belt for  development, in particular new ho using. Potential development sites located in  
Tamworth’s Green Belt  have been  assessed as part of the Local Plan process,  
through the Sustainability Appraisal, Site Selection Technical Papers and Green Bel t Review. In addition to there being no excep tional circu mstance for Green Belt release the se site s ha ve a combination of issues in cluding signif icant biodiversit y constraints, location in r elation to the to wn centre and empl oyment areas, expensive 
infrastructure needs and potential l oss of setti ng, therefore these site s will not be brought forward for development.  
 3.5 The Green Belt Review split the Green Belt into two parcels of land. Through this  
assessment it is demonstrated that both par cels have and will continue to perform 
their Green Belt purpose as set o ut in the NPPF. There  are a sma ll number o f changes to clarify and strengthen the Green Bel t boundary within each land parcel, which are d etailed in the Green Belt Review.  The strateg y is therefor e to maintain  the boundary.   
Strategy for Meeting Housing Needs  
 
3.6 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) states that Local Plans should meet 
the full ob jectively asse ssed need s for market and afforda ble housing , unless a ny 
adverse impacts of do ing so would si gnificantly and demonstrably outweigh the  
benefits. W hen this ca nnot be me t within the boundaries of a local authority, the  
NPPF sets out a frame work and th rough the mechanisms of the duty t o co-operate 
as to how t his unmet need can be delivered e lsewhere within the housing market area. Tamworth is one such local a uthority and the full objectively assessed needs for housing cannot be met within its boundaries.  
 3.7 The objectively assessed housing need for Tamworth was a ssessed in the Southern 
Staffordshire Districts Housing Needs Study (May 2012) an d updated most recently in August 2014. A ra nge of between 240 and 260 d wellings pe r annum is  recommended as Tam worth’s objectively assessed need. A figure of  250 dwellings per annum has been chosen as this will help to ensure; that there is no decline in the working age  population,  it anticipat es an accelerated level of househo ld formation  
after 2021 in response to an impro ved economic climate and it seeks to provide a  
supply-site response to redress a v ery high affordability rat io in Tamworth. Over th e plan period 2006 – 2031 this equates to 6,250 dwellings.  
 3.8 Although the most rece nt (May 2015) demographic input , based on the  2012 DCL G 
household projections, showed a lo wer range o f objectively assessed h ousing need 
of between 230-250 dwellings per annum, t he figure of 250 dwellings per annum has 
been retain ed; primarily in the interests of  supporting  economic growth and 
addressing the potentially worsening housing market signals, whilst me eting the full objectively assessed need for housing in the Borough. 
 
3.9 A key element of the strategy is to determine where new development will be located. 
Seven spatial options w ere considered, which involved a co mbination of sites within 
the urban area, sustaina ble urban extensions and the Gree n Belt. All options would  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 26 result in permanent loss of greenfield agricultur al land and some would  involve los s 
of Green Belt. The two options involving sites in the Green  Belt were discounted for 
the reasons set out in paragraph 3.4 above. The selected  option focu ses housing  
within the u rban area, Coton Lane and sustainable urban  extensions at the Golf  
Course, Anker Valley and Dunstall Lane and was selecte d because it ma ximises development within Tamworth. The sites are cl ose to existing employment areas, the town centre and sustainable transport links, whilst protecting the Green Belt.  
 3.10 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessments for T amworth set out potential  
sites for ho using development in Tamworth. T he Site Selection Paper (2014) brings together the Sustainability Appraisal, tec hnical consultation, developer submissions and other detailed asse ssments such as the Strategic Floo d Risk Assessment Level 2 (SFRA L evel 2) to assess the se sites in greater detail to establish each site’s  suitability, availability, achievability and deliverability. This process has rejected sites 
that have insurmountable constraints or have n o prospect of delivery within the Plan period. Through this assessment it can be demo nstrated that Tamworth is unable to meet its objectively assessed housi ng need of 250 dwellin gs per annum across the  plan period. The Site Selection Paper shows that there is cap acity for a further 2,948 dwellings in Tamworth in the strategic urban  extensions at Anker V alley, Dunst all 
Lane and the Golf Course and other housing smaller allocations. These are set out in 
greater detail in Chapter 5. Sites which have been assessed through the SFRA Level 2 have also  been allocated for housing and have a total c apacity of 1 40 dwellings. These sites have been allocated to promote housing development in these locations, and following constructive pre-allocation discussions it is considered fe asible to take 
these sites into account when establishing the housing requirement of the Borough. 
 3.11 Furthermore, the planning permission (April 2015) at Anker Valley for 535 dwellings, 
i.e. an addit ional 35 dwellings abov e the SUE allocation indicative capacity can b e taken into consideration when establishing the housing r equirement of the Loca l Plan. These additions to  the supply show that the housing r equirement figure in the  
submitted Local Plan  of 4,250 dwellings can be incr eased to 4 ,425, with a 
corresponding reductio n in the a mount of housing to be provided outside t he Borough to 1,825 dwellings.  
3.12 Using the objectively assessed need of 250 dwellings per annum as a starting point, 
the spatial strategy, considering th e constraint s to development set o ut in the Site  
Selection Paper and ensuring a de gree of flexibility can bu ilt into the plan, a housing 
requirement of 177 dwellings per annum has been set.  This equat es to 4,425 dwellings over the Pla n period. By allowing for an additional 10% for flexibility this gives a total of 4,867 dwellings to aim towards.

3.14 A detailed annual housing trajectory covering the Local Pla n period ca n be found in  
Appendix A. 
 
3.15 There is insufficien t la nd within Tamworth t o accommo date the whole of the  
objectively assesse d n eed. Using the housing  requirement for the plan period o f 4,425, it ca n be establ ished that 1 ,825 dwellin gs sti ll nee d to be pla nned for an d 
delivered within the ho using market area, but outside T amworth’s administrative  
boundaries. Both Lichfield and North Warwickshire local authorities share close links, housing market areas a nd administrative boundaries with T amworth. The Southern Staffordshire Districts Housing Needs Study clearly sets out that L ichfield an d Tamworth share a housing market area and that there are very strong links to North 
Warwickshire. Further to this the Stage 2 GBSLEP and Black Country Joint Plannin g 
Committee Housing Needs Study  (2014) s hows that North Warwickshire shares a  
housing market area with Tamworth, and the Coventry and Warwickshire Joint Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2013 ) shows that there are strong lin ks between North Warwickshire and Tamworth.   
 
3.16 Lichfield a nd North Warwickshire have c ommitted through their respective 
development plans to  deliver a tota l of at lea st 1,000 dwellings (500 e ach) to help 
meet Tamworth’s need s. This still leaves a shortfall of 82 5 dwellings to meet the  
objectively assessed need. All three local author ities are continuing to work together to set out how this remaining unmet need will be planned for outside of Tamworth. It 
is important that housin g need com ing forward in adjoining local authorities helps to 
meet the strategic spatial priorities of this Local Plan.   
 3.17 The Tamwo rth Joint Inf rastructure Study (200 9) showed that there is capacity in  
several locations on the border of Tamwort h but within Lichfield  and Nort h 
Warwickshire. This study showed that there if these sites were brought forward then 
the unmet needs arising in Tamworth could be met.  
 3.18 The Council has identified regeneration priority areas at six of the post war social  
housing nei ghbourhoods. These areas will be a priority for impro ving housing  standards, community facilities, the environment and access to jobs.

 28 Planning for Town Centre Uses 
 
3.19 Prioritising Tamworth town centre for future town centre uses will support economic 
activity there and enhance vitality. It will provide the greatest access to services an d 
facilities for the greatest number of r esidents, particularly for those without access to a car. Focu s on the town centre will reduce th e need to travel by sup porting multi-purpose trip s to town  centre facilities, and will maximise the use of sustainable 
modes of transport into the town centre.
   
 
3.20 The Tamwo rth Town Centre & Retail Study Update (2013) assessed the need for  
additional r etail u ses in Tamworth. The Gun gate redevelopment scheme, whic h 
already has planning permission, will meet T amworth’s retail needs in the short to  medium term. After 20 21 there is curr ently a need for 7,800 sq metres gross  
floorspace of comparison goods a nd 2,900 sq  metres of convenience goods. T his need will be monitored and potentially re-assessed.  
 3.21 Potential to wn centre use site s w ithin the to wn centre and edge o f centre we re 
assessed as part of the Tamworth  Town Cent re and Reta il Study upd ate, however only the Gungate redevelopment which has extant planning  permission, was shown  to be currently deliverable. Notwithstanding this, the study identified that there is land 
within the t own centre with the pot ential for re development in the medium to long 
term. Therefore the Local Plan will follow the town centre first approach of the NPPF; the Gungate redevelopment scheme will deli ver the short term retail needs for  Tamworth within the town centre and the overall retail need will be monitored and re-assessed cl oser to 202 1. Sites tha t are curren tly not deliverable will also be re -assessed to determine t heir contribution to the medium and  longer term retail needs 
of Tamworth. 
 
3.22 The strategy for main town centre uses (A1 retail, B1(a) offices and leisure), will be to 
focus development in existing cen tres that are accessible by pedestrians, cyclists 
and public t ransport, in order to ach ieve a susta inable pattern of development. The 
application of a retail h ierarchy and town centre first appr oach will en sure that th e 
town centre is the focu s for large scale development and the preferred location for uses that a ttract a larg e number o f people . T his will sup port the accessib ility o f 
community facilit ies and  services and the crea tion of a  vibrant and a ttractive  town 
centre . At the same time, growth of t he out of centre retail areas will be r estricted in 
the short to medium term to safegu ard the Gun gate scheme. Despite assessing a 
further nine  potential t own centre sites, capacity for additional retail development within and outside the town centre boundary is limited and no further sites have been allocated.  
3.23 Primary and secondary frontages have been d efined for the town cent re in order  to 
protect the character of the main shopping streets by retaining the majority of units in primary fron tages within  A1 retail u se. A more relaxed ap proach will apply in the secondary frontages.  
 
3.24 Local and  n eighbourhood centres h ave a complementary role as p art of the retail  
hierarchy. They are the preferred lo cations for main town centre uses after the town centre, providing the lo cal community with  eve ry day facilities clo se t o home. The emphasis is on protecti ng commun ity facilitie s and shops i n the defin ed centres,  particularly A1 retail uses, in order  to retain a ccessible lo cal shop s a nd lively and  viable centres. This will be comple ment ed by making imp rovements t o the public 
realm and  shopping environment  and increasing their  accessib ility b y publi c 
transport, walking and cycling. Uses and facilities that would remedy deficiencies and Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 29 help to address social exclusion, particularly in the regeneration priority areas will be 
supported.   
3.25 The sustain able urban extensions will be requ ired to provide new nei ghbourhood 
centres alongside other community facilities in order to create sustainable places that reduce the need to travel whilst helping to create a sustainable community.  
3.26 In order to protect the vitality and viability of centres, where main town centre uses 
are proposed outside the defined centres, a floorspace threshold has been set to 
trigger the need for an impact assessment.  
 
Strategy for meeting employment needs 
 
3.27 The Employment Land Review Update (2013) identified six future empl oyment land 
scenarios for Tamworth. The two most appropriate scenario s considered the level o f 
employment land required with a ‘regeneration  and growt h’ plan strat egy and th e expected population a nd demographic chan ges. A point  between t he two sets a minimum requirement of 32 ha of new employment land. The Review also looked  at the need for new offi ce space in Tamwort h arising from B1(a) office and A2  professional needs, the assessment showed there was no specific need for either. 
 3.28 The employment land requirement set out in the Local Plan aims to be in line with the 
objectively assessed housing need. This will e nsure that a s the popu lation grows it  will have access to new jobs, whilst ensuring that a much higher level of employment 
growth does not dr ive high levels of in-ward migration which would  in turn require further housing growth.    
 3.29 The Plan e ncourages economic growth by restricting u ses within the strategic 
employment areas to B1(b and c), B2 and B8 uses and allocating new sites for 
economic development  that are accessible by sustaina ble modes of transpo rt. Safeguarding the strategic employment areas for B class uses will no t only prote ct 
the function  of the employment areas, but also that of the town centre and a ny 
changes will need to d emonstrate need, compliance with the sequent ial test and accessibility by a range of sustainable transport modes. A more flexible approach to  
changes of use will apply outside the strategic employment areas.  
3.30 Ten sites h ave been allocated on  a  mixture of greenfield and brownfield land. W ith 
the exception of Bitterscote South, all the sites a re within or on the edge of existing  strategic e mployment areas, alth ough Bitterscote Sout h will ultimately form an extension to the Bitterscote Strate gic Employment Area.  A total of approximately 18ha of land has been identified for employment uses within Tamworth. This shows a significant shortfall of 14ha from th e identified need of a minimum of 3 2ha over th e 
Plan period . Whilst th e National Planning P olicy Framework does not requir e 
employment allocations to be made but only a criteria set  out in policy to deliver the most suitable sites, it is unrealisti c that the sho rtfall will be  found withi n Tamworth. This will ne ed to be met outside Tamworth i n neighbouring district s. Tamworth , Lichfield an d North Warwickshire a ll continue t o work together to set out how this 
remaining unmet need will be plan ned for. It is  important that the employment nee d 
coming forward in adjoining loca l authorities helps to meet the strategic spat ial 
priorities of this Local Plan and is a ligned with areas of housing growth.    
 
3.31 B1(a) office uses should be located within the town centre and if no suitable sites are 
available, then strategic employment areas could be considered providing it helps to  
deliver the overall strat egy and is not detrimental to the vitality and viability of t he 
town centre. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

Environmental Protection and Enhancement 
 
3.32 Tamworth’s history as an expand ed town ha s resulted in a planned layout th at 
contains an  extensive network of green and blue infrastr ucture comprising gree n 
spaces, rivers and canals. The  str ategic netw ork has be en identif ied on the  ke y diagram and is shown in more d etail on th e Policie s Map. The net work is multi-functional, providing for a range of needs and activities including formal and informal recreation a nd sport, e cology and biodiversity, sustainab le transport  and climat e 
change mitigation.  
 
3.33 The network will be pr otected and enhanced and new open space pr ovided where 
appropriate, to ensure t hat everyon e has convenient acce ss to high quality green  spaces. Links between spaces will be impr oved to create recreational walking and  
cycling routes and to  fill gaps between space s and habita ts. A particular need has been identifi ed for an urban park in the eastern side of the town and this will b e supported in an appropriate location. Loss of  open spaces that form part of t he strategic network will be resisted.   
3.34 Sites of biodiversity or geological/ geomorphological importance will be protected 
according t o their status and opportunities take n to improve the quality of habitat s and create new natural habitats using local wildlife partnerships where appropriate.  
3.35 Tamworth contains a wealth of heritage assets,  most of which are foun d in the town 
centre. Designated and non-designated assets will be a pri ority for safeguarding and 
enhancing. A heritage statement and statement of signifi cance will be required to  
identify significance and impact of development on an asset and its setting. 
 
Community Facilities  
 
3.36 The Plan will protect existing community facilitie s and by working with the Tamworth  
Strategic Partnership will support  the provisi on of new facilit ies wh ere they are  required. At the sustai nable urban extensions the co-location of facilitie s will be encouraged to redu ce the need to  travel and pr ovide linked benefits. In this regard, there may be scope  for educational establishments to make provision fo r community use of leisure and spor t facilitie s a nd this  will be an impor tant conside ration when 
planning for new primary schools b ecause the requirements for design , access an d size of dual use school sites are different to sites without community access.  
 3.37 The National Planning Policy Framework requires local authorities to plan positive for 
the provisio n of sports venues. The updated  Joint Sport s Strategy has identifie d 
specific needs, such as a new multi-purpose community sports centre incorporating a 
swimming pool, sports halls, squash courts and health and fitness. The provision of these facil ities will be supported i n an accessible loca tion to serve the whole of Tamworth through planning policy and in the Infrastructur e Delivery Plan. A location in the town centre would be most accessible to the greatest number of residents and will increase activity in the town centre and contribute to its vitality.  It is also likely to 
maximise the use of su stainable modes of travel into the t own centre and make the 
best use of existing transport infrastructure.    
Whole Plan Viability  
 
3.38 The National Planning Policy Framework st ates that plans should be deliverable and 
that the sites and level of development identifie d in the plan should not  be subject to such a scale of obligations or policy burdens that their ability to be de veloped viably Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 31 is threaten ed. The Whole Plan Viability, Affordable Housing and  Communit y 
Infrastructure Levy Stu dy (2014) appraises a  r ange of typical residential and non-residential developments consisten t with the plan strategy for growt h as well a s 
specific sit es includ ing sustainab le urban extensions. T he appraisa l results and  
recommendations have informed Local Plan p oli cies, with implications for affordable 
housing and infrastructure, to ensure that they do not threaten whole plan viability. Policies hav e been designed so as not to set specific costs up to the  margins of  viability and with flexibility to negotiate developer obligatio ns where th ere are site  specific abnormal costs.

Duty to Co-operate and Strategic Planning 
 
3.39 Tamworth h as proactively engaged and worked with neighbouring local authorities  
and other statutory duty to co-operate bodies in addressing strategic planning issues. This will enable the strategy for Tamworth and other lo cal authorities to be delivered for mutual benefit. Further detail on duty to  co-operate is within the Duty to  Co-operate Statement (2014).   
3.40 Agreements have bee n reached with Lichfield and Nort h Warwickshire for th e 
delivery of housing. In addition to this Tamworth Borough Council is actively involved with the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Economic Partnership. The GBSLEP Spatial Framework looks to  present opti ons for delivering strategic planning acro ss 
the LEP, one of which is the delivery of housing. Tamworth recognises t hat there is a current und er provision of housing  to meet objectively assessed need s across th e 
LEP and th at part of this arises fro m within Ta mworth, but to a much greater extent 
from Birmingham. It ha s been established that  Tamworth cannot fully meet its own  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

 34 housing or employment needs, any future development which goes beyond the levels 
of development set o ut in t his L ocal Plan  will be to meet needs arising  fro m Tamworth. Through the preparatio n of Birmingham City Council’s L ocal Plan a nd 
Tamworth’s it has been agreed between the two  authorities that Tamworth is unable 
to assist in meeting Birmingham’s unmet needs.     
Plan Strategy and Evolution 
 
3.41 Through previous adopted development plans fo r Tamworth, the growth strategy was 
to ma ximise housing development on brownfield sites with  an urban extension at  
Anker Valley, for new employment land to come forward at strategic a nd accessible 
locations and for Tamworth town ce ntre to be the focus of main town centre uses. In the main thi s strategy h as been achieved, particularly with regard to ho using. Since 2006 92.8% of new housing has been built on brownfield sites.   
3.42 In accordance with the legislative requirements the Local Plan and the Sustainability 
Appraisal have been prepared together, with the intention of testing emerging options on their sustainability performance and th erefore taking this into account in subsequent versions of the Local Plan. 
 
3.43 Over the li fetime and evolution of the Local Plan there have been several 
Sustainability Appraisals of the growth strategy and in later it erations of specific sites 
for different land uses.  Each Sustainability Appraisal an d the different strategy options are summarised in the follo wing sections, a detailed history and evolution of options can be found in the Sustainability Appraisal.  
 
3.44 The Local Plan has been in preparation sin ce 2008 and has been subject to  
contextual changes in  particular t o housing projections and change s to nation al 
policy. Because of this, there have been two p eriods in th e formation of the Local Plan and S A. The pre paration of  each Lo cal Plan ha s been inf luenced by its  accompanying SA, which in turn has influenced the next version of the SA.  
 
3.45 The first period can be defined as from 2008 to  2011, which centred on the delivery 
of 2,900 homes. The versions of the Local Plan and accompanying SA o f this period 
are: 
 Issues and Options – 2008 
 Proposed Spatial Strategy – 2009 
 Further Housing Options - 2011 
 
3.46 The second  period can  be defined  as from 2012 to 201 4, which ce ntred on th e 
delivery of 250dpa (5,5 00-6,250 ne w homes). The versions of the Lo cal Plan an d accompanying SA of this period are:   
 Pre-submission Local Plan (wit hdrawn from examination) – 2012 
 Draft Local Plan –  2014 
 Pre-submission Local plan – 2014  
 
Issues and Options 2008 
 
3.47 In March 2 008, an Issues and O ptions Repo rt was prod uced which  set out  fo ur 
spatial options for delivering future development (table 3.1). The housing requirement at this time was 2,900 to 2026. 
   Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 35 Table 3.1: Issu es and Options 
Option Description Reason for Selection 
Option 1: Urban Containment 
& Regeneration  Within the urban area there are 
a range of sites that are considered to be potentially suitable for housing and 
employment development.  
Selective redevelopment and office provision would be the focus of town centre renewal.  This option assumed that Anker 
Valley can deliver 800 units. 
 This option had the most 
potential for the urban area to remain compact.  It could deliver growth in 
areas that need 
regeneration, and housing and employment would be provided in accessible 
locations.  The town 
centre would be improved through selective redevelopment and increased business confidence.  However 
this option may lead to a 
loss of green spaces, reducing biodiversity and limiting opportunities for healthy living.  
Residential amenity 
could be reduced and congestion could get worse, particularly around Ventura as people try to access 
retail facilities. 
Option 2: Urban Containment 
and Anker Valley Intensification The Housing Land Availability 
Assessment identified that by taking the existing Anker Valley Local Plan allocation, densities could be increased to fully accommodate the remaining 
requirement.  Employment 
requirements would be met on a mixture of sites within the urban area following the outcome of further work.  
Selective redevelopment and 
office provision would be the focus of town centre renewal. 
 This option has the 
potential for the town to remain compact.  Whilst this option would involve the loss of greenfield land, it would prevent 
further greenfield release 
and sought to efficiently develop an existing site. It can deliver growth in areas that need 
regeneration.  Housing, 
employment and town centre facilities would be provided in accessible locations.  The scale of the development would 
ensure the incorporation 
of appropriate facilities and a mix of housing.  The proximity of the development to the open 
countryside would 
provide opportunities for communities to be fit and Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 36 healthy.  There is 
potential to improve public transport to 
reduce car commuting to 
and from Tamworth 
 
Option 3: Greenfield Urban 
Extensions  This option sought to locate 
housing on a greenfield site to the north of the town by extending the existing Anker 
Valley Local Plan allocation.  
Employment would be located on greenfield sites in and adjacent to existing employment areas close to the 
A5.  Selective redevelopment 
and office provision will be the focus of town centre renewal. 
 This option is not about 
containment because it would lead to Tamworth spreading up to its 
boundary on greenfield 
sites.  It would, however, deliver well-designed new communities with good access to facilities, 
the town centre and the 
countryside.  It would do little to regenerate deprived parts of Tamworth and there 
would be issues 
surrounding infrastructure, particularly highways into and out of Tamworth from the north.  There is 
potential to improve 
public transport to reduce car commuting to and from Tamworth. 
Option 4: Greenfield and 
Green Belt Urban Extensions  This option sought to locate 
housing on green belt sites to the south of the town in the 
Dosthill and Hockley areas.  
This option assumed that the existing 800 units allocated at Anker Valley could be delivered.  Employment would 
be located on greenfield sites in 
and adjacent to existing employment areas close to the A5.  Selective redevelopment and office provision would be the focus of town centre 
renewal.  The option assumed 
that green belt release may be appropriate in exceptional circumstances. 
 This option is not about 
containment because it would lead to Tamworth 
spreading into adjoining 
districts.  It would, however, deliver well designed new communities with good 
access to facilities and 
the countryside.  It would do little to regenerate deprived parts of Tamworth and there would be issues 
surrounding 
infrastructure, particularly highways in the Dosthill area and routes to and from the 
trunk roads and the town 
centre.  There is potential to improve public transport to reduce car commuting to and from Tamworth. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 37  
3.48 Following consultation on the Issues and Opti ons Report, an Options  Report was 
produced in February 2 009 which identified the  preferred spatial option  for locating  
future development.  Th e Options Report stated  that, from a  pragmatic point of view and having regard to th e fact that it is generally accepted that Tamworth has limited 
opportunities to meet all new development req uirements, considerations relating t o 
development opportunities should be based on a sequential approach, having regard to viability and delivery issues. 
 3.49 The reasons for this preferred spatial option  were: it was still government an d 
regional policy that whe rever possible previously used land should be  brought into  active use.  Therefore consideration should f irst be given to urban co ntainment.  If this cannot  be shown to deliver the growth requirements, then greenfield urba n extensions should be considered.  If there still remains a shortfall then the only other 
option within Tamworth  would be Green Belt.  However, having regard to the stat us 
of the Gree n Belt at national and regional level, this could  not be sust ained and if  there was still a shortfall then the only option would be that the required development would have to be provided outside of the Borough.  
 3.50 The advantages of this approach were identified in the Options Report as: 
 It focuses development in the established urban fabric of Tamworth;  
 It maximises the use of existing infrastructure;  
 It supports regeneration opportunities; and  
 It accords w ith national and regional guidance in containing  development in the 
urban area. 
 
Proposed Spatial Strategy 2009 
 
3.51 In October 2009, the  proposed spatial strategy
 was published with a housing 
requirement of 2,900 dwellings ba sed on the regional st rategy. This stated that 
requirements for hou sing, employment and office  d evelopment would b e 
accommodated within Tamworth’s boundaries, through a combination of sensitive urban containment and greenfield extension, which would take account  of the best aspects of Tamworth’s heritage an d biodiversity assets.  T he town centre would be  the focus of mixed use regeneration and economic development.  Ne w retail growth would be accommodated through two strategic allocations.  Office growth would also 
be accommodated and improve ments made to the public re alm in order to improve 
the quality of the visitor experience.  There would be improved linkage s to the out of  town retail parks so th at the two shopping are as are complementary to each oth er.  Improvements would also be mad e to key ga teways into the town centre.  New housing to meet the n eeds of Tamworth resi dents in the short and medium term would be provided within the existin g ur ban area, primarily on previously developed  
land and in  the form o f a sustaina ble urban extension in the Anker Valley as a  strategic sit e.  This de velopment would deliver access improvements to the train  station, tow n centre a nd the new Academy on the QEMS site and rest of t he Learning Zone via the Anker Valley Link Road.  In the longer term, sustainable site s 
outside of Tamworth would be considered to meet housing needs.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 38 Options for Housing Delivery 
 
3.52 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment identified a significant amount of 
land suitabl e for housing development.  However, further work on a vailability and  
achievability was undertaken in the Tamworth Future Development and Infrastructure Study that identified capacity within the urban area. This left a residual requirement of a minimum of 918 units to be found from outside the urban area, and the propose d spatial strategy was to seek between 900 and 1150 dwellings in the Anker Valley.  Options for Employment Land Delivery 
 
3.53 The Proposed Spatial Strategy also identified  a preferred option for th e location of 
employment sites.   Th e Council would provide 42 ha of new employment land  
through new sites and redevelopment of e xisting employment  areas to meet i ts requirement. 
 
3.54 The Proposed Spatial S trategy also identified a number of options for  approaches to 
the policies within the Plan. 
 
Further Housing Options 2011 
 
3.55 In February 2011, a c onsultation paper on h ousing policy was prod uced with a 
housing requirement of 2,900 dwellings based  on the regional strategy.  This set out 
a policy for  housing delivery which stated that  a minimum of 900 dwellings will be provided for at the  Anker Valley SUE. The remainder will be provide d within the  existing urban area.  In addition, th e policy proposed that t he Council would work  
closely with neighbouring authorities to ensur e that if furt her housing is required  to 
meet Tamworth’s nee ds that this is planned  in the most susta inable location .  Development to meet T amworth’s needs in neig hbouring authorities could be met in  identified broad locations to the east of the town or to the north of the town as part of the sustainable urban neighbourhood in the Anker Valley. 
 3.56 The Tamworth Future Development and Infrastructure Study, carried o ut jointly with 
Lichfield District and North Warwickshire Borough Councils, examined seven options 
for delivering a further 900 dwellings outside the urban area.  In ident ifying options, the Study also took into  account th e need to p rovide for a further 600 dwellings fo r flexibility in the Local Plan. The preferred option was to prioritise development within Tamworth urban area and the on the Anker Valley allocation, an d to pursue  discussions with neigh bouring aut horities subsequently to  deliver hou sing to mee t Tamworth’s needs in Lichfield and North Warwickshire.  
 
Pre-Submission Local Plan 2012 
 
3.57 In June 2012, the Pre-Submission version of the Local Plan 2006-2028 was 
published w ith an obje ctively assessed housin g need of 5, 500, seekin g to deliver. 
4,500 in Tamworth at  Anker Valley and within the urban  area, with the remaining  
1,000 to be  delivered i n North Warwickshire a nd Lichfield. This strate gy built upo n 
previous versions of  t he Local Plan in  maximising growth within Tamwort h’s 
boundaries, through a combination of urban containment and greenfield extensio n, which would take account of the best aspects of Tamworth’s heritage and biodiversity assets. Ult imately this version of t he Local Plan was withdrawn from examination.  The appointed Inspector had sig nificant concerns over the plan’s reliance on Anker  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 39 Valley and the urban ar ea in delive ring the req uired housi ng needs, a nd ability of 
these areas to deliver this quantity of housing.     Draft Local Plan and Pre-submission Local Plan 2014  
3.58 In March 2014, the draft Local Plan 2006 – 2031 was published for consultation, with  
an objectively assessed housing need of 6,250, seeking to deliver 4,250 in Tamworth at Anker Valley, Tamwo rth Golf Co urse, Dunst all Lane an d within the urban area, with the remaining 2,000 to be del ivered in North Warwickshire and Lichfield. Agai n 
this strategy built upon t he previous version of t he Local Plan, albeit with a higher  
objectively assessed housing need because the plan period had been extended by 3 years. A transport assessment at Anker Valley demonstrated that a lower number o f homes could be delivered and that further detailed asse ssments of sites within the urban area showed that overall there wa s a reduction in deliverable and developable  
sites. To maximise growth within Tamworth, two further sustainable urban extensions were allocated at Tamworth Golf Course and at Dunstall Lane.  
 3.59 The Sustainability Appraisal examined seven spatial options for Tamworth taking into 
account the need to maximise delivery of housing but ensu ring development occurs  
in a sustainable manner in line wit h the NPPF and obje ctives of th e SA. These  
options were built arou nd maximising development in the urban area and at Anker Valley and t hen by further expanding development to the urban extension option s and the Green Belt. Sp atial option 7 was taken  forward int o the Loca l Plan, the SA supported this option above the six other options as it strived to maximise the amount of housing developmen t coming forward in Ta mworth. Option 6 which included th e 
same land as option 7 plus the Green Belt had a higher amount potential housing 
than option  6 but the  SA raised several issu es with this option which were no t applicable or as severe in the other six options. These inclu ded; negative impacts t o landscape and biodiversity, the furth er deterioration of air quality in Dosthill, risks to  the capacit y and pumping of the  sewerage network which would r equire major 
investment and traffic implications to the A51 which may require a new road. T he 
decision to not take option 6 forward is supported by the Green Belt Review (2014 ) and the Site Selection Paper (2014). It should be noted here that none of the seven options assessed thro ugh the SA would be able to deliver all of Tamwort h’s objectively assessed needs.   
3.60 The sustain ability appraisal of plan  options ha s been an integral part of the plan-
making process through out the evolution of the Local Plan. The significant increase in the objectively assessed need fo r housing h as required further greenfield urban  extensions to be appraised and for the Green Belt to be re-appraised in an attempt to maximise the amount of housing de velopment coming forward in Tamworth. As the 
Local Plan can not meet the obje ctively asse ssed need for housing  arising fro m 
Tamworth, discussions have been on-going with other local authorities throughout its preparation. These strategic issue s framed by the duty to co-operate are detailed within this Local Plan and supporting evidence base.   
Delivering Sustainable Development 
 
3.61 The NPPF places gre at emphasis on the presumption in favour of sustainable  
development. This is re flected thro ugh the policies with in this Loca l Plan and it s 
future implementation.   
3.62 The policies and proposals contained in the Local Plan will impact on the three facets 
of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental and measures have Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 40 been taken  to integrat e them and minimise any potential conf licts and adverse  
impacts, in order to achieve the most sustainable outcome for Tamworth. 
 
3.63 The NPPF sets out  the presumption in favour of sustainable development and the 
need for sustainable economic growth, on whi ch local pla ns are to b e based and  
includes clear policies that will guide how the presumption should be applied locally.  
 
This policy aims to address all spatial priorities 
SS2 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development  
Any propos als for development that demonstrate that they are in accordance with 
policies in this plan and are sustainable will be granted planning permission withou t 
any delay. 
 
When determining applications the Council will take the following approach to reflect 
the presumption in favour of sust ainable development contained in  the National 
Planning Policy Framework. It will al ways work  proactively with applica nts jointly to  
find solutions which mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to 
secure development that improves the e conomic, so cial and  e nvironmental 
conditions in the area.  
 
Planning ap plications th at accord  with the po licies in  this L ocal Plan  ( and, where 
relevant, wi th policies i n neighbourhood plans) will be approved without delay, 
unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 
 
Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of 
date at the time of making the decision then the Council will grant permission unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise – taking into account whether: 
 
a) Any adverse impacts of granting perm ission would significantly and demonstrably
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the National Planning 
Policy Framework taken as a whole; or 
 
b) Specific policie s in  that Framework indicate that d evelopment should be  
restricted.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 41 CHAPTER 4 - A PROSPEROUS TOWN  
 
4.1 Delivering a prosperous Tamworth involves planning positively for sustainable 
economic growth and focussing investment in the town centre and the network 
of defined local and neighbourhood centres. 
 
4.2 New employment land allocated in accessible locations and the protection of 
existing employment areas will ensure the retention of existing jobs and attract new jobs to Tamworth which will support the reduction of high levels of out-commuting currently experienced.   
4.3 Directing investment in existing centres and accessible emplo yment sites will 
reduce the need to t ravel and make the most effective use of  Tam worth’s limited land supply.  
 
4.4 The policies in this chapter seek to address the challenges set out in Chapters 2 and 
3. Future economic growth is nee ded to provide jobs for  the next generation of Tamworth, as well as culture, tour ism and co mmercial development  in the  tow n 
centre, which has bee n negatively affected in the past by out of  centre retail 
development. Local and neighbourhood centres need to be  protected as they are  important in creating sustainable communities. 
 4.5 This chapte r has been divided into three distinct sectio ns: ‘Centres and Reta il 
Capacity’, ‘Culture and Tourism’ and ‘Employment Land and Economic Growth’. 
 
 
Centres and Retail Capacity 
 
4.6 Tamworth Town Centre is the focus for large scale  future investment and 
development as well a s the preferred location for uses that attract a large number of people. Below this level, there is a need to provide for people’s day to day needs in 
locations close to where they live.  
4.7 Local and neighbourhoo d centres play a vital ro le, not only as places t o shop but  
because they provide t he opportunity to deliv er a wide range of services loca lly in places that are accessible by a choice of means of transp ort. They are particularly 
important in deprived n eighbourhoods and areas with low le vels of car o wnership as residents can access b asic services within walking or cycling distance  or by public 
transport.  
4.8 Tamworth is unusual in having a large amount of retail floo rspace (in p roportion to 
the town centre) in an out of centre location that is relatively close to the town centre. The policies map defines the boundary of the out of centre retail areas, which include Ventura, Jolly Sailor and Cardinal Point Retail Parks, as well as, Tame Valley Reta il 
Park to the south of the  town which has large superstores and a smaller number o f bulky goods retailers.  
 
4.9 Whilst recent health checks (Tamworth Town Centres Health check) and monitoring 
of the town centre have shown the centre to be  performing relatively we ll in terms of  
shopper nu mbers and rental values, conce rns have been identified regardin g vacancy rates and the quality and range of the retail and leisure offer,  in particula r the emphasis on low value retail an d a narrow leisure offer.  Other issues include th e 
lack of nat ional retailer  representa tion (and la ck of demand identifie d for future 
representation) and the  tendency f or a significant number of the remaining nationa l Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 42 retailers to be either actively looking to dispose of their units or facing  an uncertain  
future as operators. 
 
4.10 Whilst the out of centre retail parks have enabled Tamworth to develop a strong retail 
offer for its size, as well as a generally better quality of sho pping provision than the 
town centre, it is clear t hat the retail parks have become to o dominant compared to the town centre and the balance needs to be redressed. 
 4.11 The focus for future development in the out of centre retail areas will be on improving 
the general environme nt as part of improv ing the linka ges to the  town centr e, 
improving access by means other than the pr ivate car as part of congestion reducing 
measures and retro fitting of renewable and low carbon technologies.  
4.12 There is a  significant amount of co mmercial leisure provision, mostly located within 
the town centre includin g a multiplex cinema, t he Snowdo me, bowling alley and a range of other facilitie s. Whilst the T amworth Town Centre & Retail Study identified  an adequate overall level of existing leisure provision in Tamworth,  a need was  identified to  improve th e provision of cafes a nd restaura nts in the t own centre.  Increasing t he offer of  these operators, particularly aiming at family focussed 
providers will be key to increasing  the overall attractiveness of the town centre, 
particularly in terms of helping to deliver linked tr ips between the out of centre retail areas and the town centre. 
 4.13 There is n o specific requirement for new office f loorspace, but  any future  
development should be delivered within the t own centre. To ensure that the town  
centre is th e key driver in de livering a pr osperous Tamworth, it will b e important to 
encourage t he development of new office space. Increasing the number of people  
who work within the tow n centre ha s numerous ‘spin-off ’ benefits. Not only is it th e most sustainable loca tion, acce ssible by  a variety of transport modes, office 
development will also in crease the number of people using associated services and 
facilities, th us improvin g vitality an d viability a nd helping to regenerate the town  
centre.  
 4.14 As a result of limited land supply, the need to focus a variety of uses, including retail, 
leisure and  residential,  and constraints relate d to the hi storic fabric and need to protect and enhance all heritage assets, it is considered that any future office spa ce 
will be delivered in the form of mixed-use dev elopment. As part of this approach it will 
be important to maximise the role of the railway station in particular, with its excellent 
links to London, Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham.   
Hierarchy of Centres for Town Centre Uses 
 
4.15 Policy EC1 defines a hierarchy for where devel opment involving main town centre 
uses (for example A1 (retail), B1(a) (office) and leisure) should be located. It presents a town centre first appr oach, followed by local and then neighbourhood  centres. As such, all of  the available capacity  for retail floorspace should be met as far as  possible within Tamworth town centre in order to deliver the key spatia l objective o f 
regenerating and focussing investment within the town centre. 
 
4.16 Concentrating new reta il, leisure, services, tourism, cultural and office development 
in the town centre is the best way to ensure that preference is given to sites that best serve the needs of deprived areas. It is also t he location which best satisfies the 
sequential approach to  site selection, giving preference to  sites within centres t o 
achieve a more sustainable pattern of development to help combat climate change. It will provide the opportunity to increase a ccessibility by pedestrians, cyclists an d Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 43 public transport thereby maximising opportuni ties for improving the environment and 
the overall image of the town.  
 
4.17 Whilst there is currently no opportu nity to e xpand the town  centre boundary due t o 
physical co nstraints an d the centre’s historic environme nt, there is potential to  
consolidate the town centre through redevelopment opportunities wit hin the town  centre boundary.   
4.18 Focussing retail and lei sure investment in Tamworth To wn Centre will balance the 
attraction with the out  of town cen tre retail ar eas more t owards the  town centr e. However, this will also  require restricting the  growth of the out of centr e retail area s that could weaken the attraction of the town centre, especially until the Gungat e redevelopment scheme becomes e stablished. Whilst proposals to refurbish existing units and environmental and accessib ility improve ments will be encouraged, 
development which results in the creation of additional retail and or leisure floorspace at the existing out of centre retail parks at Ve ntura, Jolly Sailor, Cardinal Point & Tame Valley will therefore not be supported.   
4.19 As well as defining a hierarchy for a sequential approach, Policy EC1  sets a  
floorspace t hreshold to  trigger the  requirement for an impact asse ssment on the relevant centre where a main town centre use is proposed outside of a defined  centre. This threshold figure was determined through con sideration o f the scale of retail and u nits with the  town, local and neighbourhood centres, existing vitality and 
viability of the defined centres, the  scale of proposals rela tive to town  centres, and the cumulative effects of recent developments. This has se t a locally proportionate 
standard as evidenced within the Tamworth Town Centre and Retail Study 2011 and 
the Threshold Policy for Main To wn Centre Uses Impact Assessment: Evidence  Report (No vember 20 13). The impact asse ssment requirement wi ll ensure that 
development outside of centres is only allo wed where it would not har m their vitality 
and viability.  
 4.20 Local and neighbourho od centres have a c omplementary role as part of the  
established retail hierarchy, serving the local community. The existing centres ensure a sustainable focus and pattern for development with each having its own distinctive character and mix of uses, including shops, services and community facilities.   
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP2, SP3 
EC1 Hierarchy of Centres for Town Centre Uses 
Tamworth’s ‘main town centre uses’ hierarchy is defined as follows and shown on 
the Policies Map: 
 
First - Tamworth Town Centre 
Second – Network of local centres  
Third – Network of neighbourhood centres  
 
Other uses which attract visiting members  of the public should also follow this 
hierarchy. 
 
Planning permission will be granted for ‘main town centre uses’ that are appropriate 
in relation to the role a nd function of each cen tre. If development invo lving a main  
town centre use or ot her use which attract s visiting members of the public is 
proposed outside of th e town centre, local o r neighbourhood centres, it must 
demonstrate: 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016

b) Good accessibility by walking, cycling and public transport, 
c) That there will be no  adverse i mpact on the vitality and viability of o ther existing 
centres 
d) Will not prejudice the delivery of other strategic objectives. 
 
For main town centre uses proposed outside of the defined hierarchy of centres, an 
impact assessment will be required accompany ing a planning application in line with 
the criteria set out below.

Where a pr oposal falls within more than one  of the ran ges specifie d above the 
lowest threshold will be applied in determining whether or not an impact assessment 
is required.  
 
The impact assessment should consider the cumulative eff ects of the proposal on  
the town ce ntre, local centres and neighbourhood centres and, where appropriate, 
other centre s outside of  the Borough. Where appropriate t he impact assessment  
should consider the impact on any recently  completed retail developme nts and any 
outstanding planning permissions for retail development, including, and in particular, 
the Gungate redevelopment. 
 
Where it can be demonstrated that develop ment would  not have  a significan t 
adverse impact on the  defined centre, or cent res, the prin ciple of development will  
be supported. 
 
 
4.21 The scope of sequential tests will vary from applicat ion to applicat ion and will 
therefore be subject to the approval of the Cou ncil. The scope of the sequential test Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

4.22 The Gunga te redevelopment will meet Ta mworth’s retail  needs in the short to  
medium term. After 2021 there is a further need of 7,800 sq. metres gross floorspace of comparison goods and 2,900 sq. metres of convenience goods. The town centre is considered to be the most appropriate loca tion to meet these reta il needs.  Th e 
Gungate redevelopme nt in particular will attract reta ilers who are seekin g 
accommodation in Tamworth but are unable t o find suita ble premises elsewhere  within the town centre.  
 4.23 Whilst the need for additional co nvenience pr ovision is small, qualitative issu es 
should be taken into account. In p articular, a possible qualitative need for additional convenience goods sh opping in Tamworth Town Centre has been identified  to  enhance it s vitality and viability. Proposals f or any additional f ood shops of appropriate size with in t he town ce ntre, local o r neighbour hood centre s should  b e assessed in relation to the extra benefits to maintain or enhance the centre. 
 4.24 The amoun t of vacant  floorspace  within the town centre, local centres and  
neighbourhood centres will be monitored, to inf orm the application  of th e sequential test for main town centre uses in implementing policy EC1. 
 
Supporting Investment in Tamworth Town Centre 
 
4.25 The town c entre boundary is shown on the Po licies Map and is where main to wn 
centre uses, including t hose which contribut e directly to the town centre, will be 
located. 
 
4.26 Policy EC2 sets out how the town  centre will be supported and regenerated over the 
plan period, including appropriate types of  development and through specific projects 
and stakeholders. The regeneration and economic development of the town centre is 
seen as a key Council objective and driver to the wider regeneration of Tamworth. 
The town centre should present a distinctive environment: an offer that complements  the out of centre retail areas, is related more t o the retail parks and takes advantage 
of the highe r expenditure levels of shoppers vi siting the se areas. Thi s will require  
improving the physical linkages bet ween the out of centre retail areas and the town centre whilst diversifying the to wn centre’s offer, in cluding attr acting new developments, residential development and im proving the quality of its environment  
to increase its overall attractiveness and image.  
 
4.27 Protecting and enhancing the heritage assets of the town will assist in defining  
Tamworth’s unique stre etscape, fostering local distinctiveness and pre serving local 
character.  
4.28 Improved li nkages fro m the town  centre to other areas on the edge of the town 
centre, such as between the railway station and the primary shopping area or leisure facilities, will also allow greater accessibility through sustainable modes of transport and will encourage increased movement to and from the town centre. This will help to reduce con gestion in  and around  the town centre and  consequen tly reduce air pollution. 
 4.29 Residential development, in parti cular that of a  higher den sity, will be  encourage d 
within the town centre. This will help deliver benefits associated with making the most Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 46 of Tamworth’s limited supply of lan d through maximising development on brownfield 
sites whilst increasing t he demand for town centre services and incre asing natural surveillance to deliver a safer environment. Chapter 5 identifies which sites ar e 
allocated within the town centre.  
 
This policy aims to a ddress Strategic Spatial Priorities SP2, SP3 , SP4, SP7,

EC2 Supporting investment in Tamworth Town Centre 
The Council  will work i n partnershi p with busi nesses an d landowners to revitalise 
Tamworth Town Centre and attract  visitors. I n accordance with the Co uncil and its 
partners’ key objectives, the town centre will be  promoted as Tamworth’s preferred  
location for  the development of town centre uses along with higher d ensity, high 
quality residential developments. In particular,  the Gungate Redevelopment Scheme 
for 20,660 sq m of com parison retail goods floorspace is proposed for completion 
prior to 20 21. Other t own centre  uses will be permitted within th is scheme in  
accordance with the criteria set  o ut in policy EC3, and residential uses will b e 
permitted on the upper floors. 
 
If substantial progress has not been made towards securing the Gungate Scheme by 
2020/21, the Council will review its retail requirement and will consider  the potential 
for retail d evelopments on other sites in  acco rdance with  the ‘town centre first’  
hierarchy set out in policy EC1. 
 
After 2021, in addition to the Gung ate scheme,  planning permission will be granted  
for development such as retail (7, 800 sq. met res comparison and 2,9 00 sq. metr es 
convenience goods flo or space after 2021), leisure, tourism, cultural and office  
development that support and enhances its dual function as both the Borough’s town 
centre and growing status as a sub regional tourism and leisure hub.  
 
Tamworth Town Centre will bene fit from impr oved connectivity in terms of cycling, 
walking and public transport, to and from the  existing out of town retail areas, the 
railway station and leisu re facilities. Where possible development should contribute 
to enhancing the public realm through high quality building design, the t own centre’s 
open spaces and linkages at strategic entrances to the town centre. 
 
Development within the town centre and appropriate edge of centre locations should 
protect and  enhance it s historic character. Key historic landmarks such as the 
Castle, St Editha’s Church and th e Town Ha ll define Ta mworth’s identity as a 
historic mar ket town. Development  should respect and e nhance the se asset s in  
terms of use, design, appearance and interpretation. 
 
Development that will have a significant adv erse impact on the vitality and viability of 
the town centre will not be supported unless it has been demonstrated that the wider 
economic benefits will outweigh the detriment to the town centre. 
 
The outdoor street markets should b e protected by nearby d evelopment and will be 
enhanced through environmental improvements and promotional activity. 
 
 
4.30 The town centre has several strengths and o pportunities not least  it s acce ssible 
location, particularly by public transport and est ablished walking and cycling links t o Tamworth’s neighbourhoods, which makes it a sustainable location for development. However, th ere are barriers to pedestrian move ment and t he quality o f the public realm is poor in places with excessive signag e, guard rails and poor quality street Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 47 furniture. Proposals to  address these issu es will be supported by future  
Supplementary Planning Documents where appropriate. 
 
4.31 The perception of th e town centre as a de stination of choice will be  addressed by 
improvements to the retail, leisure and service offer supporting the mark et along with 
expansion of its touri sm and cultura l role. A key element will involve enhancing the  role of the Castle Pleasure Grounds as a val uable sport, recreational, open space,  and leisure asset for the town, reinforcing it as an important link t o the out of cen tre retail parks.  The town centre’s ro le as a le isure hub will be promoted, making t he 
most of its existing leisure facilitie s whilst enco uraging a wider night ti me economy 
offer particu larly focusin g on family restaurants and cultur al activities.  The Retail Study identified a significant opportunity for the restaurant and bar market in the town centre, to capitalise  on the current low proportion of expenditure in re staurants and pubs in the town centre by residents within the Tamworth study area. T ogether with 
the lower than average proportion of such uses within the town centre, this market  
represents a key opportunity to exploit and widen the town centre’s attractiveness. 
 4.32 The Town Team, Destination Tamworth, will p lay a key role  in the future of the t own 
centre. Organisations fr om across Tamworth and from private, public and voluntary 
sectors have come tog ether to for m the group as they w ere concern ed about th e 
image and reputation of Tamworth  and wish to work toget her to unde rstand these perceptions and address issue s and seek solut ions. The gr oup is private sector led  and its aim is to promote a new strategic view of the distinctiveness of Tamworth and to influence developments, communications and actions across the Borough. 
 
4.33 A Creative Quarter is proposed which aspires to provide a busy and attractive square 
in the heart  of the tow n centre, fo cusing on  t he area ar ound Tamworth Library,  
Tamworth Assembly Rooms, the Carnegie Centre and Philip Dix Centre. The quarter will focus o n Tamworth’s cultural a nd heritage sites. It incl udes plans to sensitively and appropriately restore the 125-y ear-old Assembly Roo ms; plans f or a restaur ant 
based in th e Carnegie Centre; 15 business incubation units to help establish small 
and new e nterprises; improve ments to the town centre library; and, a new Town  Square drawing the Creative Quarter together and linking the area wit h the town’s  other major regeneration site: The Gungate.  
 4.34 The Gungate development is seen as cr itical t o delivering  the regene ration of th e 
town centre in terms of improving its offer to complement that of the out of town retail areas. The compact nature of its development a nd high quality design will link it into  the historic network of existing stre ets and alth ough predominantly ret ail led, ther e may be opp ortunities to  incorporate  a mixture of uses in cluding resid ential, leisur e and offices. The Gungate will therefore be a key catalyst for bringing fo rward further 
investment i n surrounding areas, increasing t he town centre’s attractiveness and 
overall viability and vitality. 
 4.35 A report entitled ‘Tamworth Town Centre and Out of Town Linkage Proposals’ (Town 
Centre Links Project) was prepared for the Cou ncil in December 2010 to assess the linkages between the town centre and the out of centre retail areas and leisure offer. 
The report considers lin kages between the town centre and Ventura Retail Park and  
the Snowdome in particular. The re port concludes that significant potent ial exists to  enhance the route along Fazeley Road by creating a unified character, improving th e quality of th e public rea lm, upgrading crossing s and introducing wider connectivity. The report proposes the use of Fa zeley Road as the main  link with a frequent bus 
service operating a circular route taking in Ventura Park Roa d, Bitterscote Drive and 
Bonehill Ro ad, with bu s stop s pro viding direct  acce ss be tween shops in the  tow n centre, Ventura Retail Park and Jolly Sailor Retail Park. A new pedestrian crossing at Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 48 the River Drive and Fazeley Road junction  could be integrated into proposed 
highway wo rks to  this junction. A  st ronger emphasis shou ld be p laced upon the  
pedestrian north-south linear axis linking the town centre to the retail parks. 
 4.36 A series of ‘gateway development sites’ situated at key ent rances to the town centre 
have been identified which have the opportunity  to create welcoming gateways to the 
town centre  through i mproving legibility, pro moting pedestrian and  cycle prior ity access to key linkages and assisting the delivery of town c entre regeneration. The linkages and gateway development sites are shown in Figure 4.1.

4.37 Elements of Policy EC2 will be  delivered in conjunction with other Policies within the 
Local Plan, such as protecting and enhancing the historic environment which will also be delivered through Policy EN6. 
 4.38 A number o f sites have  been allocated for residential development within the town  
centre under Policy HG1, helping  to achieve t he need for  high quality, high den sity residential d evelopment which will support the  future role and viability of the town 
centre.

 49 Town Centre Primary and Secondary Frontages 
 
4.39 Policy EC3 restricts use s within the primary and secondary shopping streets within 
the town ce ntre. In particular, ensur ing that the majority of units within the primary frontages ar e in retai l u se will en sure active fro ntages and support the vitality and  viability of the town centre. 
 4.40 In these areas it is important to retain accessible  local shops, particularly where they 
occupy large units or frontages, to retain and support a lively and viable centre. 
 4.41 The primary frontages  are split into section s for the p urpose of calculating t he 
percentage of retail units within them. This approach will pr event all of the non-retail  uses allowed being concentrated in one area.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP2, SP4, SP9  
EC3 Primary and Secondary Frontages 
 
The shopping area, defined on th e Policies Map town centre inset,  identifies t he 
primary and secondary frontages areas.  
 
The primary frontages have been subdivided into 5 evaluation areas: 
 PF1: Ankerside 
 PF2: Middle Entry – Includes 1-24  Middle Entry, 18, 18a and 19 Ge orge 
Street, 15-17 Market Street, 43-49 Church Street 
 PF3: George Street (north side) - Includes 20-38 George Street 
 PF4: George Street (so uth side) – Includes 1-1 7 George Street and 22, 23 , 
24 Market Street 
 PF5: Colehill – 1-5 Colehill (includes Co-op Department Store) 
 
Within the primary fron tages area,  it is expect ed that 75 % of the nu mber of units 
should fall within the A 1 (retail) u se class. Pla nning applications which would result 
in more tha n 25% non-retail uses within the re levant evaluation area of the primary 
frontage, sh own in Figure 4.2, will not be sup ported. Application s wit hin primary 
frontages which involve the loss of a use which would have an active frontage on the 
ground floor will be refused. 
 
Within secondary frontages, uses t hat result in  active ground floors or promote the 
evening economy will b e supported. Application s within secondary frontages which 
involve the loss of a use which would have an active frontage on the ground floor will 
be refused.

monitoring of the frontages and provide officers with the information required t o 
determine planning applications in line with Policy EC3. 
 Supporting Investment in Local and Neighbourhood Centres 
 4.44 Through Policy EC4, the mix of uses within lo cal and neighbourhood centres will be 
carefully managed, with an emphasis on protecting facilities that provide for people’s day to da y needs and community facilit ies unless it can be  demonstrated that they  are no long er required to serve local needs. L oss of A1 class uses at ground floo r 
level should  be resiste d to retain accessible local shops and a lively and viable  
centre, particularly where they occupy large units or frontages.  
4.45 Appropriate uses within local cent res also include small scale office s and those 
offering professional ad vice such as solicit ors or financial services. This type of u se 
would be suitable for smaller ground  floor units or upper floors. Some of the centre s Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 51 provide residential accommodation  above gro und floor, in purpose built flats o r 
converted floorspace.  Higher density residential sch emes within local a nd neighbourhood centres, including using upper floors above c ommercial uses, will be 
supported b ecause the y are sustainable loca tions with ge nerally good access to 
public transport. 
 4.46 Tamworth has a widespread network of shops and facilitie s outside the town centre, 
which are well distribu ted through out the Borough. Some are isolat ed but othe rs cluster together, either in purpose b uilt shopping centres or parades, many of which 
are located  within the 1960’s and  1970’s ove rspill ne ighbourhoods, o r they have  
evolved over time along main roads in the traditio nal housing areas. The Council has made a distinction bet ween local and neighb ourhood ce ntres, depe nding on th e range of services and catchment area served and these form part of the hierarchy of centres defined within Policy EC1. 
 4.47 The distinctive characteristics of ea ch  centre will be protect ed and promoted. There 
is scope for  making improvements  to t he public realm an d shopping environment, 
linked to ot her key objectives of increasing th eir accessibility, particularly by publ ic transport, walking and cycling. Their potential to become c ommunity regeneration  
hubs, particularly in the regenerati on priority areas, will be supporte d particularl y 
where this i nvolves delivering education-trainin g and healt h related fa cilities of a n appropriate scale.

EC4 Supporting Investment in Local and Neighbourhood Centres 
The local and neighbourhood centres in Tamworth are defined on the Policies Map. 
 
Both local and neighbourhood centres offer the potential to be a f ocus for the  
regeneration of surrounding commu nities and proposals which enhance their vitalit y 
and viability will be supported. These include hi gher density residential development 
and improvements to existing housing provision, particularly in those centres located 
within regeneration priority areas identified in Policy HG3.  
 
Environmental enhance ments, inclu ding improvements to g reen links a nd space s, 
will be supp orted and encouraged to improve their overall attractiveness and help 
design out crime. Transport improvements, particularly in relation to t he frequency 
and quality of public tra nsport provision and th e provision of bike stor age, will be  
encouraged to enhance the accessibility of centres. 
 
Local centres and neighbourhood centres are suitable for retail, leisure , employment 
uses, services and  community facilit ies serving local needs. Wit hin loca l a nd 
neighbourhood centres the loss of A1 (retail) uses will only be supported where:  
a) at least one of the  units remaining in the ce ntre acts as a g eneral convenience 
store 
b) the new use is compatible with the retail character of the centre or directly serves 
the needs of the local community 
c) the new use would not undermine the function and vitality of the centre 
 
New develo pment or proposed cha nges of use should m aintain or e nhance the  
range of uses available. 
 
Local and n eighbourhood centres ar e suitable locations for medium-higher density 
development, includin g residential where it is above ground floor, to support local  
services. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

Culture and Tourism 
 
4.53  Policy EC5  looks to b uild upon the strength and potential of Tamworth’s tourism 
sector, which owes much to its history and setting and is focussed on the town 
centre. The town centre is the most visited part of the Borough and the majority of its attractions are located  within the centre. However, Ta mworth suffers from a  po or 
image within the region, which reflects its recent history as a post war expanded town 
and the resulting urban form. A main contributing factor is the comparative weakness in respect  of the quality of the retail and le isure offer where a shor tfall of family orientated f ood and drink outlets a nd a predominance of pubs results in a narrow evening economy. In addition, aspects of the built environment are co nsidered to be poor, which  is compou nded by poor physical linkages with the out of  centre reta il 
areas which discourages linked trips. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 57  
4.54  Tamworth has a strong historic centre with a number of landmark buildings which are 
open to the public, Tamworth Castle and St. Editha’s Church being the most popular. 
The recent discovery of  the Staffordshire Hoard represents an opportunity for th e 
Borough to exploit its connection to Mercian history and increase its tourism role.   
4.55 In addition  to the town  centre, a  unique clu ster of sport  and leisure  facilities are  
located immediately south and east of the town centre within the Castle Grounds, forming a focus for ev ents and a ctivities. Ta mworth also has the benefit of t he 
extensive green linkage s that run t hrough the Borough and out to the  countryside 
beyond. Proximity to the  river and canal networks also presents a uniq ue recreation and under-used tourist resource.  
 4.56 It is recognised that to expand the offer of Tamworth to wn centre to local residen ts 
and visitors alike, cultur al development is seen as a key catalyst, in conjunction with  other local investment. The current  focus for many cultural related  e vents is the Assembly Rooms. However it is limited in its ability to deliver further events, due to its 
age, historic grade II listing an d its overall quality as a venue. Significa nt improvements and extensions to the existing Assembly Rooms building are therefore 
proposed to cater for events and activities which at the current time ca nnot be met , 
primarily due to current building limitations. It is envisaged that the Assembly Roo ms 
will form the focal point of a cultural quarter for the town. 
 4.57 Tamworth i s currently lacking an  a ppropria te conference a nd exhibitio n facility for 
local businesses and th e local community. Existing venues are too small and were  
designed fir st and fore most for purposes othe r than conf erences, exhibitions an d 
training. A purpose built facility would enhance the reputation of the are a as a p lace in which to  do busine ss, provide sustai nable opportunit ies for employment, bo th 
directly and  indirectly. The second ary effect s from such a facility would also b e 
beneficial with increased potential for take up of the local tourism offer and hospitality 
venues through an increase in business tourism. 
 
4.58 The improvements to the physical linkages and signage between the town centre and 
the out of centre retail parks, leisur e zone and railway station will make them more convenient and attractive to use. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP2 and SP9

The Council will work with partner agencies and organisations that: 
a) Safeguard existing cultural facilit ies that are  serviceable  or which continue to 
provide a service to the communit y, and support the expansion of th e Assembly 
Rooms as the centrepiece of the emerging Creative Quarter 
b)  Promote, protect and enhance Tamworth’s landscape character and heritage 
c) Support proposals f or the provision of a  diverse range of cultu ral facilities,  
including leisure and conference facilities within Tamworth Town Centre 
d) Encourage leisure and cultural  facilitie s as part of mixed use development

i) Deliver improved ph ysical linka ges between the out of centre retail parks, th e

j) Encourage the regeneration and restoration of the rivers and the Coventry Canal

k) Improve the transpor t connection s and phy sical routes t hrough promoting what  
already exi sts to visito r attractions outside of Tamworth;  particularly to Dra yton 
Manor, Kingsbury Waterpark, Middleton La kes and t he National Memorial 
Arboretum. 
 
Planning applications that achieve these aims will be supported. 
 
4.59 The Council and its part ners’ overall vision is to raise the pr ofile of Tamworth within  
the Heart of England, promoting it as ‘A Market Town for t he 21st Century’. A ke y 
component of this is partnership working with tourism organisations and neighbouring local authorities to promote Tamworth as a visitor destination. 
 
4.60  An attractive town centre is a key element of the tourism offer. Much of Tamwort h’s 
future success depend s on regenerating the town centre in order to improve  th e 
perception and image of the town as a destination for retail and le isure. Major redevelopment schemes such as the Gungate site provide the opportunity to provide 
a development built to a high sta ndard of d esign that complement s the historic 
centre. Investment in major schemes should ge nerate a knock-on effect to stimulate  
wider regeneration. Public realm impr ovements encompassing high quality paving 
and street furniture would enhance the visitor experience. 
 4.61 As the Ancient Capital of Mercia, Tamworth is hugely significant in the  Saxon story.  
The Hoard has resulted in the Mercian Trail being developed with the major partners, 
Birmingham, Stoke-on-Trent, Lichfield and Tamworth. Ea ch area will focus on a 
different aspect of the Saxon era. Tamworth will focus o n the Royal and Militar y stories, Lichfield, the religious aspect, Stoke-on-Trent the actual find and archaeology of the hoar d and Birmingham the trading lin ks and craftsmanship. Stoke-on-Trent 
and Birmin gham will continue to  house the majority o f the find, Lichfield an d 
Tamworth will hopefull y have a permanent exhibition with some of the items. 
Tamworth Castle will look to f ind funds to re develop the top floor  of  the Castle  to house such an exhibition that will attract visitors to the town. 
 4.62 Partnerships such as Wild About Tamworth,  Central Ri vers Initiative and Tame  Valley Wetlands Partnership are invaluable and successful in brin ging togeth er 
biodiversity and people and present the opport unity to cre ate an enh anced visitor experience by combining landsca pe and recr eation opp ortunities with improved  access, interpretation and habitat restoration in accessible urban locations and t he river valley. The restoration and re generation of the rivers and the Coventry Canal 
will form the basis of p rojects pro moted through the Central Rivers Initiative (CRI) 
(Tamworth i s perceived as a key gateway location into t he CRI an d, as such, 
opportunities to promote this role will need to be ma ximised). Linked to this is the RSPB nature reserve at Middleton Lakes, which is located to the south just outside of Tamworth within Lichfield District.  The reserve is expec ted to become the most important site for breeding birds in the West Midlands and will undoubtedly attract a Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 59 significant numbers of visitors. Other attractions o utside the Bor ough but on 
Tamworth’s doorstep  include Drayton Manor Theme Park, Kingsbur y Water Park, The Belfry golf cour se and the Nat ional Memorial Arboretu m at Alrewas. Improving  
the public tr ansport access to these attractions from the Borough is seen as a ke y 
objective to increase the overall attractiveness of Tamworth as a tourism destination.  
 
Employment Land and Economic Growth 
 
4.63 A significant  contributio n of the Local Plan to create a diverse local e conomy an d 
achieve eco nomic prosperity in Tamworth is to ensure th at sufficient  employme nt 
land is available in the right locations in order to support local businesses, encourage 
expansion of small business and attract inward investment. 
 4.64  Tamworth is strateg ically located a t the heart  of the moto rway network with close 
links to the M42 and M6 toll and the A5 which runs through the Borou gh. Tamworth also benefit s from excellent railway links to Lo ndon, Birmingham, Ma nchester an d 
Nottingham, with Tamworth Rail St ation being on both the Cross Cou ntry Line an d 
the West Coast Mainline. 
 4.65  In recent years there ha s been an increase in investment from the logistics and  high 
skilled man ufacturing sectors. However, the  amount o f employment land has 
declined in Tamworth in the last de cade with significant red evelopment of a number 
of sites for residential purposes, includi ng Tame Valley Alloys, Metrocab, Doulton s 
and Smurfit. This has left a ne twork of strategic emplo yment area s distribute d throughout the Borough which will be required to meet future employment needs. 
 4.66  Delivering economic growth will be crucial to ensure that Tamworth has a robust and 
growing economy in the  future, to r aise prosperity for its r esidents and businesses and to enable it to continue to play a key role within  establish ed economic  partnerships. However, Tamworth’s economy does not sit in isolat ion; there are a  range of ar eas where people curr ently work outside of t he Borough in the We st Midlands, mainly Birmingham, Lichfield, Solihull and North Warwickshire in particular  
Birch Coppice, alongside potential future locations such as Whittington Barracks in 
Lichfield. To assist  with delivering a growing, prosperou s economy, partnership  working acr oss Tamworth’s funct ioning econo mic geography will be essential , particularly as Tamworth is unable to meet its employment needs within the Borough.  
 
Sustainable Economic Growth 
 4.67 Policy EC6 allocates 18ha of new employment land to provide for the  assessed level 
of economic growth anticipated over the Local P lan period. These sites extend and  enhance the existing network of strategic employment areas within Tamworth.  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP1, SP2, SP3, SP12 
EC6 Sustainable Economic Growth 
Sustainable economic growth will be delivered through protecting and enhancing the 
existing network of strategic employment  areas; promoting the role of the town  
centre and; providing at least 18 hectares of new employmen t land to meet some of 
Tamworth’s additional employment land needs up to 2031 . The allo cation of new 
employment sites to deliver B1 (b ,c), B2 and B8 uses will support  the existing 
network.  
 
The following sites, as shown on the Policies Map will be allocated for employment:

 Strategic Employment Areas 
 4.71 Policy EC7  supports t he protectio n of existing and proposed employment land  in 
Tamworth for employment uses and sets out the criteria for assessin g applications for non B1(b and c), B2 and B8 uses in strategic employment areas. 
 
4.72  The Employment Land Review 2012 looked at the existing portfolio of employment  
land and in general none of the  existing emplo yment areas were con sidered to be 
performing poorly as a  whole, alth ough some parts of th e employme nt estates d id have high vacancy levels. The market view confirmed that there was a demand for units in the majority of the employment areas and that they had relative strengths and 
weaknesses for businesses of different types looking to locate there which supported 
a diverse Tamworth market. Consequently the Review highlighted that the network of strategic e mployment areas shou ld be retaine d in employment use although some  parts may need modernisation and environmental enhancements.  
 4.73  However th e review di d highlight issues with  Kettlebrook Road Industrial Estat e 
related to it s location and surrounding uses. T he industrial estate, not  considered to be strategic in its size, is constrained by  the A5 bypass and the adjacent railway line 
and is surrounded by residential properties to the west, all of which are considered to limit the scope for expa nsion. Furthermore, because of poor access to the strategic highway ne twork it is not conside red an attractive location for mod ern business  
requirements and therefore significa nt redevelopment for e mployment uses may b e 
challenging.  
 4.74  It is eviden t that improvements n eed to be made to the network of strategic 
employment areas, including the environmenta l quality and transport network such as road su rfacing. Fur thermore there is significant po tential for th e strategic 
employment areas to d eliver the p rovision of renewable and low carbon energy 
initiatives t hrough the retrofitting  of renewable energy techniques, such as photovoltaic and green  roofs. In  a ddition, improvements to the layou t of existin g 
strategic e mployment areas could  increase  th e possib ility of using combined heat and power. 
 4.75  There has been increa sing pressu re for altern ative town centre uses on existing 
strategic e mployment areas. However there is a risk th at this could be to the detriment of the function of the strategic employment areas and also that of the town centre. It is therefore important that the B class use s r emain at the strategic 
employment areas. Any change of use to al ternative uses would have to demonstrate 
that the unit was not att ractive to the market, th e alternative use could not be more  
sustainably accommodated elsewhere, the accessibility of t he proposal by a variety Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 68 of sustainable transport modes and that the change would not be detrimental to the  
role of the strategic employment area. 
 
4.76 New offices B1(a) should be locate d within the town centre. If no sites are available 
then strate gic employment areas could be  considered for office d evelopment, 
providing this helps deliver the overall stra tegy and is not in locatio ns that would b e 
considered detrimental to the future vitality and viability of the town centre.  
This is policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP3, SP12  
EC7 Strategic Employment Areas 
The existing network of strategic employment areas comprises of the following; 
 Bitterscote (Bonehill Road, Cardinal Point, Bitterscote South) 
 Tame Valle y Employment Area (Hedging Lane, Two Gates, Tame Valley 
Industrial Estate) 
 Amington Employment Area 
 Lichfield Road Employment Area 
 Centurion Park Employment Area 
 Relay Park Employment Area 
 
These areas are identified on the Policies Map.  
 
Planning permission should be granted for B1 (b,c), B2 and B8 uses on the network 
of strategic employment areas identified on the Policies Map. The expa nsion of any 
existing business within  these use classe s will be supported, provided it promotes 
and supports the role and performance of t he employment area i n meeting t he 
strategic economic objectives of the plan and the wider objectives of sub-regional 
economic partnerships.  
 
Where planning permission is prop osed for non B1(b, c), B2 and B8 uses within 
strategic employment areas, the devel opment will be required to demonstrate: 
a) through an indepen dent assessment, that the site is n o longer att ractive to the  
market for its existing permitted use, which will include evidence that it has been 
marketed for a period of at least 12 months, a market view of the site and details of 
the marketing. 
b) evidence to demonstrate that there are no other more suitable locations outside of 
strategic employment areas that are available 
c) good accessibility by walking, cycling and public transport, and 
d) there will be no direct or cumulative negative impact o n the vitality, viability o r 
function of strategic employment areas and other centres.  
 
To ensure the susta inability and vi ability of t he strategi c employment areas, new 
development should pr ovide appropriate soft and hard landscaping,  permeable  
surfaces and appropriately designed signage and lighting.  
 
 
4.77  Policy EC7  will ensure that suffi cient land suitable for  employme nt use will  be  
retained for that purpose, whilst also being sufficiently flexible to allow f or alternative 
provision where appropriate and necessary, and where the re is no other option. Th e protection of the strategic employment areas will be monitored using indicators such  as the tota l amount of additional em ployment floorspace an d land by u se class and the total loss of employment land.

spatial portrait in Chapt er 2. The st rategy for housing set  out in Chap ter 3 requir es the maxi mum delivery of housing  on suitable sites wit hin Tamworth while co -operating with other authorities a nd the Gre ater Birmin gham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership  to meet  the remaining need in Lichfie ld and North  
Warwickshire.  
 
Housing 
 
5.3  Policy HG1 will support the provision of new homes in Tamworth to meet the housing 
requirement for the Pla n period. A  rigorous a ssessment of potential developme nt land was ca rried out as described  in the Tamworth Pre-submission Lo cal Plan Sit e Selection P aper (2014) and informed by the T amworth Pre-submissio n Local Pla n Sustainability Appraisal (2014), ot her evidence and con sultations. Deliverable o r developable sites were selected for allocatio n. These include sustainable urban extensions to the north of Tamworth’s existing urban area at Anker Valley, in the east 
at the former Golf Course and towards the west at Dunst all Lane. Th ese sites will 
bring forward a total of 2,358 dwellings. Aside from these sustai nable urban  
extensions there is a limited supply of suitable land for ho using development withi n 
Tamworth. By allocatin g these oth er sites a f urther 625 dwellings wi ll be broug ht forward on deliverable or developable sites ent irely outside Flood Zone  3. A further 
140 dwellings have be en allocated on site s covered by the Level 2 S trategic Flood 
Risk Asse ssment (2014), these sites will be  subject  to  site specific flood  risk assessments. These sites have been allocat ed to allow and encourage further housing development within Tamworth. Ther efore 765 dwellings a llocated by HG1  
could come forward. Broad expectations for all h ousing developments are set out in  the policy and specific r equirements for allocated sites are described in the following 
supporting text. These will allow planning deci sions to improve the s ustainability of 
housing development.   
This policy aims to a ddress Strategic Spatial Priorities SP1, SP5 , SP7, SP9,  
SP10, SP12  
HG1 Housing  
Within Tamworth a net increase at least 4,425 dwellings will be delivered within the 
plan period at an avera ge of 177 u nits per annum. At least 2,358 dwellings will be  
provided for within sustainable urban extensions (policy HG2). The remainder will be 
provided within or adja cent to the  existing ur ban area ta king the op portunity to  
maximise the effective use of brownfield land in sustainable locations. 
 
Development to meet  Tamworth’s housing needs within Lichfield  and Nort h 
Warwickshire will be set out within their respective Local Plans.  
 
Housing de velopment will be expected to contribute t o the achi evement of 
sustainable communities. The Council will secure high quality housing development 
that contrib utes to cre ating inclu sive and safe mixed co mmunities and reducing  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 71 health inequalities, well served by p ub lic transport, pedestrian and cycle links.  This 
will be achi eved by req uiring a mix of well desi gned dwellings of the ri ght size an d 
affordability and will be supported by services, facilit ies and infrastructure to meet 
community needs. Contributions to off-site infrastruct ure will be required in  
accordance with policy IM1 Infrastructure and Developer Contributions.

Sustainable Urban Extensions 
 
5.6        Policy HG2 establishe s that sustainable urban extensions are more than just  
housing. Th e policy will  ensure tha t each extension, wher e necessary, will de liver 
supporting infrastructur e to create a sustaina ble, inclu sive communit y. This ma y 
include a n eighbourhood centre, community fa cilities, the  provision of a primary school (in a ddition to th e enlargement of existing primary and secondary schools in 
Tamworth) and a well designed environment. All of the sustainable urban extensions 
will be expected to provide on-site open space and both public access and wildlife  
links to the  surroundin g neighbourhoods and rural areas.  To reduce the risk of flooding an d to contr ibute towards water management objectives, op portunities f or the inclusion of sustain able drainage systems will be soug ht and may be combined with open space or wildlife corridors as multi-functional green infrastructure.  
 5.7 Good accessibility by public tran sport to the town centre a nd employment areas will  
be a critical requirement for each proposal. All housing must be within 350m of a bu s stop with a half hourly or greater frequency bus service. Internal trips will be  
maximised through the provision of services and facilities on site and  having a hig h 
degree of public transp ort accessibility will reduce the need to travel b y private car, 
therefore minimising congestion on the local road network. 
 5.8 Each locati on will require measures to be put into pla ce includi ng appropriate  
enhancement or creation of landscape features on the edge of the open countryside. This i s of particular importance with Anker Valley, which will need  to take  int o 
consideration the character appraisal for Amin gton Hall Estate Conservation Area Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 86 which identifies  it s prin cipal fe ature as be ing the setting  of open co untryside a nd 
woodland and the long distance open rural and semi-rural views available from within 
its boundaries. Similarly, Dunstall  Lane will n eed to con sider Hopwas Conservation 
Area and th e Green Belt nearby in  Lichfield District. Developers will n eed to have 
regard to maintaining th e setting of the conservation areas through careful design,  
layout and landscaping. The Local Plan Heritage Impact Assessment (2014) provides further info rmation about heritag e assets a ffected by the Susta inable Urb an Extensions and should be consulted. 
  
This policy aims to a ddress Strategic Spatial Priorities SP1, SP4 , SP5, SP7,  
SP9, SP10, SP12  
HG2 Sustainable Urban Extensions  
Anker Valley, Tamworth Golf Course and Dun stall Lane, as shown o n the Policies 
Map will be allocated for housing with accompanying services and infrastructure.  
 
Where appropriate all sustainable urban extensions should:  
a) Encourage the co-location of any re quired community infrastructure, re tail or 
services to form a ne w local or neighbourhood centre. All new infrastructure  
should be e asily accessible by foot, cycle and other sustainable modes of 
transport.  
b) Be well connected int ernally and to the adjacent urban areas, the town  
centre, emp loyment are as and green infrastructure by means of walking, 
cycling and  public tran sport. This will to help  maxi mise internal trips and 
sustainable travel whilst mitigating the traffic impacts of the  proposal o n the 
strategic and local road  network. Opportunities for active tr avel and ou tdoor 
recreation will support healthy lifestyles. 
c) Ensure that the develo pment is of a high quality, sustainable and inclusive 
design and that the layo ut reflects the requireme nts of Policy EN5  Design of 
New Development . This will be  tested through an appropriate design review 
process informed by local and nationally recognised design standards. 
d) Protect, utilise and enh ance existing and provide additiona l green and  blue 
infrastructure linkage s t o the adjacent and sur rounding gr een space and 
waterscape networks an d the urban  area. Wher e appropriat e new habit ats 
should be created and links made to  existing sites of high biodiversity value. 
All developments should positively contri bute towards meeting the objectives 
of the Water Framework Directive.  
e) Create integrated, distinctive neighbourhoods to meet t he needs of th e 
community including young and old er persons and families to ensure  social 
cohesion. The provision of community gro wing space s or com munity 
orchards should be considered as part of  the development, and be  
accessible to those with restricte d mobility. The inclu sion of Fle xicare 
schemes for older people should be  considered as part of t he development 
where feasible. 
f) Development must en sure that surface water runoff is managed u sing 
sustainable drainage measures to limit discharge rates from the site t o the 
pre-development (i.e. g reenfield) condition, to  ensure no increase in  f lood 
risk to off-site areas or loss of water quality.

Anker Valley  
Anker Valley is located on agricultural land and  will form an urban extension in  
the north of  Tamworth. Although ph ysically separated by the rail netwo rk fro m 
the town it should be well connecte d to Tamwo rth Town Centre and Tamwort h 
Rail Statio n. It will provide at least  535  new dwellings an d associated 
infrastructure as detailed below. The development should: 
 Minimise visual impact and protect long distance views to and from th e nearby 
Amington Hall Estate Conservation Area and listed buildings.   
 The eastern boundary should be  landscape d to provid e a transition to the 
countryside and the southern bo undary should include  landsca ping and low 
intensity recreational uses.  
 Conserve fabric and legibility of historic lan dscape cha racter. Development 
should be of a design and scale which enhance s the local distinct iveness and 
respects local vernacular. 
 Create pedestrian and cycle access  to the existing urban area west of the site.  
 Make green links for wildlife to the Warwickshire Moor Local Nature Reserve and 
the wider green infrastructure network. 
 Where feasible direct development  to land tha t is not best and most versatile 
agricultural land.  
 Take into consideration the potential for archa eology through an arch aeological 
desk based assessment and/or archaeological field evaluation. 
 
Required Infrastructure: 
 A new primary school and contributions to secondary school 
 Local convenience store 
 New public open space, play facilities and sports provision in line with other 
policies of the Local Plan and the Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
 North Tamworth Local Transport Package 
 
Golf Course  
The site is located on Tamworth Golf Course and will form an urban extension in 
the east of Tamworth up to the administrative boundary with North Warwickshire. 
It will provide at least  1,100 new dwellings and associ ated infrastr ucture as 
detailed below. The development: 
 Must take into consid eration the e xisting oil pipeline and electricity pylons and 
adhere to guidelines for development. 
 Must establish two poin ts of vehicular access o nto Mercian Way. The existing  
access to t he golf cour se along Ea gle Drive is suitable f or one, with a  second 
point of access coming directly onto Mercian Way south of the Woodland Road – 
Mercian Way roundabout.    
 Must avoid any impact on the nearby Al vecote Pools Site of Special Scientific 
Interest and mitigation should ensure there is no impact d ue to waste , surface 
water run-off, predation or increased recreational use of Alvecote Pools.  
 Should take into consid eration the Hodge Lan e Local Nature Reserve, which  
could be achieved through wildlife a reas, additional planting of native species t o 
provide a buffer and green linkages by pedestrian or cycleway. Wildlife corridors 
should be created between Hodge Lane Local Nature Reserve, Tamworth Gol f 
Course (portion of) Site of County Biological Importance, Coventry Canal and the 
wider green infrastructure network.  
 Reduce the  urban edg e effect on  the canal,  with particular attentio n to the 
treatment of the northern site boundary.  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 88  Should be sensitively designed in terms o f layout, s cale, materials and 
landscaping to ensure no adverse impact on the charact er and setting of the 
canal and listed bridges.  
 Take into consideration the potential for archa eology through an arch aeological 
desk based assessment and/or archaeological field evaluation. 
 May pro vide the oppor tunity to relocate an existing doct or’s GP sur gery and  
extend the range of services offered.  
 
Required Infrastructure: 
 A new primary school and contributions to secondary school 
 Local convenience store 
 New public open space, play facilities and sports provision in line with other 
policies of the Local Plan and the Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
 Modifications to the Glascote Road/Marlborough Way roundabout junction.  
 
Dunstall Lane  
The site is located o n agricultur al land an d will be p art of a mixed use  
development extending from existing employ ment and retail areas in the  west of 
Tamworth. It will pr ovide at least 723 new dwellings and associated 
infrastructure as detailed below. The development: 
 Should have regard to the Hopwas Conservation Area in Lichfield District and  
the two listed bridges within Tamworth.  
 Should include the retention and sympathetic restoration o f Dunstall Farm and  
historic brick barns as part of development for residential or commercial use.  
 Should reduce the urban edge effect on the can al, with particular attention to the 
treatment of the site bo undary with the canal, t hrough sensitive layout, design, 
scale, materials and la ndscaping. Where possible the hed gerow between the 
site and canal towpath should be retained and only opened up in part to  enable 
views out of the site and make the most of the setting.  
 Take into consideration the potential for archa eology through an arch aeological 
desk based assessment and/or archaeological field evaluation. 
 Should ens ure there i s no adv erse im pact on the Riv er Tam e and Broad 
Meadow LNR. The site is also within close proximity to the Coventry Canal which 
is an ecological corridor so any potential impact must be taken into  
consideration. 
 Should ade quately mitigate or co mpensate for the lo ss of floodp lain grazing  
marsh UK Biodiversity Action Plan priori ty habitat, which covers a large  portion 
of the site. This should reduce the net loss or impact to the ecologica l networks 
and priority species populations. 
 Should provide appropriate landsca ping and on-site open space to link with th e 
river and canal corridor s, flood plain and wider green infrastructure ne twork. In 
addition to  this the  existing an cient hedgero ws should be retained  and site 
design and layout should take the landscape character into consideration. 
 Must establish two points of vehicular access. 
 Should ensure that the public right of way through the site  remains or mitigation 
to provide an appropriate alternative route.  
 
Required Infrastructure: 
 A new primary school and contributions to secondary school 
 Local convenience store 
 New public open space, play facilities and sports provision in line with other

 Provision of  improved pedestrian and cy cle connections to the A51 Lichfield 
Road from north of the development site.  
 
In addition to the above, Staffordshire County Council an d Tamworth  Borough 
Council acknowledge th at an additional pedest r ian bridge over the river and flood 
relief chann el (linking t he Dunstall Lane SUE with the A51 to the n orth) would  
increase accessibility to the proposed primary school o n the site and t o retail a nd 
other services at the Ve ntura and Jolly Sailor r etail parks f or residents who live to  
the north of the A51. 
 
Future resid ents of the Dunstall La ne SUE would also be able to achieve some  
journey time savings for pupils travelling to se condary school and for employees 
accessing the Lichfield Road Industrial Estate. The two Co uncils will work towards 
delivery of the bridge, including securing plan ning permission for it  a nd securing 
funding for  its con struction. The Co uncil will seek finan cial contribut ions towards 
the construction of the bridge from d evelopment schemes in the surrounding area.  
The contrib utions paid  by adjacent developers will be commensurate with the  
improvements to the accessibility of their d evelopment sites that would be 
delivered by the bridge.  
 
5.9 The infrastr ucture requirements for t he sustainable urban extensions are furthe r 
detailed in  the Infrastructure Delivery Plan i n Appendix B within t he relevant 
infrastructure categories. Plan comp liant notional schemes f or each site have been  tested as p art of the  Whole Plan  Viability, A ffordable H ousing and  Communit y Infrastructure Levy Study (2014) making allowance for costs including the essential infrastructure items to make each site deliverable.  
 5.10  HG2 will be supported by vision st atements or development briefs set ting high level 
proposals designed in collaboration with statutory consultees and other stakeholders. The Council will work with the land owners and developers of each sit e to produce  masterplans informed by the policie s set out in this L ocal Plan to furt her guide th e

 93 Regeneration Priority Areas 
 
5.11  Policy HG3  will ensure  that the p otential ben efits of re generation ar e realised  i n 
areas of Ta mworth whe re redevelopment is so ught and a nticipated. The Council’s priorities for  regeneratio n focus on neighbourhoods with hig h levels of  deprivation, and where there may be a need to redevelop some public housing  stock tha t is coming to the end of it s useful life. In addition, the Wilnecote Corridor along Watling  Street has been identif ied as an area requiring a comprehensive approach to  regenerating vacant or underused  privat e property and improving th e immediate  
environment to enhance this important transport corridor. 
 
The post war social housing areas 
 
5.12  HG3 will build on Tam worth’s goo d record of  neighbourhood regenera tion throug h 
focusing interventions in the most deprived neighbourhoods. Within Ta mworth four  distinct neig hbourhoods have been identified  as Council p riority areas. These are 
Amington, Belgrave, Glascote, and  Stonydelph . The Locality Working initiative has been established to address disad vantage wit hin these defined communities. In addition the re are two other areas outside t hese loca lities that display similar attributes concerning housing and health. These all share common ph ysical 
characteristics, namely being locat ed within the  post war p lanned neig hbourhoods 
and consisting of predominantly social housing which is either currently, or predicted  
to require investment and regeneration during the lifetime of the Local Plan. 
 5.13 On this basis, the neigh bourhoods listed below have been i dentified as regeneration 
priority areas, as a result of demonstrating high levels of deprivation or a poor quality environment. The regeneration priority areas are identified in figure 5.4 
  
 Amington   
 Glascote Heath 
 Stonydelph   
 Belgrave 
 Tinkers Green  
 Leyfield 
 
5.14  HG3 will ensure that development in these areas will n ot only improve housing 
standards but contrib ute to decreasing levels of dep rivation and improvin g environmental quality. Requiremen ts will se ek to improve access to jobs an d 
services, protect local character a nd sense of communit y whilst improving and  enhancing the natural environment and mitigating the impacts of climate change.   Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

 95 The Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor 
 
5.15 HG3 will facilitate the i mprovement of the area  surrounding Wilnecote  Rail Station. 
The Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor (shown on figure 5.5) runs along Watling Street 
for almost half a mile. In addition to having rail access to Birmingham it is a well used 
stretch of road linking residential areas together and providing access to a significant employment area in Ta mworth, Tame Valley industrial e state and out  of town ret ail areas and access to Drayton Manor theme park.  
 5.16  Regeneration in the area will address a number of issu es, includ ing derelict a nd 
empty plots of land tha t have not been developed, poor pedestrian and cycle links to surrounding areas and an unattractive public realm created by dat ed building s, neglected landscaping and vehicle access points on to  Watling Street. Additionally the rail station and its surroundings could be improved by overcoming its current poor visibility an d adding t o the limite d facil ities. Due to varied land o wnership, t he 
constraint of the intersecting railway line and  existing de velopment the area ha s 
lacked a strategic direction to improvement and  has becom e run down.  Within and  adjacent to  the area ar e residentia l, employme nt, takeawa y, automotive and retail  properties, a working men’s club,  a commun ity hall and  new public open space.  These facilities and the rail station will be better exploited with improved appearance 
and accessibility.

HG3 Regeneration Priority Areas  
In the following areas the focus for regeneration will be o n improving the physical 
environment and delivering soci al and economic renewal. 
 
1. Post war planned neighbourhoods 
These areas shown on figure 5.4 are identified for regeneration with the purpose of 
revitalising the housing areas and building cohesive and sustainable communities.  
 
Where feasible and appropriate, development in these areas should: 
a) improve the  quality of t he existing housing sto ck, providin g new and existing 
properties with renewable and lo w carbon technologie s or energy efficien cy 
measures. 
b) enhance the mix of housing within the area that meets local needs. 
c) improve or provide local community fa cilities an d services where opportunities 
are available. 
d) protect and enhance the network of high quality open space. 
e) support the vitality and viability of existing local and neighbourhood centres. 
f) increase integration o f the area s with surrounding a reas and improve 
accessibility to employment, key servic es an d the town centre by walking, 
cycling and  public tran sport, facilit at ing improved public health by supporting 
active lifestyles. 
g) be of a  high quality de sign which contributes towards designing out crime and 
improving the attractiveness of the area. 
 
2. Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor 
The Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor is d efined on the P olicies Map. Proposals t o 
enhance the roadside environment or improve Wilnecote Rail Station and its access 
by bus or active travel will be supported.  The Council will actively support mixed use 
and high density develo pment and adopt a flexible approach to land uses where 
they will co ntribute to r egeneration. Proposals t hat include housing, commercial or 
community facilities or a mix of these uses will be supported where: 
h) Active ground floor frontages are provided. 
i) New buildings or altera tions are de signed to improve the  visual quality of th e 
public realm. 
j) External areas facing  the street a re landscap ed to creat e a more attractive  
environment for pedestrians and cyclists. 
k) Any opportunities are taken to improve pedestrian and cycle access between the 
Regeneration Corridor and surrounding areas. 
l) Mitigation measures are  provided if proportionate and nece ssary in accordance  
with the oth er policies in the Local Plan to prevent conflict with neighbouring 
uses or other uses on site. 
  
The Council will work with landowners, businesses and developers to discuss site 
specific opt ions and include guid ance in th e Design Supplementary Planning 
Document.  
 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 97 5.18 Within the Post War Planned Neig hbourhoods, a partnership approach will del iver 
HG3. The Council, Registered Pr oviders of affordable h ousing and  other service 
providers will ensure the  housing stock is refreshed to meet changing needs. Key to 
achieving this will be promoting an d protecting the role of local and neighbourhoo d 
centres which lie  within  and adja cent to these  neighbourhoods to en sure services  and facilities, including retail, remain acce ssible particularly to those without access to a car. The existing Locality Working initiative involves a neighbourhood level multi-agency approach to focus resources upon a defined community. This has resulted in the provision of commu nity hubs in  the local o r neighbour hood centre  within each  
locality providing accommodation for local services and supporting initiatives for local 
people with a community space.   
5.19 Delivery of the Wilnecot e Regeneration Corridor will involve promoting a vision of an 
attractive and well connected mixed use area centred on Wilnecote Rail Station. The 
Council wit h landowners, busine sses and d evelopers will explore options fo r 
improvements to existing properties, new  developments and the small contributions 
that each si te can make to conne ctivity and the street e nvironment. This will b e delivered through the planning system and business engagement.  
5.20  Delivering improve ments within the Wilnecote  Regeneration Corridor creates an  
opportunity to align with the Fazeley component of Lichfield District’s Rural Planning Project. This approach to rural master planning  results in a set of gu iding principles relating to improvements in relation to  the environment, traffic management, housing 
and socia l well-being.  Work to date has identified th e need to  address t he environment along the former A5.   Affordable Housing  
5.21 Policy HG4  sets an overall mini mum target  for afforda ble housing  provision in  
Tamworth f or the Plan period and minimu m requirements of affordable housing  
provision on private housing develo pments. The policy also supports t he delivery of  
further affor dable housing by the release of p ublic sector  and Regist ered Provider land. The Southern Staffordshire  Districts H ousing Needs Study a nd Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment Updat e (2012) indicates a n et housing need of 183 affordable d wellings per  annum. The plan set s a realist ically deliverable minimu m level of affordable housing from developers towards meeting this need.  
 5.22  The Whole Plan Viabilit y, Affordable Housing and Community Infrastructure Levy 
Study (201 4) includes an affordabl e housing viability asse ssment. The affordable  housing assessment tested 9 scenarios loo king at diff erent overall provisions of 
affordable h ousing and  also diff erent split s bet ween rented and shar ed ownership  
within each . The stud y exa mined recent p lanning histo ry and cur rent market  
information to understand the value and costs of development. It has been concluded from the study that for sites of 1 an d 2 units th ere would be no on site  provision and no commuted sum for af fordable housing. On sites of 3  to 9  units a  commuted sum for an equivalent of 20% affordable housing will be sought and for all sites of 10 units or more an  on site provision of 20% affordable housin g. The Coton Lane and 
Dunstall Lane sites can viably provide a higher level of 25% affordable housing. The 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment identif ied that the  split of  affordable housing tenure should be 50% Social Rented, 25% Affo rdable Rented and 25% Intermediate  Tenure. 
 
5.23  However, whilst this level of affordable housing is considered to be de liverable, HG4 
recognises that there may still be factors which make a site unviable and the Council Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 98 will need to  be flexible on a site b y site basis whilst stil l seeking to maximise the  
proportion of affordable housing.  
 
5.24 To establish a deliverable annual requirement the thresholds set out  above have  
been applie d to the su pply of proposed housin g allocat ions and sust ainable urba n 
extensions. When applying the thresholds th e future supply is identified as 63 6 dwellings. The total supply also incl udes existing completions of affordable dwellin gs so far in th e Plan period. In total 335 units h ave been completed and 56 units are committed (Residential Land Avai lability and  Homes a nd Commu nities Agen cy 
monitoring as of 31
st March 2014). A minimum total of approximately 1,000 affordable 
dwellings will therefore come forward between 2006 and 2031.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priority SP5  
HG4 Affordable Housing 
The provision of at lea st 1,000 affordable housing units over the Plan p eriod will be 
sought, approximately 4 0 per annum. The pro vision of affordable housing to meet 
local need s will be maximised through working in part nership wit h relevant 
organisations. The rele ase and de velopment f or affordable housing of Council,  
Registered Provider and other public bodies’ surplus land holdings will be sought. 
 
Unless demonstrated to  be unviable through an independent assessment by a  
suitably qualified person, the Council will require: 
a) new residential development invol ving 10 or more d wellings (gross) to 
provide a target of 20% affordable dwellings on site. 
b) The Land N orth of Coto n Lane (40 6) and Dunstall Lane  sites allocate d in 
Policies HG1 and HG2 will be expected to provide a target of 25% affordable  
dwellings on site. 
c) new residential development involving 3 to 9  dwellings (gross) to provide a 
financial contribution through a Section 106 agreement, equivalent to a target 
of 20% on site affordable dwellings. 
d) for on sit e provision a mix of 25% Intermediate Tenure a nd 75% Re nted 
which should be split between Social Rented and Affordable Rented.  
e) a range of  sizes of r esidential d wellings to  be provided to meet local 
requirements. 
f) a range of  housing to meet the  needs of older persons, persons with  
disabilities and those wit h special needs where t here is a pr oven need and  
demand. 
g) affordable housing units to be well designed and blend in well with the rest of 
the development to promote cohesion within the community.  
 
The Council will monito r development activity, land value s and mark et signals t o 
ensure it adopts a flexible approach to negotiations to ach ieve the ab ove targets.  
This monito ring will inform discussions over  viability, l ocal needs and where  
appropriate lead to a review of targets.  
 
5.25 In order to calculate off-site cont ributions, th e Council will monitor and update  
changes to the Land Registry average market values every financial quarter for a 
range of housing types. Contributions will be calculated using the following formula: 
 
Contribution Amount =  Net Numbe r of Units Proposed x Average Market 
Value    x  Affordable Requirement (20%) x   
    Transfer Cost  (35%) 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 99 The transfer cost is based on the e quivalent transfer value for an int ermediate o r 
shared ownership unit built on site as assumed in the Whole Plan Viability Study. For example a scheme of 9 units with an averag e value of £150,000 would trigger  a 
contribution of 9 x £150,000 x 20% x 35% = £94,500. 
 
5.26 The supply from priva te developers secured  by HG4 s hould be considered a 
minimum figure. As stated above, there remains a significant need beyond this figure, therefore it will be important to maximise the delivery of affordable housing. Th e 
Whole Plan Viability Study provides a base line to monitor market information 
alongside monitoring affordable housing delivery. It is anticipated that monitoring will 
lead to a policy review on a 3-5  year basis to re-assess affordable housing targets to ensure the overall requirement or the highest level of affordable housing that is viable is met during the Plan period.   
5.27 HG4 will support the Council’ s continued work with Registered Providers to increase  
and improve the afford able and so cial housing  stock in T amworth to  address th e remaining gap in affordable need. Where off-site cont ributions ar e paid by a developer the moneys will be used  by the Counc il or in partnership with Registered 
Providers for the development of land for affo rdable housing. In recent years this has 
involved th e construct ion of affordable housing by Regi stered Providers on la nd 
provided by the Council. The con structi on of  new council housing  will also  b e 
explored and delivered where feasible.   
Housing Mix 
 
5.28 Policy HG5  secure s th e provision of a housin g stock that  meets the  need of  all 
households in the fut ure, consid ering chang es which a re taking p lace in bot h 
demographic structure and househ old formation and preferences. The  significant growth in one person households and the age of  these new one person households results in a n increased  requirement for smaller  properties,  but of su fficient size t o 
accommodate overnight  guests or space to work at home; therefore at least two 
bedrooms are preferable. 
 5.29  The Strategic Housing Market Assessment establishes a r equirement for the size  
and type of  new home s in Tamworth. The study takes into conside ration needs based on quantitative modelling of the changing population  and then balances those 
numbers based on people’s aspirations for larger houses and viability consideration s 
for developers. The mix thereby incorporates market trends. The re sulting required mix for new housing is:  
 4% 1 bedroom flats – There is a large existing stock of the se units and fewer are 
needed in the future. 
 42% 2 bed room flats, houses and bungalows – The trend toward smaller 
households in future is a key issue in Tamworth where the existing sto ck of two  
bed units is low and a substantial increase is required. 
 39% 3 bedroom houses and bungalows – Tamworth has a large existing stock of 
three bed houses but this is also the size many residents aspire to. 
 15% 4 bedroom houses - There is a very low need for this size ho wever th e 
required proportion has been increased to reflect household aspirations for larger homes. 
 5.30 Staffordshire County Council Flexicare Strategy 2010-2015 (2010) estimates that the 
growth in population of those aged 65 and over between 2010 and 203 0 will be 72% in Tamwort h, the largest growth in Staffordshire. Extra care housin g, including Flexicare housing, pro vides an opportunity for people to live in their own  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 100 accommodation with the  security of care and su pport being available when needed.  
The Strategy identifies the level of u nits required to meet demand in Tamworth (823) and how many need to be available for rent or purchase. By the 1st April 2014, 142 
Flexicare housing units were delivered. It is expected that extra care housing will lead 
to a diversion from residential pla cements reducing the n umber of residential care beds requir ed and limiting the growth in nursing beds. It is important to meet th e need of Flexicare acco mmodation alongside other needs for specific groups in th e population identified in the future.  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priority SP5  
HG5 Housing Mix  
In granting planning permission for residential development, housing sizes and types 
that reflect local needs will be secured. 
 
Proposals for housing development should achieve the following mix of units: 
 4% of new housing will be 1 bedroom sized units 
 42% of new housing will be 2 bedroom sized units 
 39% of new housing will be 3 bedroom sized units 
 15% of new housing will be 4 bedroom or more sized units 
 
Both the affordable housing pr ovision and  the overall housing mix of the 
development shall be i n accordan ce with t he specified h ousing mix. Flexibility in 
dwelling types (e.g. flats, attached  or detached houses or bungalows) will be 
permitted to suit hou sehold nee ds and in  order to  create w ell designe d 
developments that meet the housin g mix. Where it is demonstrated tha t this is no t 
feasible or viable, an alternative mi x will be acceptable that matches local needs as 
far as possible.  
 
Proposals for non-standard residential development t ypes with a different housing 
mix such as extra care housing will be supported. Such development should meet a  
local need f or a popula tion group t hat would not be served by norma l standard  
housing development.   
 
Extra care housing should: 
a) Serve peop le with care needs in  Tamworth,  as identified in the latest 
information provided by Staffordshire County Council. 
b) Be located  within walki ng distan ce of a  bus stop and community faciliti es 
including a GP practice, pharmacy and convenience retail,  unless it can be 
demonstrated that alternative arrangements for access to th ese facilities will 
be put in place when needed by residents.  
 
Proposals for housing on sites of greater than 0.4 hectares should demonstrate how 
the proposal will meet th e population needs of th e area, including older people, and 
consider pr ovision of a n extra care scheme where a need for extra care housing  
remains in Tamworth and it would be deliverable.  
 
The Council  will monitor the delivery of housing, market and househo ld trends to  
ensure the development of sustain able mixed communities and where appropriat e 
lead to a review of housing mix targets. 
 
 
5.31 HG5 allows  the Council to take a flexible approach to feasibility and viability 
considerations. For developments with the fewest numbers of units it is impossible to meet the e xact housing mix but 2  and 3 bedro om units are preferred. The housing Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 101 mix informs the assumptions of th e Whole Plan Viability Study and i t is therefor e 
assumed that most developments are viable at the housing mix in HG5 unless further evidence is provided.  
 
5.32 The policy does not specify unit types (flats, bungalows, terraced/semi-
detached/detached houses) and is flexible towards how the design of any unit size is 
expressed. This leeway means des ign qua lity and the relationship of development s 
to the surrounding area  need not be compromi sed by meeting the housing mix. Uni t types can also therefo re be chosen and specified to meet the needs of future  
occupiers, such as providing special access arrangements.    
 
5.33 The Council will promote and discuss the poten tial provision of extra care housing on 
large schemes with developers but in general delivery models already exist for public and private provision of this ho using type. The County Council h ave led the  
successful delivery of social and affordable rented extra  care housing and will continue to  bring forw ard scheme s on land in public se ctor ownership. Private developers of leasehold  and shared ownership schemes have e xpressed interest in  bringing forward market schemes in Staffordshire. Sites of 0.4ha could accommodate the typical minimum size of 60 units set out in  the Flexicare Strategy based on past 
developments.  Policy HG5 sets out the robust criteria r equired by the National 
Planning Practice Guid ance. Extra care developments may be able to incorpora te facilities su ch as pharmacies and visiting GP services on site where they are  unavailable locally or pr ovide a transpor t service through travel plans. The County Council will provide annual monitoring infor mation of need and supply for the consideration of develo pment proposals.  If sp ecific evidence is produced for other 
groups within the local population not served by the mainstream housing market, the  Council will be supportive and take a flexible approach to housing mix.

Housing Density 
 5.34  HG6 ensures housing development makes the most effective and efficient use of t he 
land resource of Tamworth. There is a limited su pply of unconstrained available land  that is suitable for development and it is alrea dy insufficient to meet t he objectively assessed h ousing nee ds of the P lan period. It is import ant to consider the local  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 103 context in particular the proximity to su stainable transp ort hubs t o maximise the  
effective and efficient use of land to ensure sustainable patterns of development.  
5.35 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (2011) identified  136 typica l 
urban areas (figure 5.6)  reflecting different building phases in Tamworth ’s history. A 
net developable area a pproach was applied to  each site t o take into account open space, community facilities and a ssociated infrastructure, these are calculated a s follows: 
 
Site Size Net developable area  
Up to 0.4 hectares 100% 
0.4 to 2 hectares e S  80% 
2 hectares and above n 60% 
 
5.36  When these net develo pable areas are applied  to the  typical urban ar eas then the 
average density in Tamworth is 39.45 dph, with the majority of homes (57%) being in an area with a density between 30 and 50 dph. 15% of all units were in areas with a density of below 30 dph, and 28% of all units were in areas with a density of over 5 0 
dph.  
 5.37 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment, after consultation with a pan el 
and using the typical urban are a data, ap plied the f ollowing de nsities when calculating housing sit e capacity  with allo wances for  local co ntext such a s conservation areas:  
  30dph applied in less accessible urban locations 
  35dph applied for sites within the town centre and in close proximit y to public 
transport nodes. 
 
5.38  HG6 sets minimu m densities b ased on this understanding of resid ential areas in  
Tamworth. In order to ta ke account of local context and create a sustainable pattern 
of growth, higher densities within the achievable range are required in centres an d 
near to Wilnecote Rail Station while being more flexible elsewhere. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP1, SP5

or greater.  
 Away fro m these locat ions but wit hin the urb an area, a minimu m density o f 
between 30 and 40 dwellings per hectare.  
 
A range of housing types of high quality de sign will be supported where the y 
contribute t o meeting these minimum densitie s. Lower densities will be accepte d 
where they would prevent significant negative impacts to the historic environment.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 104 5.39 The density levels set by HG6 are based on t he net developable area of sites which 
will vary depending on the land taken by open space, infrastructure and facilities. The 
ratios used  by the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment are a usefu l 
guide. Guid ance on a chieving well designe d residentia l development at high er densities is widely available and fur ther detailed local guidance will be set out in the Design Supplementary Planning Document. The inclusion of flats or dividing houses  into flats as part of a development can incre ase density  without limiting land fo r gardens, open space and access. The Council can provide pre-application advice on indicative schemes or more detailed proposals to ensure the quality and character of  
neighbourhoods are enh anced by new development. The use of diff erent unit types 
provides flexibility to provide a high standard of urban design at high densities.  
 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
 
5.40  A sub-regional Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommo dation Needs 
Assessment (2012) has been under taken for Tamworth and Lichf ield Councils. The 
figures are based on a ‘need where it arises’ methodology, it does not t ake account 
of opportunities or con straints with in each local authority area. The assessme nt identifies th at there is t he need for 1 additiona l residentia l pitch within Tamworth . 
However, the report recognises that  it should n ot necessarily be assumed to impl y 
that those needs should actually be met in that specific locality.  
 5.41   Although no sites for pitches in Ta mworth were promoted  by landowners or the  
travelling communit y, t he policy criteria in Policy HG7  provide fair and equal  treatment to deal with proposals w here a need arises. Sites should be located in 
suitable and sustainable locations t hat are well connected to services and faciliti es 
and minimise potential impacts.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP5, SP12  
HG7 Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
Proposals will be expected to contribute to  the creati on of sust ainable mixe d 
communities and have regard to th e existing levels of provision and identified need. 
In addition t o the relevant national  guidance, t he following  considerati ons will be  
taken into account in the determination of locations for Gypsy and Traveller sites: 
 
a) There should be safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access to the site; 
b) The site  must be large enough to provide for adequate on sit e facilit ies f or 
parking, storage, play and residential amenity dependent on the number of pitches; 
c) The deve lopment should provide the appropriate infrastru cture required both on 
and off site. 
d) There should be convenient access to schools, shops, healthcare and other local 
facilities, preferably by foot, cycle or public transport; 
e) The site should be  a ble to b e la ndscaped a nd screene d to provide  privacy for  
occupiers and maintain visual amenity; and 
f) It should have no significant detrimental  imp act upon th e residential amenity of  
adjoining properties or neighbouring land. 
 
The Council will work with neighbouring local authoritie s, the Cou nty Council , 
landowners, Gypsies, Travellers and  Travelling Showpeople communities and other 
interested parties to enable the development o f pitches in accordance with the sub  
regional Gypsy and Traveller Accommodati on Needs Assessment (GTAA) as below:

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 107 CHAPTER 6 - A HIGH QUALITY ENVIRONMENT 
 
6.1  Delivering a high qua lity environment will involve protecting and enhancing  
Tamworth’s netw ork of green and blue infrastructure to provide sufficient 
opportunities for recreation and biodiversity . Through positive planning and understanding of the significance of Tamworth’s heritage assets, development will achiev e high quality  desig n that pre serves and enhances Tamw orth’s 
historic character. 
 6.2 The policies in this chapter aim to reconcile t he need for development described in 
chapter 2 w ith protecting and enha ncing the most importa nt aspects of Tamworth’s 
natural and built environments and t he need to raise standar ds of design throughout 
Tamworth. The chapter is divided into two distinct sections. The first contains policies 
on green and blue infrastructure including the  wider landscape, Green Belt, ope n space and biodiversity. The secon d on a high  quality built environme nt addresse s design and heritage assets. 
 6.3 Tamworth is a town of contrasts, it contains a mixture of historic building s, areas and 
landscapes. Today only one fifth of Tamworth is undeveloped however, t he planned layout has resulted in a unique le gacy in the form of an extensive network of accessible green and b lue infrastructure which encompasses green spaces, canals and rivers. Rural areas form a narro w fringe around the urban area with countryside to the north and west and Green Belt to the south and south west.   
 
6.4 Tamworth i s not know n for high quality urban design a nd it is imp ortant to raise  
standards of design in all parts of the town. This should be combined with conserving 
the best o f Tamworth ’s built an d natural environments and whe re possib le, enhancing t hem to benefit residen ts and visito rs. Creating  an attractive and well 
connected green and blue infrast ructure net work combined with footpaths an d 
cycleways will also have the dual benefit of wildlife corridors and encouraging regular informal exercise.   
 
High Quality Natural Environment 
 Landscape Character 
 
6.5 The landscapes around Tamworth have been defined as relatively low quality by the 
Staffordshire County Council’s S upplementary Planning  Guidance Planning for 
Landscape Change (2000). Policy EN1 aims to protect  the essential characteristics of the wider landscape around Tamworth and improve  areas of lower quality tha t 
have become degraded or suffered loss of landscape features through past activities. 
Reference is made to defined national character areas and county derived landscape policy types. In terms of the historic environment in the  urban fringe areas, the  Extensive Urban Surve y (2011) incl udes a usef ul assessment of the legibility of th e historic features of the landscape.  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 108  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priority SP8  
EN1 Landscape Character  
Development and activities outside the urban area should be informed by landscape 
character assessments and co ntribute to  the enhancement, restoration or 
regeneration of the la ndscape aff ected, as appropriate.  Landsca pe charact er 
assessments will also  act as a guid e for re-intr oducing landscape features, habitat 
creation and management in areas of lower la ndscape quality and preserving and  
enhancing surviving historic features. 
 
6.6 Tamworth c ontains two National Character Areas which are defined in Natural 
England National Character Area Profiles. The Mease/Sense Lowlands occupy the 
Anker Valley in the  north eastern part of the t own and are characterised by s mall farmsteads, arable farming, historic parkland, neutral grasslands, wet meadows and woodlands, rivers and s treams. Areas of archaeological int erest including ridge and furrow are also present. The Trent Valley Washlands occupy the River Tame corridor 
along the western edge  of Tamwort h. It is char acterised by broad rivers, a riverine  
environment with associated vegetation and hab it ats, alluvial soils, semi-natural and 
man made l andscapes created by sand and gr avel extraction. Arable and pastora l 
farming take place according to areas of flooding.  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

6.7 Planning for  Landscape  Change divides the county into d ifferent land scape policy 
and quality types. Most of Tamworth is urban and has a built character,  but outsid e 
the urban area there are distinct  types that  require enhancement; no parts of Tamworth have been identified as b eing sensitive landscapes. Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1 show the areas, landscape types, quality and policy objectives. 
 6.8 The Extens ive Urban Survey characterises t he urban fringe areas into Historic  Environment Character Zones (HECZ).  It identifies legible historic features within the landscape including historic halls, farmsteads, parkland, the canal network, ridge and furrow and other earthworks.  Agricultural inte nsification, gravel extra ction and 2 0
th 
century change have i mpacted on the surviva l of features but most o f the HECZs  
contain so me survi ving features or the potential for archaeological deposits to  
survive, which will contribute to the underst anding of the historic devel opment of the 
landscape.  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

6.9 The policy will apply to development outside the existing urban area where reference 
to the character areas and landscape policy objectives set out above will gu ide how development can contribute to impro ving the landscape. It will also be used to guide land management and wider biodiversity partnership project s. The addendum to the  Extensive Urban Survey shows the overall significance and value of the HECZs and 
should be t aken into account when considering development within the urban fringe areas. 
 
Green Belt   
6.10 The 211ha of Green Belt to the south of Tamworth is shown on the Policies Map and 
forms just under 7% of the total area. Policy EN2 sets out th e Council’s policy for the Green Belt.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP7, SP8  
EN2 Green Belt 
The Green Belt boundary, as defined on the Policie s Map, subject to  the possible 
review outlined below, will be maintained during and beyond the lifetime of the Local 
Plan and uses will b e allowed in accorda nce with n ational plan ning policy. 
Inappropriate development is harmful to the Green Belt and should not  be approved 
except in very special circumstances.  
 
In the eve nt that land has n ot been broug ht forward to meet th e balance  of 
Tamworth’s housing and employmen t needs sustainably by t he end of 2 017/18 as 
set out in p olicy SS1, the Council will conside r undertakin g another review of its 
Green Belt boundaries to reassess whether th ere is potential land to meet these  
local needs in the second half of the plan period.  
 
Where appropriate to their interest features, informal recreation and public access to Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 111 sites of bio diversity an d geodiversity value in the Green Belt through partnership  
projects will be supported. Links sh ould be maintained bet ween them, including the  
proposed footbridge link to the Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve from Dosthill Park. 
 
 
6.11 The Green Belt Review (2014) affirms the imp ortance of t he Green Belt in fulfi lling 
the function s set out in national planning po licy. Policy EN2, however, make s 
provision fo r a review of the Gree n Belt boun daries should land  not  have bee n 
identified to  meet the b alance of Tamworth’s h ousing and employment  needs in a  sustainable way by the end of 2017/18; such a review of th e Green Belt boundaries would determine wheth er there is potential land  for new de velopment in the second  half of the plan period.  This Green Belt review has ident ified a number of minor 
changes to the Green Belt boundary which are set out in detail within tha t document. 
In addition to the Green Belt Review the Sustainability Appraisal (2014) and technical assessments of land promoted in the Green Belt did not identify any areas suitable to be released for development. Therefore the Green Belt boundary will be maintained.   
6.12 The Green Belt contain s a cluster of designated biodiversity and geodiversity sites, 
most of which are lo cated to the west of the A51. These include Dosthill Park Site of Biodiversity Importance (SBI), Dosthill Qua rries SBI, Hockley Clay Pit (west of) SBI, 
Dosthill Church Quarry Local Geological/Geomorphological Sites (LoGS) and Dosthill Quarry Grassland Biod iversity Alert Site (BAS). In additio n, the Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve is a regionally important nature reserve based on a restored former  
gravel pit. Although it is loca ted outside  Tamworth  in Lichfield and North 
Warwickshire it is an important resource for Tamworth residents. It is imperative that links are m aintained b etween the sites to the  wider green and blue infrastructure network to allow movement of wildlife.  
 
Green and Blue Infrastructure 
 
6.13 A high quality network o f accessible multi-functional green and blue spaces plays a  
key role in improving the quality of life for residents and is particularly important in an urban area like Tamworth. The ben efits in clude healthier lif estyles, eco nomic and  social regeneration, local character, providing habitats and helping to mitigate climate 
change.  
 
6.14 Tamworth’s green and blue infrastructure netw ork contains a sign ificant amount of 
publicly accessible open space, covering a range of typologies including urban parks, amenity open space with play provision and semi-natural spaces. Some semi-natural 
green spaces are designated as local natu re reserves with an emphasis on  
community engagement. There are also more sensitive sites designated for biodiversity and geodiversity to which access is more restri cted. Outside the urban  area the co untryside plays an imp ortant role  in providing alternative spaces for  
activities such as cyclin g, walking a nd horse rid ing. It is im portant to maintain and improve physical links with the countryside beyond Tamworth’s boundary. 
 
Open Space and Green and Blue Links  
6.15 It is important that everyone has access to  high qualit y open spa ces within a  
reasonable distance of their homes. The 2012 Open Spa ce Review assessed all  
publicly accessible open space in terms of quantity, quality, value and accessibility. 
The review found that when applying a 400m buffer which equates to a reasonable walking dist ance, there  was no overall shortage of open space for  the current  population, the issu e was more one of quality. The priorit y should th erefore be t o improve ac cess to ‘go od quality’ open space  through enhancements to existin g Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 112 spaces. T he exception  will be sites that are n ot within 40 0m of good quality ope n 
space and larger devel opments that would gen erate demand that cannot be met  by the existing network. These sites should provide on-site open space. The review also 
highlighted the need for an urban park on the ea st side of Tamworth, in addition the 
three existing parks are not easily accessible from the east.  
 
6.16 Policy EN3 ensures tha t new devel opment pro vides an appropriate le vel of open  
space, a maximum distance for access to good quality open space and e xpectations 
for on-site provision. It sets out criter ia for assessing applications that would result in 
the loss of  open space and the need for links between spaces to  maintain an  
interconnected network.  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP7, SP12  
EN3 Open Space and Green and Blue Links 
Open space should b e multi-functional and contribute t o a range of objective s 
including in creasing biodiversity, connecting habitats, he althy living, leisure and 
tourism, enhancing landscape character and helping to mitigate climate change. 
 
All new housing development should be within 400m of accessible hig h quality open 
space as defined in the Open Space Review 2 012. New on-site open space should 
be provided where this is not the case using a standard of 2.43 hectares per 1000 
population as a guide . New on-site open space sh ould incorpor ate existing  
landscape features of value and pr ovide links for biodiversity, cycling and walking t o 
the wider green and blue infrastru cture network within, and where a ppropriate, 
outside of  Tamworth.  Private management schemes for future open space  
maintenance will be encouraged. 
 
Where it is not appropriate to create new on -site open space, all n ew housing  
developments should  contribute to wards im proving the quality and a ccessibility of 
nearby off-site open sp aces. Planti ng for biodi versity will be encouraged where  
appropriate to the site using biodiversity opportunity mapping as a guide. Reference 
should be made to the Council’s p riority list of  schemes which is contained in the  
Infrastructure Delivery Plan.  
 
Three circular access r outes base d on the existing green space ne twork, blue  
corridors and rights of w ay will be pr omoted for public a ccess. Links between green 
spaces and habitats will be reinforced, particula rly where there are gap s and to the  
wider green infrastructure network beyond the Tamworth boundary. 
 
The quality and accessibili ty of the canal an d river corridors will be  supporte d 
providing ecological value is not compromised. 
 
Proposals for the creation of a new multifunctional urban park on the eastern side of 
the town will be supported. 
 
Proposals f or development that would result in loss of  open spa ce or would 
adversely affect open space will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that:
a) The strategic benefits of delivering the Local Plan outweigh the negative impact or 
loss.  
b) There re mains access to good quality publicly accessible open space. Where  
alternative sites are not of good quality contributions to improving their quality will be  
expected. 
c) The integrity of the open space network and in particular its role in providing green 
links is maintained. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016

6.17 New development will put pressure on existing open space. The larger housing sites, 
particularly the sustainable urban extensions, offer the opportunity to incorporate new 
on-site gree n space int o the development. There are fewer opportunities to creat e 
new usable green spaces on smaller sites and the approach will instead be to make the most ef ficient use of the exist ing network by improving the qua lity, address 
identified deficiencies, enrich habitats and provi de and mai ntain links b etween sites through development and environmental projec ts. Biodiversity Opportunity Mappi ng was undertaken in 2010 and is explained in Figure 6.3 and table 6.2.This is important 
in the conte xt of constr ained land  supply, with a limited n umber of larger housin g 
sites that will be able t o provide o n-site open space and an increase d population  putting pressure on existing open spaces.

6.18 It is essent ial that the sustainable u rban extensions have a well design ed, useable 
network of green space that link to existing habitats an d the wider  countrysid e. Where on-site open spa ce is provid ed, the national standa rd of 2.43 h ectares per 1000 population (also known as t he Six Acre Standard devised by the National  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 114 Playing Fields Associat ion) will be used as a g uide for discussion with  developers, 
but will be applied with a degree of flexibility.  
6.19 The Council has traditio nally adopted new open space and  required developers to 
fund maintenance and management for a period of 15 years, after which the Council takes on the cost in full. Increasingly, the Council will expect developers to establish private management regimes for o n-site open space, including sustainable drainage schemes to ensure their long term management and upkeep. 
 
6.20 It is import ant to maintain and in crease links between green space s to conne ct 
habitats. When footpaths and cycleways are p r ovided as part of links, they offer t he 
opportunity for healthy l iving through recreation and contact with biodiversity. Three 
strategic circular routes of varying length will b e promoted for informal recreation as indicated on Figure 6.2.  Although the exact routes have not yet been defined, it is 
anticipated that development sites close to t he indicativ e routes will incorporat e footpaths a nd links to t he routes. I mprovements to the foo tpath network, inclu ding filling existing gaps, surfacing and waymarking.  
6.21 Partnerships such as Wild About Tamworth,  Central Ri vers Initiative and Tame  
Valley Wetlands Partnership are invaluable and successful in brin ging togeth er 
biodiversity and people.  The Central Rivers Initiative and Tame Valley Wetlands  Partnership are also a ble to take  a wider strategic approach to green infrastructure across a number of neighbouring local authority areas. 
 
Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity 
 
6.22 The Council has a good  track recor d of workin g with biodiversity and the extensive  
green infrastructure network is shown on the Policie s Map. Viewing the network an d 
interconnections at the  wider level enables a strategic a pproach to planning for biodiversity.  
 6.23 The most biodiverse and geodiverse rich areas of semi-natural habitat in Tamworth 
are linked t o the Rivers Anker and Tame an d have been designate d according  to their particular characteristics as being of national or local value. The sit es contribute significantly to Tamworth’s distinctive local identity, provide an attractive environment for residents and play a key role in the Sustainable Community Strat egy (2006) for 
Tamworth to be renowned regionally for its exceptional natural environment. 
 
6.24 Policy EN4 sets out the Local Plan’s strategy for dealing with sites of biodiversity and 
geodiversity importance and describ es the approach to the different types of sites in relation to planning applications. It explains how the Council intends to increase the 
amount of biodiversity and how natural landscape features will be protected.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP7, SP8  
EN4 Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity 
When dealing with a planning ap plication th at impacts on a site o f biodiversit y o r 
geodiversity value, a dis tinction will be made be tween statutory and non -statutory sites 
defined on the Policies Map as follows: 
 Statutory European and national sites (Special Area of Conservation or SAC and 
Site of Special Scientific Interest or  SSSI): will be protected from deve lopment 
that would have an adverse impact on their int erest features. Development wil l 
be required to demonstrate appropriate mitigatio n to ensure no negative impact. 
Development will not be permitte d that has a negative impact on the water 
quality of the Alvecote Pool SSSI. Development in the vicinity of the SSSI should Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 115 be designe d to in corporate appro priate mitig ation in cluding management and 
alternative recreational green space to minimi se recreatio nal pressur e on the 
site. 
 Statutory and non-statut ory local sit es (Local n ature reserves or LNR, Sites of 
County Biological Importance or SBI, Local Geological/Geo morphological Sites 
or LoGS and Biodiversit y Alert Sites or BAS): development should not  have an 
adverse impact on a site that is designated as having local importance for nature 
conservation, geodiversity or a gre en link, except in exceptional circu mstances 
where the importance of the development outweighs the harm. I n these  
circumstances, the opportunity should be taken to create greater than equivalent 
compensatory habitat in an appropriate location. 
 Non-designated sites, including th e canal and river netwo rks that provide the 
opportunity for habita t enrichment to creat e more robust and f unctional 
ecological units will be safeguarded, particularly if they form part of a  green or 
blue link,  including lin ks to the wider green infrastructure network outside  
Tamworth.  
 
Development will be supported that preserves designated biodiversity and geodiversity 
sites, high quality agricultural land  (Grades 1,  2 and 3a), termed as  Best and Most 
Versatile (BMV) land, maintains the favourab le conservation status of populatio ns of  
protected species and incorporates existing landscape feat ures.  Deve lopment should 
not result in  a net loss of biodiversity b y ensuring that whe re harm to biodiversity is 
unavoidable and it has been demonstrated that no alternative sites are suit able, 
development is adequat ely mitigated or as a last resort, compensated for; other wise 
planning permission should be refused. 
 
Development should create and reinforce links between semi-natural habitats, including 
habitats beyond the Tamworth boundary. 
 
Areas of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat will be protecte d from net loss, ta king the 
opportunity to restore and re-create habitats, using the Tamworth Phase One Ha bitat 
Survey and biodiversity opportunity mapping as a guide. Opportunities for public access 
should be i ncorporated where co mpatible and appropriate. The Cou ncil will sup port 
proposals for habitat restoration and creation identified through local partnerships.  
 
Development should incorporate planting of native tree species where appropriate to the 
site. Development that would involve the removal of any tre e, woodland or hedgero w, 
which contributes significantly to its setting, local landscape character or it surroundings, 
will be resisted unless the wider benefits of the development are suffici ent to offset the 
loss and cannot be avoided by app ropriate siting or design.  Where removal is ju stified 
and unavoidable, suit able and appro priate mitigation planting will be req uired to off set 
the loss of these features.  
 
In line with the requirements of the EU Wa ter Framework  Directive, Developme nt will 
not be permitted that could negatively impact  the River Anker, Rive r Tame and  their  
associated tributaries, that would degrade th e classificat ion of the waterbody (as 
specified in the Humber River Basin Management Plan).  
 
Development should exploit opportunities t o deliver priorities of  the EU Water 
Framework Directive and the Humber River Ba sin Management Plan to ensure th at the 
River Anker and River Tame meet Good Ecological Status by 2027. This could include 
opening up culverted watercourses and re-aligning and naturalising watercourses where 
possible when development is taking place.

6.25 The hierarchy of sites includes one Site of  Special Scientific Interest  (SSSI), seven 
Local Nature Reserves (LNR), sixteen Sites of  County Biological Impor tance (SBI), 
one Local Geological/Ge omorphological Site (LoGS) and six Biodiversity Alert Sites 
(BAS). The Alvecote Pools SSSI is of national importance and benefits from statutory protection, all the other  sites are o f local importance. LNRs are desig nated by the Council and  are also statutorily protected, all other sites in Tamworth are non-statutory with SBIs, LoGS and BASs designated at county level.  
 
6.26 The UK Bio diversity Action Plan, the Staffordshire Biodiversity Action Plan and the  
Staffordshire Geodiversity Action Plan set out  specific targ ets for natu ral habitats, 
biodiversity and geodiversity. Th e Tamwort h Phase 1 Habitat Survey (2008) highlights the importance of meeting these targ ets by working closely with partners, including th e Staffordshire Wildlife  Trust, Nat ural Englan d, Environment Agenc y, 
Staffordshire County Council, W ild About Ta mworth and  neighbouring authorities. 
Priority habitats are also important  for protected species to enable a favourable  conservation status of species to be maintained.  
 6.27 Tamworth contains a r ange of UK BAP Habitats namely Lowland Meadow, Wet  
Woodland, Coastal and  Floodplain  Grazing Marsh and Open Mosaic Habitats on  Previously Developed Land, Rivers and Ponds.  Where sites already  contain BAP Habitats the Tamworth Phase One Habitat Survey (2008) recommends  maintaining the current resource an d where the y are not present, it recommends restoration t o BAP habitats with appropriate management. 
 
6.28 Biodiversity opportunity mapping for Tamworth  divides the town into discrete habitat 
areas based on lo cal knowledge and habitat an d species data . It provides guidan ce 
for the creation, restoration and management of priority habitats and links, taking into 
account county and loca l targets for  habitats and species. Table 6.2 and Figure 6.3 explain the priority actio ns for each  habitat type with the aim of softening existin g 
open spaces by introducing natural areas, managing landscape features and creating links between Tamwort h. It will be used to inform the activities of  local partnerships 
and where off-site cont ributions ar e made for green spa ce enhance ment. Priority 
projects are set out in t he IDP and  include the  restoration of Broad Meadow LNR,  Tameside LNR, Kettl ebrook LNR, Dosthill Park LNR, Wigginton Park and Warwickshire Moor LNR.  
 
6.29 The Tamworth Phase One Habitat Surve y  highlights t he importa nce of linking  
habitats an d creating buffer zone s around important biodiversity sites to prevent  
habitats becoming isolated or fragmented. Buffer zones can  provide wildlife habitats, increase biodiversity a nd protect habitats by interceptin g or moderating adverse 
pressures a nd minimising disturbance. Develo pment should therefore incorporate 
features such as trees and hedgerows, which may be combined with pe destrian and cycleways to link up with the wider  green in frastructure ne twork. Green links also  
enable the wider move ment of sp ecies o ccurring as a  consequence  of climate  change. If managed in a susta inable way, high quality ag ricultural land is importa nt for its contribution to the wider benefits of  ecosystem services such as foo d 
production and biodiversity. 
 
6.30 Increasing access to p riority habitats can be a positive experience for residents in  
terms of contact with biodiversity, environmenta l education, learning practical skills and volunteering as part of org anised gro ups. Projects such as Wild Abo ut 
Tamworth, Central Rivers Initiative  and Tame Valley Wetlands Partnership prese nt 
the opportu nity to creat e an enhan ced visitor experience by combining landscap e and recreation opportunities with  improved  access, interpretatio n and habitat  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 117 restoration in accessible urban lo cations an d the river valley. Not  all sites a re 
appropriate for increased visitor access, how ever, the SSSI is sensitive and its interest features include breeding birds which could be affected by de velopment and 
recreational activity.  Access to the most sensitive parts of the site shou ld be limited 
and alternative green spaces nearby provided to attract visitors. 
 6.31 Development should incorporate e xisting landscape f eatures su ch as tree s, 
hedgerows and ponds which should also be protected d uring constr uction.  New  
development which results in  a lo ss will  be expected to provide co mpensatory 
provision of  greater th an equivalent habitat t o reflect t ime lags b etween loss,  development of mature habitats and risk of failure. Compensatory provision can be provided at both designated and non-designated sites and include measures such as green and brown roofs.

6.32 Under the Habitats Regulations, the  Council has undertake n a Habitats Regulations  
Assessment (HRA) (20 14) in consultation with  Natural England, to en sure that t he 
policies in t he Local Plan do not harm sites designated as being of  Europea n importance for biodiversity. In the case of Ta mworth the se comprise  the Cannock Chase Special Area of Conservation (SAC), River Mease SAC and  Ensor’s Pool  SAC, none of which are located within Tamworth. The HRA concluded that the Local Plan will result in no significant effects and no in-combination effects on these sites.   
High Quality Built Environment 
  6.33 It is difficult to define a distinct ‘Tamworth character’ other than local red brick, slate 
or tiled roofs and domestic scale ar chitecture. Outside the conservation areas, mos t development dates fro m the 20
th century with ribbon development along the main  
roads and the land in between filled by the post war neighbourhoo ds during the  town’s exp ansion. Much of the architectur e and layouts in the post wa r Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 119 neighbourhoods were re lated to the  rapid expansion and r eflected the  need to be  
functional and built quickly.  
 
6.34 It is important that futur e development takes a more positive approach, incorporating 
buildings a nd spaces of high quality design that respect historic assets whe re 
appropriate. This section deals with  high qua lity design an d development affecting  historic assets. 
  
Design of New Development 
 6.35 Development in Tamworth has not  always been sympathe tic to the historic sett ing 
and the town is not known for it s high quality environ ment. It is important that standards of design are raised throughout the town t o create more inclusiv e developments and mixed communities that will improve Tamworth’s image. Not onl y 
will it provide better living and working envir onments for local residents but it will also  
help to attract investment and increase Tamworth’s potential for tourism. 
 6.36 Policy EN5 aims to raise the standard of design across Tamworth b y setting out 
detailed crit eria on a range of issues which all new development must address.  
Where applications impact on he ritage asse ts, this po licy should be read in  
conjunction with Policy EN6 on the historic environment. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Prioritie s SP2, SP7 , SP9, SP1 0, 
SP11, SP12  
EN5 Design of New Development 
High quality buildings a nd places will be achi eved across Tamworth with particul ar 
attention paid to the enhancement of the t own centre, conservation areas, the 
Sustainable Urban Extensions and Regeneration Priority Areas. Poor design or design 
that fails to t ake the opportunities available to improve the c haracter and quality of an 
area and the way it functions will be refused. 
 
New developments will be expected to: 
a) Respect  and where appropriat e reflect existing lo cal architectural and historic 
characteristics but witho ut ruling out  innovative or contemporary design which is still  
sympathetic to the valued characteristics of an area.  
b) Take into account the impact of the proposal on the significance of heritage assets. 
c) Be of a scale, layout, form and massing which conserves or enhances the setting of 
the development. 
d) Utilise materials and  overall detailed desig n which conserves or enhances t he 
context of the development. 
e) Be outward facing with active frontages which incorporate landscaping and 
boundary treatments appropriate to the local context. 
f) Be legible and allow users to navigate the a rea with ea se by pro viding landmark 
buildings at key locations and a choice of routes to walk, cycle or drive along. 
g) Minimise  or mitigate environmental impacts for the benefit of existing and 
prospective occupants o f neighbouring land. Such impacts may include loss of ligh t, 
privacy or security or unacceptable noise, pollution, flooding or sense of enclosure.  
h) Pay particular regard to highway safety and servicing requirements, the capacity of 
the local road network and the adopted parking standards set out in Appendix C. 
i) Incorpora te landsca ping appropriate to the site, using native species wherever 
possible.  
j) Maxi mise health benefits throug h the incorporation of usable open space and 
footpaths a nd links to the wider green infrast ructure net work, in accordance w ith 
Policy EN3.    Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 120  
Where appropriate, proposals will be referred to local and sub-regional design review 
panels to provide objective design advice.  
 
Further detailed design  guidance will be set out within the Design Supplementary 
Planning Document. 
 
 
6.37 Well designed buildings and environments are fundamental to the way we live our 
lives. Design is not ju st about individual buildin gs, but the spaces and public places around the m and the r elationship between buildings and  t heir wider surroundings . Developers should consider the characteri stics of an area t o inform a  development 
proposal. It  is importa nt for devel opments to have a  distinctive character and to  
exhibit a high standard of urban design, architecture and landscaping.  
 6.38 Places also need to function efficie ntly and to be truly sustainable they should be o f 
durable con struction an d capable of adaptatio n to accommodate users’ changin g requirements. This mig ht include layouts that lend themselves to a daptation a nd 
ensuring that wireless and broadband connections are supplied at the outset. 
 
6.39 It is important to consid er the social  and environmental aspects of development and  
how it integrates with its surrou ndings. Ta mworth’s neighbourhoo ds should be comfortable, feel safe and be easy to move arou nd. New development should create 
and contrib ute to a sense of pla ce and be  well conn ected to th e surrounding 
neighbourhood and its facilit ies, i ncluding shops, schoo ls and publi c transport, through physical and visual links.  Sustainable modes of tr ansport will be promoted, whilst recog nising the need to accommodate  cars. However, the b uilding layo ut should take priority over road layout, which should integrate with the street scene and 
not dominate it. Throug h high qua lity design it is also important to mitigate an y 
negative impacts on th e environment. Outcomes  arising  from Manu al For Streets 
under the B uilding a Beautiful Staff ordshire initiative will be  an important tool. Thi s will be further elaborated on in the Design SPD. 
 6.40 In the areas containing historic fabric, new deve lopment should protect and enhance  
the best of  Tamworth’ s heritage assets. The  use of co ntemporary designs a nd materials alongside more traditional desi gns will be promoted throughou t Tamworth, 
providing the design is appropriate to its setting. 
 6.41 The Council makes use of local and sub-regional design review panel s comprising 
built environment experts to provide objective design advice. Significan t applications and those in sensitive or prominent locations will be referred for review.  
 
 Protecting the Historic Environment 
 
6.42 Although Tamworth has  expanded significantly during the 2 0
th century, elements of 
the town’s historic medieval core still su rvive i ncluding its medieval castle, market 
place and the line of the Sa xon and medieval street pattern. Many of the se monuments are design ated as be ing of nation al importance and much of the town  centre has been designated as conservation areas. The Extensive Urban Survey has considerably informed our understanding of the historic d evelopment of Tamwort h. 
Outside the town centre there are conservation areas based on the h istoric village 
cores of Wilnecote, Dosthill and Amington and the Amington Hall Estate parkland.  
 6.43 Heritage assets are eit her designa ted or non-designated.  Designated conservation 
areas, statutorily listed buildings and  sc heduled monuments are statutorily protected Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 121 as sites and areas of na tional importance and of significant heritage value. They ar e 
a priority for protection,  conservation and where possible enhance ment to better reveal their significance. Assets of local import ance do n ot benefit from the same  
protection and it is t he responsibility of th e Local Pl an to give them due 
acknowledgement when dealing with development that affects them.   
6.44 A number of studies have informed the Local Plan strategy for the historic 
environment, namely the conservation area appraisals (2007-2008), Extensive Urban 
Survey (2013) which incorporates a rural historic landscape element and  Heritage at 
Risk Surve y (2013). Development, particularly in the town centre with its  
concentration of historic fabric, can impact on heritage asset s and it is important th at an asset’s significance and setting  are given appropriate consideration. The town  centre exp eriences most development pressure and is a particular priority f or regeneration and the focus for a number of initiatives. As recommende d by Historic 
England, the Council has prepared a Heritage Impact Assessment (2014) which has  
informed the Local Plan housing and employment allocatio ns by identifying whethe r designated or non-designated assets will be aff ected, the significance of the assets, anticipated impact on the asset a nd its sett ing and making recommendations f or mitigation. The Heritage Impact Assessment should be r ead in conjunction with 
Policies HG1, HG2 and EC6. 
 
6.45 Policy EN6 sets out the Council’s approach to development affecting designated and 
non-designated heritage assets, including specific criteria for development affectin g designated assets.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP2, SP9  
EN6 Protecting the Historic Environment 
Development that affects designate d heritage a ssets including conservation areas,  
listed buildings, sched uled monuments and non-desig nated herit age assets 
including locally listed buildings and undesignated archaeology, will be  required to  
assess t he impact of the development on the asset throu gh a heritage statement 
and statement of sign ificance an d clearly  d emonstrate how the significance,  
including its setting, will be protect ed, conserved and, where possib le, enhanced.  
Where sites are located in a conservation area  or an area  of high archaeological 
potential, p articularly t he histori c town centre  core, the  Council’s Conservation 
Officer and Staffordshire County Council Envir onment Team (Historic Environment) 
should be consulted at an early stage. Pr oposals will be required to pay particular 
attention to: 
a) the scale, form, height, massing, detailing and materials of the development, the  
existing buildings and physical context to which it relates. 
b) historically significant boundaries,  street layouts, open  space s, landscape  
features an d structures identified in the conse rvation area appraisals including 
walls, railings, street furniture and paved surfaces. 
c) important views of listed build ings, schedu led monuments and historic 
townscape as identified in the conservation area appraisals. 
 
Reference should be made to the Historic Environment Record fo r up to dat e 
information and the Extensive Urban Survey  to  identify pot ential for ar chaeology. 
Where potential for archaeology exists, the heritage statement should incorporate an 
archaeological desk ba sed assessment t hat evaluates sur viving above and belo w 
ground archaeological remains and where necessary, a field based evaluation by an  
appropriate professional. An approp riate mitigat ion strategy  will al so b e required, 
where necessary. Where archaeolo gy may be lost through development, there will 
be a requirement for a rchaeological recording to be undertaken by a n appropriate Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 122 professional and entered in the Historic Environment Record. 
 
Where practical and viable, development should address issues identified in th e 
historic e nvironment evidence, in  par ticular the Extensive Urban Survey and,  
Conservation Area Appraisals. Development of allocated ho using and e mployment 
sites should have regard to the Heritage Impact Assessment. Particular attention will 
be paid to enhancing key buildings in the town centre, the Creative Quarter initiative, 
positive redevelopmen t or enhancement of negative features, public realm 
improvements and proposals that will enhance buildings classed a s ‘at risk’ and  
‘vulnerable’ in the Heritage at Risk Survey. 
 
The Council will support proposals that promo te the use of vacant, under-used 
historic buildings, inclu ding necessary and app ropriate minor changes that involve  
sensitive adaptation and minimal disturbance.  
 
Non-designated assets,  including  l ocal li sting and archae ology, will b e a material  
consideration in determining planning applications, with weight given to their 
significance and contribution to their environment. The Council will support the 
conservation and enhancement of locally listed buildings and will review the local list 
in consultation with the public. 
 
 
6.46 The majority of Tamwort h’s heritage assets are concentrated  within the t own centre, 
which is th e focus of the Council’s regeneration programme and e xperiences t he 
greatest development pressure. Policy EN 6 should be considered alongside Policie s 
EC2 Supporting Invest ment in Ta mworth To wn Centre and EC5 Culture a nd 
Tourism. Smaller conservation are as are centred on the former villages of Dosthill,  Wilnecote a nd Amington. Amington Hall Estate  is the  only semi-rural conservation area, locat ed to the north east and separa ted from the urban area by ope n 
countryside and farmland.  
 
6.47 The local list comprises buildings o r structures that are not of sufficient  merit to be  
statutorily listed, but are regarded as being of local historic or architectur al 
significance. The Council is responsible for maintaining the local list, which was most recently updated in 2008. The Cou ncil encourages the protection and enhancement 
of buildings on the local list and their presence on the list and the features that make 
them significant will be  material consi derations when consi dering development that 
affects them. The Coun cil is committed to revie wing the local list in con junction with interested local people.  
 
6.48 The canal n etwork in T amworth consists of the  Coventry Canal which r uns through 
Amington, Glascote, Bolehall an d Kettlebrook to Fazeley where it join s t he 
Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, which lies in Lichfield District. There are a number of historic features, including canal bridges, locks and other st ructures, many of which 
are already statutory o r locally list ed and as a collective  group, form a close knit assemblage of late 18th and early 19th century structures.  
  6.49 There are a number of significan t long dista nce views, both within and beyon d 
Tamworth. These inclu de views of key landmark building s such as t he Castle, St.  Editha’s Church, Town Hall and Moat House, which are located in  and around t he town centre. Important  longer dist ance views include th e Amington  Hall Estate, 
Fazeley Mill and the Hopwas ridgeline and it is important to protect these views. 
 
6.50 A number of studie s ha ve appraise d Tamworth to defin e it s heritage  significan ce, 
including th e town’s growth and d evelopment, listed and key non listed buildings, Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 123 above and  below ground archaeology, impo rtant views, open spaces, negative 
features and opportunities for improvement. At the largest scale the Extensive Urban 
Survey exa mined Tamworth by dividing it into historic ur ban charact er areas an d 
historic en vironment character zones for the urban and rural fringe areas 
respectively. The study highlights the areas wit h the great est heritage significance, namely the town centre, Wigginton Park and the village cores of Amington, Wilnecote and Dosthill. The rural fringe areas with the greatest heritage sign ificance are 
associated with the landscape parks of Amington Hall estate and Dosthill Park.  
6.51 Conservation area ap praisals examined the specia l character of  the seven  
conservation areas and made  recomme ndations f or boundary changes , enhancements and  re moval of negative feat ures. The Council will co-ordinate enhancement through management plans, which will be based on recommendatio ns from the character appraisals, Extensive Urban Survey and Heritage at Risk Survey. 
These will set out priorit ies for conservation and enhance ment of the conservation  areas includ ing public r ealm and open space  improve ments, targeting  of building s and interpretation of the historic environment. The management plans will be subject to public consultation.  
6.52 The Heritage at Risk Survey assessed the condition of  all the statutorily listed  
buildings in  Tamworth  which has led to a nu mber being  classed as ‘at risk’ and  ‘vulnerable’. Within the  town centre there are additional vacant and under-used  unlisted bu ildings in po or condition . The key to their long  term survival is to brin g them back into productive use. The  Council operates a conservation grant scheme  for histori c building s and will be  proactive i n engaging  with owners to se cure 
improvements. 
 
6.53 Even minor changes can have a cumulative impact on a sensitive building or area so 
it is importa nt that all d evelopment is carried o ut in a manner that is mindful of it s significance. However, e ven in sensitive location s there is scope to use  sustainable 
and innovative designs to create new modern landmarks. The Council will take  
specialist d esign and h eritage advice when necessary fro m a design review panel 
and Conservation Area Advisory Committee. 
  
Delivering a High Quality Environment 
 
6.54 Table 6.3 outlines how the policies in this chapter will be implemented to ensure th at 
development protects and enhances the most important elements of Tamworth’ s 
natural and historic environments and raises st andards of design by identifying th e

 125 CHAPTER 7 - A SUSTAINABLE TOWN 
 
7.1  Ensuring a  combination of stro ng retail c entres, ac cessible housing and  
employment sites and the regeneration of existing developed land la ys the 
foundation to deliver  a connec ted, sustai nable to wn. Making the most o f existing transport links, addressing congestion and improving public transport will ensure Tamw orth’s centres, emplo yment sites and housing sites are  
accessible by different methods of transport and reduce reliance on the private 
car. Improving energy performance, supporting renewable energy generation, reducing flood risk, preventing harm from p ollution and providing accessible  community facilities will help to deliver sustainable development.  
  
7.2 The policies in this chapter address the challe nges of incorporating a high level of 
growth in the most sustainable w ay possible  and ensuring that it is served b y 
adequate infrastructure  as describ ed in Tamworth’s  Spatial Portrait in Chapter 2. The spatial strategy set out in chapter 3 requires that the potential environmenta l 
impacts of new development are mitigated as far as possible.    
 
Sustainable Transport Network  
 
7.3 Policy SU1 supports Staffordshire County Council, Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire  
Local Enterprise Partnership and Greater Birmi ngham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership plans to improve the transport net work for all users and t o support th e 
local economy. The policy will help to mitigate the impact of development proposed in 
the Local Plan on the transport net work and prioritise s travel by more sustainable transport modes.    
7.4 Tamworth b enefits from  an extensive pedestrian and cycle network a lthough ther e 
are a number of gaps in provision (figure 7.1) which reduce the lin ks t o the town 
centre and employment areas from  residential areas. SU1 will exploit opportunities for new development or green infrastructure projects to increase the connectivity and quality of the network. This will su pport the connection of the Town Centre, leisur e facilities and retail par ks with gree n infrastructure in Tamworth and t he surrounding countryside with newly defined and promoted circular walks proposed in chapter 6. 
 
7.5 SU1 will co ntinue the f ocus of re cent years on making th e best use  of the existi ng 
highway ne twork, concentrating on maintaining its con dition and ensuring th at 
reductions in road casualties continue. The policy will make the most ef ficient use of limited fun ding and help imple ment Staffordshire County Cou ncil’s Integr ated 
Transport Strategy for Tamworth (2015) which is regularly reviewed. This will delive r 
the following key strategic priorities:  
 Accommodating proposed brownfield  development and Sustainable Urban  
Extensions  
 Manage congestion and reduce carbon emissions on the local network and A5(T)  
 Support retail and hou sing growth  and job creation in th e town cen tre that 
complements Ventura Retail Park  
 Improve public transport connectivity to the West Midlands conurbation  
 Provide sustainable transport conn ectivity to k ey destinations throughout the 
urban area  
 Maintain the current condition and safety of the highway network  
 Improve public transport connectivity and quality of life for local communities  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 126  Raise awareness of en vironmental issues and  encourage people to lead more  
sustainable lifestyles, helping to reduce carbon emissions 
 
Figure 7.1: Improving Su stainable Transport Links  
 
 
 
7.6  The followin g transport related prog rammes, shown on figu re 7.1 where measures 
are identified, have been agreed to deliver the spatial strategy: 
  
 The Central Rivers Initiative progressive restor ation and revitalisation of the river 
valley between Burton-on-Trent, Lichfield and  Tamworth.  The delivery of thi s project has the potential to enhance off-road walking and  cycling routes and  
multifunctional green spaces.  
 The Ventura Park/Town Centre/Rail Station  Corridor Local Transpo rt Package  
will deliver an improve d walking a nd cy cling route between Ventura Retail Park 
and Tamworth Town Centre, and between the Town Centre and Tamworth Rail  Station. It will tie in with proposals f or Tamworth Rail Station and Gateway and  Corridor public rea lm improvements for the  Town Centre in Chapter 4 , including 
enhancements to Victoria Road bu s interchan ge and real time bus p assenger 
information. These interventions aim to bu ild on the improvement already recently 
made to help alleviate capacity and  delay problems at the retail park. Bus stop improvements and real  time passen ger in formation will eve ntually be p rovided 
across the urban area. Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 127  Staffordshire County Council produced a Rail Strategy in 2015 to complement the 
Integrated Transport Strategy. There is an a spiration to provide a new local train  
service for Tamworth which may be achievable with infrastructure improvements  at Water Orton. This will provide additional  capacity for local commuters and will 
include capacity enhancements to the line between Birmingham and Tamwort h 
and a turnb ack siding at Tamwort h. Further improve ments at Tamworth Rail 
Station will cover access, public re alm and car parking. Pedestrian fa cilities to improve access to W ilnecote Rail Station will be delivered. In the lo nger term there are p roposals t o lengthen t he pla tforms at Wilnecote to acco mmodate 
longer trains. 
 The proposed sustai nable urban e xtensions will require  bus service extensions 
and enhancements. The Golf Course site may require a n ew service. Dunstall  
Lane could be served by an extension to an e xisting route . There may be an 
option to extend an existing route to serve other housing sites on Coton Lane. 
 The Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor proposed  in Chapter 5 links key residentia l 
areas and offers acce ss to Wilne cote Rail Station and significant e mployment sites including Tame Valley Industr ial Estate. T he Integrated Transport  Strategy supports improve ments focusing  on environmental enhancement, traffic 
management, safety and facilitating physical activity. 
 The North Tamworth Local Transport Packa ge will accommodate residential 
development to the nort h of Tamworth within th e Borough and ease op eration of the Gungate corridor, a heavily trafficked key radial route. It will deliver improve d 
traffic control to link signal controlled junctions and pedestrian facilities, increased junction capacity and traffic management. Bus connectivit y impro vements and extended pedestrian a nd cycling connectivity are also proposed. I mproved connectivity to residen tial develop ment sites to the nort h of Tamworth could include a new pedestrian footbridge over the  Cross Country railwa y line which  
would enha nce lin ks to  the rai l st ation, town  centre and  education  facilities, 
including the post-16 Academy. 
 Capacity and safety improvements t o junc tions on the A5(T) (Mile Oak,  Ventura 
Way, Marlb orough Way, Stoneydelph) and M42 (Junction s 10 and 11) will be  delivered following a more detailed understanding of any p articular development. The requirements for mitigation of significant highway impacts on any of the local junctions in the Strategic Road Network will be determined at the planning  
application stage where proportionate to the  proposal, in accordan ce with  
Department for Transport Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the  Delivery of Sustainable Development’. 
 Drayton Manor Theme Park is an important visitor destination near Tamworth. On 
a small number of days per year the acti vities of Drayton Manor Theme Park lead 
to severe congestion o n the surrou nding highway network. Staffordshir e County Council has committed to working with Highways England a nd Drayton Manor to formulate and deliver a n acce ss strategy to mitigate these  condit ions. This will 
include consideration of junction im provements including t he main access to the  
park, and revisions to signage from the strategic highway network. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP7, SP11, SP12  
SU1 Sustainable Transport Network 
The ease and quality of access to and between the town centre, local and  
neighbourhood centres, employment sites, key internal and external destinations will 
be improved. The follo wing transport measures will be su pported through planning 
decisions and the Infrastructure Delivery Plan: 
 
a) Provision, b y addressin g barriers a nd missing  links, of a  joined up  T amworth-
wide cycle and pedestr ian network - which exploits the existing green  linkages Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 128 and canal towpaths between the town centre, local and neighbourhood centres,  
railway stations, reside ntial areas and empl oyment sites - and  off-road 
pedestrian and cycle routes associated with the Central Rivers Initiative.  
b) Improved pedestrian and cycle linkages, bus stops and real time bus passenger 
information between Ventura Retail Park, Tamworth Town Centre and Tamwort h 
Railway Sta tion and an  improved bus intercha nge in the  t own centre for local 
routes within Tamworth and inter-u rban routes,  includ ing t o Lichf ield and the  
West Midlands conurb ation. Bus stop improvements will subseq uently be  
delivered across Tamworth. 
c) Proposals which improve the at trac tiveness, accessibility and pa ssenger 
capacity of both Tamworth and Wilnecote Rail Stations or which increase the  
frequency of services to Birmingham, London and the North West. 
d) Proposals to support bus servi ce extensions to the sustainable urban 
extensions.  
e) Improvements to the Wilnecote Regeneration Corridor to provide traffic 
management, environmental and highways safety measures and increase  
access to Wilnecote station. 
f) Improved traffic control, junction traffic management and capacity improvements  
and bus, cycle and pedestrian routes on the Upper Gungate / Aldergate Corridor 
to support development to the North of Tamworth. 
g) Following a n assessment of the impacts of  an y proposed development on the 
Strategic Road Network where required by Highways England, cap acity and  
safety measures at any of the following junctions: 
 A5 Mile Oak 
 A5 Ventura Way 
 A5 Marlborough Way 
 A5 Stoneydelph 
 M42 Junction 10 
 M42 Junction 11 
h) Signage or junction improvements to  improve access to Drayton Manor Theme 
Park. 
i) Local highway i mprovements and t raffic management measures as required to 
mitigate the impact of development traffic.   
 
Where appropriate and proportionate contributions toward infrastruct ure will be  
required from development that has a significant impact on the transport network.  
 
7.7 Policy SU1  supports p rogrammes of transport network improve ment that will be 
funded and delivered by various agencies a ccording to t heir own strategies. Th e 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan will be p eriodically updated and coordinate contributions 
of the Council and development to transport projects. 
 
7.8 Assessments of the impact on the Strategic Road Network will be requested as pa rt 
of Transport Assessments at the planning ap plication st age where required b y Highways England, in a ccordance with Department for Transport Circular 02/201 3 
‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’. Any 
assessment should ta ke account  of existing traffic flows and consider th e development alongside other planned development.  
7.9 The Integrated Transp ort Strategy behind the policy will also guide  the Greater 
Birmingham and Solihull and Stoke-on-Trent and Staffo rdshire Local Enterprise 
Partnerships’ Strategic Economic Plans. Work in partnership with key stakeholder s 
will continue including the Local En terprise Partnerships, public transport operators and Highways England, involve ment with the A5 Transport Liaison Group and cross  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 129 boundary working with West Midlands authorit ies, for example the Regional Rail 
Forum. The A5 Transport Liaison Group has been establish ed to ensure that the A5 plays its role in facilit ating econo mic growth  through maximising capacity an d 
improving safety. 
 
Delivering Sustainable Transport  
7.10  Policy SU2 supports the spatial strategy in reducing the need to travel and promoting 
the use of sustainable  modes of transpor t su ch as walking, cycling and publi c 
transport. This will be a chieved through travel p lanning and the location  and design of access a rrangements. The poli cy will also manage the impact of t he remainin g residual traf fic and p arking on peop le and the environment, avoiding u nnecessary 
physical highway improvements where possible. These measures will help to reduce congestion, which will both improve air quality and the overall image of the town, thus 
making it a more attractive place for residents and businesses. 
 
7.11  SU2 also re cognises that streets h ave a wide range of fun ctions as key features o f 
the public r ealm. They have a social function  as place s in their own right where people shop, relax, eat and drink and walk through. Street environments need to b e 
managed s o that exce ssive traffic and poor d esign does not suppress these other  
activities. T he policy will require b oth new ro ads and development i n general to improve or create a high quality public realm.  Best practice, as reflected in th e Government’s Manual for Streets (2007 and 2010), is increasingly moving away from strictly demarcated spa ces for ped estrians an d vehicles t o design solutions tha t involve sharing public spaces, which not only improves th e attractive ness of  the  
street but also makes it a safe place.  
 
7.12  SU2 sets car parking standards for Tamworth to guide the amount of car parking that 
new development should provide. This will m aximise the potential f or the use of sustainable transport while ensuring that unmet parking nee ds do not  impact on th e 
local e nvironment. Cycle parking  is also  requir ed to su pport an in creased level of 
active travel and reduce private car journeys and their impact.  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP11, SP12  
SU2 Delivering Sustainable Transport 
Development should b e accessible by walking, cycling a nd public tr ansport an d 
proposals should priorit ise access by thes e modes of tra nsport above the private 
car. Planning permission should only be grante d where de velopment would ensur e 
adequate highway safety, suitable a ccess for all people and  where feasible reduce 
the impact of travel up on the envi ronm ent. Pl anning permission will be refused  
where travel to and from the development would be likely to cause harmful levels of 
pollution, highway safety or capacity impacts. 
 
A Transport Assessment and comprehensive Tr avel Plan must accompany all major 
development proposals as set out in Appendix E. 
 
New roads,  both public and private , should be designed to provide a  high quality 
public realm for pede strians, meeting Manual for Streets specif ications and a ny 
design guid ance set o ut in the Design Supplementary Pl anning Document. New  
developments should  pr ovide active street front ages to cre ate attractiv e and safe 
street envir onments. They will be  required t o contribut e towards public rea lm 
improvements where appropriate.  
 
Development proposals will be required to make appropriate provision for parking on Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 130 or off the street in acco rdance with the parking standards set out in Appendix C.  
Development with lowe r levels of p arking provision may be acceptab le in locations  
that are highly accessible by w alking, cycling and pu blic tran sport, includ ing 
Tamworth’s network of centres. In considering the level of provision regard will be 
had to: 
a) the anticipated demand for parking arising from the use proposed, or other uses 
to which the development may be put without needing planning permission. 
b) the scope for encouraging alternative means of travel to t he development that  
would reduce the need  for on-site  parking. Th is will be pa rticularly relevant in  
areas well-served by public transport. 
c) the impact on highway safety from potential on- street parking and the scope for 
measures to increase highway capacity. 
d) the need to make adequate and convenient parking pro vision for people with 
disabilities. 
 
The Council  will require  the provisi on of suffi cient, safe, w eatherproof, convenient 
and secure cycle parking within development s to assist in promoting cycle use  
where viable and appropriate. 
 
 
7.13 Travel Plan s required by SU2 are  strategies t o minimise the number of single car 
occupancy trips to a  major development. The form of the Travel Plan will largely be determined by the type of development, its location and a ccessibility to sustainable 
modes of travel. The o utcome of the Trans port Assessment will affect  the measures 
and outcomes to be achieved, secured by the planning permission. 
 7.14 The Council will encourage partnership workin g to improve streets. Many public and  
private orga nisations ha ve an i mpact on the a ppearance and manag ement of th e 
street environment. Any new development w ill be expected to demonstrate how it will 
deliver these improvements and in some cases ma y be expected to contribute to the 
improvements, whether through dire ct works or as a finan cial contribut ion. Shared  
public spaces can  be  achieved by remo ving barriers and fences,  placing  th e necessary amount and type of seating, bins, lig hting and other street furniture in the right places, together with traffic calming measures. 
 7.15 Areas well served by public transport where the majority of trips can be made without 
use of the private car provide the scope to r educe parking requirements. Where  parking provided under SU2 is commercially operated, the Council will seek to agree 
management and pricing regimes with developers. This will e nsure that all parking is 
operated in a manner which benefits the town as a whole.  
 
Climate Change Mitigation  
 
7.16  The Staffordshire County-wide Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Study (2010) has 
estimated t hat the aut hority is on ly capable of meeting a small pro portion of its energy demand through  renewable energy sources by 202 0. Policy S U3 therefore  
requires development proposals to explore efficiency savings at a number of levels to reduce their emissions footprint:  
 Land use, access and transport 
 Urban design, landscaping and construction materials 
 New and existing building performance 
 Energy generation 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 131 7.17  SU3 will complement the Tamworth Clim ate Change Strategy (2011), which provides 
a framework for adap ting to the  effects of  climate change, red ucing ener gy 
consumption and man aging the use of resources. Whilst the Climate Chan ge 
Strategy do es not spe cifically set  a carbon t arget for Tamworth (a s the Climate  
Change Act 2008 has a clear nat ional target),  the strateg y sets out a number of ambitious actions for t he Council and its partners to deliver. These include a n increase in public transport use, completion of a Tamworth  cycling network, and the widespread installation of photovoltaic panels on all public buildings.   
7.18  SU3 will directly support the Tamworth Waste Strategy (2007) and the move towards 
a more  sustainable approach to waste manag ement. Rel ying on landfill for waste  disposal is unsustainable and is a waste of resources. The re is a need  to give much higher priority to waste minimisation, re cycling, composting and recovery (such as 
energy fro m waste), making disposal in la ndfill site s the last resort. Three key 
objectives of the Tamworth Waste Strategy are to reduce the amou nt of waste  
produced in Tamworth, to increase the rate of recycling and composting of household 
waste and t o reduce to  zero the am ount of wast e that the B orough sends to la ndfill by 2020.  
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP11, SP12  
SU3 Climate Change Mitigation  
Where appropriate proposals for new develop ment will be e xpected to demonstrate 
how they will address the causes of  climate change and limit greenhouse gas 
emissions with an aspiration of achieving zero carbon development through: 
 
a) promoting efficient and effective use of land.  
b) ensuring development is located in  accessible locations which promote the use 
of sustainable modes of transport. 
c) appropriate sustainable design, layout, orientation and use of construction 
materials and methods that reduce embodied energy in their productio n where 
feasible. 
d) promoting landscaping  and tree planting to provide shade, reduce local 
temperatures and carbon capture. Planning permission will not be gra nted for 
development if it compromises existing green  and blue corridors an d linear  
habitats. 
e) maximising energy a nd water efficiency including e nergy perf ormance 
improvement in the fabric of buildings.  
f) facilitating the retrofitting of the existing building stock for resource efficiency. 
g) supporting opportunities for renewable and low carbon energy generation. 
h) exploiting opportunities for energy from waste,  combined heat and power and  
district heat ing scheme s subje ct t o appropria te measures to mitiga te an y 
environmental, social and economic impacts. Proposals for securing energy from 
waste should take into account the  Staffordshire County Council Wast e Local 
Plan. 
 
Development will be re quired to co ntribute towards the Ta mworth Waste Strategy, 
providing sit e waste management plans as appropriate and  incorporating suitably 
located on- site facil ities. The Council will work with neighbouring authorities t o 
identify and promote the provision of appropriate waste man agement, treatment and 
disposal sites. Waste management facilities should be sa feguarded in accordance 
with the Staffordshire County Council Waste Local Plan. 
 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 132 7.19 The land use, urban design and landscapin g elements of SU3  wi ll in part be  
delivered by other polici es in the Lo cal Plan and further guidance will be provided in 
the Design Supplementary Planning Document. Where building design,  construction 
methods and materials are controlled by Building Regulations, specific standards are 
set by thos e controls and it is anticipated th ey will requ ire increasi ngly stringent sustainability performan ce. These  standards w ere taken into account  in the Whole  Plan Viability, Affordable Housing and Community Infrastructure Levy Study (2014).   
7.20 SU3 promotes the use of locally produced materials in order to reduce supply chain 
travel distances and the  re-use and  recycling of  materials t o prevent waste, reduce  the consu mption of raw materials, landf ill and ener gy usage. The choice  of construction materials has potential impac ts on energy efficiency during manufacture 
and in application. 
 
7.21 Green infrastructure provides a range of climate change services that can make both 
a substantial contribution towards adapting t o climate change and a limited yet 
important contribution towards mi tigating climate change. Favourable climate conditions are moving location, requiring species distributions to shift typically north and uphill. It is essenti al to create linear habitats to support this movement and 
prevent fragmentation of existing habitats. 
 
7.22 SU3 is fle xible towards the solutions supp orted to d eliver renewable energy 
generation and building energy efficiency. High  levels of e nergy performance in th e building fabric can limit t he need to incorporate additional te chnologies. The existing built enviro nment also  offers grea t potential f or renewable or low carbon energy 
generation using a variety of suita ble micro a nd larger st and-alone t echnologies, 
which could include the retro-fitting of existing development.   
7.23 Large scale development and area based regeneration initiative s may off er 
opportunities to incorporate large scale or area wide renewable energy or low carbon 
technologies including  community heating, b iomass heat ing, combin ed heat an d 
power and utilising sur plus heat. Proposals within the town centre, regeneration priority areas, sustainab le urban ext ensions , employment sit es and other areas with  
high heat d ensity will b e explored through pre -application discussions and master planning.  
 
Flood Risk and Water Management 
 7.24  Policy SU4 seeks to  re duce the risk of flood ing to propert ies in Tam worth, ensure  
drainage systems are designed sustainably and improve water quality. Having developed alongside t he confluen ce of two rivers, 25% of the Borough is within  
floodplain. Tamworth h as been aff ected in th e past by f looding, recently in the  
summer of 2007. 
 7.25  A Level 1 Strategic Floo d Risk Assessment (2008/9 and 2014 addendum) has been  
prepared for Tamworth to refine f lood risk areas, identify ar eas likely to  be at  most risk of  flood ing and co nsider li kely impacts of  climate ch ange. The probability of 
flooding is likely to wor sen accord ing to the p redicted eff ects of climate change. 
Development in the floodplain is discouraged by SU4. A flood risk assessment will be required for  all development in Flo od Zones 2, 3a or 3b and where required by standing or site specif ic advice from the En vironment Age ncy. A Le vel 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2014) has been carrie d out in order to apply the sequential  
and exception tests to the development sites selected for  allocation in Chapters 4 
and 5. 
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 133 7.26 Development can lead to an increase in the amount of impermeable land, which can 
increase the risk and impact of flooding. Traditional drainage systems can be harmful 
to the environment by increasing the risk of flooding downstream, contamination and 
depletion of groundwater and watercourse sup plies (Southern Staffordshire Surface  Water Man agement Pl an: Phase 1 & 2, 201 0/11). SU4 requires de velopments to  integrate Sustainable Dr ainage Systems (SuDS) as a way o f managing surface and groundwater regimes to avoid an adverse impact on water quality and quantity within Tamworth and reduce the risk of flooding.  
 
7.27  SuDS schemes are required to red uce surface water disch arge and where possib le 
cease the connection of  surface water discharge s into the combined sewer network.  
The Humber River Basin Manage ment Plan (20 09) states that The River Tame  has been identified as having a ‘poor’ ecological status. In addition, it has been assigned protected st atus under the Freshwater Fish (2006), Nitrates (1991) and Urba n 
Wastewater Treatment (1991) Europ ean Directives. The River Anker currently has a 
‘moderate’ ecological status, but  has also bee n assigned protected status under all the directives listed abo ve, whereas the Bourne Brook has a ‘poor’ ecological statu s and protected designation under the Freshwater Fish and Nitrates Directives. As a  
result, improvement is  necessary to m eet t he required ‘good’ eco logical stat us 
required under the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000) by 2027 a nd 
a reduction in pollution entering the watercourse from its tributaries will be essential.  
7.28 SU4 pro motes the mai ntenance and restoration of the n atural character of rive r 
valleys and their floodplains. Culverts and artificia l chan nels act as a barrier to  wildlife, the  flow of water, reduce natural clea nsing and contribute to  rivers being 
ignored rath er than see n as asset s. Watercour ses with more natural meandering 
profiles and  uneven beds encoura ge diversity, oxygenate water and support more fish and wildlife. SU4 also require s development proposa ls to consid er potential impacts on  groundwater quality a nd for new  development to enhan ce or prote ct groundwater resources.  
 7.29 SU4 protects easements to main rivers and flood defences f or maintenance, access 
and biodiversity reasons and in accordance with the Water Resources Act 1991. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP7, SP8, SP11, SP12  
SU4 Flood Risk and Water Management  
A sequential approach will be applied to all proposals for developmen t in order to 
direct it to a reas at the lowest risk o f flooding, unless it has met the requirements of 
the sequential test and exceptions test as set out in government guidance. 
 
All new development, i ncluding re generation proposals, will need to  demonstrate 
that there is no increased risk of flooding to existing properties and shall seek to 
improve e xisting flood risk management. A ll proposals f or development in Flood  
Zone 2 or 3,  or greater t han 1 hectare in Flood Zone 1 or where otherwise required 
by national planning guidance must be ac companied by a Flood Risk Assessment 
that sets out the mitig ation measures for the site and agreed with the relevant  
authority. Where necessary, pro posals will be expect ed to contribute towar ds 
building and maintaining any necessary defences and maintaining existing defences 
that are n ecessary f or new development.  Developers should consult the  
Environment Agency’s flood maps to ascertain the effects of surface water flooding 
on potential development sites.  
 
A minimum 8 metre riparian easement for biodiversity and access purposes must be 
maintained adjacent to the rivers A nker and Ta me. Furthermore, an 8m easement  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 134 must be maintained b etween any built development and the toe of Environme nt 
Agency mai ntained floo d defences.  Planning permission will not be g ranted for 
development that compromises the integrity and quality of  the strategic network of 
environmental infrastructure. 
 
Development should exploit opportunities to deliver priorities of the EU Water 
Framework Directive and the Humber River Basin Management Plan to ensure that 
the River Anker and River  Tame meet Good Ecological Status by 2027. 
 
All developments will be expected to incorporate appropriate Sustainable Drainage 
techniques that will manage flow routes on site, limit surface water run off discharge 
rates to the pre-development condition and limit or avoid th e connection of surface  
water discharge into the combined sewer netw ork. Sustainable drainage should be 
considered at an early stage of the design process and be clearly demonstrated and 
evidenced within the information accompany ing planning applications. Development 
should capitalise on op portunities for incorporating accessible green infrastructure,  
replicating natural systems and improving biodiversity with SuDS.   
 
New development will be required to open up culverted watercourses wherever it is 
technically feasible, re-aligning and naturalising watercourses where possible, and to 
ensure that development does not occur abov e or adjacent to existing culverts.  
 
Development will be permitted wh ere proposals do not have a negati ve impact o n 
water quality, either directly (through pollutio n of surface or ground water) or 
indirectly (through overloading o f wastewater treatme nt works.) Any major 
development should demonstrate that there is adequate wastewater infrastructure in 
place to serve the development. 
 
Proposals f or recreatio nal and tou rist development on Tamworth’s river, canal or 
lake areas f or better public access and for suit able water sports, inclu ding fishing, 
swimming, rowing and canoeing, will be encouraged. Such development should not 
adversely a ffect water quality or quantity, amenity, visual quality, navigation o r 
ecological value of a watercourse, asso ciated wetlands and  surrounding  
environment. Develop ments should be integrated into the existing footpath, 
cycleway a nd public tr ansport net work and highway access and pa rking issu es 
should be satisfactorily resolved. 
 
 
7.30 Guidance and initial f lood risk infor mation for site specif ic flood risk a ssessments is 
detailed in the Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. Further information related 
to surface water flooding, site dra inage investigations and sustain able drainage systems is available in the Southern St affordshire Surface Water Mana gement Plan 
(Phase 1 & 2 2010/11). Recommendations for  specific ho using allocation sites ar e set out in the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2014).  
7.31 Where new development benefits from the recently constructed Environment Agency 
Tame Flood Alleviation Scheme, developers may be require d to con tribute towards the continued maintenance of defences. 
 
7.32 SuDS use a wide range of drainag e techniques such as g rassed swales, retentio n 
ponds, soa kaways and permeable pavemen ts. Where  appropriate their de sign 
should be informed by a hydrological asse ssment. Infiltration and soakaways of  
surface water must be investigated as the first and primary means of draining surface 
water from a site. In ad dition to red ucing flood risk and risk of pollution , SuDS c an 
have wider amenity benefits where they are incorporated into the green infrastructure Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 135 network and can result in improvements in b iodiversity value.  Appropriately designed 
SuDS can support the implementati on of Policies EN3 and EN4 and the aims of th e 
Water Framework Directive.   
 
7.33 The Council  will suppor t improved access to t he riverside  to promote healthy an d 
active lifestyles and imp roved awareness and education of the river environment. A 
balance will be struck between formalising access to the  riverside, maintaining a natural cha racter to the river and safeguarding sensitiv e sections of the river.  Initiatives such as the  Central Rivers Initiat ive, Tame Valley Wetlands Partnership 
and the Hu mber River Basin Management Plan have the potential to  support this 
objective.  
7.34 Developers should ref er to the Environmen t Agency’s Groundwat er Protectio n: 
Principles a nd Practice  (GP3) (201 3) and any position statements on groundwater 
protection in connection with development proposals.  
 
Pollution, Ground Conditions and Minerals and Soils   
  7.35 Policy SU5 is nece ssary to manage the risk of existing sources of pollution and land 
instability in Tamworth, ensure that devel opment does not result in adverse impacts 
and that where appropriate and practical, mineral resour ces are not  sterilised by development.   
7.36 The Detaile d Assessment of Air  Quality at t he Two Gates Crossroa ds, Tamworth  
(2013) recommends the creation of  an Air Quality Manage ment Area at Two Gates. 
Policy SU5 will support the measures set out in the Action Plan to be prepared by the 
Council to address poor air quality in the area.   
7.37 SU5 addresses the  risk of potentia lly contaminated land a ssociated with industry in 
Tamworth and other past land uses, including the risk to the quality of water sources.  
The Broms grove Sand stone Formation is cla ssified as a  Principal Aquifer. All the  
other solid geology in t he area is either cla ssified as Secondary A or B Aquifers.  The superficial deposits associated with the River Anker ar e classified as Secondary Aquifers. Pr incipal aquifers are strategic grou ndwater resources and  capable  of  supporting large scale groundwater abstractions for public waters supply. Secondary aquifers also support local groundwater abstractions and provide base flow to rivers. 
 
7.38 Tamworth includes areas that are affected by the legacy of past coal mining and SU5 
requires land stability to be taken account of. Tamworth also  contains remaining coal 
reserves and sand and gravel resources asso ciated with the river valleys, much of  which is under the urban area. Mineral resource extraction will be considered prior to 
development. 
 
7.39 The countryside outside Tamworth’s urban area is predominantly in agricultural use, 
most of this is lower grade but there are pockets of higher grade land (best and most versatile agricultural la nd). The safeguarding  of valuable agricultur al land as a  resource fo r the future  will be  a consideration when co nsidering a pplications f or 
development. 
 
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priority SP1  
SU5 Pollution, Ground Conditions and Minerals and Soils 
Development should manage the risk of air, light, noise, gr ound or water pollution 
and land instability. Rele vant reports proportiona te to the scale of the d evelopment 
will be requi red to asse ss pollution levels and mitigation measures where a risk is Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 136 identified. P lanning per mission will be refused for any proposal where pollution 
would pose an unaccept able risk to public healt h, quality of life or the environment 
which is no t mitigated. Proposed land uses sh ould be appropriate to  the level of 
ground contamination risk. 
 
Where an Air Quality Management Area  is declared, develo pment sho uld 
incorporate any measures identified in the associated Action Plan. 
 
All new development must consider  site chara cteristics such as land stability and 
ground contamination, and be supported with an appropriate risk assessment:  
 
a) All proposals should include a preliminary risk asse ssment to id entify 
previous sit e uses an d potential for conta mination. Development  must  
conserve the water quality of aquifers in the district.  
b) Sites which fall within the Development High Risk Area shown on the Coal 
Authority’s maps must be supported by a Coal Mining Risk Assessment. 
 
The Council will consu lt with Staffordshire County Counc il in their r ole as the  
Minerals Planning Authority and the Coal Authority on the existence and extent of  
mineral and coal reserv es and imp ortance of r elevant infrastructure when dealin g 
with applica tions within  or in pro ximity to  strategic mineral allocatio ns, mineral  
infrastructure sites, mineral safeguarding areas and min eral consult ation areas.  
Where it is necessary for non-mineral dev elopment to ta ke place in  such  areas, 
consideration should be given to extracting the mineral resource in  advance o f 
development. This sh ould be done where practicable and environmentally 
acceptable and where the benefits of mineral extraction would outweigh the benefits 
of the development. This will avoid sterilisati on of these resources. Consideration will 
be given to mineral and coal reserves with cross boundary implications. 
 
When considering proposals for n ew develop ment on greenfield lan d, areas of 
poorer quality land within the site should be developed in preference to highe r 
quality land (Grades 1, 2 and 3a agricultural land) where possible. 
 
 
7.40 Preliminary risk asse ssments sh ould be in accordance with the Environme nt 
Agency’s Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination (2014). This 
should identify the potential for contamination and possible risks to controlled waters. Reference should also b e made to Environment Agency Guidance on Requirements for Land Contamination Reports (2005), which explains the type of information that  
the Environment Agen cy requires in order to assess site investigation and 
remediation reports. T he Environment Agency actively encourage s the u se of sustainable drainage systems at new devel opments; however prop osals for  th e 
drainage of surface or r oof water into the ground will need to take into account the findings of t he preliminary risk asse ssment and any subsequent site investigation. If  contamination is pre sent and surf ace water is to be dra ined to gro und then th e 
contamination risk assessment will need to consider the additional infiltration from the 
surface or roof water systems.  
7.41 The Council will maintain an up-to-date understanding of pollution and land instability 
risk in Tamworth, working with rele vant statutory organisations.  This will be used in 
pre-application discussions, master planning and to set  proportionate requirements 
for individual planning applications. 
 7.42 High quality agricultural  land is a finite resource which will be lost if it is developed. 
Retaining land of grade s 1, 2  and 3 a in the  Agricultural La nd Classification either in Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 137 food production or as other green space will safeguard its contribu tion towards  
sustainable food production and biodiversity. 
 
Community Facilities 
 
7.43  Policy SU6 protects and will expand the network of community facilities in Tamworth. 
Community infrastructure include s but is not  limited to educational an d healthcar e facilities, p laces of wor ship, sport s venues, cu ltural buil dings, publi c h ouses, lo cal shops and  community centres. Pr oposals fo r facilities which combine a mix of 
community uses on a single site will be encour aged as these have the potential t o reduce the need to travel whilst ge nerating associated linked benefits.  Locations f or new facilitie s should be selected on the basis of addressing accessib ility gaps, i n accordance with supporting evidence. 
 
7.44  Where appropriate education facil ities will be  expected to include p rovision for 
community uses, including multi-use facilities o pen to the wider community. Where 
education facilities are required to make such provision thi s will need to be factored into the overall size of the site and the design of buildings, which will be of particul ar relevance to the required new prima ry schools to serve the planned level of housin g 
development. 
 
7.45 It is important that residents of new  housing developme nts have g ood access to 
facilities an d that existi ng facili ties do not become oversu bscribed. S U6 therefore 
requires ne w develop ment to contribute towards the cost of the provision of  community facilities where warranted by the need arising from the development.  
 
This policy aims to address Spatial Priorities SP3, SP4, SP12 
SU6 Community Facilities  
A network of high qua lity, well designed and a ccessible f acilities wil l b e provided  
across T amworth to se rve local ne eds where they arise and as identified in th e 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and p olicies HG1 H ousing and HG2 Sustainable Urba n 
Extensions.  Where increased need is attributed to new de velopment, contributions 
will be req uired in accordance w ith poli cy IM1 Infrastructure and  Developer 
Contributions. 
 
Proposals will be encouraged that i nclude mixed community uses on a  single site. 
Proposals should be in locations accessible by walking, cycling and public transport. 
 
Proposals involving the loss of community facilities will be required to demonstrate: 
a) That there is insufficien t use or demand for us e to maintain the existing facility; 
or 
b) Adequate alternative provision is in pl ace in a nearby accessible location; or 
c) Where the use is commercial in n ature that th ere is a sig nificant lack of market  
interest in maintaining the facility. 
 
The existing network of Tamworth  wide education facilit ies will be protected and  
enhanced to meet local needs. The physical en hancement and expansion of higher 
and further educational facilities will be supported subject to having an  acceptable 
impact on other community and sports faci lities, the immediate environment a nd 
amenity. 
 
7.46 SU6 allows flexibility f or community faciliti es to modernise or relo cate to more 
suitable premises where it is still a ccessib le by the existing users. Whe re there is a  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 138 lack of market interest in a commercial facility of importance to a local neighbourhood 
the Council will support community bids to purchase or lease and run the service. 
 
7.47 Improved a ccess to e ducation, tr aining and support facilities is see n as a key 
objective for  Tamworth,  particular ly within the  most deprived neighbo urhoods. Th e Council’s Locality Working initiative has encouraged the use of neighbourhood based multi-use spaces which are particularly suit ed to bein g located  in local an d neighbourhood centres due to their accessibilit y. The Cou ncil will con tinue to work with partner agencies to improve  access to tr aining and skills development whilst  
identifying potential location for future provision.  
Sport and Recreation  
 
7.48 Tamworth, in conjunction with Sport Across Staffordshire aims to increase  
participation in physical activity by 1% per  year. Tamworth has consist ently met this  
target and to ensure it continues to  in the future the provision of both sports and  recreation f acilities and  an appropr iate and a ccessible net work of ope n space  are considered to be key factors in achieving this. 
 
7.49 With the ob jectives of improving h ealth, incre asing participation and improving th e 
quality of life of Tamworth reside nts, the Council produ ced a Joint  Indoor and 
Outdoor Sports Strategy in 2009 and updated it in 2014 to  take account of changes in available  facilities an d the prin ciples of  rece nt Sport England guida nce for bot h built facility and pitch  el ements. The Strategy and Update are suppor ted by Sport England and audit existing local provision of swimming pools, sports halls, health and 
fitness suites, playing p itches and  a range of specific ind oor and out door facilitie s 
including bo wls, tennis, BMX tracks and multi use games areas (MUGAs). Quali ty and access to facilities were asse ssed and consultation undertaken with nationa l governing bodies and local user g roups to understand the adequacy of existin g provision.   
 7.50 The Strategy Update recommends that all existing facilities are protected, maintained 
and enhanced and that new facilities are provided where deficiencies are identified. These are set out in the Infrastructu re Delivery Plan. Crucially, new facilities should  be available  for commu nity use thr ough officia l dual use agreements, which is of particular relevance to new school sites. 
 7.51 The Strategy identifies a need to increase access to a range of “core” facilities 
including swimming pools, sports halls a nd playing  pitche s, with a ke y recommendation relating to the need for a new multi-purpose community use leisure centre in an accessible location with associated facilities to include: 
 
 A 25m x 12 metre swimming pool with a teaching pool 
 A minimum of a 4 court sports hall 
 Squash courts 
 A health and fitness studio 
 
7.52 The quality, quantity and accessibility of new a nd existing sports recre ation facilities 
is a key fo cus in en suring an e xcellent sp ort and recreation infr astructure f or 
Tamworth’s neighbourhoods, and is integral to ensure that the associated health and 
social benefits of increased physical activity and participation are achieved.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 139 This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priorities SP4, SP7, SP12  
SU7 Sport and Recreation  
The Council will support a network o f good quality sport and recreation facilities that 
meet the needs of Ta mworth’s current and  future po pulation, with particula r 
emphasis on the needs of the Regeneration Pri ority Areas (Policy HG3). This will b e 
achieved by: 
 
a) Ensuring all  new faciliti es are in locations accessible by a range of transport 
modes including walking, cycling  and public transport  and are designed  
according to Sport England and national governing body guidelines. 
b) Delivering through cont ributions and public fun ding new an d enhanced facilities 
identified in  the Sports Strategy Update, in particular a  new multi-purpose  
community sports centre in an accessible location, with appropriate facilities an d 
3G pitches, to meet id entified nee d. Facilitie s should be designed to enable 
convenient public access and extended hours of use. 
c) Protecting a nd enhanci ng existing sport and r ecreational facilities. Sp ort and  
recreation facilities should not be built on unless any loss is compensated by th e 
provision of an equal or higher quantity and standard of facility and in a n 
accessible location or the development is for alternative sports and recreation 
provision, the needs for which are clearly set out in the Sports Strategy Update.  
d) Supporting the dual use  of new and existing school sites in accordance with the 
following criteria: 
 Where it would not be d etrimental to existing a nd proposed facilities on the 
school site. 
 Provides separate reception and changing facilitie s from the school or a  
design and layout that allows separation through site management. 
 
The sustain able urban extensions will provide provision o r a contribu tion towards 
new provision in line with the Sports Strategy Update. 
 
 
7.53 Delivery of enhanced  and new smaller spo rts facil ities will be fu nded through  
planning obligations, directly by sports clubs and associations and in conjunction with 
new school  sites. The  multi-purpose comm unity use leisure centre,  will rely on suitable funding arrangements being identified t hrough the Community Infrastructure 
Levy. The Council will explore different m odels for the finance, sit e acquisit ion, 
construction and operation of the facility.  
 
Delivering a Sustainable Town 
  
7.54 Table 7.1 outlines how the policies in this chapter will be implemented to ensure th at 
development in Tamworth contribut es to the o verall sustai nability of t he town by identifying the action required, responsible parties and when delivery s hould happen. Development management includes pro-active regulation  that goes beyond th e granting of planning pe rmission including pre-application discussions, compliance with conditions and planning enforcement.

 143 CHAPTER 8 – IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING  
 
8.1  The Local P lan’s success will depen d on effe ctive implementation of its policies. I n 
addition to the Council’ s statutory planning fu nction, impl ementation will require  
working with a range of delivery partners, including Tamworth Strategic Partnership, developers, Registered  Providers (of afford able housin g), Staffordshire County Council and other key partners from the private, public and voluntary sector. 
 8.2  The Local Plan must also show it is capable of being monitored effectively.  
Monitoring of specific, measurable, achievable, realistic an d time base d policies will  enable the success of the Local P lan to be measured during its lifetime whilst assisting the instigation  of contingency plans where it is demonstrated that policies 
are not achieving their stated objectives.  
 
Implementation 
 
8.3  Developer contributions will be use d to ensure that the necessary physical, social, 
economic and blue and green infrastructure is in place to support development . 
Contributions will be used to mitigate the adv erse impacts of development (includin g 
a proportio nal contribu tion to addr ess the cu mulative impact of the  developme nt proposals). The Council will, where appropriate, seek to  secure su ch measures through planning obligations, a nd once adopted, through the Communit y Infrastructure Levy (CI L). Where appropriate and in accordance w ith planning 
regulations, pooled contributions will be used to facilitate the necessary infrastructure 
in line with development.  
 8.4  New develo pment should not over burden existing infrastructure and  should b e 
adequately supported b y an appropriate range and scale of infrastructure, whether 
existing or new. Delivering or improving infr astructure in a timely manner is extremely 
important to ensure roads, local services and facilit ies can cope with additiona l 
demand placed on them. Ho wever, there is a recognition  that the vi ability of new development is also taken into account when agreeing the type an d amount o f infrastructure required. 
 
8.5  In some ca ses, effectiv e demand management and makin g better use of existing  
infrastructure will play an important  role in supporting new development. 
 
8.6  Infrastructure and service requirements, as ide ntified by th e Infrastruct ure Delivery 
Plan (IDP), require monitoring either through the Local Plan monitoring framework or 
in close association wit h it. The IDP is the beginning of a process to integrate the  
capital investment programmes  of variou s services with plan ning for n ew development, to align d elivery of growth , especially housin g and econ omic growth, 
with the necessary infra structure to support this. The basel ine position will allow th e Council an d its partn ers in the Tamworth Strategic Partnership t o continue  to  prioritise spending and address funding gaps over the lifetime of the Local Plan. 
 8.7 The Tamworth Strategic Partnership brings together key local organisations from th e 
public, private, voluntary and community sectors. All the  organisations are working together to address often complicated challenges required to improve the quality o f life for Tamworth’s communities. The TSP provi des a platform to discuss debate and 
progress issues. One work stream within th e TSP is the Infrastru cture Delivery 
Board, which has the key objectives of identifying infrastru cture needed to support  Tamworth and identifying available funding.  The work of the TSP is used to inform the IDP.  Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

8.8  The IDP set out Appendix B will be an important element of ensuring the delivery of 
sustainable development, supported by the  necessary services and facilitie s required. Th e IDP outlin es future infrastructure r equirements to support  population changes, housing and employment growth as detailed in this document. 
 8.9  The IDP provides an indication of  the potential costs an d methods of funding the 
identified inf rastructure t hrough mai nstream public funding,  developer contributions and other sources. It also est ablishes ef fective working arrang ements with  infrastructure agencies to ensure th at a dialogu e is maintained beyond the scope of individual projects.  
 
8.10  Where new developme nt results in a need f or new or improved in frastructure, 
contributions from developers will be sought to make the d evelopment acceptable in 
planning terms. In some cases the  cumulative impact of in dividual applications may be consider ed when a ssessing inf rastructure requirements. Contributions from a  particular development will be fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the  contribution to the cumulative impact arising from the applicable scheme. 
  8.11  Further work may be required to identify appropriate infrastructure to help deliver and 
mitigate th e impacts of Tamwort h related development located  o utside of  it s boundary. This may involve Tamwo rth, in partn ership with Lichfield District Council, North Warwicksh ire Borough Council, infra structure providers and lan downers to 
bring forward infrastruct ure through future development plans, master plans an d 
planning applications.  
This policy aims to address Strategic Spatial Priority SP6  
IM1 Infrastructure and Developer Contributions  
Planning permission for new development will o nly be grant ed if it is supported by 
appropriate infrastructure at a timely stage. Developer cont ributions will be sought 
where needs arise a s a result of ne w development, the infr astructure delivery plan 
specifies the infrastructure required, when and where it will be needed  in the plan 
and how it could be funded.  
 Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 145 Key strategic infrastructure required to support development: 
a) impro ving quality, access and  links to; the town centre and local and 
neighbourhood centres; green and b lue infrastructure and the open space network;  
and public realm in accordance with policies EC2, EC4, EC5, HG2, HG3, EN2, EN3, 
EN4 and EN6. 
b) provision of appropri ate sport a nd recreatio n facilit ies and new and improve d 
open space in accordance with policy SU7. 
c) improving acce ssibility and lin ks by  means of pub lic transport, cycleway an d 
pedestrian access to, community facilities and open space to deliver strategic urban 
extensions and housing allocations in accordance with policies HG1, HG2, EC5 and  
EC6. 
d) cross-boundary infrastructure to help deliver and mitigate the effects of Tamworth 
related future development. 
e) improvements to tra nsport infrastructure, in accordance with policie s EC6, HG1 , 
HG2, SU1 and SU2. 
f) climate change mitigation measures in accordance with policy SU3. 
g) water management measures including f lood alleviation where required, in  
accordance with policy SU4. 
 
Key service and site-specific infrastructure required to support development are: 
h) affordable housing, as set out in policy HG4. 
i) new and expanded community facilities, in accordance with policy SU6. 
j) new and expanded school facilities, in accordance with policies HG2 and SU6. 
k)emergency services related infrastructure , including police services, in accordance 
with SU6. 
l) water supply and waste water drainage. 
m) supporting service infrastructure. 
 
 
Monitoring 
 
8.12 Each policy within the Local Plan will be monitored using  specifi c in dicators an d 
targets. Progress against the delivery of these indicators an d targets will be reporte d via the Co uncil’s website each year to assess how far the policies are being implemented. In some cases, wher e deliver y is not expected in the short term, a 
series of milestones are included instead of annually measurable indicators. 
 8.13  The Sustainability Appraisal has a key influence on the Local Plan monitoring  
framework. The SA Report identifies crucial monitoring requirements in relation to the predicted effects of the Local Plan  policies and strategies, which ha s informed the  
choice of Local Plan monitoring framework indicators. This alignment will help ensure 
compliance with the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive. 
 8.14 Previously, the implementation of p olicie s was measured using indicat ors contained 
within the C ouncil’s pub lished Annu al Monitorin g Report (AMR). The Localism Act  removed the requireme nt for local planning au thorities to produce an AMR, whil e 
retaining the overall du ty to monitor. Authoritie s can now choose which targets a nd 
indicators to include in the report as long as they are  in line with the relevant UK an d EU legislation. Their primary purpose is to share the performance and achievements 
of the plan ning service  with the lo cal community. As a Council, we  will use the indicators identified to revise what indicators to use and the frequency of publication.  
 8.15 Monitoring may indicate that further action is r equired, particularly where targets are  
not being met and are unlikely t o be met in the future.  Significant  variation fro m performance required b y the policy and target may result in the need  to amend th e Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031

  APPENDIX C – Car Parking Standards 
 
Introduction 
 This Appendix sets out the recommended  car parking standards for new 
developments within Tamworth. Parking st andards are an important element of policy 
SU2 Delivering Sustainable Transport.  
Objective 
 
The objective is to ensure that sufficient space is provided for the accommodation of  parked vehicles having regard to the location, layout, size, shape, access needs and design quality of the s pace. The parking sta ndards are intended to ensure tha t parked vehicles do not become either a safe ty hazard or environmental nuisance. In 
order to achieve this objective, it is essential that a car par king policy exists in ord er for negotiations to be  carried out w ith developers in a  consistent, constructive and clearly understood manner.  The developer will normally have  to provi de fully for the parking demand generated  
on or near the site of the development, particularly when new buildings are proposed. This requirement ma y not however be possible  or desirab le where red evelopment, refurbishment or conversions are  p roposed wit hin the tow n centre or conservation areas when conservation and transportation policie s need to be taken into account and the ava ilability of p ublic parking facilities a ssessed. In these circumstances the standards should be used in a positive and flex ible manner as an aid to development. 
In central areas with good public transport links users may require less parking.  Where such developme nt proposals do not make  provision to the relevant parking  
standard then negotiations can be  entered int o to see if f urther provision could be achieved or to reach a suitable compromise where public safety will not be 
prejudiced. 
  It is recognised, however, that the parking requirements are but part of the overa ll 
assessment of the planning merits of the proposal and the outcome can be a balance between all these considerations.  
The practical parking requirements for any par ticular development are likely to reflect 
a combination of the criteria listed below and need to be negotiated accordingly: 
 1. The natu re of the use/type of use (largely reflected in th e car parkin g standards themselves) 
2. Location (town centre, conservation area, urban area, rural area, greenfield site) 
3. Development type (new development, r edevelopment, refurbishment, conversion) 
4. Proximity to public parking areas/availability of on-street parking 5. Accessibility (the balance between public and private transportation) 6. Number of employees 7. Assessment of use of development by local populace/work force 
8. Any special operational requirements 
9. Levels of car ownership 10. Multiplicity of uses proposed and degree of combined usage.  As a general principle, servicing provision should be based on the maxi mum number 
of vehicles likely to serve the developm ent at any one time b eing able to manoeuvre Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
 with ease and to stand for loading and unloading without inconvenience to other 
users of the site, so as to ensure that:  
• all service vehicles are accommodated off the public highway, 
• all service vehicles enter and leave the site in forward gear, • sufficient access is provided for emergency vehicles. 
 
How to Use the Standards  
The standards relate, where possible, to uses defined in the Town  and Count ry 
Planning Use Classes ( Amendment) Order 2005. For any use not included in t he 
standards, the number of parking spaces will be assessed and determined based on the individual merits of the scheme.  
All standards are based on gross floor area by external measurements unless stated 
to the contr ary. The term gross flo or space shall mean th e total floor  space of  a building, including such areas as service corridors, lifts and toilets.  Mixed uses will be a ssessed as a sum of the p arking requirements of t he individual 
elements of the scheme based on  the standa rds, unless the timing of demand  
associated with individual uses can be shown  to allow d ual use of spaces. Th is includes ancillary uses such as offi ce use within an industrial development or a  bar open to no n-residents within a hot el etc.  In mixed developments where the main  parking de mand occurs at differe nt times such as both daytime an d evening, an  element of dual use of parking spaces will be acceptable. Tandem spaces will on ly 
be acceptable where specifically for use by staff with similar working hours. 
 The standar ds apply to  new development, extensions and  changes of  use. Wh en considering an extension to an existing use, th e standard will be appli ed only to the extension and any shortfall in parki ng provision for the e xisting building will not be  
required to be met. When considering a redevelopment or change of use, the level of  
parking provision will relate to the requi rements of the development as a whole. 
 Sufficient manoeuvring and standing space  is required within the site for the maximum number and size of vehicle likely to serve the development at any one time. 
 
If areas within the facilities are co nvertible to another use  having a higher parkin g 
standard requirement, the higher standard will be applied.  The recommended standards are contained in  the following schedule. The minimum size for a standard car parking space is 2.4m by 4.8m. Spaces within garages can be 
included when calculating the number of car parking spaces provided.

Adopted 23rd February 2016 
  APPENDIX E – Travel Plans 
 
Aims and Objectives of a Travel Plan 
A Travel Pl an is a strat egy to minimise the number of single car occupancy mot or 
vehicles visiting a development, t hereby red ucing cong estion and mitigating the impact of travel on the  environme nt. A main aim is therefore to achieve a modal change fro m the car t o more sust ainable for ms of transport. A Travel Plan should 
deliver sustainable transport objectives which seek to: 
 
a) Manage the demand for travel to a site b) Improve the availability and choice of travel modes to a site c) Reduce the need to travel (to and from the site) 
d) Reduce the number of vehicles attending  the site, particularly single 
occupancy vehicles 
e) Reduce the costs associated with on-site parking provision and congestion 
f) Provide the absolute minimum possible car parking spaces on site g) Improve the safety and security of people who travel to the site 
h) Promote th e increased  use of cycling, walking and public transpo rt and  
therefore healthier living 
i) Promote integration between different transport modes j) Promote co-ordination between developments on larger sites k) Make positive changes to attitudes in relatio n to the use of alter native 
transport modes 
l) Provide clear information to residen ts, employees, custome rs and visito rs on 
the alternative modes of transport to and from the site 
m) Improve accessibility for non-ca r users and people with disabilities 
n) Promote th e develop ment of a  transport system whi ch enhances the  
environment and supports a sustainable economy 
 Which Developments require a Travel Plan? 
The indicative thresholds contained within Appendix B of  the Guidance on Transport  
Assessment (GTA) published March  2007 by the Department for Transport and the 
Department for Communities and Local Government will largely be used to determine whether and what type of Travel Plan will be required (see table below). 
 
Developments fall ing i nto the co lumn headed Travel Plan Threshold  will require  a Travel Plan to be submitted with the ap plications a longside th e Transport Assessment. The Travel Plan will be secured by a Section 106 Agreement.  
Those developments falling in the column headed Minimalist Travel Plan are likely to 
require a Minimalist Travel Plan secured by Grampian Condition. 
 
Types of Travel Plan 
The form of the Travel Plan will largely be determined by the type of development, its 
location and accessibility to sustainable modes of travel. Indeed, the outcome of the Transport Assessment will also affect the mea sures and outcomes to be achieved. 
Much also depends on the end user and whether these are known or not. Generally, Travel Plans fall into the following categories:  
Minimalist Travel Plans 
These are used for small-scale d evelopments where the end user is known and 
where the transport implication s ar e not subst antial but n evertheless important to control. The emphasis for Minimalist Plans is on encouraging and promoting travel by sustainable modes for a period of about 5 years. Min imalist Plan s are usually Tamworth Borough Council –Local Plan 2006-2031  
Adopted 23rd February 2016 
  secured by way of a Grampian planning c ondition. They will genera lly not involve 
modal split targets or remedies. 
 Travel Plan Framework 
These are used where outline planning consent is being sought and where the end -
users are unknown. They provide a fr amework for individual Travel Plans. 
 
Measures and Outcomes Travel Plan 
These involve more  of a commit ment to a travel plan and contain  a range of  measures or actions to be provided within an agreed timetable. In order to provid e 
more assurance that t he modal split/shift  tar gets within the Travel Plan would be 
achieved the Travel Plan needs to include remedies if the targets are not met. Where Travel Plans include modal split/sh ift targets a nd/or outcome targets with remedies and there is a high degree of confidence that this will succeed in reducing car usage 
then it is r easonable t o make an allowance for this in t he trip rate  used in th e 
Transport Assessment.  Physical or hard measures can be  secured by way of a Grampian condition that w ill require a se parate legal agreement with the County Council. Other mea sures within 
the Travel Plan can include: car parking management; the phasing of works; or the  
establishment of a Travel Plan Coordinator.  Survey and monitoring arrangements including monitoring fees are better dealt wit h by way of  a S106 Obligation. These Travel Plans ar e most eff ective where  reviews/monitoring is linked with agreed targets/outcomes and where f ailure to meet 
these is to be remedied. Remedies are also controlled by a S106 Obligation relating 
to further specified measures or actions that may prove to be more effective. 
 
Residential Travel Plan  
These focu s on journ eys originating from home to multiple and changing destinations. They should includ e targets based on trip rates with remedial  
measures

law, and its status is on ly an introductory guide to planning terminology and should 
not be used as a source for statutory definitions.  
Accessibility  The ability of everyone to conveniently go where they want. 
Affordable Housing 
 Social rented, affordable rented an d intermediate housing , 
provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by 
the market. Eligibility is determined with regard to local 
incomes and local hou se prices. A ffordable housing should include provisions to re main at an affordable price for future  eligible h ouseholds or for the sub sidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.  
Social rent ed housing  is owned by local au thorities an d 
private registered providers (a s defined in section 80 of the  
Housing an d Regeneration Act 20 08), for which guideline  target rents are determined through the national rent regime. It may also be owned by other persons and pro vided under 
equivalent rental arrangements to t he above, as agreed with 
the local authority or with the Homes and Communities Agency.  Affordable rented housing is let by local authorit ies or private registered providers of social housing to households who are 
eligible for social rented  housing. Affordable Rent is subject 
to rent controls that require a rent of no more  than 80% o f the local market rent (including  service charges, where  applicable).  
Intermediate housing is homes for sale and rent provided at  
a cost above social rent , but below market levels subject to the criteria in the Affordable Housing definition above. These can include  shared equity (shared ownership and equity loans), other low cost homes for sa le and intermediate ren t, but not affordable rented housing. 
 
Homes that  do not me et the above definition of affordable housing, su ch as “low cost market” housing, may not be considered as affordable housing for planning purposes.
