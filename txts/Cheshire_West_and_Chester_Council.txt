Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic PoliciesCheshire West and Chester Local Plan
The Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan was adopted on the 29thJanuary 2015 and forms part of
the statutory development plan for the borough. The Local Plan will be developed in two parts, Part
One Strategic Policies and Part Two Land Allocations and Detailed Policies.
Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies
The Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies is the first local development
documenttobeproducedbyCheshireWestandChesterCouncil. ThepurposeofthisPlanistoprovide
the overall vision, strategic objectives, spatial strategy and strategic planning policies for the borough
to 2030. The Local Plan (Part One) will be the starting point when considering planning applications
and will be supported by the Cheshire West and Chester Local Plan (Part Two) Land Allocations and
Detailed Policies Plan in due course.
The Local Plan (Part One) includes policies that have been informed by a suite of evidence base
documents prepared to support the Plan to ensure that the policies reflect locally determined priorities
for new homes, jobs, the environment and infrastructure development.
The Local Plan (Part One) includes:
Overall vision for the borough
Strategic objectives for new development in the borough
Spatial strategy for the location of new development including the identification of key sites
Strategic economic, social and environmental policies to support the spatial strategy
Schedule of proposed retained policies from the currently adopted Local Plans
The Local Plan (Part One) is supported by a wide range of background documents including:
Sustainability Appraisal
Habitats Regulations Assessment Screening Report
Monitoring, Implementation and Viability

the process of preparing a neighbourhood plan is successfully completed for a community, the policies
within it will form part of the development plan for that area.
Relationship to other Council plans and strategies
The Local Plan is a key Council document. It is the spatial expression of the borough's priorities and

8 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic PoliciesDuty to Co-operate
Section 33A of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, as inserted by s110 of the Localism
Act 2011, has introduced a duty to co-operate in relation to the planning of sustainable development.
This came into effect in November 2011.
This requires the Council to co-operate with other local planning authorities and bodies prescribed in
regulation 4(1) of The Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 to
maximise the effectiveness of the preparation of the Core Strategy and supporting activities so far as
it relates to a strategic matter.
TheCouncilandothersarerequiredtoengageconstructively,activelyandonanongoingbasis.Regard
must also be had, under section 33A(9) and regulation 4(2), to the activities of the Local Enterprise
Partnership as they relate to the Local Plan and supporting activities.
The Council has carried out continuous engagement with other local planning authorities and bodies
throughout the preparation of the Local Plan.
Appraisals and assessments
The Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies has been subject to assessment under the EU Habitats
Directives and a Sustainability Appraisal, which has incorporated the requirements of the EU Strategic
Environmental Assessment Directive, rural proofing, health impact assessment and equality analysis.

9 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies1 Cheshire West and Chester profile
1.1Cheshire West and Chester is a highly desirable place to live, work and visit and is one of the
most affluent areas in the North West.
1.2The borough was formed in 2009 with the creation of a new unitary authority through the
amalgamation of Chester City, Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal Councils with the western
part of Cheshire County Council. Cheshire West and Chester covers a large geographic and
demographically diverse area and is the fourth largest authority in the North West. The north western
partoftheboroughhasparticularlystronglinkswithnortheastWalesandMerseysidewhichisreflected
inlevelsofcross-commuting. TotheeasttheboroughbordersCheshireEastandhasparticularlystrong
links with the town of Middlewich that is surrounded on three sides by Cheshire West and Chester.
There are also links to Warrington, Greater Manchester and Shropshire.
1.3Over 329,000 people live in Cheshire West with over 160,000 people working in the borough.
Theareaischaracterisedbyattractivecountryside,variedlandscapesanddiversesettlementsranging
fromthehistoriccityofChestertosmallruralhamlets. Chester,EllesmerePortandNorthwichdominate
thenorthernpartoftheboroughandsitwithinoradjoiningtheNorthCheshireGreenBeltwhichcovers
42 percent of the borough's land area. Three of the larger rural settlements, Neston, Frodsham and
Helsby, are also located in the Green Belt in the more urbanised north of the borough.
1.4The borough benefits from a high quality natural environment with a number of internationally
and nationally important sites for wildlife, including the Dee and Mersey estuaries, as well as having a
rich architectural heritage with a high number of conservation areas, listed buildings and scheduled
monuments. Ease of access to the countryside provides a significant recreational resource as does
the access to the borough's waterways and leisure facilities. A key priority is to deliver development to
meetfuturehousingandemploymentneedswhilstprotectingthequalityofthenaturalenvironmentthat
gives Cheshire West and Chester its special and valued character.
1.5Cheshire West and Chester is part of the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership
andtheMerseyDeeAlliance,buttheboroughdoesnotcoverasingleeconomicgeography. Ineconomic
and geographic terms, the borough lies between the urban centres of Manchester and Liverpool and
the boundary of the spheres of influence of these economic centres runs through the area. The view
thatCheshireWestandChesterisnotatthecentreofitsowneconomicgeographyissupportedbythe
fact that residents can, on average, earn more by out-commuting than working within the borough.
1.6The key long term economic issue for Cheshire West and Chester is an ageing population and
adeclineintheworkingagepopulation. Asincreasingnumbersofresidentsreachretirementagethere
willbeimplicationsfortotaldisposableincome,retailandservicesectorvitalityandfuturelaboursupply
which may deter future investment.
1.7The population has high levels of economic activity, strong skills and is likely to be employed in
managerialandprofessionalemploymentalthoughtherearesomeareasofdeprivationintheborough.
There are pockets of deprivation concentrated in Ellesmere Port, Chester, Winsford and Northwich.

level of vacancy rates compare favourably to national averages.

housepricesarebeingmaintainedbythosewhovaluethelivingenvironmentandeducationopportunities
offered within the area but who out-commute for employment.
1.9The distribution of employment opportunities across Cheshire West and Chester leads to a high
proportion of car use for commuter journeys across the area. There is a low level of public transport
useinsomecommunitiesandthereisastrongcorrelationbetweenpublictransportuseandthoseareas
where deprivation is highest. Partly influenced by the use of private cars, and perhaps influenced by
the scale of the economy and concentration of industry in Ellesmere Port, the area has a poor record
in CO2emissions with an Air Quality Management Area in place at A5032 Whitby Road/Station Road
area.
1.10Cheshire West and Chester has considerable minerals resources and a significant salt mining
history. The area's mineral resources are supplied to both the local and wider national markets. In
particular salt extraction is essential for both the local and national economies and forms the basis for
a substantial part of the borough's chemical industry. Sand extraction is also very important to the
construction industry supplying sand for concrete, mortar and as general fill material.
1.11Whilst recycling levels for household waste have increased dramatically, a large proportion of
Cheshire West and Chesterâ€™s waste continues to be landfilled. With only one landfill site operating and
legislative and fiscal charges requiring the diversion of waste away from landfill, new types of waste
management facilities will be required. Hazardous waste facilities already operating in the borough
serve a national market area.
Chester
1.12The city of Chester is the boroughâ€™s largest settlement with over 81,000 residents and is a key
centreforemployment,retail,educationandtourismaswellasbeingamaintransportinterchangeand
gateway, with direct routes to London, Manchester, Merseyside and North Wales. The city is
internationally renowned as a historic city with unique heritage assets particularly Roman remains, the
City Walls and medieval Rows. The role of the city as a destination for shoppers has weakened due to
increased competition not only from larger centres such as Liverpool but at a local level from the
significant expansion and changing retail offer from out of centre retail parks and out of town shopping
centres, in particular Cheshire Oaks.
1.13Chesteristheonlypartoftheboroughwithasignificantlevelofin-commutingwhichreflectsthe
job opportunities available in the city particularly at the successful Chester Business Park. There is a
strong financial service sector in the city as well as a high level of service sector jobs linked to leisure
and tourism. However, many of the higher earning Chester residents in higher managerial and
professional occupations commute to jobs outside Cheshire West and Chester.
11 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies1.14The city has a successful university and Further Education establishment at the University of
Chester and West Cheshire College. Both establishments provide both learning and employment
opportunities,althoughaccommodatingandintegratingstudentaccommodationinthecityhaspresented
challenges.
Ellesmere Port
1.15Ellesmere Port is the second largest settlement with over 60,000 residents and the most
industrialised part of the borough and was a major centre for manufacturing. The town has suffered a
sharp decline in employment and there has been a 50 percent reduction in manufacturing employment
leaving a legacy of derelict brownfield sites and some contamination issues. The industrial legacy and
thepresenceoftheM53motorwaycuttingthroughthetownhasledtoimageandperceptionproblems.

of the town and the borough as a whole.
1.17Ellesmere Port town centre serves as a local shopping centre and provides access to wider
facilities and services.
Northwich
1.18The town of Northwich and adjoining settlements of Anderton, Barnton, Davenham, Hartford,
LostockGralam,LowerMarston,LowerWincham,RudheathandWeaverhamcombinetoformthethird
biggest urban area in Cheshire West and Chester. The area has benefited from the stabilisation of
former salt mines that had prevented large areas of the town coming forward for redevelopment. In
particular, land stabilisation has enabled proposals to come forward that will significantly improve the
town centre of Northwich and help enhance the town's role as a major retail and leisure destination.
1.19Northwich has good links to the wider countryside and significant heritage assets, including the
distinctive black and white buildings of the town centre. The waterways of Northwich are a particular
assetalthoughpartsofthetownhavefloodingissues. Thepresenceofchemicalindustriesinthetown
has reduced, leaving a significant brownfield land resource. There are however, a high proportion of
service sector jobs. Northwich has net out-commuting which reflects its central location to other urban
areas and access to the mid-Cheshire railway line that serves Greater Manchester and Chester.
Winsford
1.20The smallest of the four key urban areas with a population of 30,000, Winsford is nationally
renowned for the mining of rock salt. Winsford was expanded as an â€˜overspillâ€™ town in the 1960s, with
new residents arriving from Manchester and Liverpool. More recently, Winsford and the surrounding
1 Cheshire West and Chester profile

includingWinsfordIndustrialEstateandWoodfordPark,whichhaveattractednewindustryandbusiness
tothearea.Whilstthetownhasagoodsupplyofindustrialanddistributionland,thereisnoestablished
office market, reducing the range of employment opportunities available.
1.21The town faces challenges associated with a declining town centre and poor transport links
between employment and residential areas as well as between the railway station and the rest of the
town. There are pockets of deprivation in the town where average household incomes are amongst
the lowest in the borough. There are relatively high unemployment rates which has led to the town
having a poorer perception than other areas. House prices are generally more affordable for first time
buyers and the town has the potential to improve on access and links to the River Weaver, the Flashes
and surrounding countryside.
Rural area
1.22A third of the boroughâ€™s residents live in the rural area that runs from Neston in the north, which
bordersWirral,totheboundarywithShropshireinthesouth.Theruralareainthesouthismoresparsely
populated and many of the settlements, especially in the north, are effectively dormitory settlements
that are dependent on larger towns for employment opportunities. Car use is generally very high and

with higher than average household incomes and higher levels of academic qualifications.
1.23Althoughagricultureemploysfewpeople,itmakesaverysignificantcontributiontothecharacter
of the borough, habitats and the environment. The character of the rural area is also defined by the
network of settlements that provide rural residents with services and facilities. The population in the
rural area is generally older than other parts of Cheshire West and house prices are higher.

out the Council's ambitions for growth and development and how this will be distributed across the

and to support an additional 14,000 people in employment.
Levels of new development
5.2The Preferred Policy Directions (PPD) outlined the Council's preferred option for growth which
would deliver 1,050 new homes per annum (21,000 over the Plan period). This figure would be a
mid-range figure between 2008 based household projections and the housing requirement set out in
the revoked Regional Spatial Strategy. The figure also equated to past completions between 1996 and
2011,althoughthisinitselfwasnotintendedasthebasisforobjectivelyassessedneed.Sincepreparation

Government household projections and has prepared a new Strategic Housing Market Assessment
based on an updated household survey.
5.3The Government's 2011 based interim household projections that run to 2021 identify that the
number of additional households forming in Cheshire West would be around 500 per annum. Whilst

5.4There are a number of economic strategies that the borough has prepared itself or with partners
that express a variety of ambitious targets for economic growth and housing delivery. The Cheshire
and Warrington Local Economic Partnership produced â€˜Unleashing the Potential of Cheshire and
Warrington'(draftJuly2011). Thedocumentoutlinedthesub-regionshouldaimtoincreasethepopulation
by 100,000 people, provide 22,000 new jobs and 71,000 new dwellings by 2030. In 2013 the Council
published the 'Altogether Better for Business: An economic growth strategy for West Cheshire' that
aspires to facilitate an additional 5,000 new jobs, 7,300 homes and Â£500m worth of private sector
investment by 2018. These economic strategies have been considered through the preparation of the
Local Plan (Part One) and where appropriate their aspirations reflected through the Plan's policies.

Spatial Areas and approach to accommodating growth
5.7The borough has been split into five areas (Chester, Ellesmere Port, Northwich, Winsford and
rural area) which broadly reflect how regeneration is delivered in the borough. Key teams and projects
supporting regeneration in the borough include Chester Renaissance, Weaver Valley Partnership,
Ellesmere Port Development Board and Rural Regeneration Board.
5.8The Chester Renaissance programme focuses on the area in and around the wider city centre.
The 'Chester One City Plan' is a 15 year strategy to guide economic regeneration in the city.
5.9The Ellesmere Port Development Board, supported by the Council, has prepared a regeneration
framework to support investment and regeneration in the town over the next 10 to 15 years.

Approach to Green Belt release and Chester
5.13Since its designation, the North Cheshire Green Belt has played an important role in protecting
the character of the north of the borough where development pressures are the greatest. At both a
regional and local scale the designation has assisted urban regeneration, checked urban sprawl,
protected the identity of settlements and safeguarded the countryside. In relation to Chester and its
surrounding network of villages the Green Belt has assisted in preserving the setting and special
characterofChester.GiventheimportanceofGreenBelt,thePlanseekstomaintainthegeneralextent

19 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies5.14Chester is the boroughâ€™s largest settlement, a focus for economic development and acts as a
sub-regional centre for shopping, leisure and tourism. Chester is the only part of the borough with
significant levels of in-commuting with an excess of 16,000 jobs over economically active residents. It
is accepted that Chester has good public transport links and its proximity to Wales will invariably mean
a high level of cross border commuting. However, as outlined in the SHMA there is a high affordable

detail and justification for the approach of Green Belt release is set out in the 'Strategy and Housing
Background Paper'.
5.15Key factors in the approach to the location of development was to maintain the strategic gap
between Chester and Ellesmere Port, maintain the separation and distinct character between Chester
andthesurroundingvillagesandensurethatGreenBeltboundarychangerespectstheneedtosafeguard

accommodated elsewhere in the borough, albeit less sustainably. Work to review Green Belt in the
vicinity of Chester paid high regard to preserving the special setting and historic character of the city.
The Stage Two of the Chester Green Belt Study (2013), building on previous work, identified that for
the most part the cityâ€™s periphery were considered unsuitable for Green Belt release due to potential
harm to the purposes of Green Belt.

23 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policiesisavailablebothforindigenousfirmsandinwardinvestment.WiththerevocationoftheRegionalSpatial
Strategy it is for the Local Plan to identify levels of growth to meet objectively assessed needs. The
starting point for assessing need has been the production of up to date demographic forecasts that
looked at a series of scenarios to assess future housing need up to 2030. It is not the intention of the
policytolimithigherlevelsofdevelopmentwheresitescomeforwardonsustainablylocatedpreviously
developed land and where no infrastructure issues would arise.
5.21As set out previously the level of new housing is higher than that proposed at the Preferred
Policy Directions stage. It is recognised that 22,000 new dwellings to 2030 is an ambitious figure given
continued economic uncertainty and that average completions of 1,100 per annum have not been
achieved in the recent past. The Local Plan has been prepared positively and this level of growth will

2010theeconomicuncertaintyandissuessurroundingmortgageanddevelopmentfinancehavesubdued
the housing market. Although the Council has granted a significant number of housing permissions
and taken a pro-active stance regards delivery of sites, the Plan relies on house builders to build out
sites. TheCheshire,HaltonandWarringtonEconomicModel(CHWEM)forecastsanimprovingeconomy
as the plan period progresses, therefore it is considered any backlog during more difficult times should
be made up over the lifetime of the Plan. The housing requirement of at least 22,000 new dwellings
(1,100 dwellings per annum) is a net figure. If recent trends continue it could be anticipated that up to
approximately50dwellingsperyearmaybelosttootherusesordemolished.Onthisbasisthenumber

to maximise the use of brownfield land with over 60 percent of new housing anticipated to be delivered
on previously developed land, the release of greenfield sites will be required especially within the rural
area.
5.23The Local Economic Assessment identifies that there is not a single economic geography for
the borough. The economic mix is extremely diverse and as such there is a need to plan for a range of
different sizes and types of employment sites. The Local Plan policy aims to provide employment land
of various scales and types across the borough alongside new housing development, enabling people
to work close to where they live, ensuring this is attractive to indigenous and inward investors.

In recognition of the national and international importance of Chester as a historic walled city, any
development within or on the periphery of the city centre or within or on the edge of the urban area
should be compatible with the conservation or enhancement of the city centre and the character
and setting of the city.

Development in Ellesmere Port has the potential to deliver substantial economic growth through
the availability of significant sites for industrial, manufacturing and distribution purposes. Further
housing is planned to complement the townâ€™s role as a key employment location.
The Local Plan makes provision for at least 4,800 new dwellings in Ellesmere Port. To meet this
requirement the following land is identified:

The Council will maintain a portfolio of employment land and premises available within Ellesmere
Port and the surrounding area, to meet a range of sizes and types of business needs to 2030 and
contribute to the overall employment land requirement.
Key sites with considerable potential to achieve future economic growth are identified as follows:
A. New Bridge Road: land to the east of the Shropshire Union Canal and west of New Bridge

The Council will look to facilitate the development of land for employment uses in this area, and
will make provision for transport and other infrastructure improvements required to unlock the
development potential of some sites.
Land at Hooton Park is identified as an important sub-regional employment location and is
safeguarded for continued office, industrial and warehousing use. Any opportunities for new

the development complements existing uses on site and the adjoining Conservation Area.
Explanation
5.31Ellesmere Port has the potential to deliver a significant amount of economic growth during the
Plan period. This policy is intended to guide the level and location of new development in Ellesmere
Port to 2030, primarily in relation to new housing and employment development. A high level of new
housing has been planned for the town to tie in with the potential to deliver employment opportunities,
particularly in the advanced manufacturing, environmental technologies and distribution sectors. The
focus will be on delivering new quality homes to enhance the range and choice of properties available
in the town, including family homes and homes for older people, to meet the needs of the existing
community and attract new residents to Ellesmere Port. Although Ellesmere Port does have a large
supply of brownfield sites, it is considered that greenfield land should also be released to provide for a
range of housing sites to ensure both market and affordable housing is delivered. The policy supports
the ambitions of the 'Ellesmere Port Vision and Strategic Regeneration Framework (SRF)'.
5.32Ledsham Road is a large greenfield site located on the western edge of Ellesmere Port and is
identified primarily for residential development. There is the potential to provide for a medium density
development of up to 2,000 homes including the conversion and reuse of the existing farm house and
barn, local shop, a new primary school, a community building, a linear park, playing fields and other
public open space and allotments. The area is predominantly in agricultural use (grade 3a agricultural

5.43Development in Ellesmere Port is not likely to be significantly affected by flood risk. However,
any development alongside the Manchester Ship Canal could be at risk if the structure were to fail.
There are also localised areas of flood risk around Stanlow and Ince. In line with the recommendations
from the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), additional flood risk assessments may be required

Winsford
Winsford will provide a key focus for development in the east of the borough and development
proposals will help to support the continued regeneration in the town.
Provision will be made for at least 3,500 new dwellings and 35ha of additional land for business
and industrial development.
Key proposals are:
The Station Quarter Urban Extension as identified on the Policies Map to include mixed-use
development of in the region of 1000 new dwellings (775 in the plan period), new open space
linked to the Flashes, a local neighbourhood centre, primary school, leisure, social and
community facilities. This should be achieved through a comprehensively planned approach
in line with an agreed development brief.
Re-modelling of the town centre to provide enhanced local shopping and leisure facilities to
meet identified future needs, including the provision of a new foodstore.
Safeguard Winsford Industrial Estate and Woodford Park to provide business and industrial
development to support local employment opportunities.
Significant improvements to playing pitches, green space and leisure facilities with enhanced
access to the Flashes and River Weaver.
The potential for expansion of Winsford Industrial Estate and Woodford Park Industrial Estate will
be considered and assessed through the Local Plan (Part Two) Land Allocations and Detailed
Policies Plan or neighbourhood plan.

ongoing close and effective cross-boundary working between the two councils, including through the
Weaver Valley Regeneration Board, established to drive forward the regeneration and sustainable

The amount of development in each local service centre will reflect the scale and character of the
settlement concerned and the availability of services, facilities and public transport.
At least 10ha of land for business and industrial development in the rural area will enable small
scale expansion of existing employment sites, and new sites within or on the edge of key service
centres outside of Green Belt locations.
The retention of rural shops and community facilities, and the provision of new facilities at an
appropriate scale to the settlement, will be supported.
Development should not exceed the capacity of existing services and infrastructure unless the
required improvements can be made.
Explanation
5.65Theboroughhasanextensiveruralareawithnumeroussettlementsrangingfrommarkettowns
to small hamlets. The network of distinct rural settlements and the countryside in between contributes
heavily to the attractiveness of the borough as a whole. Many rural residents find employment in towns
and cities both within Cheshire West and beyond. Issues identified by the Council include the rural
population ageing faster than in the urban areas and rural housing being relatively unaffordable.
5.66The Plan aims to support thriving rural communities whilst protecting the intrinsic character and
beauty of the countryside. Delivery of new development in particular housing, will be directed to the
most sustainable locations in the rural area identified as key service centres. The level of housing

The approach of the Plan to development in the rural area aims to strike a balance between allowing
for the managed growth of rural towns and key settlements whilst taking account of the overall Plan
strategy to concentrate most new development in the borough's four urban areas.
5.67Beyond the key service centres in the remainder of the rural area there are many smaller
settlements,manyofthemwashedoverbyGreenBelt,whichhavealowerlevelofservicesandaccess
topublictransportbutcouldacceptablyaccommodatesomesmall-scaledevelopment. Thesesettlements
act as local service centres and will be identified through the Local Plan (Part Two) Land Allocations
and Detailed Policies Plan. The Plan does not intend to impose levels of development on these local
service centres as it is considered that the local community is best placed to understand the needs of
its communities in terms of supporting local services or meeting a specific housing need through
39 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policiesneighbourhood plans and other mechanism including Community Right to Build Orders and rural
exception housing. It is not the intention of the policy to allow development in unsustainable locations
therefore for a settlement to be identified as a local service centre there will need to be an adequate
level of existing services and some access to public transport.
5.68The Policy makes provision for at least 4,200 dwellings in the rural area, of which 2,300 will be
in the key service centres. Housing completions and commitments as at 1 April 2014 are as follows:
Table 5.1

5.69Completionsandcommitmentsforthewholeoftheruralareaamountto4,175dwellings,therefore
there is only a very limited amount of additional housing to be provided. The Council anticipates a
housing capacity of 682 dwellings from small sites and a further potential capacity identified through
the SHLAA of 404 dwellings which will mean there will be little if any need for additional allocations to
be made in the rural area.
5.70Developmentinruralsettlements,particularlyextensionstothebuiltformofasettlement,should
be of a scale and design that respects the character and rural setting of a settlement. Communities,
through neighbourhood plans and Village Design Statements, will be encouraged to identify those
features that contribute to character.

5.72The'RuralWorkspaceStudy'(BEGroup2009)identifiedalackofavailableindustrialunitsacross
the rural area and small scale workshops. The 'Employment Land Study Update' identifies a limited
amount of land remaining for employment development in the rural area for local office/industrial use,
primarily at Chowley Oak, Tattenhall and Hampton Heath, Malpas. It proposes there is a need for an
additional 10ha of employment land to 2030. The policy therefore allows for the small scale expansion
of existing employment sites within or on the edge of key service centres that is of a complimentary
scale and type consistent with the character of the rural location. These sites will be identified through
theLocalPlan(PartTwo)LandAllocationsandDetailedPoliciesPlanorthroughneighbourhoodplans.

STRAT 9
Green Belt and countryside
The intrinsic character and beauty of the Cheshire countryside will be protected by restricting
development to that which requires a countryside location and cannot be accommodated within
identified settlements.
Within the countryside the following types of development will be permitted;
Development that has an operational need for a countryside location such as for agricultural
or forestry operations.
Replacement buildings.
Smallscaleandlowimpactrural/farmdiversificationschemesappropriatetothesite,location

The reuse of existing rural buildings, particularly for economic purposes, where buildings are
of permanent construction and can be reused without major reconstruction.
The expansion of existing buildings to facilitate the growth of established businesses
proportionate to the nature and scale of the site and its setting.
Development must be of an appropriate scale and design to not harm the character of the
countryside.
The general extent of the North Cheshire Green Belt will be maintained. Policy 'STRAT 3 Chester'
sets out the proposed release of Green Belt to meet the development needs of Chester. In
settlements and areas of the countryside that are within the Green Belt, additional restrictions will
apply to development in line with the National Planning Policy Framework.

is recognised as a key asset and is highly valued by the boroughâ€™s residents The quality of the
environment enables Cheshire West and Chester to attract a highly skilled workforce, businesses and
visitors. The policy restricts new development to that which requires a rural location. The Council will
identify settlement boundaries for the four urban areas, key service centres and local service centres
through the Local Plan (Part Two) Land Allocations and Detailed Policies Plan. Where there is a need
to accommodate development on the edge of a settlement then the boundary will be drawn to reflect
this. Land beyond these settlement boundaries will be classed as countryside and subject to the

5.76National planning policy allows for amendments to Green Belt boundaries through Local Plans
in exceptional circumstances. A key focus of the Planâ€™s strategy is to channel the majority of new
development towards the main urban areas. In order to meet future development needs to 2030 and
to promote sustainable patterns of development, it has been identified that only in the case of Chester
are there exceptional circumstances to amend the Green Belt boundary.
5.77In line with national planning policy, inappropriate development is by definition, harmful to the
Green Belt and should not be allowed except in very special circumstances. The construction of new
buildings within the Green Belt is considered inappropriate, however exceptions to this are identified in

5.79The Cheshire West and Chester Local Transport Plan sets out the integrated transport strategy
for the borough. It includes the Council's objectives, policies and priorities for transport, and the Local
Plan is a key tool in helping to achieve these. The Local Transport Plan identifies a number of priority
goals and objectives for transport, many of which form key objectives for the Local Plan.

transport choices will vary between our rural and urban areas. The policies in the Plan directs
developmenttoaccessibleplacesthatcanbenefitfromexistingtransportnetworks,servicesandfacilities,
helping to reduce the need for travel. Reducing travel distances and encouraging walking and cycling
will also promote healthy communities and help to reduce transport congestion and emissions.
5.81The Council has guidance on thresholds for travel plans, transport assessments and transport
statements.Transportassessmentswillberequiredinalldevelopmentsthatgeneratesignificantamounts
of movement. In the case of smaller scale developments for which a transport assessment is not
required, it may be necessary to produce a transport statement alongside a planning application.
Information on when assessments will be required and what they should contain can be found in the
Department for Transport document 'Guidance on Transport Assessment' (2007).
5.82Where new development generates the need for enhancements to the local transport network,
planning obligations will be sought to fund the necessary works. Larger scale infrastructure which is
identified as being required through the Council's Infrastructure Delivery Plan may be funded through
the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).
5.83Developments should ensure that footpaths and cycle ways are included as an integral part of
the design. Safe and convenient routes should be provided which link between main buildings and the
surrounding local area and facilities. Measures to ensure safety of pedestrians include crossings,
lighting and good overlooking of footways.
5.84Requirements for parking in relation to new development are set out in the Council's parking
standards. These standards are currently applied across the whole of the borough, with the exception
oftheurbanareaofChester,wheretheSupplementaryPlanningGuidancedocument'ParkingProvision

built close to our existing cycle networks is linked to the network, and that new buildings have suitable
cycle facilities. In line with actions set out in the Councilâ€™s Cycling Strategy, planning obligations and
conditions will be used to extend and improve access to local cycle and pedestrian networks and to
make sure that new developments possess a high standard of facilities for cyclists.

prioritise major schemes for the sub region, to provide a basis for prioritising and allocating devolved
Department for Transport major transport scheme funding.
5.91Improving connectivity between West Cheshire and surrounding areas is a goal of the LTP.
Cheshire West and Chester has strong links with neighbouring areas, in particular Liverpool, Wirral,
Manchester, North East Wales and Cheshire East. Links to Manchester and Liverpool Airports, Port

Explanation
5.95Cheshire West and Chester Council supports investment in new infrastructure, be that at a
strategic level which serves the whole of the borough and beyond or at a local level serving our
communities. It adopts a positive approach towards the provision of new infrastructure facilities and
services which may be required to deal with planned future growth as well as the development of
alternative delivery methods, changing expectations and technologies; and recognises that in some
instances this will require collaborative cross boundary working to deliver improvements.

5.97To assist with the delivery of infrastructure improvements the Council aims to ensure that new
development provides for the infrastructure, facilities, amenities and other planning benefits which are
necessary to support and serve it, and to mitigate any direct loss or impact to the local area which may
result from the development.
5.98Such contributions will be secured through a variety of means, including by planning conditions
andsection106legalagreements,inparticularthoserequiringlocalmitigationbasedonadirectimpact.
Such provision will normally be expected to be provided by the developer through on-site works or the
design of the development, but on occasion it may be necessary for developers to contribute to off-site
works either directly or in the form of a financial contribution. Appropriate planning conditions may be
used to secure the delivery of any infrastructure requirements in a timely manner.

6.1The National Planning Policy Framework requires the planning system to perform an economic
role 'contributing to building a strong, responsive and competitive economy'. A key ambition of the
Council's Sustainable Community Strategy is for our workforce to have relevant skills for our future
economy. The Local Plan must seek to deliver the education and job opportunities needed to achieve
this ambition.
6.2The policies in the Local Plan have been developed during a period of economic uncertainty and
therefore must be flexible and resilient to deliver the economic development required in a recovering
economicclimate. Thepoliciesarebasedontheunderstandingoftheborough'skeyeconomicstrengths
and seek to positively and proactively deliver the sustainable economic growth over the Plan period
through Policies 'ECON 1 Economic growth, employment and enterprise', 'ECON 2 Town centres',

Economic growth, employment and enterprise
The Council will promote sustainable economic growth in the borough and wider sub-region,
supportingexistingbusinesses,encouragingindigenousbusinessgrowthandattractingnewinward
investment. The creation of new job opportunities across a range of sectors will be supported.
The Council will promote competitive town centre environments and bring forward sites to meet a
range of town centre uses including commercial, retail, leisure, culture and office uses.
A flexible supply of land for industrial and business use (falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8)
will be provided to meet a range of types and sizes of site in locations across the borough. This
supply will be met through existing planning commitmentsand new sites allocated for employment
use.
In reviewing the continued suitability of existing employment allocations and in releasing new sites
to meet future economic development needs, the following will be considered:
Proposals having the potential to support the growth and expansion of key business sectors
as identified in sub-regional and local economic growth strategies.
Proposals supporting the delivery of major regeneration programmes in Cheshire West and
Chester.
Proposals should be in accessible locations by a range of transport modes and compatible
with neighbouring land uses.
Where sustainable and viable town centre sites for new office uses are not available, suitable
edge of centre sites will be brought forward that are well connected to town centres and by
public transport.
There should be a reasonable prospect of the site being developed for employment (B1, B2
and B8 use) within the Plan period.

54 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies6.4For West Cheshire to remain competitive and to be a location of choice for inward investors, the
Council needs to create the right conditions to encourage growth. Supportive and flexible planning
policies can drive sustainable economic growth by identifying sites for new business and industrial
development in the borough. The approach within the Local Plan is to provide a range of sizes and
types of site borough wide, to meet anticipated economic needs to 2030. Existing undeveloped
employment land allocations will be reviewed to ensure they remain fit for purpose, are capable of
meeting the borough's economic growth aspirations and can be developed within the Plan period. It is
essential that there is a sufficient quantity of sites to meet future employment needs. The quality of
employment land and sites; their sustainability, accessibility to major transport networks, infrastructure
provision and the environmental setting, will be key factors in attracting new investment in the future.

Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership and the Mersey Dee Alliance. Major sites critical to meeting
these sub-regional ambitions are identified. It also aims to support the local economic objectives

Town Centres - Retail, leisure and other town centre uses
Centre hierarchy
To ensure the long-term vitality and viability of the borough's town centres, the Council will apply
a town centre first approach to proposals for retail, leisure and other main town centre uses.
Development should be of an appropriate scale that reflects the size and role of each centre and
should not have an unacceptable impact on centres in the catchment area of the proposal.
The town centre hierarchy and key proposals for the boroughâ€™s town centres is as follows:
Sub-regional centre:
Chester
Retaildevelopmentmustbefocusedinthecitycentretosupportitssub-regionalroleasashopping,

New bus interchange facilities in the city centre
The Northgate scheme should provide for high quality public realm and integration with the rest of
the city centre.

needs of the local community.
Development outside town centres
A sequential test will be applied to planning applications for main town centre uses that are not in
an existing centre. Town centre uses should be located in town centres and then in edge of centre
locations and only if suitable sites are not available will out of centre sites be considered. In terms
of edge and out of centre proposals, preference will be given to accessible sites that are well
connected to the town centre.
When considering planning applications for main town centre uses outside of existing centres,
which are not in accordance with the development plan, the Council will require an impact
assessment in accordance with the following local thresholds depending upon which centre the
development applies to:
Chestersub-regionalcentre:Developmentproposalsprovidinggreaterthan1,000m2grossfloorspace
for town centre uses in an edge or out of centre location.

greater than 500m2gross floorspace for town centre uses in an edge or out of centre location.
Local centres: Development proposals providing greater than 200m2gross floorspace for town
centre uses in an edge or out of centre location.
This should include an assessment of the:
Impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private investment in
Chester city centre, and other relevant town, district and local centres in the catchment area
of the proposed development; and
Individual and cumulative impact of the proposal on Chester city centre's vitality and viability

6.7The National Planning Policy Framework promotes town centres as the preferred location for

the city centre of Chester with its regionally significant retail, heritage and cultural assets, to small rural
centresservingthedaytodayneedsoflocalcommunities.Ourcentresarevitalinsupportingsustainable

challenges for the high street. Supporting town centre led development and enabling centres to have
flexibility to modernise and innovate will better enable them to compete and remain a focal point for a
diverse mix of uses.
6.8Maintowncentreusesaredefinedasretaildevelopment(includingwarehouseclubsandfactory

cinemas,restaurants,drive-throughrestaurants,barsandpubs,nightclubs,casinos,healthandfitness
centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls), offices, and arts, culture and tourism development
(including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities). For the
purposes of this policy community facilities are defined as local shops, meeting places, sports venues,
cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship.
6.9The retail hierarchy sets out the network of town centres in the borough based on their role and

6.10The 'Retail Study Update 2013' also deals with the future need and requirements for retail
floorspace within the borough and where this should be located. This is based on the most up to date
population and expenditure forecasts. It is very difficult to forecast retail requirements as far ahead as

new non-food (comparison) retail floorspace as part of the Northgate scheme within the city centre
which has an extant planning permission.
6.12A major concern for the Council is the steady loss of non-food (comparison) retailing from the
city centre, which if allowed to continue unchecked will damage the long term health of the city centre.
The'RetailStudyUpdate2013'confirmsthatChestercitycentrehasbeendeclininginthenationalretail
rankings over an extended period of time, experiencing a fall of 13 places in its overall Venuescore
ranking since 2006. This decline is the result of the difficulties of delivering a major city centre
redevelopment in a historic setting combined with the increased competition from other competing
centres, including Cheshire Oaks (which has seen its Venuescore ranking improve 71 places since
2006) and the expansion and changing nature of the retail offer in the cityâ€™s satellite retail parks.
6.13Itisthereforecrucial,andakeyaimoftheCouncil,toensurethatadditionalnon-food(comparison)
floorspace in Chester is delivered within the city centre through the Northgate scheme, providing
substantialnewfloorspacewhichisconducivetomodernretailoperatorsinordertostemfurtherdecline
of the city centre over the Plan period. This improved retail offer is likely to lead to Chester city centre
increasing its market share of comparison goods expenditure with a greater amount of expenditure
surplus available to support additional floorspace in the city centre. This position is supported by the
key findings from the 'Retail Study Update 2013'. In light of existing planning commitments there is
currently no requirement for additional food (convenience) retail floorspace in Chester.
6.14The priority for Northwich is the delivery of the Barons Quay scheme, which has an extant

to meet an identified capacity shortfall. This scheme is crucial in delivering a step change for the town

additional food store sites are required in Northwich at this time.
6.15Ellesmere Port town centre will continue to offer a range of shopping and services for the local
population. It faces significant competition from nearby Cheshire Oaks and the Coliseum Retail Park,
which serve as both a local retail destination and major employer in the area. There is no identified
capacity for further non-food (comparison) retail floorspace in the town and only marginal capacity for
food (convenience) retail floorspace. However, improvements to Ellesmere Port will be encouraged
when opportunities arise in the town centre.
6.16An improved town centre for Winsford is vital for the townâ€™s long term aspirations and to meet
the needs of a growing population. The 'Retail Study Update 2013' confirms that there is an immediate
needforanewfoodstoreinWinsford.Thisshouldbelocatedwithinthetowncentreandactasacatalyst

6.17Frodshamisawellperformingtowncentre,whichisbothvitalandviableandisunderpinnedby
a strong independent sector. However, it faces competition from out of centre facilities, particularly in
respect of food (convenience) retail. Therefore, promotion of the facilities in centre, including the
independent sector, will help Frodsham to maintain its role as a strongly performing town centre.
6.18Nestonprovidesvaluablelocalshoppingandserviceprovision.Therecentintroductionofanew

where they are of an appropriate scale relative to Nestonâ€™s role and function.
6.19Tosuccessfullypromoteandimplementredevelopmentwithinourtowncentres,includingaround
Northgate in Chester and Barons Quay in Northwich, the Council must control the level of out of centre
floorspace that is delivered. It is therefore appropriate to set local thresholds for the scale of edge of
centre and out of centre development which should be subject to an impact assessment.
6.20To ensure developments are not considered in isolation, the individual and cumulative impact
of edge of centre and out of centre proposals for town centre uses should be considered.
6.21The proposed thresholds for each of the main centres reflect the relative size of each centre,
acknowledging the small size of some of the centres at the lower end of the retail hierarchy and their
potential susceptibility to alternative out of centre provision.

6.24Cheshire as a whole attracts approximately 25 million visitors a year and benefits from good
transport connections and proximity to Liverpool and Manchester airports. Evidence indicates that the
visitor economy in Cheshire West and Chester is worth Â£1.2 billion and supports 14,000 jobs, which
accounts for 9.7 percent of all jobs in the borough. This is made up of the following activities: hotels,
camping sites, restaurants, bars, activities of travel agencies, libraries, archives, museums, sporting
activities and other recreational activities. Chester city centre is the commercial and tourism centre of

heritage assets including the cathedral, roman amphitheatre and historic shopping Rows.
6.25The boroughâ€™s historic towns and rural settlements attract a wide range of visitors. Cheshire
Oaks is a significant visitor destination for retail and leisure. Policy ECON 2 'Town Centres - Retail,
leisure and other town centre uses' sets out the Councilâ€™s planning policies for maintaining the vitality
and viability of existing centres and the approach towards the provision of new leisure and cultural
facilities. The borough already has some significant tourism attractions including Chester Zoo, the
National Waterways Museum, Oulton Park and the Salt Museum. In the rural area, there are a wide
range of natural assets including Delamere Forest, the Sandstone Trail, wildlife sites such as Burton
Mere Wetlands, coastal areas and Cheshire â€˜gardens of distinctionâ€™. There are a wide network of
footpaths, cycleways, bridlepaths, canals and public rights of way that provide excellent leisure and
recreational opportunities.
6.26Major sporting events in the borough (including Chester Racecourse and Oulton Park) attract a
wide range of visitors, participants and spectators. Policies SOC 5 'Health and well-being', and SOC 6
'Open space, sport and recreation' also relate to the provision of new leisure facilities for sport and
recreation.
6.27Chester Zoo is a major tourism asset located in the Green Belt. Development that provides
enhanced visitor opportunities whilst respecting the open character of the Zoo will be supported.
Development ancillary to the main function of the Zoo, such as visitor accommodation, should not be

67 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies7.4The policy takes into account the most up to date evidence of need from the Strategic Housing
Market Assessment (SHMA). It aims to give certainty to landowners, developers, local communities,
andprovideguidanceforthepreparationofneighbourhoodplans. Thepolicywillhelpcreatebalanced
and mixed communities and help deliver much needed affordable housing. The policy needs to reflect
changing market conditions over time. It is recognised that the quantity of new affordable housing

7.5In seeking to negotiate the maximum level of affordable housing on each site, the Council will
haveregardtotheeconomicviabilityofsitedevelopment,likelycosts,marketconditions,theavailability
of public subsidy and the aim of achieving a mixed, balanced and sustainable community. Developers
will be expected to demonstrate the validity of such viability factors, providing supporting evidence.
7.6The latest Cheshire West and Chester SHMA was undertaken in 2013. The SHMA highlights
that between 1996 and 2013, house prices in the borough increased by 190.3 percent. The SHMA
shows an annual net shortfall of 714 affordable homes each year across Cheshire West and Chester
for the five year period 2013/2014 to 2017/2018. This demonstrates the degree of imbalance between
supply and demand for affordable housing, rather than being specific targets for affordable housing,
and highlights that there is clear justification for an affordable housing policy across the borough.
7.7The Economic Viability Assessment which accompanies the SHMA recommends a target of up
to 30 percent provision of affordable housing on all sites, applied across the borough. The Economic
Viability Assessment suggests the targets be applied across the borough, including in urban and rural
areas. Thedwellingtype,tenureandsizemustbereflectiveofthemostuptodateSHMAandhousing

Explanation
7.10The 'Strategic Housing Market Assessment' (SHMA) highlights the need for affordable housing
throughout the borough. As planning policies are generally more restrictive in the rural areas, this can
mean that fewer affordable homes are built in these locations, particularly within the Green Belt.

the effect that this can have on local communities and the rural economy. The strategy considers that
innovative approaches to providing affordable housing will be necessary.

availability of Government funding for affordable homes through the Homes and Communities Agency
(HCA) has been significantly reduced. This has resulted in viability issues for registered providers, and
has meant that in some limited circumstances it may be appropriate to allow a small element of market

Explanation
7.17Providing an appropriate supply of housing directly supports the Council Plan key priority for
â€˜housing which meets the needs of our residents.â€™ The 'Cheshire Sub-Regional Housing Strategy' has
four priorities â€“ including increasing the supply of affordable housing; meeting housing and
accommodation related support needs of the sub regionâ€™s most vulnerable residents; and increasing
the supply of market housing to support continued economic growth and regeneration to meet local
housing needs.
7.18The'StrategicHousingMarketAssessment'(SHMA)2013highlightstheneedforfamilyhousing.
TheSHMAstatesthathousesremainthemostpopularchoiceofmosthouseholds,particularlydetached
and semi-detached properties, with three bedroom properties most popular overall. It is considered
appropriate to encourage the provision of smaller family homes of two to three bedrooms in order to
enable new households to get on the housing ladder, and for older households to downsize.
7.19It is recognised that the borough has an ageing population which will lead to specific
accommodationneeds.Providingawiderrangeofolderpersons'accommodationalsohasthepotential
to free up family accommodation.The SHMAhighlights thatthe number and proportion of older people
is increasing. In particular, the number of residents aged 75 or over is expected to increase by 79.6
percent, from 28,000 in 2010 to 50,300 by 2030. The SHMA recommends that the range of housing
optionsavailabletoolderpeopleshouldbediversified,forexamplewiththedevelopmentofopenmarket
71 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policieshousing marketed to older people, and the development of extra care accommodation and co-housing
(your own home in a small community which shares facilities such as laundry).
7.20The policy also provides for the development of further student accommodation within Chester.
In areas close to the University of Chester, such as the Garden Quarter, there are a high concentration
ofHousesinMultipleOccupation(HMOs). Thiscanleadtospecificproblemssuchasnegativeimpacts
on the physical and environmental street scene, problems with disposal of waste, the deterioration of
properties, and rises in anti social behaviour, crime, noise and nuisance. Where there are particularly
high instances of HMOs, mixed communities are not being sustained. It is therefore considered vital
to effectively manage HMOs and, where necessary, implement Article 4 Directions.
7.21The'StudentAccommodationinChesterStudy'(NevinLeatherAssociate,January2012)reveals
how 77 percent of the 805 properties with student exemptions in Chester are located within half a mile
of the main University of Chester campus. The report also sets out that by 2010, out of the 1,422
properties in the Garden Quarter area, 482 (34 percent) were occupied exclusively by students, with
additional rented properties occupied by non-student households or mixed student/non-student
households.Inordertohelpredressthisimbalanceandprovideforexistingandfutureneed,theprovision
of specialised student accommodation in appropriate and sustainable locations will be supported.
7.22The SHMA 2013 household survey identified a strong interest in self-build from households

of the community to get a foothold on the housing ladder, and can add to the diversity and character of

public land at little or no cost, purchase of a rural exception sites or through accessing funding.

Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpersons accommodation
The Council will work with its partners to ensure appropriate provision for Gypsies, Travellers and
Travelling Showpersons accommodation needs.
Development proposals will be permitted for private and public Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling
Showpersons accommodation provided that they meet the following criteria. Proposals should:
not be affected by pollution, contamination, flooding or other environmental factors that would
result in unacceptable living conditions
not have unacceptable environmental effects
be well located in relation to the highway network with adequate vehicular and pedestrian
access, and have provision for parking and circulation
be accessible to local services and facilities by walking and/or public transport
be supplied with essential services such as water, sewerage, electricity, drainage and waste
disposal
be well related to existing settlements, and have regard to residential amenity
not be disproportionate to the scale of the existing settlement whether singly or cumulatively
with other sites in the area
be located outside the Green Belt except in very special circumstances
with regard to sites for Travelling Showpersons, the development should include appropriate
provision for the safe storage and maintenance of equipment
The above criteria will be used to guide the site allocation process.
There will be a presumption against the loss of existing permanent consented Gypsy, Traveller or
Travelling Showpersons sites leading to, or exacerbating an identified shortfall unless suitable
replacement provision of equal or enhanced value are provided.

that a criteria based policy to address the needs of these communities should be included within the
Local Plan. Providing accommodation will address any shortfall and will also help to limit the number
of unauthorised encampments and developments throughout the borough. Providing sites directly
supports the Council Plan key priority for â€˜housing which meets the needs of our residents.â€™
73 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies7.25The level of need for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpersons accommodation within
Cheshire West and Chester has been identified up to 2028 through the Cheshire Gypsy, Traveller and
Travelling Showpeople Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) March 2014. It identifies a need for 15
further permanent Gypsy and Traveller pitches 2013-2018, 15 in years 2018-2023, and 16 from

Chester provides a transit site of between 5-10 pitches.
7.26The Council is committed to ensuring that suitable sites are provided for at least the level of
need identified in the GTAA. The GTAA provides the basis for the allocation of sites in the Local Plan
(Part Two) Land Allocations and Detailed Policies Plan. The criteria set out in the policy will be used
to inform the allocation of sites and to determine planning applications, ensuring that proposed sites
are suitable and capable of providing an appropriate living environment, whilst protecting the amenity

Assessments (SFRAs), which provide information at the local (but not site specific) level regarding
floodingissueswhichaffectthearea.The'WestCheshireSFRA'wasproducedin2008whichidentified
areas of flood risk from all sources across the borough.
8.11The 'West Cheshire SFRA' concludes that the main source of flooding in the borough is rivers
and streams. Affected properties are generally on low lying land in the rivers' natural floodplain. Parts
of Chester and Farndon are at risk of flooding from the River Dee, including the Sealand Basin area of
Chester.
8.12In the Ellesmere Port area, small isolated areas are subject to flood risk from drainage
infrastructure and minor watercourses such as Rivacre Brook. The Stanlow industrial area is at risk of
tidal flooding, although risk of direct flooding from the River Mersey is significantly reduced due to the
presence of the Manchester Ship Canal. The Ince Marshes area is also considered to be at high risk
of flooding. Some properties within Frodsham are considered to be under threat of flooding from the
River Weaver, however it is mainly agricultural land at risk of flooding in this area.

Northwich are at risk of flooding and work has been undertaken to understand the nature of this risk
including the 'Northwich Area Flood Risk Assessment' (AFRA).

The Local Plan will protect and, wherever possible, enhance landscape character and local
distinctiveness. This will be achieved by:
The identification of key gaps in the Local Plan (Part Two) Land Allocations and Detailed
Policies Plan between settlements outside the Green Belt that serve to protect and maintain
their character
Supporting the designation of Local Green Space
Protecting the character of the borough's estuaries and undeveloped coast.
Development should:
Take full account of the characteristics of the development site, its relationship with its
surroundings and where appropriate views into, over and out of the site.
Recognise, retain and incorporate features of landscape quality into the design.
Explanation
8.16The National Planning Policy Framework states that 'the planning system should contribute to
andenhancethenaturalandlocalenvironmentbyprotectingandenhancingvaluedlandscapes'. High
quality design can make a positive contribution to the protection and enhancement of landscape value
and as such is encouraged by the Local Plan.
8.17Where appropriate, the designation of Local Green Space will provide communities with the
opportunity to safeguard green areas which are of particular significance to the local community.
8.18The 'Cheshire Landscape Character Assessment 2009' classified and described the landscape
types across the borough. These character areas, coupled with conservation area appraisals, Village
Design Statements, and neighbourhood plans, seek to define the character and local distinctiveness
which will be protected and, wherever possible, enhanced across the borough.
8.19The quality of local distinctiveness in the borough is an essential landscape asset. In order to
protect local distinctiveness the Council will identify key gaps between settlements outside the Green
Belt which will maintain and preserve their individual character.

Explanation
8.59Generating energy from renewable and low-carbon sources is an important part of the

supporting the delivery of renewable and low carbon energy generation.
97 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies8.61The '2012 Cheshire West and Chester Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Study' provides a
technical assessment of the potential for renewable and low carbon energy generation in the borough.
It suggests that renewable and low carbon energy resources could collectively provide 4.2 percent of
the boroughâ€™s energy requirements saving 280,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
8.62The'RenewableandLowCarbonEnergyStudy'highlightsthemajorityoftheboroughâ€™srenewable

8.65It is currently anticipated that building regulations and standards will increasingly lead the
requirement for small scale renewable and low carbon sources in new developments over the coming
years to achieve the Governmentâ€™s zero carbon development programme. This is therefore supported
in line with this policy. In the event that changes to national requirements are not brought into effect as
planned the Council may look to introduce local mechanisms to encourage small scale renewable and
low carbon energy generation in future developments.
8.66The Governmenthas outlined its ambitions for residential and non-domestic development to be
delivered to a zero carbon standard by 2016 and 2019 respectively. It is anticipated that zero carbon
development will be realised predominantly through energy efficiency measures and the use of on-site

monitoringtoensurethereissufficientlandavailabletosupportnewwastedevelopmentintheborough.
Should this monitoring indicate that any of the consented recycling, treatment or disposal capacity is
unlikely to become available or significantly restricted this would trigger the need for a review of waste
policy in the Local Plan to ensure the identification of sufficient land for waste development in the
borough. The monitoring section sets this out in more detail.

8.78ThereisoneoperationallandfillsiteintheboroughinChester(TheGowy). Theconsentedvoid
space is safeguarded and extensions of time will be viewed favourably where this will ensure the site

facilitywasgrantedin2007,atKindertonLodgenearMiddlewich,whichwhilstimplemented,iscurrently
non operational and dependent on prior mineral extraction to create the void for future landfill. The
amount of available landfill void in Cheshire West and Chester is declining. The potential for identifying
new landfill sites is limited by environmental constraints. However, given that less waste is being
landfilled,existingavailableandconsentedcapacityisexpectedtolastbeyond2024whentheestimated
short fall in capacity is predicated. Therefore the Local Plan does not identify any additional sites for

waste policy in the Local Plan.
8.79Despite Cheshire West and Chester having nationally significant facilities for the treatment and
disposal of hazardous waste, including the long term storage (Winsford Rock Salt Mine) and a high
temperature incinerator (Ellesmere Port), the majority of the borough's hazardous waste is exported to
other hazardous waste facilities for treatment or disposal. However, the borough is a net importer of
hazardous waste given the two nationally significant facilities in the borough. This reflects that the
treatment of hazardous waste operates in a national market and each hazardous waste facility has a
nationalcatchmentareaandwillspecialiseinaparticulartypeoftreatmentordisposal. Thetwofacilities
within Cheshire West and Chester are safeguarded and no additional facilities are proposed for the
disposal of hazardous wastes.

104 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies8.81Waste policy has a supporting role to identify sufficient land to allow the water utility companies
todischargetheirresponsibilitiesshouldanyadditionalinfrastructureberequired.Intheplanningprocess
the water companies take into account development proposals and potential applications to design
growthneedsintotheirfutureassetmanagementplans.Whilstthecompanieshaveindicatedthatthere
may be a need for quality improvements to the works, there has been no indication that additional land
is required for the management of sewage sludge. This policy is therefore based upon no additional
sites being required to deal with sewage sludge during the plan period.
8.82There may be a need to identify a number of additional sites in the Local Plan (Part Two) Land
Allocation and Detailed Policies Plan for specific uses. This is likely to include sites to replace the
Household Waste Recycling Centres in Frodsham, Chester and Tattenhall. This would not be new
capacitybutreplacementforexistingsites.Environmentallyacceptablefacilitiesatnewlocationswhich
would improve accessibility to these facilities will be supported. Sites will be selected in accordance
with the site identification criteria set out in Annex E of Planning Policy Statement 10.
8.83This policy also encourages the development of on farm anaerobic digestion plants for the
management of agricultural waste on farm units. This supports current practise for the management of
agricultural waste in the borough, where a large amount of agricultural waste is produced but very little
leaves the farm for management.

Minerals supply and safeguarding
Cheshire West and Chester will make provision for the adequate, steady and sustainable supply
of sand, gravel, salt and brine, contributing to the sub-national guidelines for aggregate land-won

ofthenecessaryinfrastructureourcommunitiesneed. TheNationalPlanningPolicyFramework(NPPF)
requires all Mineral Planning Authorities to plan for and maintain a minimum seven year landbank for
aggregate land-won sand and gravel. Current sub-national guidelines, apportioned by the North West
Aggregate Working Party as shown in North West AWP aggregate apportionment requirements
2005-2020 (million tonnes), require Cheshire West and Chester to contribute 0.80mt of aggregate
land-won sand and gravel per annum to meet demand between 2005-2020. This apportionment has
beenrolledforwardtotheendofthePlanperiodtocalculateaminimumrequirementof16milliontonnes
for the period 2010-2030. This requirement will be reviewed annually in light of the results of the Local
Aggregate Assessment and any revised sub-national apportionment figures being established, having
regard to the environmental acceptability of any changes.

109 Cheshire West and Chester Council Local Plan (Part One) Strategic Policies8.87The Interim Local Aggregate Assessment 2013 provided a ten year average sales figure of
0.72mt per annum. Ten year average sales take account of periods of high sales and steep declines
as experienced in the UK during the past ten year period. The average sales figure has been used,
alongside the apportionment requirement, to provide up to date landbank data for the borough.

seven years should not be seen as a reason to restrict further release of aggregate reserves.
8.89Local Aggregate Assessments will provide an up-to-date appraisal of demand for and supply of
aggregate in Cheshire West and Chester. It is anticipated that these assessments will indicate any fall
in available resources or indeed any surplus.
