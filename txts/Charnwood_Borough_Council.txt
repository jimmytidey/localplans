 Foreword  
 
Welcome to the Charnwood Local Plan. This is Charnwood Borough Counci l’s vision of where 
and how new development should come forward in Charnwood over the next 16 years to 2037.  
We are very fortunate to live and work in a place as beautiful as Charnwood. Our borough 
contains great towns and attractive villages, nestled in a nd around the Charnwood Forest a nd in 
the Wolds, as well as the river valleys of the Soar and the Wreake. These places are cherished 
for th eir wildlife, heritage and beauty and we have a role in ensuring future generations can 
benefit from them.  
Charnwood’ s location at the heart of the t hree cities of Leicester, Derby and Nottingham, 
together with its attractive scenery combines to create gre at pressure for new homes and new 
places for people to work. Planning to meet this need, as we are required to do by national 
planning policy, is ver y challenging given the sensitivity of our environment and the shared 
desire to protect it. We have therefo re carefully balanced the need for growth against our 
responsibilities to protect the natural and built environment, and where new development is 
required, we will seek to minimise its impact.  
We have already set in place much of the development required for the future with new 
communities being delivered through urban extensions to Leicester and Loughborough. Our 
new l ocal plan provides for the remai ning housing and employment needs of the Borough to 
2037.  
Preparing this local plan has required difficult  decisions to be made about the areas which will 
be developed and those that will not. These decisions have been info rmed by the views of 
residents, businesses, interest groups as well as infrastructure providers and others that will be 
involved in deliver ing and implementing the plan.  
Representations are invited on this Pre -Submission Draft of the Charnwood Local Plan b etween 
12th July and 5pm 23rd Au gust 2021.  This is your opportunity to make your views known on 
the Local Plan.  Any representations rece ived will be considered by an independent planning 
inspector, as part of the formal examination of the Local Plan.  
 
Councillor Richard Bailey  
Cabinet L ead Member for Planning  
Charnwood Borough Council 
 
  
Chapter 1 Introduction  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  6 
 Chapter 1 Introduction  
 
1.1. The Charnwood Local Plan Cor e Strategy was adopted in November 2015 and provides 
a development strategy to 2028 setting out where and how new d evelopment should take 
place in the Borough. Whilst the Council is working with its partners to deliver that plan , 
work has taken place on th e preparation of a plan for a longer period to 2037 to align with 
the new Strategic Growth Plan for Leicester and L eicestershire and new evidence of the 
need for homes and jobs.  This approach is in accordance with the national policy 
requirement to keep p lans up to date and reviewed at least every five years.   
 
1.2. This new local plan sets out a vision and a framework fo r the future pattern, scale and 
quality of development in Charnwood.  It addresses needs and opportunities in rela tion to 
housing, the economy , community facilities and infrastructure as well as conserving and 
enhancing the natural and historic environment,  mitigating and adapting to climate 
change, and achieving well designed places that contribute to healthy communi ties. The 
majority of polici es in this plan are considered to be strategic policies which address the 
priorities for development and use of lan d in Charnwood. A small number of non -strategic 
policies are also included to guide decision making and to guide the promotion of 
sustainable  development.    
 
1.3. The plan consists of three distinct sections: overall development strategy, place -based 
policies  and topic -based policies.  The place -based policies relate to specific locations in 
Charnwood: Leicester Urban Area, Loughborough  Urban Centre , Shepshed, Service 
Centres, Other Settlements and the Countryside. They incorporate several policies for 
these p laces to provide a more coherent approach to planning for our communities.    
 
1.4. The new local plan, once adopted, will form part of the developm ent plan and replace the 
Charnwood Local Plan Core Strategy (2015) and the saved policies from the Borough of 
Charnwood Local Plan (2004).  The development plan is at the heart of the planning 
system with a requirement set in law that planning decisions mu st be made in line with 
the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
Preparation of the Pre -Submission Draft Local Plan  
 
1.5. This Pre -Submission Draft Local Plan reflects the Government’s requirements as set out 
in the National Pla nning Policy Framework (NPPF).  It has been developed to support 
and deliver the Council’s Corporate Plan and is informed by the Council’s vision and local 
priorities.  It reflects the evidence that has been prepared to understand the roles of 
different se ttlements, what land is available for development, constraints to development 
and the options for delivering home s and jobs.  
 
1.6. The plan has been developed through engagement with the public and key stakeholders 
such as infrastructure providers, parish and town councils, residents’ groups, interest 
groups and the development industry.  This has ensured the plan and th e evidence 
underpinning it have been shaped by an understanding of the key local issues.   
 
 Chapter 1 Introduction  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  7 
 1.7. The Council has undertaken three consultations to help prepare this plan and 
engagement with stakeholders has also taken place to inform the preparation of our 
evidence.  The first local plan consultation concerned the scope of the plan and took place 
in July 2016. The second consultation in April 2018 fo cussed on the key issues and 
options, with the Council publishing a discussion paper titled ‘Towards a Local Plan  for 
Charnwood’. Informed by these consultations, the ‘Draft Charnwood Local Plan’, was 
published for consultation in November 2019. This propo sed our preferred development 
strategy for Charnwood and presented draft policies which responded to the 
represen tations to date and our evidence. The representations made during this 
consultation process have been considered and informed the preparation o f this Pre -
Submission Draft Local Plan.  
 
1.8. The Charnwood Local Development Scheme 2021 -2024 sets out the programme for the 
next stages in preparing the new local plan and identifies this consultation on the Pre -
Submission Draft Local Plan  in July  2021 and th en the subsequent Examination in Public 
of the plan in spring 2022.  
 
Status of the Pre -Submission Draft Local Pl an  
 
1.9. We have prepared this Pre -Submission Draft Local Plan to provide a framework for the 
future pattern, scale and quality of development in C harnwood . We must submit the d raft 
plan to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government f or 
independent Examination in Public before it can become part of the development plan for 
Charnwood. Before we submit the draft plan, we are u ndertaking a consultation for a 
period of six weeks and the main issues raised will be considered as part of the 
examination of the plan.  
 
Sustainability Appraisal  
 
1.10.  Sustainable development is a key principle which underpins the planning system.  It 
means ensuring a better quality of life, now and for future generations.  This means 
considering all three aspects of sus tainable development: the community, the economy 
and the environment.  
 
1.11.  A separate sustainability appraisal r eport accompanies each stage of t he preparation of 
the local plan. Prior to this  consultation, there have been sustainability appraisal r eports 
on the scope of the local plan (January 2017) and ‘Towa rds a Local Plan for Charnwood’ 
(April 2018). A  sustainability appraisal  report of the alt ernative options was then 
undertaken to assess the impact of the draft policies on sustainability principles and th is 
was published in October 2019 to accompany the ‘ Draft Charnwood Local Plan’.   
 
1.12.  At the current stage, a full Pre -Submission Sustainability  Appraisal Report has been 
prepared which appraises the Pre -Submission Draft Local Plan and brings together all 
previous stages of the sustainability appraisal. It su mmarises the sustainability appraisal 
work carried out to date and how it has influenced t he plan; the report is published as part 
of this consultation and views on it are invited.

 Vision  
 
1.23.  The profile highlights that Charnwood is already an attractive place  to live, work and visit 
for many but that there are several challenges for the plan period. The key challenges 
include:  
 
• a growing population with a range of housing needs including specialist homes for 
older people, students and those unable to get onto the housing ladder;  
• a number of deprived communities in the Borough with lower than average incomes, 
poor health an d lower  levels of educational attainment;  
• increasing volumes of traffic and pressure on infrastructure including schools, health 
centres, ope n spaces and utilities;   
• the changing retail market with an increase in online shopping and the impact this and 
other str uctural economic and social changes are having on the vitality and 
appearance of Loughborough town centre;    
• pressure on open land as  settlements grow to accommodate the population which 
impacts on the separation and identity of settlements;  
• clima te chan ge impacting on the wider environment with localised issues such as 
increased flood risk or water quality and quantity pressures; and  
• the reduction in biodiversity and the fragmentation of habitats.  
 
1.24.  An understanding of the Borough and our key oppor tunitie s and challenges has informed 
the vision for the Borough to 2037.  The vision also reflects the spatial elements of the 
Charnwood Boro ugh Council corporate vision, setting out the local priorities which have 
influenced the approach to future develop ment in  the Borough alongside national policy 
and the Strategic Growth Plan for Leicester and Leicestershire.   
 
A VISION FOR CHARNWOOD 2037  
In 2037 Charnwood will be one of the most desirable places to live, work and visit in the East 
Midlands.  
Development  will have been managed to improve the economy, quality of life and the 
environment.  
Charnwood will be recognised for the role Loughborough p lays in the region’s knowledge -based 
economy.   
Our strong and diverse economy will provide more employm ent opportu nities for local people 
including higher skilled, better paid jobs in high technology research and manufacturing, sports, 
tourism, creative a nd cultural industry clusters.  
Growing businesses will have been retained, new investment secured and en trepreneuri alism 
encouraged. The Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park and Loughborough University will 
be at the heart of Loughborough’s brand as a centre for excellence. Business and technological 
links with the city of Leicester will have been streng thened thro ugh major employment 
developments in the south of the borough.  
Our landscape and the special buildings, heritage  and biodiversity it contains  will be in a good 
state. Our picturesque villages will have retained their strong sense of identity.  Charnwood wi ll 
be known for its natural and built environment which provides a place that people want to visit 
and explore.  Chapter 1 Introduction  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  14 
 Our communities will have acc ess to a range of green spaces, leisure and recreational facilities 
across Charnwood and new parkland in Loughborou gh and Thurmaston will be provided. 
Charnwood Forest will be recognised as a Regional Park. Our water environmen t, including the 
River Soar a nd River Wreake, will be improved for wildlife and people, including continued 
mitigation of flood risk, and a rege nerated Watermead area will bring environmental benefits to 
its surrounding communities and welcome visitors. We  will work with nature to pro vide a more 
resilient response to climate change and associated flooding and will provide a more sustainable 
enviro nment for all to enjoy . Charnwood will be recognised for delivering growth to a high design 
quality that provide s healthy, inclusive and safe  places for our communities. Charnwood will be a 
place that promotes health by design with developments that have t he connectivity and open 
spaces where active travel is desirable.  
The demand for housing will be focused on Loug hborough to support its role as the social, cultural 
and economic focus for the Borough, on the edge of Leicester to support the centrally locat ed city 
and on Shepshed to support its continued regeneration. This will include sustainable urban 
extensions at  Loughborough and Leicester, as well as other planned areas of growth, which will 
incorporate good quality design and reflect our strong local d istinctiveness.  
Our communities will have access to homes to suit their needs. There will be provision of 
affordable housing including in ru ral communities. Issues previously associated with houses in 
multiple occupation will have been managed and social cohesion will have improved.  
Growth at Loughborough will be managed to respond to its rich history and relation ship with 
Charnwood Forest wh ilst supporting the town centre as the main economic, social and cultural 
heart of the Borough.  The town will have  benefitted from regeneration which capitalises on our 
industrial heritage including the Great Central Railway a nd the Grand Union Canal.  Th e town 
centre will be an attractive, compact and walkable destination for shopping, leisure, entertainment 
and cult ure.   It will be a town for all ages, providing an attractive place to live as well as visit.    
Growth at Shep shed will support the Leicest er and Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan’s 
proposal for the Leicestershire International Gateway, secure regener ation that enhances the 
physical fabric of the town and makes the most of the surrounding forest and natural env ironment. 
Settlements located  within and adjacent to the Charnwood Forest will be known for their intrinsic 
connection with that special landsca pe.  Our other settlements will have an attractive provision of 
local shops, culture and leisure facilities and will have retained their indi vidual identity.  
Our communities will have better access to jobs and services, with a choice to safely and 
convenie ntly walk or cycle. For longer trips, Charnwood will be known for its excellent connections 
by public transport.   Some trips will no longer b e necessary as an expansive broadband network 
will make Charnwood one of the best connected semi -rural boroughs in the country. In turn this 
will improve local air quality by reducing car emissions.  
Our communities will enjoy a cleaner and greener environ ment. Charnwood will be safe and 
resilient to the impacts of climate change and will be playing its part in reducin g greenhouse gas 
emissions, particularly through its woodland and forest character  of a mosaic of (international ly 
important) geology, outcro ps, remnants of heathland and heath grassland.  
Our communities will have a sense of ownership and increased pride i n development within their 
local areas through their engagement with neighbourhood planning. Communities will fe el 
empowered to engage with p lanning.

  Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  18 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
 
A Strategy for Charnwood’s  Future Development  
 
2.1. Our development strategy sets out the scale and pattern of development in the Borough.  
It flows from the vision and obj ectives and our understanding of the Borough and the key 
opportunities and challenges it faces.  
 
2.2. We want to meet th e development needs of our communities, create a strong and lasting 
economy and protect our environmental assets  to create a good quality of life for all our 
residents.  
 
2.3. Our strategy aims to guide new development to the most suitable locations in the 
Borou gh, avoid development in our most environmentally sensitive locations and reduce 
the Borough’s contribution to g lobal warming.  This means ha ving regard to:  
 
• the role of Loughborough as the economic, cultural and social focus of the Borough;  
• our relationsh ip with the city of Leicester;  
• the separate strong identity and character of our settlements;  
• our valued landsca pes, biodiversity and heritag e; 
• the impacts of and contributions to climate change, including the risk of flooding; and  
• access to jobs, service s, infrastructure and sustainable travel options.  
 
2.4. Our development strategy aims to direct development to locations that provide access to 
jobs, services, infrastructure and where there are alternatives to the private car. 
Successful planning should lead t o the creation of healthy places in the Borough.  Our 
evidence shows that Charnwood is alre ady a healthy place to live compared with other 
places in the East Midlands and the rest of the country. However, there is recognition that 
encouraging more people t o adopt active lifestyles is an important public health objective.  
We want well -designed p laces that consider people’s well -being and encour age walking 
and cycling as physically active modes of transport and enable people to have convenient 
access to open  spaces and other facilities for active recreation and play, the natural 
environment and he alth care facilities.  
 
2.5. Our strategy also takes acc ount of the Strategic Growth Plan for Leicester and 
Leicestershire, which provides a long -term vision for the housi ng market area to address 
the challenges and opportunities in the area to 2050. The Growth Plan promotes 
developing Leicester’s role as the c entral city.  It also includes an A46 priority growth 
corridor around the south and east of Leicester terminating i n the south east of 
Charnwood and an International Gateway in the area around the junction of the A42 and 
the M1 motorway. It encourages mana ged growth at Loughborough and other market 
towns, an A5 improvement corridor and Melton Mowbray as a key centre fo r regeneration 
and growth.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  19 
 2.6. The development strategy in the local plan takes account of all these social, economic 
and environmental facto rs in identifying an appropriate spatial pattern of homes, jobs and 
facilities.  It has been prepared having consid ered the reasonable alternative options for 
development and should be used to understand wh ether individual proposals are 
acceptable in princ iple. 
 
Amount of Development Needed  
 
2.7. Both the UK’s and the Borough’s populations are increasing with people living longer, 
birth rates exceeding death rates and more people moving in than leaving the Boroug h. 
As a consequence, we have growing and changing communities which need homes, jobs, 
shops and services.  The role of the local plan is to make provision for the ri ght amount 
of development to meet our communities' needs for housing, employment shops and 
services.  
 
Local Housing Needs  
 
2.8. The Local Housing Need for Charnwood has been calculated using the standard 
methodology set out in the National Planning Practice Gui dance.  This shows there is a 
need for 1,111 new homes a year for the period 2021 -2037.  This is a total of 17,776 
homes.  
 
2.9. We have considered  whether the Local Housing Need figure needs to be adjusted to take 
account of economic circumstances in the Boroug h. Our evidence on local housing needs 
and economic needs indicates that our Local Housing Need figure does not need to be 
adjusted for econo mic circumstances.  
 
2.10.  In addition, we have considered whether our Local Housing Need figure needs to be 
adjusted to t ake account of the delivery of affordable housing. Our evidence shows that 
provision of new affordable housing is an important and pressing i ssue in the Borough. It 
does not however conclude that there is a need to consider a housing requirement greater 
than our Local Housing Need figure in order to enable the delivery of more affo rdable 
housing.  This is because some of the affordable housing need is already counted in the 
Local Housing Need figure as this measures the total number of new households that w ill 
form, including those in need of affordable housing.  Identifying this gr oup again in our 
housing need evidence does not therefore demons trate an additional overall need for 
housing above that identified. In addition, many households with a need for af fordable 
housing will already be living in housing and so providing an afford able housing option 
will release another home meaning there is n o overall net increase in the need.   
 
2.11.  Charnwood forms part of the wider housing market of Leicester and Leicesters hire and 
the city of Leicester has declared an unmet housing and employment n eed. Charnwood 
Borough has been actively engaged with its partne rs in the Housing Market Area to 
accommodate this need in the most sustainable way.  A Statement of Common Ground 
is advanced between partners setting out the process by which unmet need will be 
distributed. Policy DS2 provides a clear mechanism for the lo cal plan to be reviewed, and 
then updated if necessary once  the Statement of Common Ground is agreed by all 
partner s. Chapter 2 Devel opment Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  20 
 2.12.  A significant proportion of our housing need will be met through existing planning 
permissions including for  three Sustainable Urban Exten sions (SUEs) that will deliver 
homes throughout the local plan period, and in the case of North East of Leicester b eyond 
2037 as well:  
 
• North East of Leicester at Thurmaston known as Thorpebury (planning permission for 
4,500 homes)  
• West of Loughborough kn own as Garendon Park (planning permission for 3,200 
homes); and  
• North of Birstall known as Broadnook (planning perm ission for 1,950 home s). 
 
2.13.  The table below shows both the amount of homes needed and how many of the homes 
already have planning permission an d are expected to be delivered by 2037. The table 
shows 7,185 homes are required to meet our needs for the longer p lan period up to 2037  
once commitments are considered.

Flexibility  
 
2.14.  It is important to recognise that unforeseen changes can  affect the delivery of sites and 
our plan includes sufficient flexibility to allow for such circumstances and enable delivery 
of housing to meet our needs over the plan period.

 Employment Needs and Regeneration  
 
2.15.  We have worked with all the authorities in the Leicester and Leicestershire Functional 
Economic Market Area (FEMA) to understand our employment needs and tested this at 
a local level.  Our evidence identifies a need for 55.47ha of employment land over the 
plan period. This need is made up of 11.92ha for offices and 43.55ha for general industrial 
and small -scale  warehouse units.  This identified need includes a 10ha contingency in 
the supply of genera l industrial land to address low vacancy rates, choice and  market 
imbalance.  
 
2.16.  Charnwood forms part of the wider hou sing market of Leicester and Leicestershire and 
the city of Leicester has declared an unmet employment need . We have  actively engaged 
with partners in the FEMA to accommodate this need in the most sustainable way.  A 
Statement of Common Ground is advanced between partners setting out the process by 
which the unmet need will be distributed.  Policy DS2 provides a clear mechanism for the 
local plan to be reviewed, and then updated if necessary once  the Statement of Common 
Ground is agreed by all partners.  
 
2.17.  The scale of need for larger strategic distribution units in Leicestershire is being 
investigated with our partners, with most demand focuss ed in Harborough, North West 
Leicestershire, Hinckley and Bosworth, and Blaby. We are considering this at a Leicester 
and Leicestershire FEMA level to ensure a coordinated approach in addressing the needs 
of the sector,  which operates at a sub -regional, re gional and national level that requires 
significant cross boundary cooperation to meet their development needs . Our ap proach 
to strategic distribution is set out in our economy and regeneration chapter.  
 
2.18.  We have reviewed our existing employment commitments , and these continue to meet 
our needs and deliver our preferred strategy for economic growth.  Our commitments 
includ e employment provision as part of the allocated Sustainable Urban Extensions and 
other allocations and planning permissions. We will carry  forward the existing 
commitments and allocate these in the local plan which will provide sufficient supply to 
meet ne ed over the plan period. Employment land is primarily built out in response to 
demand, with little speculative investor engagement in the market for industrial 
development; however, we have sought to ensure that our strategic employment land 
supply is avai lable in a variety of locations, across the plan period to help meet our needs.   
 
2.19.  In order to provide flexibility in the supply of employ ment land and support the Council’s 
objectives in relation to the Leicestershire International Gateway and the regener ation of 
Shepshed, an additional allocation of 5ha of employment land is identified close to 
existing areas of employment land in the town  to support the availability of land in the 
short and medium term.   
 
2.20.  Our Employment Land Trajectory is set out at App endix 2.  We will use this trajectory as 
part of our consideration of proposals which are not allocated in the local plan

engineering. We have a long -standing commitmen t to the extension of the Loughborough 
Science and Enterprise Park to support growth in the high technology and kno wledge 
economy. Our strategy makes provision for the continued extension of the Loughborou gh 
Science and Enterprise Park up to 73 (gross) hec tares of land to the west of the existing 
site on the edge of Loughborough in a high-quality  landscaped setting.  
 
Town Centre and Retail Needs  
 
2.22.  Across the country the way people are using town centres is changing.  In recent years, 
shoppers have been incre asingly prepared to travel in order to access the greater choice 
of shops and leisure facilities that are more comm only available in larger towns and cities. 
The trend for shoppers to use large r centres and for a greater proportion of shopping to 
be done o nline presents a significant challenge to all retail centres but particularly those 
of smaller towns and villages. Our evidence tells us that despite these national trends, 
the proportion of sp ending on non -food shopping in Loughborough has remained stable  
since 2013. This suggests that, despite the challenging environment, Loughborough town 
centre continues to functio n well as a retail destination.  
 
2.23.  Taking account of developments that are alrea dy planned, and the amount of money that 
is expected to be avai lable for spending on both food shopping and non -food shopping, 
in physical retail space there is no quantitative n eed for any new floorspace for food 
shopping in Charnwood up to 2037  and only a need post 2028 for between 3,000sqm 
and 4,500sqm for new non -food shopping. Our evidence tells us that the most appropriate 
site for accommodating this new non -food need is at Baxter Gate/Pinfold Gate in 
Loughborough. The Covid -19 pandemic has accelerate d trends for more shopping to take 
place ‘online’ with the impl ications that future floor space needs are less predictable, and 
our policy response is therefore necessarily more flexible in this regard.  
  
Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  24 
 Regeneration Strategy  
2.24.  At the same time as planning for new homes, employment and retailing is t he need to 
regenerate parts of our Borough in order to support deprived communities, to respond to 
rapidly changing  economic conditions, and to support economic growth.   
 
2.25.  Our regeneration strategy focuses on Loughborough including the Town Centre, Bishop 
Meadow and the Industrial Heritage Quart er in the e ast of the Town, together with 
Loughborough Science and Enterpri se Park to the west.  Shepshed Town Centre and the 
area a round Watermead Country Park are also areas of regeneration priority as part of 
wider regeneration of t he Borough.  
 
2.26.  Significant progress has been achieved on regenerating the Borough since the Core 
Strategy was adopted in 2015 with major commercial develo pment taking place on sites 
in and around Loughborough town centre and improvements to the public realm at 
Loughborough and Shepshed  Town C entres now in progress.  This progress will be 
further suppo rted through the Loughborough Town Centre Masterplan (201 8) and with 
the preparation of a Town Investment Plan for Loughborough, which aims t o address 
challenges facing Loughborough including the hollowing out of the town centre, vacant 
land and buildings,  poor public realm, flood risk and traffic congestion.  
 
2.27.  Regeneration of our urban areas is considered further in the place polices for Leice ster 
Urban Area, Loughborough Urban Centre and Shepshed  Urban Area . The need to 
support the regeneration of existin g urban areas has been considered as part of the 
strategy  for new development which is considered in the section below.  
 
Location of Developm ent 
 
2.28.  Our strategy identifies a pattern of development that seeks to support our economy, 
provide a balance between homes and jobs in the Borough and ensure access to services 
and facilities including education, health, shops, leisure and open space.  It ha s bee n 
informed by an understanding of the Borough’s environment and the relationship between 
our settlements and t he countryside.  
 
2.29.  Our strategy is built on an understanding of our settlement hierarchy. We have assessed 
the services and facilities availabl e wit hin our settlements and the relationship each 
settlement has with the urban centres of Loughborough and Leices ter.  This has helped 
us to understand each settlement’s role and function and which settlements might be 
capable of supporting new developme nt.  Our settleme nt hierarchy is shown in table 4 .

2.30.  Markfield lies within Hinckley and Bosworth Borough, but the built form of the village lies 
on the boundar y with Charnwood.   Markfield is considered to have a range of services 
and facilities that is consistent with a Ser vice Centre, and our strategy has considered 
potential growth at Markfield within Charnwood’s Bo rough boundary in this context.  
 
2.31.  Our developm ent strategy has been informed by a sustainability appraisal and prepared 
in the context of the Strategic Growth Pl an for Leicester and Leicestershire with local 
priorities expressed through the local plan visio n.  
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  26 
 2.32.  Our development strategy results from de tailed testing of reasonable alternative options 
which began in the ‘Towards a Local Plan for Charnwood’ discussion  paper (April 2018).  
Reasonable options at this stage included different scales of growth acros s the Borough 
and also different amounts of d evelopment going to the different tiers in the settlement 
hierarchy.  Consultation responses to the discussion pape r did not highlight any further 
reasonable alternatives and did not provide any strong degree of  consensus as to a 
preferred option.  
 
2.33.  Evidenc e, consultation responses and the sustainability appraisal informed the 
development strategy that was consulted on in the Draft Charnwood Local Plan 
Consultation (October 2019).  At this stage the preferred stra tegy included 2,000 new 
homes at the edge of Leicester, 2,000 new homes at Loughborough, 2,000 at Shepshed, 
1,000 at the Service Centres and 800 at Other Settle ments. A detailed constraints 
assessment was undertaken for all sites in the Strategic Housing a nd Employment Land 
Availability Assessment (S HELAA) and the draft local plan included specific sites that 
were considered to best fit the overall strategy.  
 
2.34.  Consultation responses to the draft local plan led to refinements in the development 
strategy in tw o key ways:  
 
• the scale of homes to be planne d for, and  
• detailed responses from infrastructure providers indicating that the way homes are 
distributed needed f urther consideration.  
 
2.35.  Further sites were submitted during 2019 and 2020 which were also assessed to the 
same level as other SHELAA sites an d formed par t of the reconsideration of the 
development strategy. A sustainability appraisal was used to understand  the point at 
which significant adverse impacts would be encountered for different amounts of growth 
in different tiers of the settlement hie rarchy.  Sig nificant engagement was undertaken with 
the Local Education Authority and Clinical Commissioning Groups  to understand the 
capacity of schools and medical centres and the options available for the expansion in 
provision. This more detailed consi deration led  to significant refinements to the 
development strategy, notably in the Service Centres.  
 
2.36.  Details of th e alternative reasonable options consid ered are fully outlined in the 
sustainability a ppraisal that accompanies the local plan.  
 
Overall Principles  
 
2.37.  The overall principle underlying the allocation of land for development has been to avoid 
significant adve rse impacts on social, economic and environmental objective s.  Wherever 
possible, a lternative options which reduce or eliminate such impac ts have been pursued. 
Where significant adverse impacts are unavoidable, suitable mitigation measures are set 
out. 
 
2.38.  Our strategy is to direct development to those locations where there is a genuine 
opportunity to walk, cycle or use public transport and whi ch reduce the need to travel by 
private car. Reducing the need to travel by private car is one of the key ways in whic h the 
locational strategy can reduce contributions to climate change. In identifying sites in our 
development strategy, we have considered  the accessibility of services and facilities by 
sustainable modes of transport.  
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  27 
 2.39.  Our development strategy is for urba n concentration and intensification with some limited 
growth dispersed to other areas of the Borough.  It focuses housing and employment a t 
the edge of Leicester, proposes managed growth at Loughborough, directs some growth 
to Shepshed and smaller scale gr owth to the Service Centres and Other Settlements as 
set out in the table below.  
 
2.40.  Priority has been given to the development of sites with in our urban areas and particularly 
within Loughborough town centre to support its vitality and viability. This includ es new 
homes as well as town centre uses and employment opportunities, such as retail, offices, 
entertainment and leisure which are best s uited to town centre locations.

Other Settlements  119 815 934 
Small Villages/Hamlets  18 0 18 
Total 10,603 8,858  19,461  
 
2.41.  Our development strategy includes a variety of sizes of sites in a variety of locations and 
includes both strategic sites , which have the benefit of supporting the provision of on-site 
infrastructure, and small sites which will help to support small builde rs, provide market 
choice and contribute to the supply of new homes. We will work with landowners, 
developers and our com munities to bring forward additional small sites including through 
neighbourhood plans.  
Leicester Urban Area  
2.42.  The fo cus of development at the edge of Leicester reflects our commitment to the 
economic and social focus of the city which is central to the succ ess of the wider Housing 
and Economic Market Area of Leicester and Leicestershire. It is intended that 
development at the edge of the city reinforces our relationship with the city and the 
economic and social opportunities it presents.  
 
2.43.  It has been necessa ry to identify some housing sites in Green Wedges, with the strategic 
need for development, on balance, outweighing  the lo ss of Green Wedge. Following 
consultation with local authority partners, there is recognition that in allocating 
development in Green Wedges, significant and coordinated mitigation will be required.  
 
2.44.  Most of our housing growth in the Leicester Urba n Area will be delivered through two 
Sustainable Urban Extensions which will also provide employment land for the wider 
Leicester Urban Area.   The regeneration of Thurmaston will continue to be supported by 
maximising the potential of Watermead Country Par k and i dentifying land adjacent to 
A607 to help meet our need for jobs.  
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  28 
 Loughborough Urban Centre  
 
2.45.  Our strategy for Loughborough gives prior ity to new development within  the existing  
urban  area including  the areas in and closes t to the town centre.  This managed approach 
to growth will support the town’s role as an Urban Centre and maintain it as the social, 
cultural and economic focus for the  Borough. This will also support the regeneration of 
the town and its long -term vitality and via bility.   This has included allocating sites within 
the urban area where adverse impacts exist and this in recognition of our strategy of 
urban intensification and concentration.  
 
2.46.  This approach is complemented by new and committed extensions to the town.  These 
have taken i nto account the key constraints of the wide River Soar flood plain to the east, 
sensitive Charnwood Forest landscapes to the south and west o f the town, the herit age 
of Garendon Registered Park and Garden, the settlement identities of Quorn, 
Woodthorpe and  Hathern, and transport constraints.  
 
2.47.  Our strategy also seeks to maintain strategically important links in the wildlife network, 
keeping the m free from built for m to ensure connectivity between the Charnwood Forest 
and River Soar, two of Leicestershire’s most strategically important areas for biodiversity.  
 
Shepshed  Urban Area  
 
2.48. The growt h directed  to Shepshed will complement the existing commi tments and reflects 
the accessibility to services and facilities and evidence of landscape, ecological and 
transpor t capacity.  Our strategy supports the Leicestershire International Gateway set out 
in the Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic Growth  Plan.  
 
2.49.  Our str ategy takes account of the sensitivity of the Black Brook and Charnwood Forest and 
the impact on air qua lity.   Development in Shepshed will support the regeneration of the 
District Centre and improve access to jobs, services and facilities.    
 
Service Centres and Other Settlements  
 
2.50.  The provision of accessible primary school education within the Service Cent res and 
Other Settlements has been important to the development of an appropriate development 
strategy for Charnwood. Our strategy includes  growth  in our Service  Centres  and some 
of our  Other Settlements where  there is existing school capacity and ensur es sufficient 
levels of development to support the provision of new or extended schools  as necessary .   
 
2.51.  The growth dispersed  to the Service Centres and  Other Settlements provides housing in 
a variety of locations which improves the prospects for housing deli very whilst taking 
account of landscape and settlement identity constraints outlined in the overall vision and 
strateg y. 
 
2.52.  The smaller amount of development directed to Other Settlements reflects the smaller 
range of services and facilities in these village s compared to urban areas and Service 
Centres within Charnwood.  
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  29 
 Countryside  
 
2.53.  The Policies Map shows the Limits to Development for the U rban Centre, Urban Areas, 
Service Centres and Other Settlements in the Borough.   These boundaries define the 
cohesive built form of settlements, taking account of development allocations made, and 
makes them distinct from the Countrys ide. Our small villag es and hamlets do not have 
Limits to Development defined and will be treated as part of the Countryside.   
Countrys ide is the largely undeveloped land beyond the defined Limits to Development 
of our towns and villages and has its own i ntrinsic character an d beauty.  
 
2.54.  The Limits to Development, and by extension the edge of the Countryside, are an integral 
part of our dev elopment strategy to guide development to sustainable locations.  
 
Neighbourhood Areas  
 
2.55.  Charnwood has twelve designated neighbourhood areas – Anstey; Barrow upon Soar; 
Cossington; Thrussington; Thurcaston and Cropston; Queniborough; Quorn; Rearsby; 
Rothley;  Sileby; the Wolds Villages; and Woodhouse. The National Planning Policy 
Framework incl udes a requirement to set out a housing requirement fo r designated 
neighbourhood areas, taking into account any relevant allocations.  
 
2.56.  The plan makes provision for a gr eater number of homes than the housing requirement 
for the Borough between 2021 and 203 7 through allocations.  Our development strategy 
has b een strongly influenced by the need for sustainable development to be accompanied 
by the infrastructure that is req uired to support it, particularly primary school education.  
This has led development t o be directed to certain settlements and not others at  a 
strategic level.  For these reasons we have chosen not to set out an additional housing 
requirement for designat ed neighbourhood areas for this time period.   
 
2.57.  We will continue to support neighbourho od planning groups that wish to meet more local 
housin g needs.  Where requested by a neighbourhood planning body, an indicative 
housing requirement figure will be provid ed taking account of the latest housing need and 
infrastructure evidence at that time, the delivery of allocated sites and the period that th e 
neighbourhood plan would cover.  
 
2.58.  The parish of Wymeswold is not yet a designated neighbourhood area.  There are a  
number of available sites that adjoin the village and are similar in size and characte r and 
capacity in the local primary school.  A housing  requirement figure of up to 60 homes has 
been set for that area should it be designated as a neighbourhood area in  the future so 
that the most suitable site can be determined locally.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  30 
 Policy DS1: Development Strategy  
 
The overall  spatial  strategy  for Charnwood between  2021  and 2037  is urban concentration 
and intensification with some limited dispersal to o ther areas of the Borough.  The most  
environmentally sensitive  areas  will be protected,  and the pattern  of development  will 
provide  a balance  between  homes,  jobs and  facilities.  
 
We will support sustainable development that:   
 
• contributes towards  meeting  our needs for housing,  employment  and town centre uses  
within the defined Limits to Development  and allocations  defined  in this plan ;  
• minimi ses the need to travel,  particularly by private car, and prioritises public  transport,  
walking  and cycling;  
• protect s the intrinsic  character of the Countryside;   
• maintains the functions of Green Wedges and Areas of Local Separation;  
• safeguards and delivers  a net gain in biodiversity;  
• supports Loughborough as the main social, economic and cultural focus within the 
Borough and its compact and walkable town centre;  
• supports the vitality and viability of the Town Centre, District Centres and Local Centres 
to se rve the day to day needs of their communities;  
• supports the regeneration and economic success of urban areas;  
• makes  efficient use of land including using brownfield or underused land and buildings;  
• safeguards services and facilities;  
• contributes to local p riorities ident ified in neighbourhood plans; and  
• is in accordance with the policies in this plan.  
 
New Homes  
 
The housing requirement for Charnwood is 17,776 homes between 2021 and 2037 and 
provision for at least 19,461 new homes will be made. Land for ne w homes has been 
identified based on the optimum balance between social, environmental and economic 
considerati ons taking account of strategic and local priorities. The pattern of development 
for new homes in our spatial strategy is as follows:  
 
 Number of  
Homes  Pattern of 
Development  
Leicester Urban Area (Birstall, Syston, 
Thurmaston)  7,358  38% 
Loughborough Urban Ce ntre 6,073  31% 
Shepshed Urban Area  2,331  12% 
Service Centres  
(Anstey, Barrow upon Soar, Mountsorrel, Quorn, 
Rothley, Sileby)  2,747  14% 
Other Settlements  934 5% 
Small Villages and Hamlets  18 0% 
Total  19,461  100%  
  Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  31 
 New Employment and Retail  
 
Provision is made for up to 81.8 hectares  of employment land between 2021 and 2037. 
Employment land is identified to meet the economic and regeneration  needs of our 
communities and support the economic success of Charnwood and Leicester. The 
majority of new employme nt will be delivered as part of  Sustainable Urban Extensions and 
Watermead Business Park with a smaller proportion allocated in Shepshed, and , within 
and adjoining Service Centres and Other Settlements.  
 
Provision is made for the extension to Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park of up 
to 73 hectares to support the continued role of Loughborough in the knowledge -based  
sector.  
 
Provision will  be made for up to 4,500sqm (net) of comparison retail floorspace (non -food) 
at the Baxter Gate/Pinfold Gate Opport unity Site in Loughborough, as part of a mixed -use 
development.  
 
Environment  
 
Development will be directed to those locations of the least en vironmental or amenity 
value and to locations within the Borough at the lowest risk of flooding, applying the 
Seque ntial Test where applicable, and if necessary, applying the Exception Test.  
 
Development proposals should conserve and enhance the built and natural environment, 
protect biodiversity and mitigate and adapt to climate change in accordance with policies 
in this plan.  
 
Areas designated as Countryside, Areas of Local Separation, Green Wedges and 
Charnwood Forest Regional Park are identified on the Policies Map. These designations 
are an integral part of the spatial strategy that have  been identified to deliver growth in the 
context of the objective of conserving and protecting the character of our towns and 
villages and the intrinsic character and b eauty of the countryside.  
 
Implementation of Spatial Strategy  
 
The effect of our spatial strategy is that new buil t development wil l be confined to sites 
allocated in this local plan and neighbourhood p lans, and other land within the Limits to 
Development  subject to specific exceptions set out in this plan.  Development proposals 
which do not accord with this spatial strategy will not  be considered compatible with the 
vision or to meet the objectives of the plan and will not be considered sustainable 
devel opment, and as a result will not be supported.  
 
In circumstances where a five-year supply of deliverable housing l and cannot be 
demonstrated, proposals for development should only be refused where any adverse 
impacts of doing so would significantly and de monstrably outweigh the benefits.  In these 
circumstances, proposals are only likel y to be permitted where they:  
 
• accord with the pattern of development set out in table above;  
• adjoin the Limits to Development;  
• do not prejudice the deliver y of infrastru cture set out at A ppendix 3; and  
• accord with other development plan policies.  
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  32 
 If any one of the above criteria ar e not met, proposals will be considered to have significant 
adverse impacts. 
 
Leicester and Leicestershire Unmet Needs  
 
2.59.  There is a long track  record of effective joint working on strategic matters across Leicester 
and Leicestershire.  The nine local author ities have continuousl y engaged with each other 
on strategic matters  throughout the preparation of local plans across th e area.  
 
2.60.  Leicester Ci ty Council has identified an unmet need for housing and employment through 
its draft local plan.  The Leicester and  Leicestershire authorities have been engaged in a 
process of testing reasonable alternative options for meeting Le icester’s unmet need 
throu gh a sustainability a ppraisal process with a view to agreeing an apportionment of 
the unmet need ahead of the submi ssion of this local plan.   
 
2.61.  The change in Leicester’s housing need on 16 December 2020 (resulting from 
Government chang es to the standard me thod for calculating housing need) is so 
significant that additional work is now needed.  We will continue to activ ely engage in the 
programme of work planned to address the scale and redistribution of unmet need in the 
Housing Market Area with the objecti ve of agreeing a Statement of Common Ground with 
other authorities across Leicester and Leicestershire. We will do this whilst maintaining 
progress with the preparation of the Charnwood local plan.   
 
2.62.  Avoiding delays is critical to dem onstrating and mainta ining a five-year supply of 
deliverable housing sites in the Borough. Delay will lead to unplanned development and 
a lack certainty for communities and private and public sector investors in the intervening 
period. This certainty is al so needed to ensure a ppropriate infrastructure is secured and 
to assist the economy in its recovery from the Covid -19 pandemic.  
 
2.63.  The Cou ncil will continue to work collaboratively with the Leicester & Leicestershire 
authorities to establish the scale and re distribution of unmet  housing and employment 
needs in the Housing Market Area (HMA) and Functional Economic Market Area (FEMA).  
This wi ll be achieved through a Statement of Common Ground addressing the scale and 
redistribution of unmet need arising in Lei cester or elsewhere i n the HMA/FEMA.  
 
Policy DS2: Leicester and Leicestershire Unmet Needs  
 
Within 6 months of the agreement by all part ners of the Statement of Common Ground for 
the apportionment of unmet housing and employment need, the Council will publish a 
review of this local plan. Should a full or partial update be triggered by the review,  the 
Council will commence the update (defin ed as being publication of an invitation to make 
representations in accordance with Regulation 18 of The Town and Country Planning 
(Local Pla nning) (England) Regulations 2012) within 12 months of the publication of the 
review. Once the update has commenced  the Council will submit the Plan Update to the 
Planning Inspectorate for Examination within a further 36 months of the date of 
commencement of the update.  
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  33 
 Housing Allocations  
 
2.64.  Our spatial strategy has identified the most appropriate locations for de velopment to meet 
the Borough’s housing needs while meeting our other strategic objectives and the wider 
aims of sustainable development.  We  have used a site selection process inform ed by a 
sustainability appraisal to identify the most suitable housing si tes from those that are 
available to achieve the distribution of development set out in our spatial strategy.  That 
process has also been inf ormed by the need to secure the provision of the infrastructure 
necessary to support sustainable development.  
 
2.65.  For a number of sites, we have included site specific policies that are required to address 
specific constraints, wider objectives or other issue s related to those sites.  Site policies 
should be read in conjunction with the place -based and topic -based policie s in the plan.  
If there is no site policy this means that the issues relating to that site are adequately 
addressed by applying place -based and topic -based policies  in this local p lan. 
 
Policy DS3: Housing Allocations  
 
We will make provision for homes in accordance with Policy DS1 and will support housing 
development on the sites listed in this policy.   We will support development that:  
 
• is cohesive and integrated with other allocations set out in this plan including in 
relation to the provision of new sc hools and other infrastructure; and  
• in accord ance with the other policies in this plan and the site-specific  requirements set 
out in this pol icy below.

2.66.  Site HA1 Land S outh East of Syston is located in the area between Syston and Barkby  
that is important in maintaining the separate identities of these two places and extends 
close to the edge of the Barkby Conservation Area.  A significant portion of the site is at 
higher  risk of both fluvial and surface water flooding.  The capacity of the site has been 
reduced to reflect the need to  mitigate the impact of develop ment on the settlement 
identity, Barkby Conservation Area and the risk of flooding to residents of the 
develop ment.  The site will provide the site for and contribute to the cost of providing a 
new primary school that will me et the needs of this developmen t and other development s 
within a safe walking distance.  
 
2.67.  The following diagram provides a visual guide to ass ist with interpretation of the policy 
below.  It also provides a concept masterplan for the site for illustrative p urposes.  We will

Loughborough, Woodthorpe and Quorn, an area import ant for maintaining the separate 
identities of these settlements, and also in a strategically important link s in the wildlife 
network between the important natura l resources of the Charnwood Forest and Soar 
Valley.  For this reason, it is particularly impo rtant that biodiversity net gain is achieved 
on site in this location rather than through off site contributions, i n accordance with Policy 
EV6. The capacity of t he site responds to the site constraints to enable the impact of 
development on settlement ide ntity and the landscape to be mitigated.

HA16 Laburnum Way, Loughborough  
 
2.81.  Site HA16 Laburnum Way, Loughborough is located in a sensitive and valued landscape 
within the Charnwood Forest and forms an important part of the landscape setting of 
Loughborough.  The site is promin ent in views from the Outwoods and other higher 
ground to the west, and care will be needed in planning the site to ensure that urbanising 
effects of development are successfully mitigated.   The provision of significant planted 
areas which allow trees with  large canopies to mature is likely to be a more successful 
solution to integrating new development into the landscape.  This will require ca reful 
attention not just to design and layout, b ut to long term management and maintenance of 
public open spaces.  
 
2.82.  The site is also  in a strategically important link in the wildlife network between the 
important natural resources of the Charnwood Forest an d Soar Valley . For this reason,  it 
is particular ly important that biodiversity net gain is achieved on site in this  location rather 
than through off site contributions, in accordance with Policy EV6.  The site also includes 
a listed building (Half Way Hous e) and is located close to two other listed buil dings (Moat 
House and Park Grange) and the non -designated heritage asset of the parkland to 
Beaumanor Hall.  
 
2.83.  Parts of the site are  shown by our evidence to be at risk from surface water flooding and  
access t o the western portion of the site needs to be ca refully planned in light of a flood 
risk assessment.  The site also  includes a tributary of the Wood Brook.

Design of Development  
 
2.128.  Achie ving high quality design is one of the main elements of our vision for the Borough.  
This aim is supported by the NPPF, which makes clear a high standard of design is a key 
part of sustainable development and a means to make development acceptable to 
commu nities.   
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  69 
 2.129.  The Gov ernment’s National Design Guide, preparation of a National Design Code and 
establishment of the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission show a commitment 
to improving design nationally.  The 2020 Housing Design Audit for Engla nd also identifies 
a ne ed for improvement as the East Midlands continues to be the worst performing 
English region in terms of design quality of new developments.  
 
2.130.  High quality design is not just about how development looks; it is also about how it 
respond s to the site and the e nvironment around it.  High quality design creates 
environments where people want to live, work and visit and which are safe, long lasting 
and adaptable to changing needs.  High quality design can also respond effectively to a 
wide r ange of issues such as tackling climate change, improving local biodiversity, 
enhancing a sense of place and providing healthier and more active places.  The Covid -
19 pandemic has shown the importance of some of these aspects of design, such as the 
benefit s to people of having g reen spaces within walking distance of their homes.  
Important design considerations therefore feature in other policies in this plan, particularly 
in relation to heritage, biodiversity, flood risk, sustainable construction and susta inable 
transport.  Being able to respond appropriately to all of these considerations and 
understanding how they interact is a key part of achieving high quality design.  A 
successful response in relation to one component is unlikely to overcome defects in  the 
response to others . 
 
2.131.  While the principles of good design are well -established, there are many ways of 
describing how it can be achieved.  For example, the NPPF sets out six characteristics of 
well-designed places, the National Design Guide sets out te n characteristics (loos ely 
grouped under three themes), and there is useful guidance produced by specialist 
organisations in relation to specific design issues.  These include:  
 
• Sport England’s Active Design Guidance and The Ten Principles of Active Design;  
• Historic England’s Go od Practice Advice on The Setting of Heritage Assets;  
• Designing Out Crime published by the Design Council; and  
• Manual for Streets. 
 
2.132.  Both the NPPF and Natio nal Design Guide are material considerations in decision making 
but we encourage a pplicants to also m ake use of available specialist guidance and 
consider the two pillars to good design set out below.  
 
Pillar One: Responding to Place  
 
2.133.  We will require new development proposals to make a positive contribution to local 
character, includin g its heritage, bio diversity and overall sense of place.  Because of the 
importance we place on this, and also on maintaining the individual identity of settlements 
and their  surrounding countryside, we will expect the way in which developments on the 
edge s of settlements ar e designed to be given particular attention.  We will also recognise 
the role that appropriately innovative and original designs can play in helping to rei nforce 
local distinctiveness and achieve a high standard of architectural quality.  
 
2.134.  Charnwood has a d iverse natural landscape and history of human settlement; this has 
meant that our towns, villages and different areas of countryside have distinct identiti es 
and characters.  Successfully designed schemes will draw inspiration from this local 
distinctivene ss.  The plan contains place -based policies that set out the key features of 
different parts of the Borough.  The first pillar of our approach to good desi gn is that those 
policies, along with adopted neighbourhood plans, village design statements and Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  70 
 cons ervation area character appraisals, should be the starting point for identifying the key 
aspects of place that will inform how development is designed.  Th is approach will be 
enhanced when development proposals are informed by local enga gement in advance o f 
planning applications being made.  
 
Pillar 2: Design Tools  
 
2.135.  Our approach to the process of design is based upon Building for a Healthy Life (BfHL).  
BfHL is a widely used design tool and its latest edition was prepared in partnership w ith 
Homes England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and endorsed by the Home 
Builders Federation.  We recognise the usefulness of BfHL in communicating important 
design c onsiderations to applicants through illustrations and prompts.  Although it is not 
place specific, we wis h to see it used, alongside the place -based prompts described 
above, as the other major pillar supporting good design in Charnwood.  
 
2.136.  There are plenty o f examples of well -designed new developments in the Borough, as 
shown in the Charnwood  Design Awards’ win ners and nominees.  However, these 
examples are predominantly small -scale  developments.  Research has shown that 
successful application of BfHL principl es by major housebuilders in the East Midlands 
remains generally poor with many new de velopments failing to score highly against the 
questions that were the basis for Building for Life 12.  
 
 
Storkit Meadows, Wymeswold: Shortlisted for the 2019 Charnwood Design Awards  
 
2.137.  We recognise that larger developments raise a wider range of design con siderations, 
partic ularly regarding how groups of buildings and areas of open space relate to each 
other and how they are connected.  Good design choices about the location and 
integrat ion of services and facilities within larger developments can also incr ease the 
number of times that they are visited and enable sustainable modes of travel to be used 
to visit them.  The structuring of BfHL around three themes of Integrated Neighbourhoods , 
Chapter 2 Development Strat egy 
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  71 
 Distinctive Places and Streets for All is therefore particularly rele vant to improving d esign 
quality in larger developments.  
 
2.138.  For those developments that require a Design and Access Statement, we will expect 
those statements to clearly set out how these  two pillars have been addressed and how 
the design of the development has responded to th e issues that have been identified.  
This should cover not just the architectural style and materials of buildings but their layout 
and arrangement in relation to ope n spaces, and the pattern and grain of the street 
network.  
 
Independent  Design Reviews  
 
2.139.  For developments of a significant scale and those on sites which we identify as being in 
sensitive locations, such as those that form a gateway to a settlement or area within a 
settlement, we want to see design excellence showcasing the ve ry best use of urba n 
design principles, setting a benchmark for achieving high quality design elsewhere in the 
Borough and across the region. Independent design reviews can be a helpful  tool to 
influence the design process for these types of developments.   
 
2.140.  We will require developments of a significant scale and those in sensitive locations to 
undertake an independent design review , especially the following:  
 
• Land South East of Syston (Site HA1) because of the scale of development;  
• Land at Gynsill Lane an d Anstey Lane, Glen field (Site HA12) because of its scale and 
impact upon the Green Wedge;  
• Land south of Loughborough (Site HA15) because of the scale of development;  
• West  of Anstey (Site HA43) because of the scale of development;  
• Laburnum Way, Loughboroug h (Site HA16) becau se of the potential impact on the 
Charnwood Forest; and  
• Moat  Farm, Land south west of Loughborough (Site HA17)  because of the potential 
impact on the C harnwood Forest.  
• We want independent design reviews to be constructive and lead to be tter 
placemaking.  They can for example provide  a positive opportunity for both the local 
planning authority and the applicant to consider a range of design solutions that  result 
in good placemaking.   
 
2.141.  To be effective, design reviews need to be incorporat ed at an early stag e of the design 
process so that any amendments suggested by them can be incorporated into 
development proposals.  It may be necessary for the review process be undertaken 
several times as development proposals evolve.  
 
2.142.  The Council will a ssess development p roposals to determine whether an independent 
design review is appropriate due to their scale or location on a case -by-case basis.  It is 
more likely that a design review will be required on unallocated sites than for th ose 
allocated in t he local plan as th ey have not met the combination of characteristics in terms 
of minimising or mitigating harms, and achieving benefits, for inclusion in our development 
strategy.   
 
2.143.  Any design reviews that are required by the Council wi ll be funded by th e applicant.  
 
 
 Chapter 2 Development Strategy  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  72 
 Other considerations  
 
2.144.  Good design encompasses a wide range of considerations.  The following sections 
highlight matters that should be used in interpreting our policy and is non -exhaustive.  
 
Design Guidance  
 
2.145.  Guidance to b e used in planning  decisions, particu larly with respect to house extensions, 
amenity, car parking and crime prevention is set out in A ppendix 4.  This guidance should 
be considered alongside the other aspects of good design, particularly the need to 
respon d to local context . 
 
Amenity  
 
2.146.  The ame nity of a place relates to the positive characteristics that combine to make up its 
character and the way it is enjoyed by people, particularly those who live there.  Good 
design will add to the amenity of an area and protect existing am enities, for exampl e by 
enhancing its sense of place and protecting its tranquillity.  
 
Retail Centres  
 
2.147.  Our retail centres (Town Centres, District Centres and Local Centres) perform a number 
of functions in terms of the services they provide and are places where people come 
together to meet.  In order to support these functions it is important that the design of 
developments in and near these locations supports this character, for example by 
incorporating active frontages, which add in terest, life and vitali ty to the public re alm, and 
responding positively to the grain and vertical and horizontal rhythms (e.g. the building 
widths, the proportion and scale of windows and doors etc.) of the surrounding 
townscape.  
 
Equalities Act 2010  
 
2.148.  The Council has a duty und er the Equalities A ct 2010 to have due regard in its decision 
making to achieve certain objectives for people with protected characteristics. These 
objectives include eliminating forms of discrimination, advancing equality of opportu nity 
and fostering good  relations between persons with and without protected characteristics. 
The contribution a development proposal makes to the achievement of objectives of the 
Equalities Act will form part of the consideration of planning proposals.  
 
Neighbourhood Planning  
 
2.149.  We expect neighbour hood plans to continue taking a strong lead on the type of design 
they expect for their area.  We have made clear that adopted neighbourhood plans and 
village design statements will be key starting points for unde rstanding places and the ir 
character and th erefore of achieving good design.  We will encourage those communities 
who wish to prepare a neighbourhood plan to provide local design guidance which reflects 
and accords with Building for a Healthy Life principl es. Many villages also h ave a village 
desig n statement, and we will continue to work with our communities who wish to 
influence the design of new buildings using this type of document.

Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  73 
 Design Codes  
 
2.150.  We will be preparing our own design codes for the Borough.  We also encourage  their 
use by appli cants, alongside other tools such as masterplanning and development briefs, 
as an effective way of developing and communicating the design ideas for proposed 
developments.  
 
Policy DS5: High Quality Design  
 
We will require new development s to make a positiv e contribution to Charnwood, by 
responding positively to the local distinctiveness of the area and providing attractive and 
functional places where people will want to live, work and visit. We will specifically require 
new developments t o: 
 
• respect and enh ance the character of the area, having regard to scale, density, 
massing, height, landscape, layout, materials, access arrangements, and heritage 
assets and the ir setting;  
• protect the amenity of people who live or work nearby and those who will live in th e 
new development;  
• be built to last and add to the quality of the area, not just in the short term but over the 
lifetime of the development;  
• provide attractiv e, safe and well managed public and private amenity spaces which 
support acti ve lifestyles;  
• provide well -defined, legible and multi -functional streets and spaces that support all 
users and encourage social interaction; and  
• reduce their impacts upon, and be resilient to, the effects of climate change in 
accordance with Policy CC4.  
 
An independent de sign review should be carried out for strategic or sensitive development 
proposals. We will determine on a case by case basis whether an independent design 
review is required based on the scale of the proposals and the sensitivity of the ir location.   
 
Any design reviews that are required by the Council will be funded by the applicant.  
 
Planning permission will be refused for developments that are not well designed, 
especially where appropriate design methods to achieve well -designed plac es, such as 
Buildin g for a Healthy Life, appropriate place -based reference points and engagement with 
the local community, have not been used.

Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  74 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
 
Leicester Urban Area  
 
3.1. The Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan id entifies Leicester as having a 
pivotal part to play in the strategy for delivering homes and jobs in Leicester and 
Leicestershire and looks to develop its role as the ‘central city’.  The urban settlements of 
Birstall, Syston and Thurmaston in the South of  Charnwood form par t of the Leicester 
Urban Area and are significantly influenced by their physical and functional relationships 
with the City whilst also having a good range and choice of services and facilities that 
meet the day to day needs of residents .   
 
3.2. There is an ar ea south of the A46 in Anstey parish, and a small residential area adjacent 
to Hamilton, to the north east of the city, within Charnwood which also form part of the 
Leicester Urban Area but are not settlements in their own right.  
 
3.3. Leice ster has significan t housing needs yet the opportunities to satisfy this need are 
constrained within its administrative boundary.  Many of the strategic opportunities 
available within the city are to the north and north west close to Charnwood.  There is 
also growth being de livered in Blaby and Harborough district areas to the north west and 
north east of the city.  A key part of supporting Leicester in its role as ‘central city’ will be 
ensuring a joined -up approach to delivering growth in this wider area.   
 
Background  
 
3.4. Leicester is one of the oldest cities in England with its origins in the Iron Age.  The city 
has a rich heritage from Roman, Saxon, and Norman times, and became one of the most 
significant centres for textile and hosiery manufacturing in the  UK.  The city has grown 
significantly over the last few decades and now forms part of a continuous urban area 
which goes beyond its administrative area and is home to 650,000 people.     
 
3.5. The proximity of Thurmaston, Birstall and Syston to Leicester has a lways been a key 
factor in their growth and development. All were originally Saxon standalone settlements, 
however, over the years, improving transport links with Leicester allowed new busi nesses 
to develop while also giving people the opportunity to trave l to work in Leices ter.  From 
the 18th century onwards local industries in Syston included framework knitting and shoe 
manufacture. Later in the 20th century, Syston along with Thurmaston, experienced 
significant growth of jobs and housing.  
 
3.6. The area is i nfluenced by a seri es of natural and man -made features which have shaped 
development. The River Soar and Grand Union Canal stretch from the centre of the city 
into Charnwood and provide rec reational opportunities along their length, notably at 
Watermead Co untry Park. There a re also several major arterial routes, such as the A6, 
A607 and Anstey Lane which run into the city from the A46 in Charnwood, north of 
Leicester. The Midland Main Line r ailway runs northwards from the city to Loughborough 
and beyond, wi th the route east t o Peterborough branching off at Syston junction. The 
Great Central Railway also passes through the area with this popular heritage line starting 
in Birstall and travellin g north to Loughborough.  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  75 
 3.7. The Leicester Urban Area also holds a sig nificant proportion  of the Borough’s population 
with over 20% of people in Charnwood living around the edge of Leicester. 51% of people 
living in Birstall, Syston, Thurmaston and Anstey tra vel to jobs in the City and benefit from 
the range of services and facilities that it has. Whilst there are a significant number of jobs 
in Charnwood, approximately 34% more people leave the Borough to work than travel in, 
with 84% of these heading to Leic ester.  Sustainable transport routes into Leicester allow 
relatively good access to jo bs and the cultural and social opportunities provided by a large 
urban area.  
 
3.8. In addition to having very good public transport connections into the city, Thurmaston, 
Syston and Birstall also individually provide a full range and choice of services and 
facilities to residents.  These settlements all have a secondary school and more than one 
option available to residents for a range of services including food shops, primary  schools, 
doctor’s surgeries, pharmacies and cash machines.  Thurma ston and Syston has  the 
highest concentrations of employment outside the urban centres with between 8 -9% of 
the Borough’s total employment located in each of these settlements. Almost certa inly 
related to this, these settlements also have a relatively high  level of self -containment for 
travel to work journeys compared to other settlements.  
 
3.9. Thurmaston is home to some of the most deprived households in the Borough, with some 
areas worsening i n deprivation ranking over the last 5 years. Part of Thurmaston bor ders 
the Watermead Country Park and is within the South Charnwood Priority Neighbourhood. 
Our evidence shows pockets of deprivation where there are low levels of income among 
older people, low levels of education, skills and training and a poor -quality liv ing 
environment. Co mmunity cohesion is also restricted by the physical barriers of the A607 
and Midland Mainline railway. The opportunity to benefit the community by linking 
Thurmaston to W atermead Country Park and the Grand Union Canal has been supported 
in the past, but none of these initiatives as yet have successfully come forward to impact 
upon deprivation.  
 
Environmental Context  
3.10.  The Leicester Urban Area sits largely within the Soar Va lley landscape character area, 
with Syston lying within the Wreake Valley area.  It al so has a relationship with the 
Charnwood Forest to the west and High Leicestershire to the east.  These landscape 
character areas are an important part of the character a nd local distinctiveness of the 
individual urban settlements and th eir setting.   
 
3.11.  Many of the locations allocated for new development on the edge of Leicester are situated 
on sites with sloping topography and are prominent in views from a variety of locat ions in 
surrounding countryside.  Screening focussed on the edge of  such sites is unli kely to 
successfully integrate development into its landscape setting, as more central parts of 
new development may still be conspicuous.  The allowance for significant p lanted areas 
which allows trees with large canopies to mature is li kely to be a more s uccessful long -
term solution to integrating new development into the landscape.  This will require careful 
attention not just to design and layout, but to long term manag ement and maintenance of 
public open spaces.  
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  76 
 3.12.  Also important to lo cal distinctiveness  are the historic centres of Thurmaston, Birstall and 
Syston.  Conservation Areas have been designated within Birstall and Syston and for 
each there are nationally and locally listed buildings within and adjacent to t he 
Conservation Area .  Whilst not withi n the Leicester Urban Area, the setting and heritage 
of the Barkby Conservation Area and the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Hamilton 
Deserted Medieval Village will also be relevant to the delivery of development in thi s area.  
 
3.13.  The River S oar and Grand Union  Canal provide a broad green corridor between the city 
centre and the countryside in Charnwood.  This is a green lung which is important for 
wildlife, visitors and the tourist economy.  We will work with partners on a  joined -up 
approach to the River Soar a nd Grand Union Canal for ecology and leisure purposes and 
together with Watermead Country Park these are a significant element of our strategy for 
this important corridor.   
 
3.14.  Watermead  Country Park is the most significant area of open sp ace serving Syston,  
Thurmaston and Birstall and provides a large area  of natural and semi natural green 
space totalling 144 hectares. It is an important recreational asset for surrounding 
communities  based on a network of old mineral workings and artificia l lakes that run no rth 
to south along the path of the river.  A key issue in this area is the need to improve the 
connectivity between Thurmaston, Birstall and Wanlip and the Watermead Country Park 
and t o make the most of this high -quality environment as p art of supporting t he 
regeneration of Thurmaston Local Centre.  
 
3.15.  Green Wedges are a long -standing policy designation used by the city of Leicester and 
the districts that surround it to manage urban growth .  The aim of Green Wedges is to 
guide development fo rm, to provide a ‘g reen lung’ into the City and ensure that, as the 
urban area grows, it is accompanied by open areas for people and for wildlife and to 
safeguard the identities of communities within and  around urban areas. Our strategy is to 
extend the Le icester Hamilton Gr een Wedge as part of delivering the North East of 
Leicester Sustainable Urban Extension.   
 
3.16.  Our strategy, informed by wider sustainability considerations explained in Section 4, 
includ es development in areas that have previously been ide ntified as Green We dge.  
Development in these locations will require careful planning to ensure that the effect upon 
the separate identities and landscape setting of distinct towns and villages is mitiga ted 
and to ensure that linked areas of open space can  be maintained into  the urban area of 
Leicester. We will work closely with Leicester City Council to ensure a coordinated 
approach to the delivery of new development to include areas where the functions of 
Green Wedge can be maintained. We will use the opp ortunities brought by new 
development to provide significantly improved recreational opportunities.  
 
3.17.  In forming part of the urban area of the city, the communities of Barkby, Birstall, Rothley, 
Syston, T hurcaston, Thurmaston and Wanlip have increasingly be en concerned about 
their identities as separate places.  Our strategy seeks to protect the identity of places 
and prevent the coalescence of urban settlements and settlements outside urban areas 
by intro ducing new Areas of Local Separation.  
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  77 
 3.18.  Our eviden ce shows us that th at there was a quantitative shortfall in the provision of parks 
and gardens in Syston, Thurmaston and Birstall.  Both Syston and Thurmaston have 
quantitative shortfalls of allotments, and Thurmaston also has an under provision of 
childre n’s play and facili ties for teenagers.   In delivering our development strategy, 
opportunities to provide new open space and recreational facilities will be sought.  
 
Development Strategy for Leicester Ur ban Area  
Homes and Jobs  
3.19.  Our development strategy dire cts development to the edge of Leicester as a sustainable 
location that has a range and choice of services and facilities that meet the day to day 
needs of residents and which functionally forms part of the Leicester Urban Area. The 
focus of development at  the edge of Leices ter reflects our commitment to the economic 
and social success of the city, which is essential to the success of the wider Housing and 
Economic Market Area of Leicester and Leiceste rshire and reflects the Leicester and 
Leicestershire Str ategic Growth Plan’ s aim to enhance Leicester’s role as the central city 
at the heart of the county.  
 
3.20.  Our strategy allocates most of the Leicester Urban Area growth to two Sustainable Urban 
Extensions  (SUE); one to the north east of Leicester and the other  north of Birstall , both 
of which have planning permission.  The two SUEs  are the subject of specific policies in 
this plan which will guide their implementation to ensure they make a positive contrib ution 
to sustainable development.   
 
3.21.  Our strategy alloca tes a further 2,104  new homes to the Leicester Urban Area through 
smaller allocations.  The gro wth directed to the edge of Leicester  takes account of 
landscape constraints, including Green Wedges, and  the transport infrastructure required 
to support growth .  A key part of ou r strategy is the delivery of homes and jobs that are 
supported by the necessary infrastructure.  The delivery of growth in the Leicester Urban 
Area will be supported by continued c oordination between the Borough Council, the two 
Highway  Authorities, Highw ays England and the two Education Authorities to ensure the 
provision of the necessary infrastructure. Our strategy includes provision for a new 
primary school on Land South East of  Syston.   
 
3.22.  The south of Charnwood provides significant job opportunities w ithin our Borough, as well 
as supporting and supplementing the major centre for employment in Leicester. We have 
identified strategic employment sites at the two SUEs  to reflect the need for ad ditional 
provision close to the city. Land i s also allocated fo r employment close to Watermead 
Country Park, providing a highly accessible and attractive site for inward investment. This 
will create jobs close to our Priority Neighbourhood in South Charnwo od.   
 
Regeneration  
3.23.  The high -quality recreat ional opportunities  of the  Watermead Country Park provide  an 
opportunity for wider regeneration of this area.  Development also provides the 
opportunity to address the severance of the community by major transpor t corridors and 
connect the community with t he adjacent County Park and heritage canal frontage.  Any 
development close, or with a relationship, to Thurmaston Waterfront or Watermead 
County Park must support regeneration of this area and protect and enhanc e the area’s 
valuable landscape, tranquillit y and biodiversity.  We also want to make sure that this area Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  78 
 continues to act as a Green Wedge and contributes to community identity on the fringe 
of the city.  
Sustainable Travel  
3.24.  The edge of Leicester enjoys a re latively good transport network connecting o ur 
settlements to b oth the city and Loughborough. As with any large conurbation, the road 
network can suffer from congestion at peak times in areas such as the A46 Leicester 
Western Bypass; Melton Road, Syston; a nd, Anstey Lane, Leicester. However, there a re 
often walking an d cycling opportunities available and bus services are good, including a 
park and ride service at Birstall, although journeys that require more than one bus can be 
inconvenient. The area is a h ighly accessible location, and our evidence has identified 
strategic transport advantages over many other locations in Charnwood.   
 
3.25.  We will seek to develop these connections and exploit the opportunities that new 
developments and transport projects will p rovide to encourage sustainable forms of 
transport.  The constr ained road network and breadth of alternatives to the private car 
provide a real opportunity to shift transport to walking, cycling and public transport in this 
area.   
 
Retail  
 
3.26.  Whilst the city  of Leicester is the focus for higher order services and facili ties in areas 
such as retail, leisure and cultural activities in the south of Charnwood, there are also 
town and village centres which provide a focus for communities in the Borough by offering  
goods and services close to where people li ve.  
 
3.27.  Syston Distri ct Centre contains national retail chains as well as independent local retailers 
and provides a strong and varied shopping and service offer. Birstall also has a healthy 
District Centre with a strong convenience offer and a variety of ot her retail and serv ice 
provision that meets the needs of the local community. Melton Road, Thurmaston 
provides a Local Centre for day to day needs and acts as a focal point for its community.  
We want to see new development within this Local Centre not onl y to support its ro le as 
a Local Centre but to help our priority for the regeneration of Thurmaston. We want to 
ensure that development proposals around the edge of Leicester supports the vitality and 
viability o f these centres. We want these centres to co ntinue to provide f or day to day 
needs of their local communities and we will support town centre uses provided this 
development is consistent with their position in our retail hierarchy.  
 
3.28.  Thurmaston Shopping Centre, to the north of Thurmaston, provides an  out-of-centre reta il 
and leisure offer in Charnwood, and is a popular destination for shoppers drawing custom 
from outside the Borough.  This centre does not form part of our hierarchy of centres for 
town centre uses.   
 
 
 
  
Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  80 
 Policy LUA1 : Leicester Urba n Area  
 
We will sup port Leicester Urban Area in its role as the central economic, social  and cultural 
focus of the County.  We will do this by supporting development that:  
• delivers housing and employment allocations in accordance with Policy DS3 and DS4 
or sustainable devel opment that is in accordance with the pattern of development 
outlined in Policy DS1  and which supports our vision and objectives including making 
effectiv e use of land;  
• ensures the timely and coordinated delivery of infrastructure to sup port sustainable 
communities, including coordination across authority boundaries, in accordance with 
Policies INF1 and INF2;  
• improves connectivity and accessibility to Leice ster city centre, Birstall and Syston 
District Centres and Thurmaston Local Centre,  particularly by wa lking, cycling and 
public transport, capitalising on the accessibility of the Leicester Urban Area, in 
accordance in Policy CC5;  
• ensures Green Wedge funct ions are maintained and development is co -ordinated 
across administrative boundarie s where this is rel evant, in accordance with Policy EV2;  
• provides urban form which integrates with the wider landscape setting and responds 
positively to the relevant local landscape character area of Soar Valley, Wreake Valley, 
Charnwood Forest or High Le icestershire, in ac cordance with Policy EV1;  
• protects the predominantly open and undeveloped character of Areas of Local 
Separation, in accordance with Policy EV3;  
• protects  and enhances the strategically important links in the wildlife network, 
including the Great Central R ailway, River Soar, Grand Union Canal, Green Wedges and 
locations which provide connectivity between strategically important habitats, in 
accordance with Policies E5 and EV6;  
• protects and enhances heritage features and positively support s local distinctive ness, 
in accordance with Policy EV8;  
• responds positively to the high quality, tranquil setting of Watermead Country Park;  
• improves connectivity and access ibility between Watermead Country Park, 
Thurmaston Waterfront and the wider communi ty; and  
• contributes  to the regeneration of Thurmaston Local Centre, the Thurmaston 
Waterfront and the Grand Union Canal.  
 
Leicester Urban Area Strategic Allocations  
 
North East of Leicester Sustainable Urban Extension  
 
3.29.  The North East of Leicester Sustainab le Urban Extension (SUE) is allocated on land 
adjacent to the Leicester Urban Area to the east of Thurmaston and north of Hamilton (in 
Leicester).   
 
3.30.  The site benefits from a hybrid planning permission granted in August 2016 which 
secured outline permissio n for the SUE and a  detailed permission for the Southern 
Access Road into Leicester.  The planning permission is structured around a detailed 
Design and Access Statement, six parameter plans and a series of framework and 
strategy documents, which together guide how developme nt will come forward by 
establishing a design framework.  The detail in these documents are secured by planning Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  81 
 conditions and a legal  agreement. Reserved matters have also been approved for the 
first phase of residential development.  
 
3.31.  Delivery of the SUE is a key part of delivering the plan’s overall spatial strategy.  The site 
is a commitment and is allocated in the local plan to provi de a policy framework and 
certainty around delivery in the long term.  We will work with landowners, de velopers, and 
other  stakeholders to support the delivery of the SUE over the plan period.  
 
3.32.  We have prepared a vision for the North East Leicester Sustain able Urban Extension in 
partnership with the developers, Leicestershire County Council and Leicester Ci ty 
Council. The vis ion is outlined below:  
 
A Vision for the North East of Leicester Sustainable Urban Extension  
The North East of Leicester Sustainable Urban Extension will be a locally 
distinctive, sustainable and thriving new community that is well integ rated and has 
excel lent connections with Thurmaston and Leicester. It will assist in realising 
regeneration oppo rtunities for Thurmaston and north east Leicester and create a 
new focus for the community east of the railway line but maintain a physical 
sepa ration from Syston,  Barkby and Barkby Thorpe.  
It will provide a balanced mix of high -quality  housing as well as  diverse 
employment opportunities and an excellent network of green infrastructure which 
connects into existing areas of environmental value and  includes an extens ion of 
the Leicester Hamilton Green Wedge. It will have vibrant centres that provide a 
heart to the community and accessible community, shopping and business 
facilities.  
Growth will be planned in a sustainable manner and have regard to the protection 
and enhancement of valuable built and natural resources. Design will be locally 
distinctive and c reate attractive, usable and adaptable development that meets 
high environmental standards, is resilient to climate change and optimises 
opportu nities for sustaina ble transport choice. Development will deliver a place 
that is well connected with safe and a ttractive neighbourhoods that provide 
opportunities and benefits to existing communities and stimulate investment by 
new residents, visitors and  businesses.  
3.33.  The sc ale of the SUE requires a comprehensively planned scheme that takes the 
opportunity to create  distinct character areas that respond to the scale, layout and density 
of the existing neighbourhoods to ensure the new community relates appro priately to 
neighbo uring areas, including Thurmaston. This will mean a mixture of homes and 
densities to meet th e needs of our community and provide a high -quality environment.  
 
3.34.  We also expect an appropriate mix of business uses that reflect the needs of t he local 
economy an d maximises the opportunity to work locally. We want to ensure provision for 
new and developi ng business.  
 
3.35.  We want the SUE to connect new residents to employment, schools, shops, leisure 
facilities, open spaces and other community facili ties both within th e development and 
beyond. Whilst the SUE will include a range of uses to meet day to day need s, residents 
will also enjoy good connections with the Leicester city centre, Watermead Country Park Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  82 
 and the centres of Thurmaston, Syston and H amilton where addit ional services and 
facilities are available.  
 
3.36.  The topography rises from Hamilton and Thurmast on to Barkby Thorpe, with Barkby on 
a plateau to the north. We expect the design of the SUE to protect the identities of Syston, 
Barkby and Bark by Thorpe and respo nd to the landscape. This should include avoiding 
development on the higher ground and ensuri ng that important views are protected and, 
where appropriate, used to full effect.  
 
3.37.  There are features in the local area which are of historic value. The Roman Vi lla and 
deserted medieval village of Hamilton are Scheduled Monuments. Historic England has 
identified the Roman Villa as at risk from ploughing. The conservation areas of Barkby 
and Barkby Thorpe are also nearby and there is potential f or unscheduled arch aeology 
in the area. Although these historic features are outside the development site, we ex pect 
their wider setting to be carefully considered at the start of the design process. It will be 
particularly important to protect views of hi storic buildings an d spaces and consider the 
impact of access arrangements.  
 
3.38.  The site of the SUE is currently f armed. There are however two strategically important 
links in the wildlife networks along the Melton Brook and Barkby Brook which have the 
most biodiversity value in the area. The development will be expected to respect and 
enhance these two strategically important links in the wildlife networks supporting the 
Water Framework Directive and, where appropriate, create new wildlife networks. There 
are opportunities to create a network across the landscape along on the north -south and 
east-west axis. Activities  that have the potential to disrupt wildlife should be focused 
elsewhere in the site.  
 
3.39.  We want the SUE to be designed so that is it resilient to  climate change. Ou r evidence 
suggests that there is a need for appropriate run -off management and prevention of  any 
increase in flood risk downstream. This should include investigating opportunities to 
reduce flood risk associated with the Thurmaston Dyke  and reduce flood r isk in Syston 
and Barkby through storage options on the site.  Appropriate assessment of floo d risk 
was undertaken in support of the approved outline planning application for the SUE.  
 
3.40.  The SUE is well related to the River Soar and the Wa termead Country Par k. We want the 
development to complement and maximise the opportunity for access to this wide r Green 
Infrastructure Network.  
 
3.41.  We want to see the necessary physical and social infrastructure being delivered at the 
right time for the new c ommunity to foster sustainable lifestyles. Key infrastructure items 
and when they are expected to be delivered a re included in the Infrastructure Schedule 
in Appendix 3.  
 
3.42.  Where appropriate and necessary we will use compulsory purchase orders to deliver the  
SUE in line with t he vision.

Policy LUA2: North East of Leicester Sustainable Urban Extension  
 
Land is allocated to north east of Leicester, as shown on the Policies Map, as a sustainable 
urban extension to deliver a community of approximately 4,500  homes. The develop ment 
will make a significant contribution to meeting our housing needs by delivering 
approx imately 3,205 homes by 2037 and the remaining homes beyond the plan period.  
 
The sustainable urban extension will create a balanced community and a safe, high qualit y 
and accessible environment.  We will do this by:  
 
Housing  
 
• seeking 30% affordable homes t o meet local needs in accordance with Policy H4;  
• seeking a range of tenures, types and sizes of homes in accordance with Policy H1;  
• supporting ext ra care housing whe re it meets the needs of our ageing population in 
accordance with Policy H2; and  
• requiring a permanent site for gypsies and travellers of at least 4 pitches and a site of 
at least 4 plots for showpeople in accordance with Policy H9;  
 
Emp loyment  
• providing u p to 13 hectares of employment land to help meet our strategic and local 
employment needs in accordance with Policy E1;  
Chapter 3 Place  Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  84 
 Community Facilities  
• providing three primary schools and one secondary school, as appropriate to meet the 
need for sc hool pla ces, as foc al points for the new community, in locations that are 
accessible to both the new and existing communities;  
• providing one main accessible Local Centre delivered as part of an early phase of 
development that is accessible to both new and existing  communitie s, including as a 
minimum, local shops and a supermarket, small scale employment and a range of non -
retail and community facilities and services in accordance with Policy T1;  
• including opportunities, where appropriate, for additional sma ller cen tres where they 
complement the main centre, are well related to a school and meet community needs 
in accordance with Policy T1; and 
• supporting the provision of superfast broadband networks for all homes and 
businesses in accordance with Policy  E3; 
 
Transpo rt 
 
• requiri ng well connected street patterns and walkable neighbourhoods that provide

North of Birstall Susta inable Urban Extension  
 
3.43.  The North of Birstall Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) is allocated on l and north of 
Birstall, to the north of the A46, west of the A6, east of the Great Central Railway and to 
the south and west of the Broadnook  Spinney.   
 
3.44.  The site now benefits from a hybrid planning permission, which was granted in November 
2020 which secured outline permission for the SUE and the first phase of development. 
The planning permission is structured around a detailed Design and Acc ess Statement , 
parameter plans and a series of framework and strategy documents, which together guide 
how development will come forward by establishing a design framework.  The detail in 
these documents are secured by planning conditions and a legal agreem ent.  
 
3.45.  Delive ry of the SUE is a key part of delivering the plan’s overall spatial strategy.  The SUE  
is a commitment and is allocated in the local plan to provide a policy framework and 
certainty around delivery in the long term.  We will work with landowne rs, developer s, and  
other stakeholders to support the delivery of the SUE over the plan period.   
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  86 
 3.46.  This location provides an opportunity to create a new garden suburb to reflect the 
pioneering work started during the early part of the twentieth century alo ng the Great 
Centra l Railway. During the early part of the twentieth century homes were built to Garden 
Suburb principles along the route of the Great Central Railway. This is particularly evident 
at the Ridgeway in Rothley, part of the unfinished Rothley Garden Suburb , whic h was 
strongly influenced by Hampstead Garden Suburb. The plan included individually 
designed houses with good sized gardens.  
 
3.47.  Garden Suburbs are a development of the Garden City movement which sought to 
combine all the advantages of the  town by way of acc essibility and all the advantages of 
the country by way of environment without any of the disadvantages of either.  
 
• Garden Suburb principles include:  
• strong vision, leadership and community engagement;  
• land value capture for the benef it of the community ;  
• community ownership of land and long-term stewardship of assets;  
• high quality, imaginative design including homes with gardens;  
• mixed tenure homes which are affordable for ordinary people;  
• a strong l ocal jobs offer, with a variety of employment oppor tunities well related to 
homes;  
• generous green space linked to the wider countryside, well managed and high-quality  
gardens, treelined streets and open spaces with opportunities for residents to grow 
their own food;   
• access to strong l ocal, cultural, rec reational and shopping facilities in walkable 
neighbourhoods; and  
• integrated and accessible transport systems.  
 
3.48.  We expect the development to continue the tradition of Garden Suburb housing 
associated wit h the Great Central Railway.  
 
3.49.  We have prepared a vi sion for the North of Birstall Sustainable Urban Extension in 
partnership with the developers, Leicestershire County Council and Leicester City 
Council. The vision is outlined below:   
 
Vision for North of Birstall Sustainable Urban Exten sion 
The North of B irstall Sustainable Urban Extension will be known for its reputation 
as a Garden Suburb. It will combine the benefits of excellent access to Leicester 
for work and leisure with the benefits of the countryside such as green open space, 
fresh a ir, tranquilli ty and beautiful character. It will have been comprehensively 
planned to offer an excellent quality of life for its community. The range of homes, 
jobs, community facilities and shops will meet the day to day needs of the people 
who live  there. Community u ses will provide a focus of civic pride.  
 
3.50.  We expect the SUE to meet the employment needs of the new community in accordance 
with garden suburb principles. However, given the area’s excellent connections and 
relationship with Leicester th ere is also an oppo rtunity for new jobs that contribute to our 
wider employment requirements. We will carefully assess any employment development 
through the masterplanning process. In total, this direction of growth may deliver up to 15 
hectares of genera l emp loyment land a s part of this SUE.  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  87 
 3.51.  We want this new community to benefit from access to a wide range of services and 
facilities including schools, shops, new or expanded health facilities and community 
facilities such as a place of worship and a commu nity centre. We exp ect new facilities to 
be delivered as part of the centre within the development. This will reduce the need to 
travel for the people who live in the new homes and also increase access for the existing 
community.  
 
3.52.  We want the SUE to connec t new  residents to employment, schools, shops, leisure 
facilities, open spaces and other community facilities both within the development and 
beyond. Whilst the SUE will include a range of uses to meet day to day needs, they will 
also enjoy good connection s with the City Cen tre, Watermead Country Park, Charnwood 
Forest, Loughborough and Birstall District Centre where additional services and facilities 
are available.  
 
3.53.  We will expect the development to make the most of opportunities for high quality walking 
and cy cling routes a nd high frequency bus services. We want the new development to be 
accessible and connect the community to services and facilities, National Cycle Route 6 
and the Park and Ride facility in Birstall.  
 
3.54.  Whilst we will maximise the opportunit ies to walk and cyc le there will still be a need for 
new roads to serve the new development, provide links to the wider road network, support 
high frequency bus services and to avoid adverse impacts on neighbouring communities. 
This SUE will be next to the  A6 and A46 which a re the main transport corridors connecting 
Leicester to Loughborough and the area to the M1 motorway. We will work with our 
partners to understand the impact of more detailed development proposals on these 
corridors, the A46/A6 interchan ge an d the wider ne twork and develop a package of 
transport measures to support the development.  
 
3.55.  The SUE will provide a garden suburb, a high -quality environment, respecting and 
responding to the landscape, ecology and heritage in this area.  
 
3.56.  The topograp hy in  this location  is partially lower lying on either side of the A6 and rises 
towards the south west. Rothley is located to the north of this location, beyond the 
Broadnook Spinney, whilst Wanlip is to the south east of the A6/A46 roundabout. We 
expect t he de sign of the SU E to protect the identities of Rothley and Wanlip and respond 
to the landscape. This should include ensuring that important views are protected and, 
where appropriate, used to full effect.  
 
3.57.  There are a number of features in the local ar ea wh ich are of his toric value. The nearby 
Rothley Conservation Area and Rothley Park are home to historic buildings including the 
Grade I listed Rothley Court Hotel and Chapel. There is also potential for unscheduled 
archaeology in the area. Although thes e his toric features  are outside the development 
location, we expect their wider setting to be borne in mind at the start of the design 
process.  
 
3.58.  The site of the SUE is currently farmed. There are however two important wildlife corridors 
associated with th e Bro adnook Spinney  and the Great Central Railway which have the 
most biodiversity value in the area. The development will be expected to respect and 
enhance these wildlife corridors and, where appropriate, create new wildlife networks. 
This includes consi derin g opportunitie s to create a network across the landscape along 
on the north -south and east -west axis to help enhance connections to the River Soar. In Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  88 
 particular, activities that have the potential to disrupt wildlife should be focused elsewhere 
in the site. 
 
3.59.  The SUE is  well related to the River Soar and the Watermead Country Park. We want the 
development to complement and maximise the opportunity for access to this wider Green 
Infrastructure Network for recreation and leisure to the benefit of the exi sting  and new 
commu nities.  
 
3.60.  The eastern part of this location lies within a sand and gravel Minerals Consultation Area 
and there is potential for minerals resources to be sterilised. We will expect the policies 
in the Leicestershire Minerals Local Plan to  safeguard minerals  from sterilisation to be 
applied and further detailed investigation undertaken to assess the resources that could 
be affected and the necessary mitigation.  
 
 
 
Policy LUA3: North of Birstall Sustainable Urban Extension  
 
Land is allocate d to the north of B irstall as shown on the Policies Map as a sustainable 
urban extension to deliver a garden suburb of approximately 1,950 homes. The 
development will make a significant contribution to meeting our housing needs by 
delivering approximately 1,950 homes by 2037 .

Loughborough Urban Ce ntre 
 
Background  
 
3.61.  Loughborough dates back to the Saxon period and in 1221 was granted a Royal Charter 
by King Henry III to hold a weekly market and an annual fair. By 1600, the hosiery industry 
was starting to develop and Loughborough Canal opening in 1778  improved connections 
to London and Birmingham via the Grand Union Canal. The invention of steam operated 
machinery supported growth, attracting bleach and dye works and other industries 
including the John Taylor Bell Foundry, The Falc on Works (steam train s and cars), and 
the Empress Works (cranes).  Further expansion of the town took place with the Great 
Central Railway arriving in 1840.  Large mill and industrial buildings were located along 
the canal with many dye works across the to wn.  The textile and hosiery industries 
continued to thrive peaking in the 1960s and attracting many immigrants from India and 
Bangladesh.  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  91 
 3.62.  Loughborough Urban Centre is the largest settlement in the Borough located in the north 
west of Charnwood and provi ding the economic, cu ltural and social focus for a significant 
proportion of the Borough.  Together with Shepshed it provides the main focus for homes 
and jobs in the Borough. While Loughborough and Shepshed have separate identities 
and characteristics the y have close inter- relationships and function as a wider urban area.  
Loughborough is centrally positioned between the cities of Nottingham, Derby and 
Leicester at the very heart of the UK and the Midlands Engine: an area that is recognised 
as the ’engine room’ of the UK economy  
 
3.63.  The Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan identifies Loughborough as a 
market town and a location for managed growth with aspirations for continued town centre 
regeneration and better services. It also highlights that the town has a close relationship 
with the Leicestershire International Gateway, providing an attractive and accessible 
place for workers to live. It also recognises the contribution Loughborough makes to the 
wider Leicestershire economy, being the locatio n of two sites within  the Loughborough & 
Leicester Science & Innovation Enterprise Zone.   
 
3.64.  Loughborough is the largest market town in the County with a population of over 67,000 
and predicted to exceed 80,000 by the end of the plan period. Loughborough’s population 
is younger  and has a stronger skills and occupational profile than county, regional and 
even England averages. By 2043 its Old Age Dependency Ratio will still be below the 
England average as it is today. This youthful, skills -rich profile is epi tomised by the 
Univer sity with over 17,000 enrolled students and the College with over 10,000.    
 
3.65.  Loughborough has a range of employment opportunities and high order services that 
meet all of the day -to-day needs of residents and are accessible to the sur rounding area.   
Howev er, the town’s economy under performs and there is a need to level it up with other 
higher performing economies and balance the gap between its knowledge -based  sectors 
and low skills levels particularly in areas of deprivation.  
 
3.66.  Our visio n for Loughborough  town centre aims to capitalise on its rich history, to support 
the town centre, and for the town to be the main economic, social and cultural heart of 
the Bor ough.   
 
Economic Context   
 
3.67.  Half of the Borough’s jobs are located in Loughboro ugh and 53% of the  economically 
active people living in Loughborough work in the town, meaning the town is by far the 
most self -contained settlement in Charnwood.  Loughborough’ s economy is based on a 
range of service and manufacturing businesses. Whilst t here has been a na tional decline 
in heavy and electrical engineering industries, they continue to make an important 
contribution to the prosperity of Charnwood. In more recent y ears, as traditional industry 
has declined, Loughborough has become well known for science and in novation activity 
in areas such as advanced engineering, bioscience and pharmaceuticals.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  92 
 3.68.  Whilst the industrial areas are concentrated in the east of the town, one of the largest 
employers is Loughborough University, which is located on the western sid e of the town.  
The University is home to one of the largest science parks in the UK and is a significant 
driver of economic prosperity for the Borough and the wider area and its students make 
up approximately a fifth of the town’s popula tion.  Loughborough College is located in 
close proximity to the University and makes a similarly important cont ribution to the town’s 
education sector.  
 
3.69.  The multi -site Loughborough and Leicester Science and Innovation Enterprise Zone 
includes two sites i n Loughborough. Ch arnwood Campus is a Life Sciences Opportunity 
Zone offering state of the art laboratory space for research and development supporting 
bio-medical and pharmaceutical industries.  Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park 
(LSEP) is home to k nowledge -based bus inesses specialising in advanced engineering 
and manufacturing, high value research and develo pment, and energy and low carbon 
technology. It benefits from the close links it has with Loughborough University and is an 
important location f or the training an d development of elite athletes, research into sports 
science, and provides a base for a numbe r of sports governing bodies.  
 
3.70.  The 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation ranked two of the Lower Super Output Areas 
(LSOA) of the town in the to p 10% of England’s  most deprived areas. The Bell Foundry 
and Warwick Way LSOAs sit close to the town centre and have the highest deprivation 
statistics for the town. Other neighbouring LSOAs are also in the top (meaning worst) 
25% of the IMD data for the c ountry. Two Priori ty Neighbourhoods have been established 
in East and West Loughborough due to the high levels o f deprivation in these areas. The 
neighbourhoods variously suffer from low incomes, high unemployment, low educational 
attainment levels, poor h ealth and high cri me rates. The east of Loughborough also has 
pockets of derelict and neglected land.   
 
3.71.  The sha pe and pattern of the town centre has remained largely unchanged since the mid -
20th century.  The two shopping centres, The Carillon Court Shopp ing Centre (opened  in 
1972) and the more recent Rushes Centre (opened in 2002), together with a large food 
store  on Ashby Road and the adjacent Regent Place Retail Park reflect the national trend 
for retail development in the last 30 years, with purpose bu ilt units for nati onal retail 
chains.   
 
3.72.  More recently, many of the national chains have ceased trading or conso lidated their 
outlets in fewer locations in the country and Loughborough has not been immune to this. 
Nevertheless, there remain a high proporti on of independent traders in the town centre 
and the challenge will be to maintain this offer against the backdr op of increasing online 
trading and the town’s proximity to the three cities and motorway accessible centres like 
Fosse Park. Vacancy rates, esp ecially in seconda ry and peripheral areas, are high and 
we expect rates to increase post -Covid -19. The changing nature of retailing introduces 
the opportunity to strengthen the role of the town centre as a place where commercial 
activity can sit alongside community space an d housing; and to take advantage of its 
unique heritage, open spaces and tourism that the town  centre has to offer.  
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  93 
 3.73.  Loughborough’s strengths are clustered towards the outskirts of the town rather than in a 
vibrant centre. This means ke y components of Lo ughborough’s current success look 
outwards rather than inwards to the town. Loughborough University, the College and 
Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park are located very close to Junction 23 of the 
M1 motorway, an area which will als o host the large W est of Loughborough Sustainable 
Urban Extension (SUE). Charnwood Campus is j ust off the A6 on the road to East 
Midlands Airport. Loughborough Railway Station, only 70 minutes from London and 
therefore a potential attractor of inward inves tment, is 15 minut es walking distance east 
of the town centre, creating a long east -west prima ry spine from there through the town 
centre to the college, university, Science and Enterprise Park and SUE.  
 
3.74.  Loughborough benefits from a good walking and cyclin g network and ther e are good 
commercial bus services to Leicester and other centres.  The town is, however held back 
by structural weaknesses in its local internal connectivity, which will only be exacerbated 
as it grows outwards away from the centre. While  it is a walkable town with good 
accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists, there are key rou tes that are not attractive or 
safe. There are opportunities to improve connectivity, improve health benefits through 
more walking and cycling and improve the inc lusion of deprived  communities. Future 
regeneration projects will aim to enhance connectivity including improving walking and 
cycling routes  between the town centre and the University and College, and to create 
stronger links between the railway station, t he town centre and  the heritage quarter.  
 
3.75.  Loughborough Railway Station has direct and regular  services to Leicester, Nottingham, 
London and other destinations around the country. We are working with our partners to 
explore the potential to reopen the Syst on Chord to passen ger traffic, which would 
connect the Midland Mainline to the Birmingham/ Sta nstead Line. This would connect 
Melton to Nottingham and could provide a direct connection between Loughborough and 
Cambridge, two renowned centres for research.  
 
3.76.  Loughborough als o benefits from good access to the local and strategic road network. 
The M1 motorway lies to the west and improvements to the capacity of Junction 23 and 
the A512 as part of our growth at Shepshed and Loughborough has recently been 
comple ted. However, ther e is congestion at peak hours on key routes in the town 
including the A6 and  along Epinal Way.    
 
Environmental Context  
 
Landscape  
 
3.77.  The western part of the town lies within Charnwood Forest landscape character area 
which provides a woo ded landscape sett ing to the town, part of its local distinctiveness.  
The main routes to the west of the town provide gateways to the Charnwood Forest 
Regional Park.  The eastern area of Loughborough sits within the Soar Valley landscape 
character area, t he flat wide flood plain has significantly constrained the growth of the town 
to the east and therefore future projects to address flood risk in Loughborough will be 
supported.   There is a sm all area of land between Loughborough and Shepshed that lies 
within the wider Langl ey Lowlands character area. Although it adjoins other landscape 
character areas around Loughborough , it shows transition featu res of its neighbouring 
landscapes. These landscape character areas are an important part of the character and 
local distinctivene ss of Loughborough and its setting.    Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  94 
  
3.78.  Many locations allocated for new development on the edge of Loughborough are situated 
on sites with sloping topography and are prominent in views from a variety of locations in 
surrounding countrysi de, including the Charnwood Forest.  Screening focussed on the 
edge of such sites is unlikely to successfully integrate development into its lan dscape 
setting, as more central parts of new development may still be conspicuous.  The 
allowance for significan t planted areas wh ich allows trees with large canopies to mature 
is likely to be a more successful long-term solution to integrating new develop ment into 
the landscape.  This will require careful attention not just to design and layout, but to long 
term ma nagement and maint enance of public open spaces  
 
Biodiversity  
 
3.79.  The way Loughborough grows needs to take account of the strategically important natural 
resources of the Charnwood Forest to the south west along with the River Soar/Grand 
Union Canal to east and it needs to ma intain the important Green Infrastructure  
connections between them.  The gaps between Loughborough and surrounding 
settlements  are narrowing, and the diagram shows strategically important links in the 
wildlife networks to the south and to  the north of Loug hborough which require protection 
and enhancement.  
 
3.80.  Loughborough, whilst predominantly urban in character, contains a variety  of green 
spaces that provide places for recreation and also for wildlife.  Within the built-up area to 
the west  there are the anc ient woodlands of Holywell and Burleigh Woods.  These sites 
are part of an ecological network providing stepping stones for wi ldlife and contribute to 
the quality of place for local residents.  The need for development has been balanced 
with the impact upo n wildlife habitats and appropriate mitigation is factored into the 
capacity of sites.    
 
Watercourses  
 
3.81.  Several tributaries t o the Soar also run through Loughborough. They include Black Brook 
(also a Local Wildlife Site), Burleigh Brook and Wood Brook. Th ese continue to support 
a range of wildlife despite being heavily canalised and culverted in some sections. Where 
they form pa rt of managed open space they contribute significantly to the public realm. 
These watercourses are a valuable en vironmental and re creation asset to the town 
however, they require careful management to preserve their quality and value, and to 
manage flood r isk.  The Woodbrook runs through the town centre, partly in a culvert and 
flows near a number of allocated sites . Our Level 2 Stra tegic Flood Risk Assessment 
states that these sites are developable but detailed consideration would need to be given 
to the i mpact of both fluvial and surface water flood risk as part of a detailed local flood 
risk assessment. Developers  should also ensur e that they enter meaningful engagement 
with the Environment Agency at pre -application stage to understand the most up to date  
assessment and the types of mitigation measures that will be required including any 
limitations on development.

 Settlement I dentity  
 
3.82.  Quorn, Hathern and Woodthorpe  are settlements in close proximity to Loughborough 
where communities have increasingly been concerned about their identities as separate 
places. We have identified Areas of Local Separation south and  north of Loughbor ough 
to maintain the predominantly ope n and undeveloped character of the gaps  between 
Loughborough, Hathern and Quorn.  In planning for site HA16 South of Loughborough  it 
will be important to ensure that Woodthorpe retains its immediate l andscape setting i n 
order to maintain the historical vis ual association that the hamlet has with agriculture.   
 
Open Spaces 
 
3.83.  There is a good network of open spaces in Loughborough including parks and gardens 
and amenity green space and the town benefits f rom having the Cha rnwood Forest and 
River Soar corridor within a short walk from the urban edge.  Our evidence tells us that 
the urban nature of some Loughborough wards means that demand for space is 
significantly higher than elsewhere in the district due to the population particularly in 
Garendon and Hastings Wards. In delivering our development strategy, opportunities to 
provid e new recreational facilities will be sought and where this is not possible, we will 
seek to maximise the quality of existing site s and improving th eir accessibility.  
 
Heritage  
 
3.84.  There are 90 Listed Buildings, 2 Ancient Monuments and 8 conservation areas in 
Loughborough.  Garendon Park, to the west of the town, is a Registered Park and Garden 
containing many historical features incl uding the Triumpha l Arch (Grade I) and the 
Temple of Venus (Grade II*). The historic environment in Loughborough is essential in 
creating a distinctive place in which to live and work and needs to be safeguarded from 
inappropriate development.  It is impor tant that growth i n Loughborough is managed 
carefully to strike a positive balance between safeguarding the natural and built 
environment and ensuring the future prosperity of the town.  
 
Air Quality  
 
3.85.  There are two Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA) in Lo ughborough, the 
Loughborough AQMA in the town centre focused along A6 Derby Road and A512 Ashby 
Road (road traffic emissions) and the Great Central Railway AQMA (steam train 
emissions). There are two site allocations close to the Loughborough AQMA at 
Devon shire Square and B axter Gate, which may have the potential to impact on air quality 
in and around the town centre.   These loca tions are also within the boundary of the 
Loughborough East Priority Neighbourhood.  We will therefore require sustainable 
transpo rt modes to be pri oritised in the planning for these developments to minimise the 
impact on air quality in these areas.   
 
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  96 
 Development Strategy for Loughborough  
 
Homes and Jobs  
 
3.86.  Our development strategy directs development to Loughborough as the loc ation in 
Charnwood  which provides the best access to jobs, services, infrastructure and 
sustainable travel options.  The scale of development directed to Loughborough reflects 
our commi tment to the town as the main economic, social and cultural centre of t he 
Borough whilst recognising the need to respond to the environmental context of the town.    
 
3.87.  Most of the housing growth in Loughborough is allocated to the West of Loughborough 
Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE).  Our strategy identifies Loughborough for  urban 
intensifica tion and concentration and allocates a further 2,242  new homes including a 
mixture of urban and gr eenfield sites of varying sizes.  Sites have been identified in and 
close to the town centre to assist with our ambition to make the best us e of redundant 
land and buildings, regenerate the public realm and to support its social and economic 
role. The grow th directed to the edge of Loughborough takes account of landscape 
constraints, notably Charnwood Forest and settlement identity, and the tr ansport and 
educat ion infrastructure required to support growth. Our strategy includes provision for a 
new primary s chool to the south of Loughborough to support growth and developments 
will be expected to contribute towards the costs of education needs ar ising from their 
developments.  
 
3.88.  To support Loughborough’s role as the economic focus for the Borough we will meet th e 
employment needs of the town by delivering 16 hectares of employment land at the West 
of Loughborough Sustainable Urban Extension and a fu rther 9 hectares o f employment 
land at Dishley Grange.  We will support the Council’s vision for Loughborough to be 
recognised for its role in the region’s knowledge -based economy with the Loughborough 
Science and Enterprise Park and Loughborough Universit y at the heart of 
Loughborough’s brand as a centre for excellence.  Our strategy allocates 73 hectares of 
land adjac ent to the University for the continued long -term expansion of Loughborough 
Science and Enterprise Park for knowledge -based businesses.   
 
3.89.  We will continue to  work with our partners at Loughborough University and Loughborough 
College to further develop lea rning, creativity and innovation and assist in the 
commercialisation of research. This includes supporting the growth of Loughborough 
Univer sity by providing for the expansion of the University campus and providing 
opportunities which encourage our graduat es to remain employed or set up their own 
business within the Borough and to deliver support for entrepreneurship in the community.  
 
3.90.  In par allel we will work  with the promoters of Charnwood Campus to capitalise upon the 
legacy of world class buildings and  laboratories vacated by a major research 
establishment to regenerate the facility as a centre for life sciences and biomedical 
research and  development. This  will consolidate the role of Loughborough as a centre for 
high technology and knowledge -based bus inesses.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  97 
 Town Centre and Regeneration  
 
3.91.  The continued vitality and viability of Loughborough town centre is key to our regeneration 
strategy for the town .  Loughborough’s town centre includes a historic Market Place, a 
variety of shops and services bu t faces competition from larger centres like Leicester, 
Nottingham and Derby, along with new models of internet based shopping and other 
forms of online comme rce. 
 
3.92.  The area to the east of the town centre is identified as Loughborough’s Industrial Heritage 
Quarter.  Many of the former industrial premises are now underused or in a poor state of 
repair offering an opportunity for the delivery of new homes and busi nesses.  
Regeneration opportunities including the redevelopment of redundant and underused 
land an d property will be supported where they retain and enhance the remaining heritage 
assets.   
 
3.93.  The Tourism Blueprint for Charnwood recognises the tourism potent ial of our industrial 
past and its key heritage attractions such as the Great Central Railway, the  Grand Union 
Canal and Taylor’s Bell Foundry and Museum and the opportunity for a heritage trail is 
being investigated.  
 
3.94.  The Great Central Railway is an esta blished heritage railway that runs between its main 
base in Loughborough and Birstall and is expan ding its successful events programme 
and on-site offer.  We will support development and investment in the infrastructure 
necessary to enhan ce the railway’s appeal as a major tourism destination.     
 
3.95.  The River Soar and Grand Union Canal Partnership’s visi on for the delivery of 
improvements to the canal corridor will be supported in association with the regeneration 
of the Loughborough Industr ial Heritage Quart er and the opportunities for enhanced 
linkages between the water way and the town centre.  
 
3.96.  The Lo ughborough Bell Foundry Trust is restoring key parts of the historic Grade II* Listed 
Taylor’s Bell Foundry to enhance the commercial operat ion and attract mo re visitors.    
 
3.97.  The former landfill site at Allsopps Lane is currently neglected and could provide a major 
informal recreational area for the local community. We want to see it reclaimed for new 
green space and have identified it as a pr iority project in our Open Spaces S trategy.   
 
3.98.  Nottingham Road provides a direct route between the Loughborough Railway Station and 
the town centre and passes close to these heritage assets. There have been recent 
improvements to the public realm around th e station; however , these have not been 
continued along Nottingham Road. We will encourage and support improvements to the 
public realm which enhances the walking and cycling experience from the station and link 
these to the heritage trail and wider connec tivity improvement s within Loughbor ough.   
 
3.99.  The Council will continue to work with partners and seek opportunities for funding to 
support our regeneration priorities for Loughborough. Several regeneration projects 
relating to the town centre have been init iated in order to enhance the econo mic, social 
and environmental prospects of the town. Proposals that support the aims of these and 
other regeneration projects will be supported, including:  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  98 
 • improving the public realm including the retail centre, heritag e assets, key open  
spaces and to make it is easier for people to move between the railway station, the 
town centre and the education sector/enterprise park to the west of the town;   
• unlocking the town’s potential in terms of careers, enterprise, community  projects and 
key development sites;  
• specific public realm projects such as the Bedford Square Gateway; Nottingham 
Road, the Lanes and Links and Parish Green;  
• culture and heritage projects su ch as Loughborough Bell Foundry; the Great Central 
Railway and the Riverside Rege neration; and  
• projects to address flood risk in Loughborough including a flood defence scheme for 
the town centre which in turn would help to unlock development sites within the town 
that are currently constrained by flood risk.  
 
3.100.  The lon ger-term effects o f the Covid -19 pandemic are unknown, but it is anticipated that 
it will accelerate trends for more shopping to be carried out online and may alter how 
people use town centres.   Given these uncertainties, a more flexible and innovative 
approach to planning for Loughborough town centre is likely to be needed if our vision 
and objectives for the town centre are to be achieved.  Uses which provide a reason for 
people to visit, spen d time and which support economic activity in Loughborough town  
centre will be en couraged.  
 
3.101.  The Council’s spatial vision expressed through the Loughborough Town Centre 
Masterplan is that:  
 
Loughborough Town Centre Masterplan Vision  
 
Loughborough Town Centre will be a successful and vibrant place with a strong 
identi ty that stems from  its role as  a market town and home to Loughborough 
University. It will be an attractive destination with a diverse retail and leisure offer, 
a mix of housing and a wide range of employment opportunities.   
 
The town will be easy to access  with a well -conne cted network  of vehicular and 
pedestrian routes. Activity in the town will be supported by a range of events and 
innovative marketing, business and promotional strategies that will make 
Loughborough a great place to be.   
 
3.102.  The Masterplan i dentifies opportun ity sites th at are currently under -utilised and offer 
potential for development to strengthen the town centre offer and improve the townscape 
and sense of space.   
 
1. Baxter Gate;   
2. Aumberry Gap;   
3. Devonshire Square;   
4. Sainsbury’s store on Ashby Road; and   
5. Loughborough University School of Art and Design building.   
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  99 
 3.103.  The site at Baxter Gate, which is located to the south of the Baxter Gate leisure complex 
and to the north of Pinfold Gate, was the only one of the five sites identified as s uitable 
for signif icant retail development. Having regard to the amount of retail development that 
is needed in the plan period, the network of centres and the strengths and weaknesses 
of Loughborough town centre, the Baxter Gate site is considered to be t he most 
appropriat e site for accommodating the Borough’s need for retail floorspace. A mixed -
use scheme on this site will be supported where this assists the vitality and viability of 
Loughborough town centre. The Council will be flexible in its approach t o town centre 
uses  on this site, given the uncertainties that might arise in a post Covid -19 world.   
 
3.104.  Following on from the successful redevelopment of Aumberry Gap, we will support the 
redevelopment of the other opportunity sites and any other town centr e developments, 
where this supports the vitality and viability of the town centre and responds to the 
Loughborough Town Centre Masterplan.    
 
3.105.  We are also working with our partners to secure a Loughborough Town Deal Scheme 
with a shared vision that ‘ Loughb orough will be a g reat place to live, learn, work, and grow 
– offering residents, communities, businesses, the university and college, opportunities 
to participate fully in the town’s development. It will be digitally, culturally and physically 
connected, providing industri es for the future, cherishing its heritage, with healthy 
neighbourhoods and opportunities for all ’. 
 
3.106.  The Loughborough Town Deal Board includes the Borough Council, Loughborough 
University, Loughborough College, Love Loughborough, Leiceste rshire County Coun cil, 
the Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership, Charnwood Together Economy 
and Skills G roup, local businesses and the Loughborough MP.   The Board have identified 
projects that will bring about social and economic improvemen ts to the town.  T he Town 
Deal Investment Plan proposes a range of projects which  will: 
 
• improve skills levels to boost job prospects;  
• redefine the town centre to ensure it is well -used and vibrant for the future;  
• improve links between the east and west si des of town, from the railway station 
through to the town centre through to the Loughboro ugh Science and Enterprise Park;  
• improve flood defences for the town;  
• reduce carbon emissions by encouraging more walking and cycling;  
• unlock areas prime for developme nt for housing, le isure and commercial use;  
• build on Loughborough University's reputation  as a centre for innovation, research 
and sport;  
• showcase the town's unique heritage to attract more visitors to the area by supporting 
Taylor's Bell Foundry, Great Ce ntral Railway and improving the canal environment; 
and  
• improve job prospects and life sk ills for 5,000 young people from disadvantaged 
background.  
 
3.107.  The Towns Fund has already provided £750,000 in forward funding to deliver the   Skills 
and Enterprise Hub  in the town centr e. 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  100 
 3.108.  We will also continue to work closely with the Loughborough Town Team and the Love 
Loughborough Business Improvement District to support smaller interventions which can 
deliver local and immediate change at relatively low cost, such  as themed events,  pop up 
shops, public realm interventions and support for existing comm unity projects.   
 
3.109.  Public realm improvements are underway in the town centre and will be completed within 
the plan period.  We will support the implementation of conti nued improvements including 
those identified through the development of the Loughborough Lanes Strategy.  This aims 
to improve the overall experience of the town centre for people and enhance retail loops 
to increase footfall for businesses by encouraging improvements to th e large number of 
lanes and alleyways that play an essential role in li nking many of the town’s important 
destinations.   Other public realm projects that enhance the public realm of the town centre 
and provide better linkages between it a nd the knowledge -based sector to the west of the 
town, therefore broadening resident acce ss to this growing employment sector, will be 
supported.   
 
3.110.  We also recognise that encouraging people to live in the town centre and supporting 
flexible workspaces/off ices and commercia l uses beyond the traditional retail offer, will 
support and complement Loughborough’s vitality and viability.  
 
District Centres  
 
3.111.  Loughborough has two District Centres at Gorse Covert and Shelthorpe and a Local 
Centre at Sharpley Road.  These District and  Local Centres support their local 
communities and are well -used. We want these centres to continue to provide for day to 
day needs of their local communities and we will support development for town centre 
uses that is consistent with th eir position in ou r town centre hierarchy.  
 
Sustainable Travel   
 
3.112.  Car usage is much lower in Loughborough than other parts of the Borough a nd there is 
an opportunity to encourage this further and increase the number of journeys made by 
sustainable transpo rt modes.  There i s a comprehensive cycling and walking network to 
the west of the town centre providing routes from the edge of the town, p ast the University 
to the town centre.  
 
3.113.  We will work with our local partners to improve connectivity across the tow n and will 
produce  a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan for Loughborough and set out 
proposals for a public realm scheme that lin ks the railway station to the town centre and 
the University, making the most of our unique heritage.  
 
3.114.  Making areas,  such as Loughboro ugh town centre, more accessible by foot and bicycle 
will also help to revitalise and further improve our local economy an d regenerate the 
physical fabric of the town and its heritage assets. We will see k to improve the 
connectivity of Lo ughborough and exp loit the opportunities that new developments and 
transport projects will provide to encourage sustainable forms of transpo rt.  The busy road 
network and breadth of alternatives to the private car provide a real opportunity to shift 
transp ort to walking, cy cling and public transport in Loughborough.    
 
  
Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  102 
 Policy LUC1: Loughborough Urban Centre  
 
We will support Loughborough Urban Centre in its role as the main economic, social and 
cultural heart of the Borough.  We will do this by suppor ting development t hat:  
 
• delivers allocations in accordance with Policy DS3 or sustainable development that is 
in accordance with the pattern of development outlined in Policy DS1 and which 
supports our vision and objectives including making effective use of land;   
• ensures  the timely and coordinated delivery of infrastructure to support sustainable 
communities, in accordance with Policy INF1 ;  
• improves connectivity and accessibility within Loughborough and to surrounding 
settlements, particularly by walkin g, cycling and pub lic transport, in accordance with 
Policy CC5;   
• provides urban form which integrates with the w ider landscape setting and responds 
positively to the relevant local landscape character area of Charnwood Forest, Soar 
Valley or Langley Lowlan ds, in accordance with Policy EV1 ;   
• protects the predominantly open and undeveloped character of Areas of Local  
Separation in accordance with Policy EV3 ;  
• protects and enhances the Charnwood Forest and River Soar and the strategically 
important links in the wildlife networ ks which connect them,  in accordance with Policy 
EV6; 
• supports measures to mitigate flood risk including contributions towards flood 
alleviation works in the wider catchment of the Woodbrook or other water courses 
flowing through or adjac ent to the town ; 
• secures the redevelopment of the opportunity sites, fol lowing the design principles set 
out in the Loughborough Town Centre Masterplan, unless it can be clearly 
demonstrated that an alternative high -quality  design solution is needed to ens ure a 
viable schem e; and   
• conserves and enhances the heritage and tourism value of Loughborough’s Industrial 
Heritage Quarter and its heritage assets, including the Great Central Railway, Grand 
Union Canal and Taylor’s Bell Foundry, in accordance with Poli cy EV8 including:   
 
• prop osals to reconnect the northern and southern sections of the Great Central 
Railway and associated infrastructure;   
• requiring development adjacent to the Grand Union Canal to provide an active 
waterfront with public access; and   
• supporting proposal s that enhance the landscape and biodiversity value of the 
former Allsopps Lane refuse tip and provide for public access.   
 
Loughborough Town Centre   
 
We will make a significant contribution to the regeneration and continued vitality and  
viability  of Loug hborough by supporting and encouraging retail, leisure, office, 
professional services and other town centre development in the Town Centre.  
 
Non main town centre uses, including homes, will be supported where they form part of a 
mix of us es that pr ovide ac tivity throughout the day and evening and complement the main 
retail attractions of the town centre.    
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  103 
 We will support development in the Town Centre that:  
 
• reinforces and enhances the compact, legible and walkable character of Loughboro ugh 
town centre ma intaining the Market Place at its heart;   
• maintains continuous street frontage activity within the Primary Shopping Area;   
• makes a significant improvement t o the character and appearance of Loughborough 
town centre, particularly at poin ts of arrival into  the town centre;   
• makes a significant improvement to pedestrian and cycle connections within the town 
centre, including to surrounding public open spaces;   
• provides improvements to the infrastructure for markets and events; and   
• is de signed to address public safety and wider security, particularly in areas where 
large numbers of people congregate.   
 
Our additional need for non -food retail floor space will be met as part of a mixed -use 
development of allocation HA22 at Baxter Gate /Pinf old Gate.  We requ ire a coordinated 
and integrated approach to the redevelopment of this key opportunity site that:   
 
• includes a retail parade, major new car park and housing  and health centre as 
necessary in consultation with the Clinical Commissioni ng Gr oup;   
• follows the  design principles set out in the Loughborough Town Centre Masterplan 
unless it can be clearly demonstrated that an alternative high -quality  design solution is 
needed to ensure a viable scheme;   
• takes account of the Air Quality Mana gemen t Area; and  
• prior itises sustainable modes of transport.    
 
Loughborough Urban Centre Strategic Allocations   
 
3.115.  We have prepared a vision for the West of Loughborough Sustainable Urban Extension 
and Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park in partnership wit h the developers, 
landowners and Leicestershire County Council. The vision is outlined below:  
 
A Vision for th e West of Loughborough Sustainable Urban Extension and 
Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park  
 
The West of Loughborough sustainable urban extens ion and Science & Enterprise 
Park will provide the opportunity to put local connectivity at the centre of the vision 
for growth in the north of the Borough. Connectivity to employment, services and 
open spac e for the benefit of new and existing residents, reducing the need to 
travel by car.  
 
It will create a connected urban system of Loughborough and Shepshed with a 
historic park at the centre. Whilst the separate identities of the towns will remain, 
there w ill be an improved level of connectivity to and b etween Loughboroug h and 
Shepshed.  
 
There will be a network of walking and cycling routes and bus services providing 
excellent connectivity to facilities, services and open spaces.  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  104 
 The sustainable urban ext ension will be a new community with its own chara cter. 
It will be o f mixed density and provide a variety of homes to meet the needs of all 
sections of the community including older people. The Local Centre will be a 
vibrant place day and night, providing a  heart to the community.  
 
The sustainable urban e xtension and Scien ce and Enterprise Park will provide 
residents with a variety of employment opportunities. There will be excellent links 
between employment areas north east of Loughborough, within the susta inable 
urban extension and at the University and Science & Enterpri se Park. The Science 
& Enterprise Park will support the needs and aspirations of the University for 
growth, whilst reinforcing the knowledge -based  focus of Loughborough.  
 
There will be a resilient biodiversity network that links Charnwood  Forest to the 
River Soar Valley. Existing ecological sites and wildlife corridors such as the Black 
Brook and Burleigh Brook will be enhanced, and ecological sites will be 
reconnected.  
 
Garendon Registered Park and Garden will be opened up for public acce ss and the 
monuments and parkland will be restored and managed for the benefit of our 
community.  
 
The design of the development west of Loughborough, will be strongly informed 
by the uniqu e local character and the historic setting provided by Charnwood 
Forest and the Garen don Registered Park and Garden. Urban design of the 
development in this growth area will weave the local style into the development as 
well as introduce new innovative and  creative solutions . 
 
West of Loughborough Sustainable Urban Extens ion 
 
3.116.  The West of L oughborough Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) is allocated on land to 
the west of Loughborough, north of Garendon Registered Park and Garden and west of 
the A6 to the north of the town.   
 
3.117.  The site benefits from planning permission grante d in 2018 which se cured outline 
permission for the SUE.  The planning permission is structured around a detailed Design 
and Access Statement, parameter plans and a series of framework and strategy 
documents, which together guide how development will come f orwar d by establis hing a 
design framework.  The detail in these documents are secured by planning conditions 
and a legal agreement.  
 
3.118.  Delivery of the SUE is a key part of delivering the plan’s overall spatial strategy.  The site 
is a commitment and is allo cated  in the local  plan to provide a policy framework and 
certainty around delivery in the long term.  We will work with landowners, developers, and 
other stakeholders to support the delivery of the SUE over the plan period.  
 
3.119.  The scale of the SUE requires a com prehensively planned scheme that takes the 
opportunity to create distinct character areas that respond to the scale, layout and density 
of the existing neighbourhood to ensure the new community becomes a part of 
Loughborough. This will mean a mixture of ho mes and densi ties to meet the needs of our 
residents and provide a high-quality  environment.  Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  105 
 3.120.  We expect the SUE to include employment development so that people living in the 
development and nearby have the opportunity to live close to work as part of  our plans to 
reduce commuting.  
 
3.121.  An essential part of a sustainable community is to have a centre that acts as a focal point 
for the community providing goods and services close to where people live. Our evidence 
suggests that the development should includ e one new Local Ce ntre that provi des a 
mixture of small -scale  employment and local shops, a supermarket and a range of non -
retail services such as a cafe or a public house. The scale of ‘town centre’ uses within the 
new Local Centre should support our stra tegy for the regen eration of Loug hborough Town 
Centre and Shepshed District Centre and to protect the vitality and viability of surrounding 
centres, whilst also responding to the lack of provision for food shopping in the west of 
Loughborough.  
 
3.122.  To ensure that people living  in this new co mmunity have services close to where they live 
it may be appropriate to have an additional smaller centre that complements the main 
centre. We expect any smaller centre to be well related to the school to provide a focus 
for the community an d reduce the need to travel by car.  
 
3.123.  We want the SUE to connect the new residents to employment, schools, shops, leisure 
facilities, open spaces and other community facilities both within the development and 
beyond. Whilst the SUE will in clude a range of u ses to meet day  to day needs, they will 
also enjoy good connections with Loughborough town centre along with Shepshed and 
Gorse Covert District Centres where additional services and facilities are available.  
 
3.124.  We will expect the SUE to ma ke the most of opp ortunities for high quality walking and 
cycling routes and high frequency bus services. We want the SUE to be accessible and 
connect the community to services and facilities, Loughborough Railway Station, 
Charnwood Forest and provide safe  routes across the  M1 motorway in  support of our 
regeneration priority for Shepshed District Centre.  
 
3.125.  Whilst we will maximise the opportunities to walk and cycle there will still be a need for 
new roads to serve the new development, provide links to the wi der road network, support 
high fr equency bus services and to avoid adverse impacts on neighbouring communities. 
The SUE will deliver a new strategic distributor road, from the A512 to the A6 north of 
Loughborough. This will run through Garendon Registered Park and Garden, a ligned 
closely with the M1 motorway. Through the Park, this will have the character of an estate 
road and be designed sympathetically to help reduce impact on the heritage assets. This 
strategic distributor road will include a link to Hat hern Road which co nnects the 
deve lopment to Shepshed and Hathern.  
 
3.126.  The duelling of the A512 together with improvements to Junction 23 of M1 have already 
been undertaken in anticipation of additional traffic generated by the development.  
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  106 
 3.127.  The SUE will a lso include a new road designed to function as a high street for the 
development which will be a focus for community and commercial uses. A high-quality  
environment respecting and responding to the landscape, ecology and heritage in this 
area will also be delivered in assoc iation with the development.  
 
3.128.  The topography in this location rises from the site southwards up to the Temple of Venus 
in the Registered Park and Garden and then falls into a shallow bowl before ascending 
once again northwa rds towards a second the ridgeli ne located to the south of Hathern. 
We expect the design of the SUE to protect the identities of Hathern and Shepshed and 
respond to the landscape including the relationship the site has with Charnwood Forest. 
This should in clude avoiding  development on th e ridgeline south of Hathern and ensuring 
that important views are protected and, where appropriate, used to full effect.  
 
3.129.  The SUE is located to the north of Garendon Registered Park and Garden. The Park 
includes the remain s of a Cistercian Abbey and Mans ion, with fishpond and mound which 
is a scheduled monument. It also includes a Grade I listed building called the Triumphal 
Arch, a Grade II* listed building called the Temple of Venus and other Grade II listed 
buildings. Historic England  has registered th e park and garden because of its importance 
and identifies the registered park, Triumphal Arch and Temple of Venus as being at risk 
due to their condition, maintenance and uncertain future. There is also potential for 
unsche duled archaeol ogy in the area.  
 
3.130.  The development provides the opportunity to restore the Park and Garden and its 
monuments and provide appropriate public access for the first time, securing its long-term 
future. We expect these opportunities, together with  careful desig n, to inform a 
comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impact of development on the Park.   
 
3.131.  The area includes  strategically important links in the wildlife network which are part of the 
ecology network connecting the Charnwood Forest to the So ar Valley. The se corridors 
include the Black Brook, Hathern Drive, a series of woodlands along the western edge of 
Loughborough, a disused railway line and connect to the Hermitage Local Wildlife Site.  
 
3.132.  We expect the development to respect and enhance these strategical ly important links  in 
the wildlife network for their important biodiversity value and, where appropriate, create 
new wildlife networks. There are opportunities to create a network across the landscape 
along the north -south and west -east axes. There is an o pportunity to re -connect isolated 
ecological assets, such as the Site of Special Scientific Interest at Oakley Wood. Activities 
that have the potential to disrupt wildlife should be focused elsewhere in the site.  
 
3.133.  The M1 motorway r uns along the site’s west ern boundary. We e xpect the layout and 
design of the site to mitigate the impacts of noise and pollution associated with the M1 
motorway.  
 
3.134.  The SUE will provide appropriate public access to Garendon Registered Park and 
Garden. This will provide a formal par k, including recre ation and leisure space in keeping 
with the character of the historic park

to inform detailed planning applications or reserved matters applications.  
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  110 
 Loughborough  and Science  and Enterprise  Park  
 
3.135.  The teaching and research expertise of Loughborough University is of regional and 
national importance, particularly in sports sciences and performance. The University is 
the Borough’s largest employer, with more than 3,500 staf f, and 17,0 00 students.  
 
3.136.  The Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park, located alongside the University, is one 
of the largest science parks in the UK with a diverse range of potentially high growth 
businesses within the knowledge -based and high technology  manufactur ing sectors.  The 
initial phases of the Science and Enterprise Park has been successful and makes a 
significant contribution to our economy. On that basis the allocated extension to the 
Science and Enterprise Park is carried forward from our Cor e Strategy to support its 
continued expansion and enable long term planning of the Science and Enterprise Park 
beyond the plan period to recognise its lasting importance to the wider regional economy.  
 
3.137.  The Science and Enterprise Park remains central to our vision fo r Charnwood and it s 
extension will help achieve a strong, responsive and competitive economy in the Borough. 
Exploiting the full commercial and research potential of the University is a priori ty we 
share with our partners, including the University, the Lei cester and Leicest ershire 
Enterprise Partnership and Leicestershire County Council.  
 
3.138.  The importance of the Science and Enterprise Park to not only Charnwood, but also the 
wider region, is highlighted by its inclusion as one of three sites within the Loughb orough 
and Leicest er Science and Innovation Enterprise Zone designated in April 2017. The 
dynamic innovation community, a world -class research base and graduate supply along 
with the offer  of financial incentives and the priority partnership working availa ble will help 
drive job creation and business growth.  
 
3.139.  We have identified the best strategy to enable high technology manufacturing and 
knowledge -based businesses alongside the University’ s core business needs. We will 
work with our partners to sustain the  momentum of that development to drive the delivery 
of the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park.  This will provide a positive framework 
for inward investment and business interest wit hin and beyond the plan period.  
 
3.140.  Our evidence suggests that future d emand for space on  the Science and Enterprise Park 
is expected to come from four main sources and we have identified a demand for space 
from:  
• start- ups and very small companies requiring s mall units and shared facilities in a 
multi- occupancy facility;  
• existing technology -based firms, predominantly drawn from the Derby/Nottingham 
and Leicester triangle;  
• larger corporate companies with research and development related projects from 
other part s of the UK and abroad requiring a site to develop their own facilit ies; and  
• major new  University -related research and development projects which cannot easily 
be accommodated in the existing University facilities.  
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  111 
 3.141.  The extension of the Loughborough Scie nce and Enterprise Park complements the new 
homes and local jobs in the adjoining SUE and makes the best use of new and existing 
infrastructure. The Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park will be expected to 
contribute towards infrastructure in conjuncti on with the SUE . 
 
Business and Innovation  
 
3.142.  We do not want to see the  Loughborough Scie nce and Enterprise Park used for general 
industrial development or warehouses.  The Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park 
concept in based on providing land for businesses within the knowledge -based sector. 
Knowledge -based businesses a re those which are  based on their intensive use of 
technology and/or human capital.  While most businesses are dependent in some way 
on knowledge as inputs, knowledge -based businesses are particularly dependent on 
knowledge and tec hnology to generate reven ue, they rely on t he creation, evaluation and 
trading of knowledge. These types of businesses include high and medium technology 
manufacturing, communications technology, financial and professional services, creative 
and cultural i ndustries and employment in education and h ealth care.  We do not want to 
see the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park used for general industrial 
development or warehouses.   
 
Knowledge Based Sector  
 
“The knowledge -based  economy” is an expression coine d to describe trends in 
advanced economies towards greater dependence on knowledge, information and 
high skill levels, and the increasing need for ready access to all of these by the 
business and public sectors. (OECD Definition)  
 
3.143.  However, we want to continue the relationship betw een business innov ation and learning. 
For that reason, the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park makes provision for 
University uses, including teaching and research activities, student accommodation and  
sports infrastructure where this doesn’t diminish  the main focus of  the site for knowledge -
based  businesses.  
 
3.144.  We wish to ensure that the uses within the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park 
maintain its unique character as a place for knowledge -based activity (both University, 
commercial and other re search activities)  and that a strong “community of innovation” is 
built. This can be achieved by the establishment of a clear and robust gateway policy, in 
conjunction with the University an d other partners, such as the Leicester and 
Leicestershire Economi c Partnership.  The operation of such a policy will provide an 
important control mechanism for the occupiers and the uses they carry out in the Science 
and Enterprise Park; and help to attrac t similar occupiers by giving them an assurance 
that the Park will  continue as a hig h quality, specialist facility.  
 
3.145.  The policy will be designed to guarantee that all companies and organisations on the 
Science and Enterprise Park will be:  
 
• engaged in knowl edge -based activities that complement the academic activities of t he 
University (or be specialist organisations engaged in the support of such businesses); 
and Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  112 
 • willing to engage on an on -going basis in discussion of mutually beneficial joint 
activities across the spectrum of teaching, research, and knowledge exchange.  
 
Landscape  
 
3.146.  The land scape to the west of the University provides a particularly attractive approach to 
Loughborough.  It is an attractive area which forms the north -eastern part of Charnwood 
Forest Regional Park together with the National Forest and as such the requirements o f 
Policy EV4 will apply.  It includes important habitats, such as the ancient woodlands at 
Holywell Wood and Burleigh Wood, both of which are Local Wildlife Sites. The oppo rtunity 
should be taken for the development to create and improve habitats, reflecti ng the 
established character.  To the south of the shallow valley of the Burleigh Brook the land 
rises towards the Outwoods, providing an open foreground to the elevated ar eas of 
Charnwood Forest. The landscape is bisected by Snell’s Nook  Lane.  
 
3.147.  The landsc ape will need to be planned for carefully.  Early phases of the Science and 
Enterprise Park have maintained a parkland setting by retaining 40% of the development 
site as o pen and undeveloped.  The extension to the Science and Enterprise Park within 
this a ttractive landscape setting is only considered acceptable because of its outstanding 
economic advantage and the expectation that high quality buildings can be developed in 
a similar landscaped parkland setting.  
 
3.148.  There is around 31 hectare s of land to the e ast of Snell’s Nook Lane. With around 40% 
of the site being retained as parkland we expect to see around 18.5 hectares developed. 
There is around 42 hectares of land to the  west of Snell’s Nook Lane, within the National 
Forest; with aroun d 40% of the site being retained as parkland we expect to see around 
25 hectares developed.  
 
3.149.  The development’s scale, form, character  and design must respect the site’s topography, 
natural features and setting.   As a gateway to Loughborough the site prov ides an 
opportunit y to provide landmark buildings on prominent frontages in support of our vision 
for high quality design set out in P olicy DS6. We have worked with our partners to develop 
a concept masterplan and design principles that responds to the lan dscape and our 
vision. This is intended to provide an illustrative example of how the development of the 
Science and Enterprise Park c ould be delivered in the future rather than a restrictive 
framework which is rigidly enforced. As such we would welcome an y adaptations whic h 
reflect our aims for the science park and will assist in its delivery.  
 
3.150.  The Science and Enterprise Park offers the  potential to reduce our carbon footprint 
through design, including the careful layout and orientation of buildings.  The development 
must a chieve high standards of sustainable construction and design.  
 
3.151.  We want the Science and Enterprise Park to be designe d so that is it resilient to climate 
change.  We expect the development to maintain a greenfield run -off rate, protect and  
enhance water qua lity, in support of the Water Framework Directive.  We have worked 
with our partners to explore opportunities to red uce flood risk.  Our evidence suggests 
that there is a need for appropriate run -off management and consideration of storag e 
options to preve nt any increase in flood risk downstream. This should include Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  113 
 investigating opportunities to reduce flood risk assoc iated with the Burleigh Brook and 
reduce flood risk in Loughborough.  
 
Access and Travel  
 
3.152.  The development should be fully a ccessible and legi ble, supported by facilities that 
encourage walking and cycling.  The site is well served by existing bus services providing 
direct connections to the town centre, Leicester, Nottingham and Coalville, alon g with 
destinations in between. T he potential for a  significantly increased customer base will 
support improvements to those services delivering wider benefits across the public 
transport network.  
 
3.153.  We will expect the Development Framework, masterplan and d evelopment proposals to 
be inform ed by a Transport Assessment in accordance with Policy INF2.  
 
Delivery  
 
3.154.  We will work with our partners to seek public and private funding and inward investment. 
The demand for development to support knowledge -based business  is difficult to predict. 
We want  to be ready for g lobal inward investors and will also pursue schemes to support 
business start -ups and growth. A successful Science and Enterprise Park will have major 
benefits for the economy of Leicestershire and the Eas t Midlands.  
 
3.155.  The advantages of it s unique location and quality landscape will demand a phased 
approach capable of both promoting appropriate development and responding positively 
to opportunities as they arise.   
 
3.156.  We do not want to see ad hoc and poorly re lated development take place on t he Science 
and Ent erprise Park.  A concept masterplan has been developed to evidence how a 
positive framework for an integrated development could be provided. We will support any 
similar cohesive framework which would achie ve a similar comprehensive develo pment.  
 
3.157.  The provis ion of infrastructure will be timed to service the needs of the relevant phase of 
development.  We will expect to see a phasing strategy as part of the early parameter 
plan that establishes the timing of i nfrastructure.  
 
3.158.  We are working wi th our partners, i ncluding the University, to maximise  the opportunities 
for local employment and businesses to benefit from the Loughborough Science and 
Enterprise Park. We will produce a joint Economic Development Strategy which will show 
how new jobs an d other training o pportunities that arise from the Sci ence and Enterprise 
Park will be targeted towards local people.  Training, apprenticeships, education and 
supply -chain opportunities for local businesses will be promoted during construction and 
through  the operation of the Science and Enterprise Park.  
 Chapter  3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  114 
  
 
Policy LUC3: Loughborough Science & Enterprise Park  
 
We will allocate 73 hectares  of land to the west of Loughborough University for an 
extension to the Science and Enterprise Park.  
 
This will include  31 hectares of la nd to the east of Snell’s Nook Lane and 42 hectares to 
the west of Snell’s Nook Lane.  
 
By 2037 the Science and Enterpri se Park will have delivered suitable knowledge -based 
business space in a landscaped campus that:  
 
• provides for uses tha t directly relate to the University’s own operational activities 
including teaching, research and development, administration, student 
accommodation and sports facilities;  
• provides for the development of businesses operating within or directly supporting t he 
knowledge -based  sector;  
• delivers a range of development opportunities that includes an innovation centre, 
space for business start -ups, grow on units for small and medium sized enterprises 
and potential for inward investment;  
• provid es for appropriate an cillary uses to se rve the Science and Enterprise Park and 
ensures that any main town centre uses are in accordance with Policy T1;  
• protects historic and archaeological features including the setting of Garendon 
Registered Park and Gard ens and its assets in  accordance with P olicy EV8;  
• integrates with the sensitive landscape and respects its character, biodiversity and

Policy ENV9; 
Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  115 
 • provides high quality design and innovation in the form and layout of the development, 
buildings and green space in accordance with Policy D S5; 
• where viable, exc eeds the sustainab le construction techniques in accordance with 
Policy CC4;  
• delivers buildings and spaces that have been designed to be adaptable to future

netwo rks in accordance with Policy CC5; and   
• makes a positive contribution to the provision of highway infrastructure as identified 
through a Transport Assessment in accordance with Policy CC5 and INF2.  
 
We will do this by  working with our pub lic and private se ctor partners, including 
Loughborough University, to:  
 
• prepare a gateway policy to ensure the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park 
maintains its unique character as a place for knowledge -based activity;  
• agree a flexible Development Fr amework, including  delivery and phasing arrangements 
and a masterplan that sets parameters and a phasing strategy for the delivery of a 
cohesive development;  
• establish an economic development strategy to capture the wider benefits of the 
development; and  
• support the Unive rsity in the development of management and marketing practices that 
assist the delivery of the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park.  
 
We will require the flexible Development Framework and detailed planning applications to 
be informed  by a Green Infras tructure Strategy and a Sustainability Assessment that 
identifies the developments response to carbon emissions reduction and climate change 
resilience.  
 
Shepshed Urban Area  
 
3.159.  Shepshed is located in the north west of the Borough on the wes t side of the M1 
motorway.  It is the second largest settlement in Charnwood and together with 
Loughborough it provides the main focus for homes and jobs in the Borough.  While 
Loughborough and Shepshed have separate  identities and characteristics they hav e 
close inter- relationships and function as a wider urban area.  
 
3.160.  The town lies within an area identified by the Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic 
Growth Plan as the Leicestershire International Gateway.  This is  an area of land focused 
around the nort hern parts of the A42 and M1 motorway that includes East Midlands 
Airport, the East Midlands Gateway (a strategic rail freight terminal) and other land and 
settlements in North West Leicestershire.   
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  116 
 3.161.  Our vision and objectives for Shepshed are to support t he Leicestershire International 
Gateway, through the provision of new homes and jobs, to secure its regeneration and to 
make the most of its location on the edge of the Charnwood Forest.  
 
Background  
 
3.162.  The development of Shepshed since the medieval period ha s been influenced by the 
wool industry, linked to the nearby Charnwood Forest to the south and the Cistercian 
Abbey at Garendon to the east.  The town centre remains focussed around the 
marketplace but the pattern of  nineteenth and twentieth century expans ion has resulted 
in the town centre now being located in the northern part of the town.  The key routes 
from the Market Place lead to the north (Hathern and Long Whatton) and south to the 
Charnwood Forest.  The A512 linking Shepshed to Loughborough and Ash by-de-la-
Zouch is located a mile south of the town centre, leaving the centre somewhat 
disconnected from main through routes as a result.  
 
3.163.  Following the decline of framework knitting as a key source of employment, th e economy 
of Shepshed was focussed on sm all manufacturing businesses.  The majority of 
Shepshed’s factories have now closed and their sites have been redeveloped, mainly for 
homes. Shepshed continues to have significant employment areas, particularly in the  
area to the north of the A512 Ashby Roa d, and after Lough borough is the second most 
self-contained settlement in the Borough, with 20% of those living in the town also working 
there.  However, the majority of Shepshed residents work elsewhere, including t he 27% 
who work in Loughborough, and the  town has fewer jo bs than the smaller settlements of 
Syston and Thurmaston.   
 
3.164.  Many of the new homes that have been built on old factory sites have been to the south 
of the town centre, locations where access to the town centre is difficult due to a lack o f 
walking and cycl ing links. As a consequence, many residents choose to shop elsewhere 
and Shepshed town centre has declined over the last 30 years with closures exacerbating 
the fragmented character of the main shop ping streets.  
 
Environmental Context  
 
3.165.  Shepshed lies withi n two landscape character areas: the Langley Lowlands area, with a 
rolling landform of gentle slopes, to the north, and the Charnwood Forest to the south.  
The part of the Charnwood Forest character area that includes the southern part of  the 
town and the area immediately south of it has a gently rolling character of mixed farmland.  
Further south the land rises significantly to Ives Head where it has an elevated upland 
character.  
 
3.166.  About a third of the built-up area of Shepshed lies within  the boundary of t he Charnwood 
Forest Regional Park.  The area to the south west of Shepshed includes a number of 
wooded areas, including several ancient woodlands, which also form part of the 
Charn wood Forest.  These are important habitats and are also of  historical and cu ltural 
value in terms of the forest landscape and Shepshed’s past.  These landscape character 
areas are an important part of the character and local distinctiveness of Shepshed and  
its setting.   
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  117 
 3.167.  The historic centre of Shepshed has been designated as a Co nservation Area and there 
are several nationally and locally listed buildings within and adjacent to the Conservation 
Area.  Historic England has identified the Conservation Area o n its Heritage at Risk 
Register describing its condition a s poor and declini ng.  Our approach to regeneration in 
Shepshed aims to have positive benefits for the Conservation Area as well as the District 
Centre.  Through positive engagement with the local c ommunity and Historic England 
and using the Conservation A rea Character Appr aisal we will seek opportunities to 
improve the condition of the Conservation Area with the aim of securing its removal from 
the Heritage at Risk Register over the course of the pl an period.  
 
3.168.  The Black Brook is a tributary to the River So ar and flows aroun d the west and north of 
the town.  It is part of the town’s Green Infrastructure network but also forms part of the 
Borough’s network of strategically important links in the wildli fe network.  We have 
therefore carefully considered the im pact that new deve lopment in this area and will 
require that any developments, including site allocations, result in an enhancement in 
biodiversity and address how water flow will be managed as part  of that enhancement 
and to reduce flood risk.   
 
3.169.  Shepshed  generally has suf ficient provision of Green Infrastructure and open space.  New 
development will have to ensure that provision keeps pace with the needs of a growing 
population.  Development also p rovides an opportunity to maintain and enhance networks 
of open spaces that provide biodiversity and health benefits.  These are particularly 
important in Shepshed and in some cases have the potential to support our objectives for 
improving connectivity wi thin the town.  
 
3.170.  Air quality is generally good and improvin g in the Borough, however, a combination of 
road traffic and industrial sources of pollution could have an impact on communities in 
Shepshed that are more deprived and therefore more vulnerable to t he effects of 
pollution.  As our strategy directs a signif icant amount of ne w growth to Shepshed it is 
important that the issue of air quality is carefully considered so that opportunities to 
mitigate impacts and improve air quality can be identified.  Whi lst the impacts of individual 
developments in isolation ar e not significant,  it will be necessary to consider the 
cumulative impacts of proposed development, including the allocations set out in this 
plan, to avoid an overall significant impact on air qual ity. 
 
Development Strategy for Shepshed  Urban Area  
 
Homes and Jobs  
 
3.171.  Our stra tegy directs development to Shepshed as a sustainable location for growth. It has 
a range and choice of services, facilities and employment opportunities that meet the 
needs of res idents and benefits from its close relationship with the L oughborough Urban 
Centre.  Our strategy identifies sites for 1,878 homes and 5 hectares of employment land 
as part of the overall distribution of growth to meet the Borough’s needs over the plan 
period.  
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based P olicies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  118 
 3.172.  The housing sites identified in this plan include  significant devel opment on the west side 
of the town, which will also be the location for new infrastructure including a new primary 
school. Additional demands on GP surgeries will also be addressed through joint working 
with the Clinical Commissioning Gr oup and local GP P ractices. This is likely to result in 
enhanced provision at existing surgeries or the provision of a satellite surgery.  
 
Regeneration  
 
3.173.  In planning terms there is a hierarch y of retail centres and in Charnwood this comprises 
a Town Centre in Loughborough, s everal District Centres and smaller Local Centres.  
Using these terms Shepshed provides the functions of a District Centre despite Shepshed 
being a town.  
 
3.174.  Addressing the st ructural issues in the District Centre and its poor accessibility requires 
a concerted effort from different agencies to implement the regeneration strategy already 
agreed. We have worked with the Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership 
and hav e already committed substantial funds to commence the improvement of the 
public real m in the Market Place and Bullring areas.  However, more needs to be done to 
ensure the town is re -vitalised as the focal point for the community and the first choice for 
day to day needs and services.  An important strand of our strategy  is to ensure that  new 
development contributes to the regeneration of the town and District Centre through 
public realm works and accessibility improvements.  
 
3.175.  There are opportunities at the  Leicestershire International Gateway to use the 
environmental asse ts of the Charnwoo d Forest to support sustainable development 
including supporting investment in tourism and leisure and the wider health and well -
being agenda, and using existing and newly planted trees to enhance the physical fabric 
of the town and respo nd to its forest s etting.  There are also regeneration benefits from 
securing good transport links, including by sustainable transport modes, between 
Shepshed and the International Gateway’s  key employment locations.  
 
3.176.  With our partners we have already prod uced a strategic v ision to improve the overall 
economic health and vitality of the current centre through the Shepshed Town Centre 
Masterplan and Delivery Framework.  They focus on interventions around complementary 
activities combining public realm improv ements with strate gies to relate character and 
identity to the town’s retail function.  The Council’s spatial vision expressed through the 
Shepshed Town Centre Masterplan is that:  
 
Shepshed Town Centre Masterplan Vision  
 
Shepshed is to be a District Centre  for local people,  based on support for, and 
expansion of, independent traders, repairing the physical fabric of the town and 
thereby making it more attractive to visitors.  
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  119 
 3.177.  Work is underway to improve the Bull Ring, Market Place and Hall Croft, financ ed by 
developer co ntributions, the Borough Council and Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise 
Partnership.  We will continue to work with Shepshed Town Council, the Town Team an d 
other stakeholders to deliver the Shepshed Town Centre Masterplan and Delive ry 
Framework.  
 
3.178.  There is evidence that the investments that have already been made and improvements 
made by businesses and the local community are starting to have a positive effe ct, as 
shown in lower shop vacancy rates and shorter re -letting times.  New re tailers have 
moved  to the town, adding to the range of the town’s retail offer, and there has been a 
recent growth in the Shepshed Market as people have made more use of shopping  locally 
during the Covid -19 pandemic.  These improvements need to be consolid ated and built 
on to deliver the Masterplan in full and the opportunity exists to do so.  There are also 
opportunities to build on the growth of the market to further raise its p rofile and secure its 
future.  
 
Shepshed District Centre  
 
3.179.  The continued vitalit y and viability of  Shepshed District Centre is key to our regeneration 
strategy for the town and to ensuring that development in Shepshed is sustainable.  The 
Shepshed Town Centr e Masterplan and Delivery Framework has been produced to 
consider the opportun ity to improve the  overall economic health and vitality of the centre. 
The Framework identifies a number of issues related to shopping patterns, accessibility 
of the centre, publ ic realm and services available.   
 
3.180.  We want to support Shepshed District Centr e to improve its o verall economic health and 
vitality and viability, and in continuing to provide for resident’s day to day needs.  This will 
mean supporting developments which a ddress these issues.  Proposals for town centre 
uses, out of the District Cent re, will require c areful assessment of the impacts, particularly 
given our understanding of the health of Shepshed District Centre and our strategy to 
address this.  
 
3.181.  In order to consolidate the improvements to the District Centre and deliver our vision of 
increasing its vit ality and viability, opportunities to improve car parking facilities will be 
considered.  This forms part of our overall strategy of improving access to the Dis trict 
Centre as the focus for retail and other services in the town.  Whilst w e wish to enable 
more people to use sustainable transport modes to access the District Centre, we 
recognise the need to ensure sufficient car parking facilities are available.   
 
3.182.  Our development strategy for delivering new homes at Shepshed will seek to en courage 
footfall a nd spending in Shepshed District Centre by ensuring new homes are well 
connected to, and contribute to the regeneration of, the centre.  Where appropriate, this  
may include developer contributions for supporting improvements to connectivi ty, the 
public rea lm, landscaping, and heritage assets, the provision of public art and the 
repurposing of buildings for commercial or community use  
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  120 
 3.183.  In addition, we would support innovative proposals which seek to complement this 
approach with more tra nsformative soluti ons.  These would need to respect Shepshed’s 
heritage but could include seeking to open up links and create new gateways between 
the Di strict Centre and the rest of the town, creating greater coherence between the 
different elements of th e centre, or ident ifying new complementary uses for sites within 
the centre that build on its role as the town’s meeting place.   
 
 
 
Policy SUA1: Shepshed Urban Area  
 
We will support Shepshed as a settlement within the Leicestershire International Gateway  
and secure its re generation.  We will do this by supporting development that:  
• delivers allocations in accordance with Policy DS3 and DS4 or sustainable 
development th at is in accordance with the pattern of development outlined in Policy 
DS1 and which sup ports our vision a nd objectives including making effective use of 
land;  
• ensures the timely and coordinated delivery of infrastructure to support sustainable 
communitie s, in accordance with Policy INF1;  
• improves connectivity within Shepshed, particularly b etween new develop ments and

• mitigates impacts on air q uality, taking account of cumulative effects, including those 
from significant industrial sources in the area, and where possible contributes to 
improvements in air quality, in accordance with Policy EV11;  
• contributes  to improving the condition of Shepshe d Conservation Area, having regard 
to the Conservation Area Appraisal in accordance with Policy EV8;  
• secures financial contributions to improve the public realm, landscaping, community 
facilities, public art and herita ge of the town and particularly for th e Bull Ring, Hall Croft, 
Field Street and Market Place; and 
 
• provides innovative proposals for improving the vitality and viability of Shepshed 
District Centre including:  
• opening up links and creatin g new gateways bet ween the District Centre and the 
rest of the town;  
• creating greater coherence between the different elements of the centre ; 
• identifying new complementary uses for sites within the centre that build on its role  
as the town’s meeting place , including repurp osing vacant buildings for community 
and commercial uses; and  
• providing managed workspace and small business start- up space.  
 
We will work with the West Leicestershire Clinical Commissioning Group and local health 
providers to help meet t he increased deman ds on local GP practices.   
 
Service Centres  
 
Background  
 
3.184.  Service Centres are larger settlements with a good range of services and facilities to meet 
the day to day needs of residents or have good accessibility to services not available 
within the settlem ent. Five Service Centres are located in the Soar Valley: B arrow upon 
Soar, Mountsorrel, Quorn, Rothley and Sileby, while the other Service Centre, Anstey, is 
located close to the boundary with the city of Leicester, Hinckley and Bosworth  and Blaby 
in the south west of the Borough.   
 
3.185.  Our vision and objectives for  the Service Centres is to ensure there is a network of 
centres, so residents have access to a range of shops, services and facilities and also to 
protect and enhance the identity  of the Borough’s locally distinctive towns and villages.  
 
3.186.  Each Service Cent re has origins which date back many centuries.  Anstey, Barrow upon 
Soar, Rothley and Sileby were all recorded in the Domesday Book, and are thought to be 
of Saxon origin while Si leby’s name indica tes its Danish origin. Quorn and Mountsorrel’s 
origins post date the Doomsday book, but have histories dating back to 12th century.  
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  122 
 3.187.  The Service Centres developed during the 19th century through manufacturing; notably 
through framework kni tting.  Quorn and Mountsorrel’s historical development is linked to 
the quarr ying of local stone; an industry that remains today. All of the Service Centres 
saw significant residential expansion in the 20th Century, a trend that has continued until 
the pre sent.  
 
3.188.  All of the Service Centres generally have a good range of local facili ties including 
convenience shops, pubs and community buildings.  All have at least one primary school 
which provide a focal point for their communities, serving the majority of ch ildren living in 
the village, and with the exception of Rothley, all have a G P surgery.  District and Local 
Centres are in reasonable health and some centres have a strong restaurant and bar 
offer too.   
 
3.189.  These facilities serve not only the villages themse lves but a hinterl and of smaller 
settlements and surrounding countryside.  Al l Service Centres have good road and public 
transport links to larger settlements for access to employment and higher order goods 
and services.  While there is a degree of self -containment in terms  of travel to employment 
for residents of the Soar Valley S ervice Centres, a large majority travel to other locations 
for employment.  For Barrow upon Soar, Mountsorrel and Quorn, Loughborough is a 
major destination for employment, wherea s for Anstey, Roth ley and Sileby, Leicester is 
more of a focus for employment  opportunities.  
  
3.190.  Our Service Centres have a population ranging from 5,056 in Rothley to 8,849 in Sileby. 
The population of all Service Centres has increased significantly in rece nt years with the 
largest increases being in Rothley, Quorn and Barrow upon Soar. Together they  are home 
to slightly less than a quarter of the Borough’s population and the location of 14% of the 
borough’s jobs.  Local employment opportunities can help to reduce out commuti ng and 
bring sustainability benefits for the centres and the wider community.   
      
3.191.  The Service Centres’ proximity to the large urban areas of Loughborough and Leicester 
and attractive countryside, has created a strong market demand for housing which has 
been one of the key reasons for their significant expansion in recent years.  This 
expansion has often been unplanned and as a consequence there have only been 
incremental improvements made to the infrastructure.   Schools in particular h ave limited 
option s available for further expansion and there has also been pressure on doctors ' 
surgeries and the local road network.  
 
3.192.  All Service Centres are recognised for having a strong sense of community identity, and 
this is reflected by the strong  engagement in nei ghbourhood plan preparation encouraged 
by proactive parish councils and their  local communities.  
 
Environmental Context  
 
3.193.  Our Service Centres lie within the Soar Valley landscape character area, but also extend 
into Charnwood Forest and Wolds character ar eas.  Anstey lies within the Charnwood 
Forest character area.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  123 
 3.194.  All of our Service Centres have historical cores, defined by conservation areas, which 
have developed close to the River Soar, or the Rothley Brook in the case of Anstey. All 
Service Centre s lie in areas of significant flood risk and that has affected the pattern of  
development.  Significant growth in recent years has meant that development now 
extends well beyond these original cores, extending up valley sides into adjoini ng 
landscape chara cter areas, with a pattern of development that often contrasts strongly 
betwe en old and more recent development.  New development will need to be carefully 
planned to integrate with the unique settlement pattern and landscape setting of t he 
Service Centres . 
 
3.195.  As our Service Centres have grown, the gaps separating them have become sm aller.  
This has contributed to an increase in concern about settlement identities and the 
importance of settlements remaining distinct and separate places. W e have identified 
Areas of Local Separation adjoining our Service Centres as well as a Green Wedge to 
the south of Anstey to manage the growth of Anstey and Leicester.    
 
3.196.  The Soar Valley on which five of the Service Centres lie is a strategically importan t part 
of the Borough ’s ecological network. In addition, the Charnwood Forest also has one of 
the highest concentrations of designated ecological sites in Leicestershire.   The further 
narrowing of the gaps between Service Centres, particularly on the west ern side of the 
River  Soar has the potential to isolate our most important wildlife networks.  Our 
development strategy seeks to ensure that connectivity is maintained between the River 
Soar, Rothley Brook and the broader ecological network.  
 
3.197.  All the Servi ce Centres are locate d on the edge of the Charnwood Forest and/or next to 
the River Soar/Grand Union Canal Corridor, which are major recreational assets. A key 
priority in our Open Space Strategy is to link areas of open space through Green 
Infrastructure Corridors, particular ly throughout the Soar Valley and Charnwood Forest.  
There are also railway stations at Quorn/Woodhouse and Rothley on the Great Central 
Railway with potential to support a visitor economy.  
 
3.198.  The Charnwood Open Space Strategy 2018 – 2036 i dentifies shortfal ls in provision for a 
range of typologies of open space in terms of quantity, accessibility and quality. The most 
common deficiencies in all six of the service centres were the number of park s and 
gardens followed by allotments where a sh ortfall was record ed in all but Quorn and 
Rothley. There was a shortfall of natural and semi natural open space in Barrow upon 
Soar, Quorn and Sileby. The Soar Valley is generally well -provided with playing pi tches 
for all pitch sports and age groups.  
 
Development Strategy for the Service Centres  
 
3.199.  Our Service Centres  are the most sustainable locations for growth outside our urban 
centres and urban areas, but growth needs to be planned carefully in these villag es to 
respond to their key characteristics and constraints as out lined in this chapter.   
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  124 
 3.200.  Our development strategy identifies sites for 1,819 homes as part of the overall 
distribution for meeting the Borough’s needs over the plan period.    
 
3.201.  Our strategy is to support employment development in the S ervice Centres in accordance 
with the pattern of development outlined in Policy DS1, where this would contribute 
towards meeting our borough wide need for employment land and would reduce out 
commut ing in service centres.  
 
3.202.  We will encourage development wh ich supports the v itality and viability of the Local and 
District Centres and seek to enhance their unique characteristics in terms of their heritage 
and diversity of uses.   
 
3.203.  One of the key issues for our Service Centres is the provision of homes within a  safe 
walking dist ance of a primary school. Primary schools in the Service Centres are at or 
nearing capacity with no or limited opportunity for future expansion.  It is therefore 
important that dev elopment in these settlements can deliver new or extended schools to 
ensure the future sustainability and cohesion of these communities.  The housing sites 
identified are largely focused in three of the Service Centres to ensure that new or 
extended primary schools can be secured as part of new development.     
 
3.204.  The Infrastructure Schedule identifies the Service Centres where new or extended 
schools are required to support new housing growth. Development in these areas will be 
expected to contribute to the c osts of education facilities in accordance with 
Leicestershire County Counci l’s Developer Contributions Policy.  The locations for new 
facilities are:  
 
• A new 1 Form Entry Primary School, land west of Anstey (HA43)  
• A new 1 Form Entry Primary School, land off Cotes Road, in Barrow upon Soar 
(HA49)  
• A 0.5 Form Entry  Extension to Coss ington Primary School, land to the Rear of 
Derry’s Garden Centre (HA59), which would also serve housing growth in Sileby  
 
3.205.  Between 70% and 90% of journeys to work in the Serv ice Centres are made by the private 
car, but car usage is lower than in rural part s of the borough, in the Wolds and the 
Charnwood Forest. All Service Centres benefit from access to frequent public transport 
services to larger urban areas of Leicester and Loughboroug h. The proximity to larger 
centres also means that cy cling can be an op tion, making use of National Cycle Route 6, 
a long-distance  route passing through the Soar Valley.  Our development strategy 
allocates new development within 800m of public t ransport which provides at least a 30-
minute  frequency to a larg er urban area or w here there is the potential to achieve this. 
Our evidence has also identified a need for additional off street car parking spaces in 
Anstey, Sileby, Barrow upon Soar and Quor n.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  126 
  
Policy SC1: Service Centres  
 
We will support  Service Centres i n providing for the day to day needs of their residents, 
seek to improve their sustainability and maintain their unique characters and separate 
identities.   
 
We will do this by supporting development that:  
• delivers alloca tions in accord ance with Policy D S3 and DS4 or sustainable 
development that is in accordance with the pattern of development outlined in Policy 
DS1 and which supports our vision and objectives including making effective use of 
land;  
• ensures the timely and  coordinated de livery of infrastr ucture to support sustainable 
communities, in accordance with Policy INF1 including contributing to new primary 
schools in Anstey and Barrow upon Soar with additional primary school provision at 
Cossington to serve Sileby;  
• is carefully pl anned to integrate  with the unique settlement pattern and landscape 
setting of Service Centres;  
• protects the predominantly open and undeveloped character of Areas of Local 
Separation in accordance with Policy EV3;  
• protects and enhances the C harnwood Forest  and River Soar an d the strategically 
important links in the wildlife network which connect them, in accordance with 
Policies EV4 and EV5.  
• improves connectivity and accessibility within Service Centres and to higher order 
settlements, partic ularly by walki ng, cycling and pu blic transport, in accordance with 
Policy CC5;  
• seeks to provide new development within 800m of public transport with at least a 30-
minute  frequency to a larger urban area;  
• provides employment opportunities in accordance with Policy DS4 an d which reduces 
out commuting from Service Centres;   
• contributes to the vitality and viability of the Mountsorrel, Quorn and Rothley Local 
Centres and Anstey, Barrow upon Soar and Sileby Di strict Centres and which builds 
upon the unique characteristics of  these centres in terms of their heritage and their 
diversity of uses, in accordance with Policy T1; and EV8.  
• provides new off street car parking provision to improve the viability and funct ioning 
of the Local and District Centres where there is a proven l ocal need.  
 
Other Settlements, Small Villages and Hamlets  
 
3.206.  Charnwood is characterised by a mix of urban and rural environments: from the edges of 
the city of Leicester to hamlets and the wider countryside.  Although the majority of the 
Borough’s population  live in larger se ttlements, smaller settlements are more n umerous, 
and the countryside occupies most of the Borough’s area.  In all there are 39 settlements 
in the Borough and only 12 of these are classified as Urban Areas or Service Centres.   
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  127 
 3.207.  Our v ision and objectiv es for the Borough’s smaller settlements seek to maintain their 
identity and to protect the special and distinctive qualities of the Borough’s landscapes.  
As with all places we want the people who live in these areas to have good access to 
jobs, services,  facilities and opportunities for recreat ion, with greater opportunities to do 
so by walking, cycling and public transport.  Appropriately located and designed 
development can help to deliver these objectives.  
 
3.208.  Our Settlement Hierarchy As sessment identifie s 14 Other Settlements in the Borough.  
Although forming a recognisable tier in the settlement hierarchy there is also a significant 
degree of variation between them.  They range in size from East Goscote (population 
2,866) to Swithland ( 217) but all have a primary school and some of the other se rvices 
and facilities required to meet the day to day needs of residents.  Our Other Settlements 
are Barkby, Burton on the Wolds, Cossington, East Goscote, Hathern, Newtown Linford, 
Queniborough, R earsby, Seagrave, Swithland, Thrussington, Thurcaston, Wood house 
Eaves and Wymeswold. 
 
3.209.  The Settlement Hierarchy Assessment also identifies a further 13 Small Villages and 
Hamlets which have few or no local facilities and range in population from Hoton (353 ) to 
Cotes (29).  Most of these settlements do not have a p arish council of their own and are 
served by a parish meeting or form part of a larger parish.  Our Small Villages and 
Hamlets are: Barkby Thorpe, Beeby, Cotes, Cropston, Hoton, Prestwold, Ratcliff e on the 
Wreake, S outh Croxton, Ulverscroft, Walton on the Wolds, Wanlip, Woodhouse, and 
Woodthorpe.  
 
3.210.  5.7% of the Borough’s jobs are found in Other Settlements, Small Villages and Hamlets 
and Countryside.  While the number of jobs per economically active person is greater 
here than in our Service Centres, the more limited range of employment opportunities 
that are available means that only between 4 and 6% of economically active people in 
these areas work in the electoral ward in which they live.  Most of these settlements have 
access to only infrequent public transport services to the employment opportunit ies and 
higher order goods and services offered by Service Centres and our urban areas.  The 
distances and routes involved also makes walking and cycling  not a suitable op tion for 
these journeys.  This particularly affects settlements further away from the  Soar and 
Wreake valley corridors and includes some settlements that would otherwise be large 
enough to be considered sustainable locations, e.g. Newtown  Linford, Woodhous e 
Eaves, Burton on the Wolds and Wymeswold, all of which had populations recorded in 
excess of 1,000 in the 2011 census.  As a result of these factors, in the middle super 
output areas covering the Charnwood Forest and the Wolds, 86% of j ourneys to work ar e 
by private car.  
 
3.211.  Prior to the Covid -19 pandemic, 5% of the people in employment wor ked mainly at home, 
a further 1% worked in the same grounds or buildings as their home, such as farmers or 
people with a shop attached to their home, and  another 8% used their home as a base 
while undertaking self -employed work on site at varying locations .  The response to the 
pandemic resulted in the number of people working from home increasing to nearly 50%.  
While this potential for homeworking is not  evenly distribute d between different sectors of 
the economy and poses challenges for our retail centre s, it provides an opportunity to 
improve the sustainability of smaller settlements by reducing the number of journeys to 
work made by car.  We will there fore respond posit ively to proposals to improve superfast 
broadband infrastructure, on which homeworkin g relies, in rural areas and to 
modifications to homes which facilitate homeworking.  
  
Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  129 
 Environmental Context  
 
3.212.  Our evidence has identified six dist inct landscape cha racter areas in the Borough.  The 
following map shows the location of all of our smaller settlements in relation to those 
landscape character areas.  This shows:  
 
• the distribution of settlements within the Charnwood Forest is mainly to th e east of 
the high est land;  
• the sparse settlement distribution in the High Leicestershire area, par ticularly further 
to the east;  
• that although the Soar Valley is dominated by larger settlements, there are also five 
smaller settlements located in this area ;  
• the importance of the topography of the Wolds for the location of settlements with 
most nestled within small valleys around the 75m contour line, and  
• the dense distribution of settlements in the Wreake Valley particularly in the west of 
this area.  
 
3.213.  The historic centres o f most Other Settlements have been designated as Conservation 
Areas.  The exceptions to this are Burton on the Wolds and East Goscote.   
 
3.214.  East Goscote was built as a new settlement in the 1960s and 1970s whilst Burton on the 
Wolds onl y significantly grew f ollowing the demise of the Burton Hall estate in the 1950s.  
 
3.215.  Many of our smaller settlements have not grown significantly beyond their historic centres 
and in some cases, for example Barkby, Newtown Linford and Seagrave, the 
Conservat ion Area extends over the vast majority of the built-up area.  In the case of 
Swithland, Woodhouse and Woodhouse Eaves, the Conservation Area extends to 
include buildings and settings beyond the village itself.  
 
3.216.  Our countryside has been heavily influenced by human activity and contains evidence of 
the history of human settlement in the area.  These include a Bronze Age/Iron Age hill 
fort at Beacon Hill, a Roman villa at Hamilton, deserted medieval villages at Cotes and 
Hamilton, monastic and aristocratic es tates at Bradgate, Gar endon and Prestwold and 
the settlements that remain part of the rural landscape today.   
 
3.217.  Our evidence shows that there is a strong link between the form and character of our 
smaller settlements and the surrounding landscape.  Example s of this include:  
 
• the significance of views of church spires and towers in several areas;  
• the use of local stone and slate in the construction of buildings in the Charnwood 
Forest and the importance of stone walls as boundaries;  
• the presence of farms wit hin settlements and gr een lanes in High Leicestershire; 
and 
• the location of villages in the Wolds within their own small valleys which means that 
extension of those villages can have a significant impact on the landscape.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  130 
 3.218.  The sense of identity of our small er settlements is one of their characteristics that we wish 
to maintain and enhance.  This sense of identity is also reflected in neighbourhood 
planning: both in the community endeavour of preparing a plan and in the conte nt of the 
plans themselves.  Four neighbourhood plan s have been made covering eight of our 
smaller settlements.  A further three neighbourhood plan groups are working on plans 
relating to four settlements .  
 
3.219.  Our evidence shows that accessible natural and s emi-natural green space is not eve nly 
distributed ac ross the Borough, with limited provision east of the River Soar.  This means 
that only 25% of the smaller settlements in the Borough have any accessible natural and 
semi- natural green space within their p arish.  This is in part a further reflection of the 
different character of the Wolds and High Leicestershire landscapes which lack the 
extensive woodlands of the Charnwood Forest and the meadows of our river valleys.  It 
also demonstrates the importance of  maintaining and enhancing the pub lic right of way 
network as a means of enabling people to have access to and benefit from the 
countryside.  
 
Strategy for Other Settlements  
 
3.220.  Protecting our landscape character while allowing sustainable development that s upports 
our rural areas is a delic ate balance.  Ther e is a close relationship between protecting 
our landscape and our support for the agricultural and tourism sectors of the rural 
economy. Our strategy and policies also support our rural communities’ need s for 
affordable housing, faciliti es and services.  
 
3.221.  As part of our strategy we have made a number of allocations in Other Settlements that 
will provide 755 homes as part of the overall distribution for meeting the Borough’s needs 
over the plan period.  Dev elopment has been directed to thos e settlements wher e there 
is capacity at local primary schools or, in the case of Cossington, where development 
there and in neighbouring Sileby can secure an extension to the existing school.  In the 
case of Wymeswold we have chosen to identify a housing requirement figure  for 60 new 
homes and enable appropriate sites to be identified through a neighbourhood plan.  
 
3.222.  Beyond these allocations, our strategy is to limit growth in Other Settlements and as a 
result only small -scale development proposals within th e Limits to Develo pment are likely 
to be appropriate. This infill is expected to be well -designed and enhance local character 
and distinctiveness.   
 
Policy OS1: Other Settlements  
 
We will support our Other Settlements, to meet their local social and econ omic needs.  We 
will do this by supporting development that:  
• delivers allocations in accordance with Policy DS3 or sustainable development that is 
in accordance with the pattern of development outlined in Policy DS1 and which 
supports our vision and object ives including mak ing effective use of land;  
• is small -scale and within defined Limits to Development;  
• ensures  the timely and coordinated delivery of infrastructure to support sustainable 
communities, in accordance with Policy INF1, including contributing  to expanded 
prima ry school provision in Cossington;  Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  131 
 • supports the provision of community services and facilitie s that meet proven local 
needs as identified by a neighbourhood plan or other community led plan;  
• safeguards existing services and facilities; a nd  
• contributes to local priorities as identified in neighbourhood plans.  
 
Strategy for Small Villages and Ham lets in the Countryside  
 
3.223.  Our Small Villages and Hamlets have few or no services and facilities, and the people 
who live in these settlements rely  on larger ones fo r their day -to-day needs.  They are 
therefore generally poor locations for new development, a nd we have made no allocations 
in these places.  
 
3.224.  We have only defined Limits to Development for Other Settlements, Service Centres and 
Urban Area s on the Policies Map.  As a consequence, our Small Villages and Hamlets 
are within the Countryside when it com es to making planning decisions. Our approach to 
development in the Countryside is set out in Policy C1 and our policy in relation to rural 
excep tion sites to meet  affordable housing need is set out in Policy H5.     
 
Strategy for the Countryside  
 
3.225.  Countryside is the largely undeveloped land beyond the defined Limits to Development 
of our towns and villages and has its own intrinsic character and be auty.   
 
3.226.  Land desi gnated as Countryside is identified on the Policies Map.   Our Smaller Villages 
and Ha mlets as defined in the settlement hierarchy do not have Limits to Development 
and are considered part of the Countryside when it comes to making plannin g decisions.  
 
3.227.  The local plan has an important role to play by guiding development in areas of 
Countrysi de to protect its intrinsic beauty.  Managing development in areas of Countryside 
is fundamental to delivering the pattern of development set out in our development 
strate gy and therefore delivering sustainable development. It also has an important role 
in providing the landscape setting to our settlements which contributes to their settlement 
identity.  Policy EV1 sets out our approach to protecting lands cape character whi ch 
highlights the role of the Countryside in providing the setting and contributing t o the 
distinct separate identifies of our towns and villages.  
 
3.228.  Countryside is the location of many rural enterprises, notably agriculture, forestry and 
horticulture.  Whil st protecting the Countryside from most development, it is important to 
support these  rural enterprises and make provision for development that has a strong 
relationship with their operational requirements.  This includes considering new isolated 
homes in circumstances where there is an essential need for a rural worker, including 
those ta king majority control of a farm business, to live permanently at or near their place 
of work in the Countryside. Where locational requirements are requir ed for equalities 
reasons, exceptions to the policy will be considered under the public sector equaliti es 
duty.  
 
 Chapter 3 Place Based Policies  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  132 
 3.229.  Where an independent expert assessment is required to assess the viability of rural 
businesses or the requirement for a worker to be housed a t or near their ru ral place of 
work the costs of this will be charged to the applicant.   
 
3.230.  Within land designated as Countryside there are other designations which have their own 
purposes in guiding development and delivering sustainable development. These  are set 
out in ou r policies on Green Wedges (EV2) and Areas of Local Separation (EV3).  
 
Policy C1: Cou ntryside  
 
We will manage development in areas of Countryside to protect its largely undeveloped 
character, and its intrinsic character and beauty.  We wi ll do this by:  
 
• supporting rural economic development which has a strong relationship with the 
operational requirements of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and other land-based  
industries;  
• supporting development for the reuse and adaptation of rural bui ldings and small  scale 
new built development where there would not be significant adverse environmental 
effects; and  
• supporting the provision of community services and facilities that meet proven local 
needs as identified by a neighbourhood plan or other c ommunity led pla n. 
 
The development of isolated homes in the Countryside will be supported if one or more of 
the following circumstances apply:  
 
• there is an essential need for a rural worker, including those taking majority control of 
a farm business, to live permanently  at or near their place of work in the countryside;  
• the development would represent the optimal viable use of a heritage asset or would 
be appropriate enabling development to secure the future of heritage assets;  
• the development would re -use a redundant  or disused building and enhance its 
immediate setting;  
• the development would involve the subdivision of an existing residential dwelling; or  
• the design is of exceptional quality, in that it:  
• is truly outstanding or innovative, reflectin g the highest stan dards in architecture, 
and would help to raise standards of design more generally in rural areas; and  
• would significantly enhance its immediate setting and be sensitive to the defining 
characteristics of the local area.   Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  133 
 Chapter 4 Housin g 
 
4.1. Our development  strategy meets the Borough’s identified housing needs in terms of the 
number of new homes required for our growing and changing communities.  The following 
policies address the need to ensure that the new homes that are delivered p rovide  an 
appropriate mi x of types, tenures and sizes of homes including affordable housing for 
those who cannot afford market rents and purchase prices.  By seeking an appropriate 
mix of housing, we will act positively to ensure that new homes best meet t he cha nging 
needs of the  population and create mixed and balanced communities.   
 
4.2. Our priority is that over the plan period enough homes are built to meet our identified 
housing needs and that their size, tenure, adaptability and type also meet people’s ne eds.  
 
4.3. We will encourage  our communities through neighbourhood plans to make decisions on 
what type of housing they need in their local area, where it should be built and who should 
occupy it. Supported by evidence, neighbourhood plans can include policies  aroun d 
affordability, l ocal lettings and retaining homes as community assets in perpetuity. They 
can also identify specific sites for housing and specify a proportion of them to be 
affordable and available to local people.  
 
Housing Mix  
 
4.4. A range of house sizes i s required to cate r for a diverse housing market and provide 
levels of affordability. Our evidence shows that the suggested mix of market dwellings 
should be largely split between 2 -and-3-bedroom dwellings, for which there is demand  
from both newly forming  households and ol der households wishing to downsize but retain 
the ability for friends and family to come and stay.  There is also a small need for 1-
bedroom  dwellings, and some 4-bedroom  dwellings reflecting the lack of turnover i n larger 
dwellings and t he number of large r households in the Borough.   
 
4.5. The overall need is similar for affordable housing but with a greater need for smaller 
properties and less need for larger ones.  The following table sets out the most 
appropriate mi x for new affordable and  market homes to m eet our needs over the plan 
period.  This takes account of the particular need for smaller affordable home ownership 
properties to assist people getting onto the housing ladder.  It also takes into account the 
existing high number of 1 -bedroom social rente d homes available in the Borough and the 
priority need for larger affordable rented homes for families with children.  
 
Table 6: Preferred Overall Mix of New Housing by Size and Tenure  
 
Preferred Overall Mix of New Housing by Size and Tenu re

 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  134 
 4.6. The preferred mix of affordable housing is also influenced by  the need to ensur e that the 
best use is made of the housing stock to ensure that properties are both affordable and 
provide stability for low income households to meet housing needs.  For example, 1 -bed 
properties o ffer limited flexibility for changing ho usehold circumstan ces and Registered 
Providers prefer not to acquire additional one bed properties which may result in fewer 1 -
bed affordable rented properties being sought. We have therefore chosen to present the 
preferred proportion of 1 -bed and 2 -bed af fordable homes for  rent as a combined figure.  
Local evidence from the housing register and discussions with Registered Providers will 
be used to inform the appropriate mix of homes.  
 
4.7. It is also important to consider  the types of affordable homes to ensure  what is provided 
best meets the needs of households and ensures a Registered Provider can be 
successfully secured to manage the homes. On this basis we will generally seek to avoid 
the following:  
 
• rented affordable  flats for families with children;  
• large numbers of one b edroom rented affordable flats on an individual site;  
• one-bedroom  intermediate affordable homes; and  
• intermediate affordable flats.  
 
4.8. Our approach is also to seek to ensure affordable homes are desi gned to accommodate 
the following number  of people to refl ect how homes will be allocated to those on the 
housing register:  
 
• 1 bed affordable rented homes need to accommodate 2 people;  
• 2 bed affordable rented homes need to accommodate 4 people;  
• 3 bed affordable rented homes need to accommodat e a minimum of 5 p eople; and  
• 4 bed plus affordable rented homes need to accommodate a minimum of 7 people.  
 
4.9. Like many other parts of the country,  Charnwood has seen an increase in the size of the 
private rented sector over the last 20 years.  Our evidenc e shows there is a  sufficient 
supply of homes in the private rented sector and no demand for Build to Rent properties 
has been identified.  Issues in relation to rented houses in multiple accommodation and 
purpose -built student accommodation are dealt with  later in this cha pter. 
 
4.10.  Our evidence has also considered differences in the existing housing stock and housing 
market in different parts of the Bo rough.  While differences exist, these are not significant 
enough to warrant different policies in relation t o housing mix bein g applied in different 
parts of the Borough.   
 
4.11.  The policy supports the deliverability of development and seeks to adopt a flexib le 
approach that uses our evidence in relation to housing mix to guide development over 
the course of the pla n period rather th an being a requirement for each development.  We 
will therefore consider evidence that is provided that could justify a particula r housing mix 
on a site.  
 
 
 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  135 
 Policy H1: Housing Mix  
 
We will seek a mix of house types, tenures and sizes that  meet the overall needs of the 
Borough in line with our most up to date evidence.  We will do this whilst having regard to 
the extent to which those needs have already been met by other development, local 
housing needs and housing market evidence, economic  conditions, viabi lity and site-
specific  circumstances.  
Housing for Older People and People with Disabilities  
 
4.12.  People are living longer and the proportion of older people in the population is increasing.  
This means there will be an increase in the numbe r of people with l ong-term mobility and 
health problems as people age. Our evidence also shows that the number of  people aged 
65+ with mobility problems and dementia is increasing more quickly than the total number 
of people in this age category.   
 
4.13.  There is therefore likel y to be an increased requirement for specialist housing options for 
older people, whether in th e form of sheltered housing or extra care housing.  There are 
also younger people who have needs for adapted or specialist accommodation.  We w ish 
to encourage e nhanced provision of these types of housing in both the market and 
affordable sectors.   
 
4.14.  The B orough Council owns 14 sheltered housing schemes across the Borough 
comprising nearly 450 units. The Council is already undertaking a phased sh eltered 
housing re view which aims to provide high quality housing in self -contained 
accommodation, addressing ten ants’ needs and expectations, and where residents may 
live independently with support.   
 
4.15.  Bungalows can also provide more appropriate accommoda tion for those wit h limited 
mobility and we will therefore support their provision on appropriate sites.  While 
bungalows may require a greater plot size, affecting the density of development, there 
may also be situations where bungalows are the most suita ble house type for  a particular 
site or part of a site, taking account of the site’s constraints or context.  
 
4.16.  Our policy is to encourage an adequate supply of accessible housing through the 
provision of homes which can provide greater accessibility, flexib ility and adaptabi lity to 
meet a diverse range of needs over time.  Our approach focusses on increasing the 
suppl y of those properties that are accessible and adaptable (i.e. they meet Part M4(2) 
of the Building Regulations) so that people can more easily remain in their ho mes if their 
circumstances change.   
 
4.17.  In providing affordable housing, there is an opportunity for the Council, through its 
nomination rights, to match the needs of individuals to homes including those that need 
homes suitable for wheelch air users.  We can  therefore work with Registered Providers 
to identify an appropriate combination of accessible and adaptable properties (Part M4(2) 
of the Building Regulations), and wheelchair user properties (i.e. those that meet Part 
M4(3) of the Build ing Regulations) w hen delivering affordable homes. Building 
Regulations differentiate between wheelchair accessib le and wheelchair adaptable 
dwellings and options will be considered in discussions with Registered Providers.  Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  136 
 Policy H2: Housing for Older Peo ple and People wit h Disabilities  
 
To meet the needs of the ageing population and people with disabilities, we wil l:  
• seek at least 10% of new market homes on major developments that meet the Building 
Regulations Part M4(2) standards for being accessible an d adaptable, or an y 
replacement standards produced by the Government; and  
• seek an appropriate proportion of affordable homes that meet the Building Regulations 
Part M4(2) standards and/or the Part M4(3) standards for being suitable for wheelchair 
users in consultation with relevant Registered Providers of affordable housing.  
 
In seeking these types of homes,  we will have regard to any evidence provided regarding 
viability or other site -specific factors that may make it impossible to provide step -free 
access.  
We will also:  
• support the provision of bungalows or other single level properties; and  
• suppor t the provision of specialist accommodation where it addresses the needs of 
older people in accordance with identified housing needs and care requirements, or of 
younger people wit h special accommodation needs.  
 
Internal Space Standards  
 
4.18.  Living in a dwelli ng that is overcrowded or too small can cause health problems and be 
detrimental to well -being.  Average dwelling sizes in the UK are amongst the smallest in 
Euro pe and the Governm ent has introduced nationally described space standards to 
establish minimum  standards and help bring consistency across the country.  The 
Government has recently required these standards to be complied with for new homes 
delivered throug h permitted develo pment rights.   
 
4.19.  Our evidence shows that the nationally described space stan dards are not consistently 
being met in new homes in Charnwood, particularly those relating to gross internal 
floorspace and the provision of built -in storage.  W e wish to balance the delivery of the 
number of homes needed with providing adequate living co nditions for their occupiers 
and avoiding overcrowding.  Delivering homes that meet the standards is also consistent 
with our wish that people can remain in their  homes if their ci rcumstances change.  We 
will work with Registered Providers to balance meeti ng the space standards with other 
factors so as to maximise the delivery of affordable housing.   
 
4.20.  In order to provide certainty for developers, we will not apply  this policy to re served 
matters applications that relate to outline planning permissions granted before the 
adoption of this plan. 
 
Policy H3: Internal Space Standards  
 
We will seek compliance with the nationally described space standards, or any 
replacem ent standards prod uced by the Government,  for all new homes (including those 
resulting from the change of use of existing buildings).  We will do this while having regard 
to any evidence provided regarding viability or other site -specific factors.   
 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  137 
 For a ffordable housing we will respond positive ly to development proposals that are 
accompanied by a Design and Access Statement, or similar document that satisfactorily 
explains how any deviation from the nationally described space standards (or any 
replacemen t standards produc ed by the Government) wi ll still meet the needs of 
occupiers.  
 
Affordable Housing  
 
4.21.  The difference between house prices and household incomes makes it difficult for some 
people to afford to buy a home. Market rent levels can also be unaff ordable for some 
people who are unable to or do not wish to purchase their home.  
 
4.22.  Evidence from the Land Registry shows that house prices in Charnwood have increased 
significantly over the last decade and have done so by more than the regional and 
nationa l average. Househo ld earnings have not kep t pace with this increase in house 
prices.  The generally accepted ratio for the amount of mortgage a household can borrow 
is 3 to 3.5 times household income and in Charnwood average house prices are over 7 
times a verage earnings.  
 
4.23.  We wish to help people w hose housing needs are not being met by the market by seeking 
the delivery of new affordable homes.  These are usually homes that are made available 
to buy a share in, buy at a discount or rent through a Registered  Provider such as the 
Council or a Housing  Association.  
 
4.24.  The National Planning Policy Framework categorises affordable housing into four main 
types:  
 
(a) Affordable housing for rent : owned and managed by a Council or other 
Registered Provider with rent set at a level which does  not exceed 80% of the local 
market rent or Social Rent set in accordance with the Government’s rent policy.  
(b) Starter homes : new dwellings which are available for purchase by qualifying first -
time buyers and are sold at a discount of at l east 20% of the ma rket value, subject 
to a price cap and with restrictions on sale or letting.  
(c) Discounted market sales:  housing which is sold at a discount of at least 20% 
below  local market value with eligibility determined by local incomes and house 
prices and with provis ions to ensure housing remains at a discount for future 
eligible households.  
(d) Other affordable routes to home ownership:  for those who could not achieve 
home ow nership through the market including shared ownership, equity loans, low 
cost h omes for sale and rent to buy.       
 
4.25.  There is an identified need for 476 new affordable homes for rent (category a) a year in 
Charnwood over the plan period to meet existing an d newly arising needs. The majority 
of that need is for homes where rent is cha rged at the social  rent level, which is less 
expensive than the affordable rent level.  It is recognised that there is also a role for 
affordable rents and our evidence suggests  that a significant proportion of the need for 
affordable homes for rent could be met by either a ffordable rent or social rent when 
access to housing benefits and the local housing allowance cap sought on affordable Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  138 
 rents are taken into account. It is clea r from our evidence that both tenures of homes are 
likely to be required in all  areas of the Boro ugh.  
 
4.26.  The National Planning Policy Framework states that major housing development 
proposals should make provision for at least 10% of the overall number home s to be 
available for affordable home ownership (categories b, c and d).  This is more than 
sufficient to meet the need for affordable home ownership in the Borough.  
 
4.27.  First Homes are the Government’s preferred discounted market tenure.  First Homes are 
a specific kind of discounted market sale housing (category c) which are discounte d by a 
minimum of 30% against the market value, sold to a person or persons meeting the First 
Homes eligibility criteria set out in the Planning Practice Guidance and cost no mo re than 
£250,000.  When sold they must have a restriction registered on the tit le at HM Land 
Registry to ensure this discount and other restrictions are passed on at each subsequent 
title transfer.  In accordance with national guidance, we will require at least 25% of all 
affordable homes delivered through developer contributions to be First Homes.  
 
4.28.  Our evidence shows that shared ownership is the most appropriate form of affordable 
home ownership to meet the needs of those most in need in the Borough due to  the lower 
deposit requirements and lower overall costs.  Once the First Homes requirement has 
been met, this will be the preferred affordable home ownership tenure  
 
4.29.  Our approach to meeting the need for affordable housing has also been informed by our 
viability evidence.  This has informed the policy to seek 30% of all homes delivere d as 
part of major  developments to be affordable, with the exception of brownfield sites.  We 
recognise that there are greater costs associated with bringing forward development s on 
brownfield sites than on greenfield sites.  Informed by our evidence on vi ability we will 
therefore seek a minimum of 10% affordable housing from major developments on 
brownfield sites.  
 
4.30.  In order to meet the national requirement for 10% of the overall  number of homes to be 
available for affordable home ownership on greenfield si tes, we will seek a tenure split of 
67% affordable housing for rent and 33% affordable home ownership (made up of 25% 
First Homes and 8% other affordable home ownership, prefera bly shared ownership).  
This is equivalent to 20%/10% of the total number of ho mes on the site.  We will seek a 
50%/50% split on brownfield sites to take account of our much greater need for rented 
affordable housing and the number of brownfield sites incl uded in our development 
strategy as part of urban intensification.  The 50% aff ordable home owner ship will be 
made up of 25% First Homes and 25% other affordable home ownership, preferably 
shared ownership.  
 
4.31.  In considering alternative tenure mixes the Coun cil will balance the need to meet the 
objectively assessed needs of our communi ties with the need  for flexibility to avoid delays 
to the delivery of housing. We will continue to work collaboratively with Registered 
Providers and housebuilders to consider a lternative mixes where there is a clear 
justification.  
 
 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  139 
 4.32.  In planning for affor dable housing, we have taken account of viability to ensure 
development schemes are not rendered undeliverable as a result of excessive obligations 
and policy burdens.  We have undertaken a whole plan viability study that includes the 
required level of aff ordable housing.  Where a developer considers that the requirement 
for affordable housing is making a site financially unviable, the applicant will be required 
to provide a viability appraisal that meets the requirements set out in the  Planning Practice 
Guidance and meet th e cost of an independent assessment of that appraisal 
commissioned by the Council to inform a discussion of the appropriate development of 
the site.   
 
4.33.  It may not always be viable or practical for sheltered housing or  extra care housing t o 
provide an element of affordable housing, this will be considered on a case by case basis.  
 
4.34.  Affordable housing should be provided on site as part of sustainable and mixed 
communities. Where there is a lack of a Registered Provider wi lling to acquire or m anage 
the affordab le homes, the Council will also consider proposals for the affordable homes 
to be gifted to the Council to add to its own social housing stock.  Exceptional 
circumstances may however justify alternative means of affor dable housing provisi on 
such as the use of a commuted sum in lieu of provision on site.  An example might be a 
preference from the local housing authority for local affordable housing need to be met in 
an alternative location.   
 
4.35.  We will work to ensure tha t housing proposals a re delivered on al l suitable sites and will 
invite interest from developers regarding providing new affordable homes for young first -
time buyers at discounted prices on underused or unviable commercial or industrial sites 
not currently  identified for housi ng, as part of our  support for entry -level exception sites.  
 
4.36.  Our policy follows the National Planning Policy Framework in only seeking contributions 
from applicants of major developments and excluding small sites of less than 10 
dwell ings.  However, devel opers are expected  to make efficient use of land and attempts 
to deliberately circumvent the local plan thresholds through the inefficient use of land or 
subdivision of sites will not be acceptable.   When considering whether a develop ment 
meets the thresh old for the provis ion of affordable housing the Council will consider the 
development potential of land adjacent to the site. Where the site forms part of a wider 
allocation or a larger area within the control of the applicant, which i s suitable for 
develo pment, this will b e taken into account to ensure comprehensive development and 
avoid piecemeal development which does not make appropriate provision of affordable 
housing.  
 
4.37.  We will monitor the delivery of affordable housing in our Auth ority Monitoring Repo rt. 
 
Policy H4: Affordable Housing  
 
We will seek 30% affordable housing from all major housing developments with the 
exception of brownfield sites where 10% affordable housing will be sought.   
 
  Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  140 
 We will seek the following tenure mix:  
 
 Total Affordable  % of Affordable 
Hom es for Rent  % of Affordable 
Homes for Ownership  
Greenfield  30% 67% 33% 
Brownfield  10% 50% 50% 
 
New affordable housing should be delivered on site and integrated with market housing 
unless there are exceptional circumstances which contr ibute to the creat ion of mixed 
communities.  
A clear justification supported by an independent viability assessment will be required if 
the applicant considers that particular circumstances justify the need for a lower level of 
provision.  
Developers are ex pected to make eff icient use of land and attempts to artificially reduce 
the scale of development to below the thres hold for providing affordable housing will not 
be acceptable.  
Contributions will not be sought from self -build or custom housebuilding devel opments.   
 
Rural Exception Sites  
 
4.38.  Our evidence shows that house prices and rents in rural areas are higher than in other 
parts of the Borough.  This and a smaller stock of dwellings can restrict choice and lead 
to limited availability of affordable housin g in rural areas.  Our development strategy 
involves restricting the amount and scale of development in the Countrys ide, which 
includes Smaller Villages and Hamlets.   
 
4.39.  We wish to address the lack of affordable housing options in our rural areas by using a  
rural exception s ites policy to meet local needs.  Households with a local need are those 
who are either current re sidents or have an existing family or employment connection but 
are unable to access market housing.  Our policy would allow developments th at provide 
afforda ble housing that meets those needs to take place outside the Limits to 
Development of settlements where it would not otherwise be allowed.   
 
4.40.  Rural exception sites will be limited to our Other Settlements, Small Villages and Hamlets 
with a population of le ss than 3,000.  Proposals for small scale rural exception sites will 
be expected to be adjacent, o r otherwise well -related, to the existing village or hamlet so 
that they are accessible and within a short and safe walk. Developments shoul d be 
appropriate i n scale, character, and appearance.  In terms of scale, sites should be less 
than 1ha in area or i ncrease the number of homes in the settlement by less than 5% of 
the existing housing stock, whichever is the smaller.  A high standard of d esign will be 
expe cted which seeks to minimise the development’s impact upon the landscape, the 
existing built form of the village or hamlet and its effect upon the role and function of the 
settlement.  
 
4.41.  The successful delivery of rural exception sites will  require a partner ship approach 
between the Borough Council, Parish Council, Registered Provider and the landowner.  
Neighbourhood plans provide a good opportunity for communities to identify the need and 
possible locations for rural exception sites.  Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  141 
  
4.42.  Prop osals must be supp orted by a Housing Needs Survey which demonstrates local 
housing need having regard to the Council ’s local lettings policy.  The format, method of 
analysis and geographical extent of any survey should be agreed with the Council.  Some 
market housing may be  acceptable where it subsidises the delivery of rural exception 
schemes as part of the same develo pment.  We will only do this where there is clear and 
robust evidence of the needs being met and the financial justification for the market 
housing being prop osed to deliver the scheme.  
 
4.43.  We will seek to address an identified local need in a single village/ hamlet or where a 
combined need can be identified across a group of villages/hamlets. The affordable 
homes provided will be allocated in acc ordance with the C ouncil’s Housing Allocations 
Policy to ensure they meet the needs of current residents or those wh o have an existing 
family or employment connection to the village(s)/hamlet(s) but are unable to access 
market housing.  
 
Policy H5: Rural E xception Sites  
 
We will support the provision of small -scale  developments in rural areas for affordable 
housing outside Limits to Development as an exception where:  
 
• the housing is demonstrated to meet an identified local need for affordable housing as 
set out in a Housing Needs Survey; and  
• development is adjacent,  or otherwise well -related, to a rural settlement, and respects 
the character of the settlement and its landscape setting.   
 
We will require, through a planning condition or legal agreement, that homes delivered as  
part of a rural exception site must remai n available as affordable housing in perpetuity.  
 
Self-build and Custom Housebuilding  
 
4.44.  Some people want to build or commission their own homes and we want to ensure our 
communities have the opport unity to do so as part of our strategy for meeting housing 
need.  Such schemes can include individual family homes and community housing 
projects.  The Council maintains a register of those interested in building their own home 
within Charnwood. Approximat ely half of these have no specific location in mind with the 
other half identifying an area of search.     
 
4.45.  Our evidence suggests that most of the demand in relation to these types of homes is for 
small sites in the countryside but that these are in limite d supply, and that  in terms of both 
number and affordability they are insufficient to meet the demand.  We will therefore 
support self -build or cus tom housebuilding in any location considered suitable for housing 
in accordance with our spatial strategy set  out in Policy DS1  and Policy C1 on 
development in the Countryside.  We will also encourage neighbourhood plan groups to 
identify suitable sites fo r self -build and custom housebuilding within their areas.  
 
 
 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  142 
 4.46.  There is also potential for larger housing sites  to include plots for self -build homes as a 
means of meeting the demand for this form of accommodation.  Our evidence tells us a 
small proportion of self -build plots as part of larger schemes is unlikely to adversely 
impact the viability of those sites.  A pplying this as a requirement to all development sites 
could be disruptive to the build out process and may not meet the needs of self and 
custom housebuilders, thus making it ineffective.  Instead, we will pro -actively encourage 
applicants to consider the  potential for inc luding plots for those wishing to build or 
commission their own homes as part of development proposals.  We will focu s on those 
areas where the demand can be identified from the register or other evidence, and on the 
largest sites where d isruption will hav e a less marked effect.  
 
4.47.  Contributions for affordable housing will not be sought from plots used to develop self and 
custom -built homes.  
 
Policy H6: Self-build and Custom Housebuilding  
 
We will support proposals for self -build and custom  housebuilding in locations considered 
suitable for housing in accordance with Policies DS1 and  C1. 
 
We will encourage the provision of serviced plots for self -build and custom housebuilding 
as part of an a ppropriate mix of dwellings on all major developmen ts in locations wh ere 
there is clear evidence of local demand.  
We will seek the provision of at least five serviced plots for self -build and custom 
housebuilding on sites of more than 250 dwellings.   
Whe re plots have been made available and marketed appr opriately for at l east 12 months 
and have not sold, the plots can be used to deliver general market housing.  
 
Houses in Multiple Occupation  
 
4.48.  A house in multiple occupation (HMO) is a property in which 3 or more unrelated people 
live together and share faci lities such as a k itchen and bathroom. There are two types of 
HMO:  
 
• Small HMOs: shared houses or flats occupied by between 3 and 6 unrelated 
individuals who share basic amenities, classified as C4 in the Use Classes Order; and  
• Large HMOs: those with more t han 6 people shari ng, unclassified by the Use Classes 
Order and described as being sui generis (of their own kind).  
 
4.49.  The number of properties used this way has grown in recent years.  Our evidence tel ls 
us that HMOs are meeting the needs of a range of soci al groups includin g students, low 
income households, young professionals, migrant workers, those going through a change 
in family circumstances and those who select HMOs as a preferred choice of 
accom modation such as weekday accommodation returning to anot her home at 
weeken ds.   
 
 
 
 Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  143 
 Concentrations of Houses in Multiple Occupation in Charnwood  
 
4.50.  Our evidence shows that there are two distinct dimensions to the local HMO market.  The 
student HMO market is fo cused around the northern, eastern and southern edges of  the 
Loughborough University campus, and in particular Storer Ward and Southfields Ward.  
The non -student HMO market is most marked in the eastern wards of Loughborough and 
to a lesser extent in other  larger settlements in the Borough and some outlying vil lages.  
Traditiona lly, HMOs in Loughborough were considered to be mainly used by students 
who attend Loughborough University or Loughborough College.  Our research has 
shown, however, that a high prop ortion (44%) is occupied by other groups in our 
communit y.  
 
4.51.  HMOs are an important part of the housing market which bring benefits to the community 
by providing affordable, flexible accommodation for those groups who otherwise may 
struggle to access housin g and those that require short term housing options, inc luding 
students.  Our student population makes a significant economic, social and cultural 
contribution to our Borough, which is valued.  
 
4.52.  However, some communities in Loughborough with a high concent ration of HMOs 
experience problems, including anti -socia l behaviour, noise , crime, poor maintenance of 
properties, lack of car parking, highway safety issues and an imbalance in the mix of the 
community which can leave community facilities under resourced.    
 
4.53.  Where there is a high proportion of HMOs occupied by  students it can a lso lead to a sharp 
contrast between busy term times and quieter periods during the holidays which impacts 
on social interactions, surveillance, local services and facilities. In ess ence, an over 
concentration of HMOs can lead to a loss o f community spirit  as long-standing  
communities are replaced by transient populations with less stake in the community.  
 
4.54.  We will continue to work closely with our partners, particularly local resident s’ groups, 
Leicestershire County Highways, Leicestershir e Police, Loughbor ough University and 
College and the Students’ Union, as well as the Council’s Private Sector Housing and 
Environmental Health Teams, to address issues arising from concentrations of houses in 
multiple occupation.  
 
4.55.  In recognition of the i ssues caused by th e concentration of HMOs in Loughborough, 
special powers were granted to us by the Secretary of State under an Article 4 Direction 
to remove permitted development rights to convert a home into a small HMO. The 
Direction means that in Lough borough planning p ermission is needed to use a house as 
a small HMO.  Planning permission has always been required for use as a large HMO 
and this remains the case for the whole of the Borough.  
 
Use o f Concentration Threshold in Loughborough  
 
4.56.  The developme nt of sustainable,  inclusive  and mixed communities is a key planning 
objective which aims to ensure the needs of different groups in the community are met.  
While the impact of a single new HMO or the expansion of an existing HMO may not 
always be signific ant on its own, it  can add t o the cumulative impact of a concentration of Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  144 
 HMOs on the character and amenity of an area and the sustainability of the local 
community.   
 
4.57.  In Loughborough, where the Article 4 Direction is in place, we will use a threshold 
approach to assess the cumulative impacts of HMOs on communities.  This will measure 
whether there is already a high concentration of HMO accommodation within an area 
where  a new HMO or expanded HMO is being proposed.  The threshold approach will 
apply to:  
 
• new small or lar ge HMOs;  
• conversions of existing small HMOs (3 -6 unrelated people) to large HMOs (more than 
6 unrelated people); and  
• extensions to existing large HMOs where this would not result in a change in their use 
class but would intensify the us e, e.g. the provis ion of additional bedrooms.   
 
4.58.  The policy will not apply to extensions to small HMOs which remain in the C4 use class.  
In those cases, the property can lawfully accommodate between 3 and 6 people as a 
small HMO.  Where planning permissio n for an extension  to an existing small HMO is 
required, the impact of the development on the amenity of people occupying the property 
and neighbouring properties, and on the character of the area will be considered in 
assessing proposals against other pol icies in the plan including Policies DS5 (Design) 
and H3 (Internal Space Standards).  
 
4.59.  In setting a threshold above which no further HMOs or expansion of existing HMOs will  
generally be granted planning permission, a balance needs to be struck.  There is a need 
to maintain m ixed and balanced communities, whilst not unnecessarily restricting the 
overall supply of HMOs across Loughborough and therefore limiting the housing ava ilable 
to meet the needs of the population as a whole.  Studies have indicated that l ocal 
communities b ecome unbalanced if more than 10% of properties are HMOs.  This is 
therefore the threshold that we will use.   
 
4.60.  Assessments of the current concentration of houses in multiple occupation in 
Loughborough will be undertaken using the followi ng method.     
 
• A 100m radius will be measured from the centre of the building to which the application 
applies.  
• The number of current HMOs will be measured as a proportio n of the total number of 
residential properties within the area defined by the radius . 
• A property will be included in a calculation where the centre of the property falls within 
the area defined by the radius.  
• Each dwelling house within the area defined by  the radius will be counted as a single 
property, regardless of the number of bedroom s. 
• Each HMO will b e counted as a single property, regardless of the number of 
bedrooms.  
 
4.61.  The 10% threshold provides a measure of the concentration of HMOs and therefore  the 
broad level of balance or imbalance in a community.  It is important to note howeve r that 
we will not  adopt a rigid approach to decision making, and our policy identifies other 
factors that will also be taken into account when determining app lications.  These include Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  145 
 factors that operate at the smaller scales of a house and its neighbour s and the street, 
which can also be important in affecting the impact of development on the character and 
amenity of a residential area.   
 
Local Geography in Loughborough  
 
4.62.  A number of factors relating to local geography will be considered in addition to t he 
threshold in or der to assess the impact of an additional or expanded HMO on community 
balance, and the character and amenity of the area.  These may indicat e that 
development in an area that exceeds the 10% threshold is acceptable or development in 
an area below the 10% threshold is unacceptable.  
 
4.63.  The number, location and size of large HMOs, and the presence of a halls of residence 
and purpose -built student a ccommodation within the area defined by the radius will be 
taken into account.  This is because t heir proximity, th e location of the main entrances 
and whether the facilities are managed could accentuate or diminish the cumulative 
impacts measured by the c oncentration of HMOs.  
 
4.64.  We will also consider the area in the immediate proximity of the property  to which the 
application relates and assess whether the concentration of HMOs in the surrounding 
street/s is significantly different to the overall proportion  in the area defined by the radius.  
 
4.65.  It may be appropriate in certain circumstances to exclude f rom the calculatio n parts of the 
area defined by the radius where the presence of any natural or other physical boundaries 
clearly separates them from the loca tion of the proposed development.  
 
4.66.  Our evidence has identified an issue with residential propert ies being sandwich ed 
between two HMO properties.  In these circumstances negative impacts from HMO 
properties can be exacerbated for occupants of the non -HMO p roperty.  The residents of 
the non -HMO property may also feel isolated from other residential pro perties on the 
street.  Our policy will resist an HMO where it would result in a residential property being 
sandwiched between two HMOs along the same side of a street.  This would not apply 
where the properties are separated by an intervening road.  
 
4.67.  Thes e matters expand u pon the concentration threshold approach and therefore only 
apply to Loughborough.  
 
Noise  
 
4.68.  HMOs can often be noisier than a family home because of the number of people living 
independently within the property.  There is likely to be a gre ater number of jou rneys up 
and down stairs and entering and exiting the property.  There is the potential for a greater 
number of electronic devices to be  in use at the same time including TVs and radios and 
there can also be increased noise created by sel f-closing doors fi tted for fire safety 
reasons.  Noise can adversely affect the amenity of neighbours and other local residents 
and the potential noise im pact of a proposed HMO will need to be considered.  
 
4.69.  In Loughborough, these impacts have been considere d as part of estab lishing the 
threshold approach to assessing cumulative impact.  Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  146 
 Character and Amenity  
 
4.70.  The impact of proposed HMOs on the character and amenity of an area will differ 
depending on the nature of the area and the effects of existing HMOs.   In Loughborough,  
these effects have informed the threshold approach used to assess cumulative impacts.  
Where available we will also conside r other evidence including standards of property 
maintenance, parking issues, reported crime and anti -social behav iour including noi se 
complaints, a fear of crime, accumulations of waste and rubbish, littering, fly -posting and 
the proliferation of letting signs to assess the existing impact of HMOs in a particular local 
area.  In Loughborough this will enable local fa ctors to form part  of the consideration of 
applications.  Outside Loughborough, where the threshold approach is not used, the 
evidence will en able an assessment to be made of the impact of existing HMOs on the 
area.  
 
4.71.  HMOs by their nature have the potential  to increase the n umber of cars associated with 
a single property and therefore to increase the pressure on the on-street  parking 
provision.  This can lead to problems such as traffic obstructions (to pedestrians, 
emergency vehicles and refuse vehicles) an d congestion.  Whi le highway safety will be 
an issue to consider for all applications, the harm to the residential amenity of the local 
area c aused by the number of cars associated with new HMO developments will also be 
an important consideration in determ ining applications . 
 
4.72.  One way of addressing the issue is to seek adequate off-street  parking and appropriate 
storage space for bikes.  However,  the removal of front gardens and curtilage features 
such as walls to provide additional off-street  parking can al so have a detrimen tal impact 
on the character and amenity of an area and so will need to be considered on a case by 
case basis.  
 
4.73.  The provision of secure, unobtrusive and accessible refuse and recycling storage away 
from the public highway but within easy a ccess to the front  of the property for collection 
can be beneficial in reducing the impact of new HMO development on amenity.   
 
Policy H7: Houses in Multiple Occupation  
 
We will support the well -being, character and amenity of our communities by managing  
the proportion of  houses in multiple occupation.  
   
We will support new houses in multiple occupation, conversions of small houses in 
multiple occupation to large houses in multiple occupation or extensions to large houses 
in multiple occupation in Lough borough where:   
• the concentration of houses in multip le occupation is less than 10% within the area 
defined by  a 100m radius from the centre of the building to which the application 
relates, or the development would not otherwise result in an over -concent ration of 
houses i n multiple occupation taking into ac count local geographical factors;  
• they do not result in a residential dwelling being sandwiched between two houses in 
multiple occupation; and  
  Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  147 
 • they do not, either cumulatively with other houses in mu ltiple occupation or in 
themselves, lead to:  
• adverse noise and disturbance which is detrimental to the amenity of the street or 
residential area;   
• on street car parking that would cause an unacceptable impact on highway safety, 
severe impacts on the road network , or cause detriment to the  amenity of the street 
or residential area; or  
• damage to the social and physical character and amenity of a street or residential 
area.   
 
We will support new or expanded large houses in multiple occupation outside of 
Lough borough that:   
• do not, either cumulatively w ith other houses in multiple occupation or in themselves, 
lead to:  
• adverse noise and disturbance which is detrimental to the amenity of the street or 
residential area;   
• on street car  parking that would cause an  unacceptable impa ct on highway safety, 
severe  impacts on the road network, or cause detriment to the amenity of the street 
or residential area; or  
• damage to the social and physical character and amenity of a street or residential 
area.  
 
Campus and Purpose -Built  Student Accommodation  
 
4.74.  Loughborough University and Loughborough College are important contributors to the 
local economy, both in terms of the number of people whom they employ and the 
investment that they attract  into the town.  The student populati on also contribute s to the 
town’s vitality.  
 
4.75.  Our evidence shows that the number of people studying at Loughborough University has 
continued to increase over the last five years, although more slowly than in the decade 
prior to that.  Although the Universit y has no plans to significantly increase the number of 
students, this trend is likely to continue.  There has also been an expansion in the 
provision of purpose -built student accommodation both on the University campus and 
elsewhere in Loughborough in rece nt years.  Loughbo rough College also provides some 
accommodation for its students.  
 
4.76.  The provision of new purpose -built student accommodation on the campuses of the 
University and College, or in other appropriate locations, meets the needs of students for 
this type of accomm odation.  It can also help reduce pressures on residential areas to 
accommodate students and, conseq uently, help meet the housing needs of other groups 
and address the issues associated with high concentrations of houses in multiple 
occup ation.   
 
4.77.  Given th e recent increase in the supply of campus and purpose -built student 
accommodation, our evidence conc ludes that there is no need to have a specific policy 
allocating sites for purpose -built accommodation in order to meet the needs of stude nts.  
We will supp ort new purpose -built student accommodation, both in the form of new 
buildings and the conversion of  existing buildings, in appropriate locations.   Chapter 4 Housing  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  148 
  
4.78.  We wish to see such developments generate the minimum number of vehicle movements 
throug h optimising oppor tunities for making use of sustainable modes of transport, for 
example through providing secure cycl e storage as part of the development, and such 
measures as no car provisions in tenancy agreements.  
 
4.79.  The Loughborough Student Street Suppo rt Scheme provides  welfare support to students 
and minimises night -time noise disturbance to local residents through p roviding street 
patrols on routes used by students.  New off -campus student accommodation can result 
in changes to the pattern of pedestri an traffic between  the campus, the town centre and 
the accommodation.  It may be appropriate for new off -campus studen t accommodation 
to contribute to the additional costs of patrolling new routes or increased patrolling of 
existing routes associated with the development.  
 
4.80.  Providers of new purpose -built student accommodation are encouraged to respond 
positively to the nee ds of students in terms of providing an appropriate proportion of lower 
cost accommodation, providing 24 -hour warden services, and adoptin g the 
ANUK/UNIPOL National Code.   
 
Policy H8: Campus and Purpose- Built  Student Accommodation  
 
Additional student housing provision within the campuses of Loughborough University 
and Loughborough College will be supported.  
 
Additional off -campus purpose -built  student accomm odation will be supported provided 
it:  
• is located to be well -related to either Loughborough town centre or the campuses of 
Loughborough University and Loughborough College;  
• has good access to suitable bus routes or is within easy cycling  or walking distan ce of 
the campuses;  
• minimises the vehicl e traffic generated by the development;  
• avoids damage to the social and physical character and amenity of the local area taking 
account of the cumulative impacts of the development and other simila r uses; and  
• contri butes to the cost of the Loughborough St udent Street Support Scheme, where 
the development will result in additional patrols.  
 
Development proposals for off-campus purpose -built  student accommodation should be 
accompanied by a Design and Access Statement, or similar document, that sets how 
issue s of sustainable transport and the potential impacts of the development on the local 
community have been addressed.

 Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
 
4.81.  The Government has an overar ching aim to ensur e the fair and equal treatment of gypsies 
and travellers that facilitates their traditional and nomadic way of life whilst respecting the 
interests of the settled community. To inform our policies we have worke d with other 
Leicestershire local authorities to assess the need for sites to accommodate gypsies’, 
travellers’ and travelling showpeople’ s  needs.    
 
4.82.  The Sustainable Urban Extensions North East of Leicester, West of Loughborough and 
North of Birstall include provision for permanent  pitches for gypsi es and travellers or plots 
for travelling showpeople to meet identified needs.  These are being implemente d as 
follows:  
 
• Land for 4 gypsy and traveller pitches and 4 travelling showpeople plots as part of the 
North East of Leicester Susta inable Urban Exten sion;  
• Land for 4 gypsy and traveller pitches and 4 travelling showpeople plots as part of the 
West of Lou ghborough Sustainable Urban Extension;  
• 4 plots for travelling showpeople as part of the North of Birstall Sustainable Urban 
Extensi on.  
 
4.83.  We will moni tor the delivery of plots and pitches, including those at the Sustainable Urban 
Extensions, to ensure they  are provided within agreed timescales.  
 
4.84.  Our evidence shows that there are no additional needs for permanent pitches for gypsies 
and travellers or plo ts for travelling showpeople in Charnwood for the period up to 2037.  
There remains a need for transit sit es across the county, particularly in the north west of 
the county and the city of Leicester, and we are working with other local au thorities in 
Leice ster and Leicestershire to identify and bring forward sites in the areas of greatest 
need for transit prov ision.  
 
Policy H9: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
 
We will support sites for gypsies, travellers and travelling show people to meet an identified 
need that are:  
 
• designed to create a safe and healthy environment for residents;  
• appropriate in scale;  
• well related to local infrastructure and services including shops, schools and health 
facilities;   
• sensitively designed to avoid unacceptable  adverse impacts on the cha racter, 
appearance and amenity of the locality; and  ensure safe access for the movement of 
vehicles to and from the site with provision for parking and servicing within the site.  
 
  Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  150 
 Chapter 5 Employment  
 
Our Eco nomy and Labour Ma rket 
 
5.1. Charnwood is centrally located in England and is the largest district by population in 
Leicestershire and one of the largest in the country. Leicester, Nottingham and Derby are 
within easy reach whilst the Midland Mainline railway, M1 motorway and Ea st Mid lands 
Airport provide good connections with more distant destinations, and this makes 
Charnwood an extremely attractive location for business.  
 
5.2. Loughborough is a big driver for the local economy in the north of the Borough, with the  
high technology m anufacturing and knowledge -based industries an important sector for 
the town.   The Charnwood economy also has a strong relationship with Leicester and 
our economic fortunes are closely linked to the city. Businesses in the south of the 
Borough  benefit fro m their proximity to the city and 15,000 residents living in Charnwood 
travel to work in the city.  
 
5.3. We produced an Economic Development Strategy for Charnwood in 2018 and following 
the Covid -19 global pandemic we have been working with ou r part ners to cont ribute to 
an Economic Recovery Strategy for the Leicester and Leicestershire area.  Our ‘in 
Charnwood’ initiative aims to create a strong economy for the Charnwood area by working 
closely with other parts of the Council, businesses and wi th a w ide range of  partner 
organisations to encourage inward investment and business growth. Charnwood has 
significant economic growth potential, and our policies are designed to help facilitate that.  
 
5.4. In 2019 there were around 79,000 jobs in Charnwood wit h our businesses p roducing 
goods and providing services worth £3.5 billion a year to the economy. The education 
sector and professional, scientific and technical activities are particularly well represented 
compared to the national average. This reflects t he imp ortance of L oughborough 
University and Loughborough College to the local economy. Despite a 35% decline in 
employment in manufacturing from 2000 to 2016, this sector is still substantially larger in 
Charnwood than the regional and national average.  
 
5.5. The Bo rough’s aver age wage is very similar to that of the East Midlands and the wider 
country whilst the number of our residents claiming out -of-work benefits is lower than the 
national average and that of the East Midlands.  Unemployment levels are also l ower t han 
the nati onal and regional average. However, there are still areas of Charnwood which 
suffer from higher unemployment, lower wages and lower levels of educational 
attainment, especially in our Priority Neighbourhoods of Loughborough East, 
Loughbor ough W est, Mountso rrel and South Charnwood (part of Thurmaston and 
Syston).  
 
Charnwood’s Future Economy  
 
5.6. We want to create a strong and lasting economy which will encourage the success of our 
businesses and in turn provide jobs and a better quality of life  for all our resid ents.  
 
 
 Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  151 
 5.7. Our development strategy sets out our approach to meeting employment needs in the 
Borough.  We want to ensure that businesses in Charnwood can access suitable 
premises which enable them to thrive.  We also want to attract new in ward investment.  
Our aim is to encourage a flexible supply of land which can respond to a changing market 
and working practices, encourage competition and maximise economic growth.  We will 
help facilitate the supply of major employment sites and make pro vision  for the sup ply of 
land and property which encourages the establishment and growth of small and medium 
sized businesses.  
 
5.8. Innovation is important for value creation, growth, competitiveness and employment.  We 
will capitalise on this by taking advant age of  the presenc e of Loughborough University, 
the Loughborough and Leicester Science and Innovation Enterprise Zone sites, our 
existing businesses that are involved in innovation and leading -edge technologies and 
the excellent transport links in our Boro ugh.  
 
5.9. We will con tinue to support our Enterprise Zone sites of Loughborough Science and 
Enterprise Park and Charnwood Campus as centres for high value, knowledge -based 
businesses. We will seek opportunities to support the forward funding of infrastructure  
and b uildings wit hin the Enterprise Zone area through the use of future business rate 
receipts to ensure a significant boost to our economy. We will also use these receipts to 
support initiatives which help provide training and improve the skills required  to es tablish, 
improve and grow businesses.  
 
5.10.  Just to the north of the Borough, East Midlands Airport and the East Midlands Gateway 
provide employment opportunities for some of our residents. The Leicester and 
Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan has ident ified the Leicestershire International 
Gateway, focussed around these sites, as an area with the potential for further growth 
and employment. To promote the potential of this area we will work collaboratively with 
our partners on any major employment oppor tunities proposed outside Charnwood which 
contribute to the Leicestershire International Gateway and seek to improve access to 
them from Charnwood.  
 
5.11.  Shepshed has provided a focus for our housing growth and to support this development 
and our regeneration aims for the town,  along with the International Gateway, we have 
allocated 5 hectares for employment on land off Fairway Road to provide the opportuni ty 
for new employment premises to be built in the town.  
 
5.12.  The economic relationship between south Charnwoo d and the city of Leicester provides 
an opportunity to encourage new manufacturing and small warehousing jobs within 
Charnwood to take advantage from business investment and expansion that may not be 
able to take place in the city.  
 
5.13.  Our evidence forecasts  a growth in offic e related jobs to 2037. Around half of this growth 
will be focussed in professional services with the rest spread across a range of sectors.  
We recognise that the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic has altered the way many 
companies have op erated and may wel l alter future working patterns for such jobs, and 
this will be monitored through the plan period as the economy settles. There has been a 
rise in homeworking over recent years, driven by improvements in technology which has 
accelerated d uring the pandemic . We will support opportunities for live/work units which  
consist of both commercial/office space and a residential component where this does not 
affect residential amenity or lead to conflict with commercial activities.  
 Chapter 5 E mployment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  152 
 5.14.  Development can provide opportunit ies for our communities through the provision of new 
jobs and training prospects. We will encourage developers to demonstrate how jo b and 
training opportunities can be made accessible to residents, particularly those from priority 
neighbo urhoods, through p lanning obligations. The availability of new jobs can support 
our local residents whilst the raising of skills levels will help incr ease the productivity and 
competitiveness of the Charnwood economy.  
 
5.15.  In the manufacturing sector, the decl ine in jobs is forecast to slow down compared to past 
rates and as a result manufacturing is likely to remain an important part of our local 
economy in future years and we will seek to support this. Alongside Covid -19,  the 
departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union is also likely to have 
implications for our economy and how it operates in the future; however, these impacts 
cannot be define d with any great certainty at present and their precise nature is likely to 
remain unknown for several yea rs. 
 
5.16.  To encourage the establishment of small and medium sized businesses we will ensure 
the provision of land and buildings to meet their needs whilst  facilitating the supply of 
major employment sites and their delivery. Our evidence has also identified th at there is 
a stro ng demand for smaller freehold industrial units and additional development for such 
units to meet this need will be supported provid ed it is in suitable locations.  
 
5.17.  Our evidence regarding employment land highlights that our existing land  supply 
commitment s are sufficient to provide choice and flexibility to meet our needs.  The 
oversupply of land identified will allow us to respond to  any changes in demand, including 
unmet employment needs from within the city of Leicester in the south of  the Borough.  
 
5.18.  Amendments to the town and country planning regulations have established that Class E 
now covers a range of commercial, business and se rvice uses. Where a proposal is 
meeting a demonstrable need in support of the local economy, we will consi der using 
specific conditions to restrict permitted development rights within the new Class E.   
 
5.19.  To create favourable conditions for the growth of ou r economy requires good 
infrastructure and a built environment which suits the needs of businesses so they  can 
thrive. We wi ll support and influence infrastructure providers to meet the future needs of 
existing and new businesses.  
 
5.20.  Neighbourhood plans pro vide local communities with the opportunity to make decisions 
about employment for example stipulating the  type of jobs need ed, the scale of 
employment and its location.  We will encourage our communities through neighbourhood 
plans and supported by approp riate evidence to identify employment opportunities in their 
local area.  
 
Regeneration  
 
5.21.  We want to help a ll our towns and v illages to thrive, and to revitalise and further improve 
our urban areas which will support our vision and objectives. We will encourage 
development which improves the urban environment and rejuvenates the economy. Our 
overall development  strategy of urban  intensification and concentration aims to support 
the vitality and viability of existing centres. We want to encourage people to live close to 
the urban centres in the Borough to promote the future success of those centr es by 
boosting fo otfall and the local economy. We will support the regeneration of existing Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  153 
 employment sites to support our urban areas and ensure the efficient use of brownfield 
land.  
 
5.22.  We have identified priorities for regeneration at Thurmaston in our place -based  policie s.  
We also recogn ise the importance of regenerating the centres of Loughborough and 
Shepshed, as the major urban areas in the north of our Borough. We have developed 
Masterplans and identified place -based  policies which will assist in their revitalisation . 
 
Policy E1: Meet ing Employment Needs  
 
By 2037 we will meet the economic needs of our communities and continue to contribute 
to supporting the economic needs of Leices ter.  We will do this by supporting development 
that:  
 
• contributes to delivering our em ployment needs, in  accordance with Policies DS1 and 
DS4;  
• supports the expansion of the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park, in 
accordance with Policy LUC3;  
• encourag es a greater proportion of high technology and knowledge -based  businesses 
in Loughborou gh; 
• provides oppor tunities for manufacturing businesses to develop, re -locate and expand;  
• supports proposals that provide flexible accommodation, including for offices and 
managed workspace;    
• provides opportunities for small -scale, high quality business units and offices,  
including freehold industrial units;  
• supports business and employment regeneration opportunities which support our 
Priority Neighbourhoods and existing urban areas;  
• seeks to provide employment and training schemes to maximise local emp loyment 
opportunit ies and help address skills deficits in the  local population ; and  
• supports and promotes transport, power and broadband infrastructure which facilitates 
employment developments.  
 
We will consider the use of planning conditions for applicat ions which are for  offices, 
research and development or light industrial uses (Use C lass E (g)) to ensure that they 
remain within that use in perpetuity.  
 
Protecting Our Existing Employment Sites  
 
5.23.  We want to prevent the loss of good quality employment site s to alternative u ses as our 
evidence identifies that these sites have low vacancy rates and are needed to maintain a 
supply of land and buildings for new and growing businesses. Employment uses are 
generally considered to fall within the B and E Use Class es along with some  sui generis 
employment uses; however, we also recognise that there may be occasions when other 
employment generating commercial uses may be acceptable.  
 
5.24.  The Policies Map identifies the good quality employment sites which should be 
safegu arded, based on ou r evidence of their attractiveness to occupiers, accessib ility and 
compatibility with their surroundings.   
 
 Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  154 
 5.25.  We will require any proposal involving the loss of commercial accommodation or land to 
demonstrate that there are no reasonable prospects that the  site will be required for 
employment use in the future t hrough proportionate marketing relevant to the site’s 
circumstances and setting, and the market demand at that point in time.  
 
5.26.  We recognise that recent changes to the Use Classes Or der and General Pe rmitted 
Development Order will mean that some alterations  to a building’s function and operation 
may no longer be controlled by the planning system. However, to provide a range of 
employment sites and limit the need for development on gre enfield land we wi ll look to 
ensure that existing employment sites, premise s and allocations that are viable for 
continued use are safeguarded where possible to maintain job opportunities and protect 
the economic health of our Borough. Where we are able, w e will seek to ens ure the 
release of viable employment sites or premises to  other uses may only be made where 
their loss would not cause harm to business or employment opportunities, or where there 
are unacceptable amenity impacts for local residents. This  policy will be ap plied to not 
only new floorspace, but also to change of u se (where appropriate) and variations of 
conditions to remove or amend restrictions on how units operate in practice.  
 
5.27.  The marketing evidence submitted with a planning application s hould demonstrate:  
 
• that the site or land has been widely advertised and ma rketed for a wide range of 
economic uses for at least one year, including offering the site for both freehold and 
leasehold interest; 
• that the site or land has been offered at value s reflective of cu rrent market values, 
including benchmarking with similar sites in the market area;  
• details of any interest received from potential buyers or tenants since marketing 
commenced, including expla nation of why this was not pursued; and  
• viabili ty testing of indi cative schemes where sites or land are undeveloped, or property 
needs to be redeveloped.  
 
5.28.  We will consider sites on an individual basis to take account of specific circumstances 
including the  relationship with, and amenity of, adjoining s ites. It may be po ssible for an 
employment site which cannot remain wholly in employment use to become a mixed -use 
development to offset part of the loss of employment space. This should be considered 
prior to  total loss of the site.  
 
5.29.  Our allocated sites, which are not yet developed, may not be brought forward for several 
years. These sites contribute towards our medium and long -term supply of employment 
land and allow the economy to respond flexibly to demand over time. We would, therefore, 
not normally ex pect them to be co nsidered for alternative uses.  
 
Policy E2: Protecting Existing Employment Sites  
 
Existing good quality employment sites, as identified on the Policies Map, will be protected 
for employment uses unless it can be demonstrated that:  
• the site  or land has no re asonable prospect of being re -occupied or redeveloped for a 
new employment use;  
• the proposed use would contribute to delivering the wider local plan objectives in 
accordance with Policy DS1;  Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  155 
 • immediately prior to submission of a relevant planning applicati on the site or land has 
been widely advertised and marketed for a wide range of economic uses at reasonable 
market values for at least one continuous year;  
• consideration has been given to mixed use development of the site including 
employ ment uses; and  
• the alternative use is small scale, complimentary and ancillary to the main employment 
use of the site.  
 
For other existing employment sites, not identified as good quality on the Policies Map, 
proposals for alternative uses will be supporte d where it can be demonstrated that:  
 
• the property or land is vacant and has been unsuccess fully marketed for employment 
use for at least six months, at reasonable market values; and  
• the change would result in amenity or environmental benefits to the adja cent uses or 
area.  
 
Warehousing and Logistics  
 
5.30.  The logistics and distribution industry now form a significant part of the UK’s economy as 
goods flow from the manufacturer to the general public via suppliers, retailers and their 
distribution centres. Leices tershire, and the wider Midlands area, occupies a central 
location in the country with exce llent transport links and as such is considered a prime 
location for large scale B8 warehouse and distribution operations, making it of regional 
and national signifi cance to the strat egic distribution sector. The commercial buildings 
(strategic warehouses)  used in these strategic storage and distribution operations are 
large scale and relate to units where the individual unit size is over 9,000sqm (or 
approximately 10 0,000sqft), a stan dard definition within the commercial property sector.  
 
5.31.  We recognise that the sub -regional, regional and national scale at which the strategic 
distribution and logistics sector operates requires significant cross boundary cooperation 
to meet their developm ent needs. We have joined with our local authority partn ers across 
the Functional Economic Market Area to produce an evidence base which examines the 
current and future needs of the sector, with an emphasis  on future floorspace and land 
requirements. Howev er, delivering new commercially attractive strategic sit es on this 
scale to proactively drive and support sustainable economic development cannot be 
undertaken by Charnwood working alone.  
 
5.32.  We will use our evidence base, through the duty t o cooperate, to en sure continued long -
term strategic and collaborative pla nning across the county of Leicestershire, and 
potentially with authorities in neighbouring areas, to identify and deliver the needs of this 
industry. Our evidence recognises that th e prime locations for strategic distribution 
operations are influenced by several criteria which are required to ensure they can 
operate efficiently: for example, good connectivity with the strategic road network and 
accessibility to a suitable workforce.  
 
5.33.  These factors wi ll be used, with our partners, to identify potential are as of opportunity for 
such development. When identifying sites, a sequential approach is also recommended 
which ensures that existing sites are sufficiently exhausted first; followed  by extensions 
of these sites; then satellite sites near existing sites; t hen brownfield; and finally, new 
greenfield sites.  
 Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  156 
 5.34.  We will seek to ensure that any proposals for strategic distribution development meet the 
vision and objectives in this plan of s upporting our stro ng and diverse economy and 
enhancing the role of  knowled ge-based industries in Charnwood. Proposals for strategic 
warehousing will be determined against other policies in this plan to assess their impacts 
upon factors such as residential amenity, sustainab le construction and impact on the 
character and appearan ce of an area.  
 
5.35.  Alongside the strategic distribution warehouses themselves the logistics industry also has 
further requirements at different points in the supply chain, which include  consolidation 
centres and last mile delivery facilities, along with HGV p arking and associated amenities. 
We will support such development and its contribution to the wider supply chain, subject 
to the other policies in this plan.  
 
Our Rural Economy  
 
5.36.  Our rural areas have c hanged with the continued mechanisation of agriculture a nd 
consolidation of holdings into larger farms. Jobs in agriculture have declined considerably 
and are forecast to continue to do so and we want to ensure the economic viability of r ural 
communities a nd enterprises. Our rural areas generally have less acce ss to public 
transport, and it is important that local services and facilities are supported. We are 
proposing to support the regeneration and diversification of the rural economy wh ilst 
protecting th e character and appearance of the countryside and our ru ral communities.  
 
Small Scale Business Development in Villages  
 
5.37.  We will support development which is not detrimental to the character and appearance of 
the countryside and will provi de employment oppo rtunities in our rural areas for local 
communities. Neig hbourhood plans provide an opportunity for local communities to take 
the lead in deciding how to balance the employment needs of their communities and 
several have already done so.  
 
Re-use of Rural Bu ildings  
 
5.38.  We will help our rural economy by supporting th e reuse of redundant or under used rural 
buildings for small scale business activities compatible with countryside locations. This 
can also help preserve historic agricultural buildi ngs whilst support ing local economies.  
 
Farm Diversification  
 
5.39.  Farm diversification can help farmers by providing sources of income which allow them 
to continue to farm and manage the land. Successful farm diversification activities include 
small farm shops , processing and s elling produce from the farm, craft workshops, sm all 
businesses, bed and breakfast and holiday accommodation.  We will support activities 
which are compatible with a countryside location as long as farming remains the dominant 
business ac tivity.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  157 
 Equine Businesses  
 
5.40.  The keeping of horses in the Borough makes a valuable contribution to our countryside 
and the rural economy. We will support the development of our horse related industry 
which provides opportunities for leisure, tourism a nd farm diversific ation along with  the 
related farriery, saddlery, feed trades and specialist equine veterinary services. New 
development proposals of this nature will however need careful consideration in terms of 
their impact on the character and appeara nce of the country side.  
 
Tourism a nd Leisure  
 
5.41.  Tourism in Charnwood contributed £304 million to our economy per year as of 2018  and 
the Borough attracts over 6.01 million visitors a year.  The Charnwood Tourism Strategy 
found that tourism supports over 6,000  jobs in more than  900 businesses in the Borough. 
There are several popular attractions in our Borough such as the Charnwood Museum, 
Loughborough Town Hall, the Carillon Court Shopping Centre, Great Central Railway, 
Taylors Bell Foundry, Bradgate Park, Gra nd Union Canal and  various other c ountry parks. 
We recognise the important role tourism and leisure plays in the Borough’s rural areas 
and overall economy and will support our partners to continue to grow the tourism sector 
in our Borough.  
 
5.42.  The Great Centr al Railway plays a  significant rol e for our rural tourism offer with stations 
at Rothley and Quorn providing a focus for tourism activity.  We will continue to work with 
the Great Central Railway to support the future success of this heritage line.  
 
5.43.  We wil l continue to work  with the River Soar and Grand Union Canal Partnership to 
harness the potential of the waterway and make it more attractive to visitors.  The policy 
will support development which improves accessibility and facilities for canal related 
tourism development.  
 
5.44.  There is also potential for rural tourism based on the enjoyment of the countryside, our 
rich built heritage, festivals and events supported by restaurants, cafés, bars and public 
houses.  
 
5.45.  Charnwood Forest is a unique and important land scape which is rel ated to the wide r 
National Forest. With our partners in the Charnwood Forest Regional Park, we will 
promote sustainable leisure and tourism, manage and promote landscape and settlement 
character and support agricultural diversification an d woodland and rur al economy uses.   
 
Small Scale Expansion of Existing Businesses in the Countryside  
 
5.46.  There are a number of existing businesses across the rural areas of the Borough including 
offices, warehousing and manufacturing operations. Some, such as  those at Wymeswol d 
and Rearsby, are associated with redundant military and civil airfields. Whilst th ese sites 
are not good locations for businesses that create a significant number of vehicle 
movements, some types of business can contribute to the local economy and provid e 
jobs for our village communities. We will support small scale expansion or intensi fication 
of these types of business provided it is sensitive to the character and appearance of the 
Countryside.  
 
 Chapter 5 Employment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  158 
 Policy E3: Rural Economic Development  
 
We will maximise  the potential of our rural economy by 2037 by supporting development 
that:  
 
• provides small scale, sustainable growth and expansion of existing businesses in rural 
areas both through conversion of existing buildings and well -designed new bu ildings;  
• enables  farm diversification where farming remains the dominant element of the 
business; 
• provides superfast broadband networks for all homes and businesses;  
• provides tourism and leisure facilities, particularly developments that benefit the Great  
Central Railway, the River Soar and Grand Union Canal, the National Forest Strategy 
and the Charnwood Forest Regional Park; and  
• is not detrimental to the character an d appearance of the Countryside in terms of its 
scale, character or operational requireme nts.

Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  159 
 Chapter 6 T own Centres, Services and Facilities  
 
Town  Centres  
 
6.1. Town,  district  and local centres  are the focal  point  of communities.   They  provide  local 
access  to goods,  services,  leisure  facilities,  social  interaction  and employment  and are 
therefore  an essential  part of sustainable  communities.   Our centres  are set within  the 
historic core of our towns  and villages  and contain  significant  heritage  assets  that are 
integral  to their sense  of place.      
 
6.2. Our vision and objectives include support for st rong, vibrant and healthy communities.  
This policy applies to proposals for main to wn centre uses and proposals within defined 
centres  and needs to be considered alongside other policies in the local plan.  Policy DS1 
sets out the scale and pattern of dev elopment for retai l uses for the local plan as whole.  
Policies for specific places are set in the place -based  policies including the Baxter Gate/ 
Pinfold Gate Opportunity Site in Loughborough to meet need for retail uses, as well as 
our regeneration and o ther priorities fo r different centres in Charnwood.  
 
6.3. To achieve our vision and objec tives, planning decisions need to ensure that there is a 
network of vibrant centres, so residents have good access to a range of shops, services 
and facilities at the heart  of their communit ies.  The vitality and viability of centres will be 
supported by d evelopments that provide a range of uses, that encourage a strong daytime 
and evening economy that enhance local employment opportunities and spend.  High 
quality design of  buildings and spa ces including the retention of traditional shop frontages, 
avoidan ce of ‘dead frontages’, providing for the ease of movement and attractive public 
realm will enhance the visual interest of centres and create safe places where people 
want to spend time toge ther.   We will support appropriate residential uses within centre s, 
particularly at upper floor levels, to make the best use of underused floorspace and to 
enhance activity, footfall and natural surveillance.  
 
6.4. Our evidence establishes i ndividual centre b oundaries which are identified on the Policies 
Map and which are w ithin the following hierarchy:  
 
• Town Centre  (Loughborough) – provides the principal focus for retail, leisure, offices, 
arts, tourism and cultural activities in the Borough . A ‘primary shopp ing area’ is 
identified defining the area where retail development  is concentrated within the town 
centre.  
• District Centres  (Anstey; Barrow upon Soar; Birstall; Gorse Covert; Shelthorpe; 
Shepshed, Sileby; and Syston) – provide day -to-day retail and servic e needs that 
typically arise for a wider local catchment, usually comprised of groups of shops, at 
least one supermarket, and a range of non -retail facilities such as banks, healthcare, 
religious institutions, restaurants or a library.  
• Local Centres – (Mou ntsorrel; Rothley; Sharpley Road Loughborough; Quorn; and 
Melton R oad, Thurmaston) – provide a range of small convenience shops that serve 
a small local catchment and, in most cases, non -retail facilities such as a religious 
institution o r community hall.  
 
 Chapter 6 Town Centres, Services and Facilities  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  160 
  
Sequential  Test and Impact  Assessment  
 
6.5. We want to see main town centre uses being developed in our town centres rather than 
other locations.  Development of such uses outside of our defined centres will not help us 
to deliver our visio n.  We will apply a sequential approach to the location of new town 
centres uses  which prioritises sites in centres, ahead of those in edge of centres or then 
out of centre locations.  
 
6.6. The sequential test will be applied to proposals for main town centre u ses, including 
developments involving mezzanine installations and variation of c ondition applications 
(for example to extend hours of operation or the range of goods sold). The sequential test 
will not be applied to proposals for small -scale rural economic  development such as for a 
small -scale  shops that is ancillary to a tourism use or farm, or the expansion or a rural 
business which involves minimal new floorspace (see policy E3). Similarly, the sequential 
test will not be applied to proposals for changes  of use for a unit  within existing 
undesignated small parades of shops that prov ide goods or services for a local 
neighbourhood catchment.  
 
6.7. Our evidence has established local impact assessment thresholds which are reflected in 
the policy. When applying th e assessment thres holds, the size of proposals will be 
assessed as the proposed gross internal area.  
 
Permitted  Development  
 
6.8. We will help create  the conditions  in which  businesses  can invest,  expand  and adapt  
whilst balancing  this with supporting  the viability of Charnwood’s  designated  centres.   
Where  permitted  development  rights  exist that could  result  in subsequent  alterations/use  
changes  that could  undermine  the aims  of the sequential  approach,  we will consider 
attaching  specific  planning  conditions  in order to support  the viability  of town  centres.   
This will be considered  on a case -by-case  basis  but could  include  for example  restricting  
the sale of certain  goods  and services  and restricting  chang es of use.  
 
Hot Food Takeaways  
 
6.9. Hot food takeaways  contri bute to the mix of uses  in centres  and can support  local evening  
economies.   However,  concentrations  of hot food takeaways,  particularly  on prominent  
streets  or retail  frontages,  can detract  from the overall  appearance  of centres  due to their 
predominant  evening  use which  can result  in a lack of street  activity  in the daytime.   They  
can lead to the generation  of significant  litter,  including  food waste,  and to short  term 
parking  outside  takeaways  leading  to congestion.   Our evidence  tells us that the 
concen tration  of hot food takeaways  in specific  locations,  particularly  in Birstall  and 
Shelthorpe  District  Centres,  detracts  from their vitality.   We  want  to manage  the 
concentration  of hot food takeaways  to support  the vitality  and viability of our centres.   
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 6 Town Centres, Serv ices and Facilities  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  161 
 Policy T1: Town Centres and Retail  
 
The hierarchy  of centres  in Charnwood Borough  is defined  below  and their  boundaries  are 
identified  on the Policies  Map: 
 
• Town  Centres:  Loughborough  
• District  Centres:  Anstey;  Barrow  upon Soar;  Birstall;  Gorse  Covert  (Loughborough);  
Shelthorpe  (Loughborough);  Shepshed,  Sileby;  and Syston  
• Local  Centres:  Mountsorrel;  Rothley;  Sharpley  Road  (Loughborough);  Quorn;  and 
Melton  Road  (Thurmaston).  
 
We will make  a significant contribution  to the vitality  and viability  of our town, district  and 
local centres.   We will do this by supporting  development  for main  town  centre  uses  within  
centres  that:  
 
• widens  the range  of main  town  centre  uses  in the centre;  
• supports  activity  throughout  the day and into the night;  
• are physically  integ rated  within  the centre  and enhance  the centre’s  compact and 
walkable  character; 
• makes  use of above  ground  floor  spaces,  including  for residential  use, whilst  
maintaining  main  town  centre  uses  at ground floor;   
• addresses  specific  regeneration  priorities  for Loughborough,  Shepshed  and 
Thurmaston  (see policies  LUC1,  SUA1  and SC1);   
• enhances  existing  or create  new markets;  
• main tains  street  frontage  activity  which  encourages activity  within  the Centre  (such as

walkable  character; 
• ensures  that proposed  signage  does  not detract  from  the character  and appearance  of 
the surrounding  area;  
• maintains  and enhance  histori c shopfront  features;  and  
• provides  appropriate  access  for building  servicing.  
 
We will apply  a sequenti al approach  to the location  of proposals  for main  town  centre  uses.  
Town  centre  uses  will be directed  to defined  centre  locations,  then edge  of centre  
locations,  and only if suitable  sites  are not available  (or expected  to become  available

We will require  an impact  assessment  for proposals  (including  the formation of mezzanine  
floors)  for/or  which include  retail,  leisure  and office  developments  which  are not located  
within  a defined  centre  where:  
 
• the proposal  provides  a floorspace  greater  than  500sqm gross;  or  
• the proposal  is located  within  800m  of the boundary  of a District  Centre  and is greater  
than  300sqm gross;  or

Proposals that result  in clusters of hot food  takeaway  uses  will not be supported,  taking  
account  of the concentration  and proximity  of existing such  establishments  in the 
immediate  area.  
 
Protection of Community Facilities  
 
6.10.  Community facilities are essential to ensure and maintain a high quality of life for those 
people who visit, live and work in both the urban and rural ar eas of our Borough. We will 
protect and where possible, enhance, viable and necessary community facilities which 
play an important role in social interaction and community cohesion.  
 
6.11.  Neighbourhood plans play an important role in allowing local communities to identify, 
protect and enhance community facilities which are important to  their neighbourhood 
area. Through neighbourhood planning, local communities can identify important local 
facilities, including those on the statutory list of ass ets of community v alue, and develop 
appropriate solutions for their retention and enhancement.  
 
6.12.  For the purpose of this policy, community facilities are defined as follows:  
 
Facilities and uses generally available to and used by the local community at larg e for the 
purposes  of leisure, social interaction, health and well -being or learning. This wil l include, 
but not be confined to, community centres, historic and community public houses, 
premises for indoor sport, leisure and cultural centres, places of wor ship, doctor’s 
surgeries/ health centres, crèches, playgroups, libraries, schools and other tr aining and 
educational facilities . 
 
Policy T2: Protection of Community Facilities  
 
We will protect community facilities and support their enhancement. Development  
resulting in the loss of an existing community facility will only be permitted where:  
 
• suitable alternative provision exists or will be provided in an equally accessible or more 
accessible location within 800m walking distance; or  
• all reasonable efforts h ave been made to p reserve the facility, but it has been 
demonstrated that it would not b e economically viable, feasible or practicable to retain 
the building or site for its existing use; and  
• evidence is provided to confirm that the property or site has be en marketed at a 
reasonable value according to size, condition and exiting use without development 
potential for a meaningful period, of at least for example 12 months, and that there is 
no realistic interest in its retention for the current use or for an alternative commun ity 
use.

 Car Parking  
 
6.13.  The availability of residential and non -residential parking is important in our Borough as 
it can have a major influence on the way in which people travel and the accessibility to 
services and facilities.   
 
6.14.  Our evidence tells us that demand for car parking will increase and, in some areas, 
demand will exceed supply. This is forecast to be the case in Loughborough, Shepshed, 
Anstey, Barrow upon Soar, Quorn and Sileby where additional off street car parking wil l 
be required.  We commissioned further evidence to identify the scope for bringing forward 
sites at each location, and this will inform our discussions with local communities and 
developers.  
 
6.15.  We do not have a statutory duty to provide car parking however we recognise the va lue 
it provides for supporting the vitality and viability of our towns and villages and we will 
work with local communities, Leicestershire County Council and businesses to address 
the issues where they are most acute. In providing for sufficient parking f or local 
communities and businesses we will also ensure that environmental sustainability is 
secured through measures such as providing for electric vehicle charging points in 
accordance with Policy CC6.  
 
6.16.  Leicestershire County Council, as the local highwa y authority, has prepared a 
Leicestershire Highway Design Guide which provides advice on highway design, 
including parking standards.  It provides guidance on the levels of car, cycle, motorcycle, 
electric car charging and disabled parki ng that should be p rovided in association with 
development. This document is the starting point for detailed discussions and agreement 
on development proposals and any new development will need to have regard to the 
guidance and advice set out in the docum ent.  All new propo sals will be expected to be 
supported by robust evidence that justifies the need for the specified amount of parking.   
 
Policy T3: Car Parking Standards  
 
We will ensure that there is an adequate provision for all users of residential and  non-
residential p arking in our Borough.  We will do this by: 
 
• encouraging parish and town councils to address car parking needs and identify 
potential sites for new car parks through the neighbourhood planning process;  
• requiring that all new developments provide car parkin g spaces in accordance with the 
latest published guidance of Leicestershire County Council and Charnwood Borough 
Council; 
• requiring that parking infrastructure is well -designed and in suitable, sustaina ble 
locations; and  
• requiring that a ny variation from the guidance is supported by robust evidence and 
thoroughly justified.    
  Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  164 
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
 
7.1. We recognise Climate Change as one of the key challenges facing Charnwood with 
predictions for the East Midlands indicating that we can expect hotter, dri er summers and 
warmer, wetter winters as well as an increase in incidents of severe weather such as 
storms and flooding.  
 
7.2. The Climate Change Act commits the UK government to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels (net zero) by 2050 .  Net zero refers to the 
balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed  from 
the atmosphere.   We recognise the planning system will need to play a role in achieving 
this challenging target.   As well as takin g actions to reduc e emissions, it will be important 
to maximise natural process that can take carbon out of the atmosphe re such as peat 
and trees, known as carbon sequestration.  
 
7.3. We know that we need to take immediate action to protect the environment for future 
generations  and this is a priority in our Corporate Plan, reflected through our Climate 
Change Strategy, and is a n objective of the local plan. The Council has already reduced 
its carbon footprint by 32% since 2012 and is committed to making operati ons carbon 
neutral  by 2030 through using less energy, producing more power from renewable energy 
sources and reducing wa ste. 
 
7.4. Carbon emissions from activities in the wider Borough have also fallen over recent years; 
however, we want to see further reductio ns and there is a role for us all to play in achieving 
this. Ensuring that our Borough fully contributes to reducing the  impacts of climate change 
is a priority and we can all make changes to our lifestyles to reduce our impact on the 
environment.  
 
7.5. We wil l help make these changes by raising awareness of climate change issues with our 
local communities, partners and stakeho lders, introducing mitigation measures which 
reduce our impact on climate change, and by ensuring our built and natural environments 
are resilient and can  adapt to climate change over the short and longer term. Some of the 
actions for tackling climate chan ge, such as improving energy efficiency in homes and 
increasing provision of Green Infrastructure, could have direct benefits for reside nts by 
reducing en ergy bills and providing a higher quality environment.  
 
7.6. We are aware that there are parts of the Borou gh where air quality is an issue. Our 
policies on Sustainable Construction and Sustainable Transport also seek to address 
activities tha t can detrimentall y affect air quality.  
 
7.7. The policies in our local plan will play a significant role in helping to shape  a sustainable 
pattern of development which supports our climate change ambitions. Our approach also 
provides a positive planning framew ork which addresse s issues such as renewable and 
low carbon energy, sustainable construction, minimising flood risk, enc ouraging the 
application of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) and promoting sustainable transport. 
We will also work with our partners , stakeholders and  local communities to protect and 
enhance our local environment.  
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  165 
 7.8. We also recognise that trees play an essential role in helping to tackle climate change by 
offsetting CO 2 emissions and reducing the heat island effect. We have pledged to ensure 
that 100,00 0 trees are planted by the end of 2024 and our policy on trees is set out in 
more detail in the  Environment Chapter of the local plan.  
 
Managing Flood Risk  
7.9. The Rivers Soar and Wreake flow through Charnwood and together with the Grand Unio n 
Canal and other watercourses mean that approximately 12% of our Borough lies in Flood 
Zone 3 (highest risk of f looding). Charnwood’s rivers, reservoirs, canal and brooks are a 
valuable asset, but they require careful management to preserve their quality and value, 
and to manage flood risk.  
 
7.10.  Significant fluvial flooding incidents occurred in April 1998 and January 1 999 along the 
Rivers Soar and Wreake, and surface water flooding occurred during the summer of 2007 
in the settlements around Charnwood Forest in the west of the  Borough. More recently 
fluvial flooding occurred in June and November 2012 in Loughborough and  across the 
wider Borough. Between 2018 and 2020 there was a total of 87 Local Flood Authority 
reports of internal flooding, 32 of which were i n Loughborough.  
 
7.11.  The main flood risk from rivers (fluvial flood risk) is along the River Soar, the River Wreake 
and their tributaries. These present flood risk to rural communities as well as to the main 
urban areas including Loughborough, Syston, Thurmast on and Quorn. The risk of 
flooding from surface water (pluvial flood risk) is usually caused by intense rainfall that 
may only last a few hours and usually occurs in lower lying areas, often where the 
drainage system is overwhelmed with the volume of water . Our evidence als o tells us that 
surface water predominantly follows topographical flow paths of existing waterc ourses.  
 
7.12.  Groundwater susceptibility mapping of the Borough has shown that the lower permeability 
of bedrock in Charnwood means that the majorit y of the Borough i s at a lower probability 
of groundwater flooding (less than 25%). Areas with higher susceptibil ities and more likely 
to flood from groundwater are found along the River Soar and River Wreake. The Grand 
Union Canal is the only canal in Cha rnwood. There have  been only two incidents of a 
breach of the canal which occurred at Wanlip Weir in 1962 and Bar row Weir in 1971.  
 
7.13.  Our evidence provides us with an appraisal of all potential sources of flooding and 
assesses the potential increase in flood  risk due to clima te change. Our policy on 
managing flooding is based upon a risk -based, sequential approach to t he location of 
development, avoiding high risk areas and steering development to areas at lower risk. 
This will be done by applying the Sequent ial Test meaning t hat sites at risk of flooding 
can only be suitable for development if there is no other land av ailable in areas with little 
or no flood risk. If it is not possible to locate development in areas with a lower risk of 
flooding (Flood Zone 1 ), the Exception T est will need to be applied (this is for development 
in Flood Zones 2, 3a and 3b). Where no sui table sites on land with the lowest risk of 
flooding are available, we will need to ensure that developments are appropriate, flood 
resilient a nd resistant, safe  for its users for the development’s lifetime, there will be no 
increase to overall flood risk,  and where possible should look to reduce flood risk to third 
parties. Our evidence provides a framework for the application of the Sequential Test of 
sites and,  where necessary, the Exception Test.  
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  166 
 7.14.  We require all applications for major developments in Fl ood Zone 1 or any development 
in Flood Zones 2 or 3 to be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment. This 
should identify the main f lood risks to the site, including whether the development will 
increase flood risk downstream, and recommendation s for mitigating measures such as 
sustainable drainage systems, site layout and design or modifying ground levels.  
 
7.15.  We also require development s to take account of the cumulative impact of flooding at the 
design and planning application stage and ensure th at appropriate mitigation measures 
are installed so flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Examples of such include level for 
level floodplain compensation.  
 
7.16.  We recognise that measures to manage the biodiversity and landscape of major 
watercourses such as the River Soar and River Wreake corridors and the Grand Union 
Canal and projects such as the Soar and Wreake Living Landscape Scheme, will be 
extremely important  in helping to reduce flood risk. The creation of new habitats, including 
woodlands and wetland s, planting of trees and reconnecting rivers to natural flood plains 
can all be used to reduce flood risk naturally and provide ecological bene fits. It will also  
be important to reduce impacts of flood risk for areas of habitat that are vulnerable to 
clima te change in line with Natural England’s Climate Change Vulnerability Mapping.  
 
7.17.  New developments can have a significant impact on water use and  water network 
capacity and also on water resources, waste disposal and flood risk.  The benefits of 
adopting an early and integrated water management approach are advocated by the 
Environment Agency and can help to create a healthier, safer and richer env ironment for 
our c ommunities to live in.   
 
7.18.  We will work with our partners including the Environment Agency, Leicestershire County 
Council, in its role as the Lead Local Flood Authority, and Seven Trent Water to manage 
flood risk across the Borough. We wil l work with develo pers to secure contributions to 
flood risk mitigation measures where it is appropri ate and viable to do so. 
 
7.19.  We will support our local communities, through their neighbourhood plans to identify 
opportunities for flood mitigation measures suitable for their  local area.  
 
Policy CC1: Flood Risk Management  
 
We will manage flood risk by directing development to areas in the Borough with the 
lowest risk of flooding (Flood Zone 1), applying the Sequential Test and Exception Test, 
where necessary . We will do this by: 
 
• ensuring that major development proposals in Flood Zone 1 and any developm ents in 
Flood Zones 2 and 3 are accompanied by a site-specific  flood risk assessment;  
• requiring a sequential approach to layout is taken within the site, with the highest 
vulner ability development being located within the lowest flood risk zone(s);  
• requiring developments on greenfield sites to cause no net increase in the rate of 
surface water run off;  
• requiring development on brownfield sites to secure a decrea se in surface wate r run -
off; Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  167 
 • requiring developments to consider the cumulative impact of p roposals within, or 
which affect, local areas susceptible to flooding, and ensuring appropriate mitigation 
measures are in place so that new development does not incr ease flood risk an d, where 
possible, reduces flood risk;  
• ensuring that, where appropriate,  all major developments incorporate sustainable 
drainage systems, in accordance with Policy CC2;  
• ensuring that the natural environment and major watercourses within the site are 
suita bly managed to help reduce flood risk;  
• encouraging minor developments t o incorporate sustainable drainage systems, in 
accordance with Policy CC2;   
• ensuring that the design of flood risk mitigation measures is appropriate and in keeping 
with the environme nt in which they will be implemented;  
• encouraging an integrated water ma nagement approach is considered in the early 
stages of site planning; and  
• encouraging developments which support the creation of new habitats, including 
woodlands and  wetlands, plantin g of trees and reconnecting rivers to natural flood 
plains.  
 
We will sup port neighbourhood plans in identifying suitable flood risk mitigation measures 
appropriate for their local area.  
 
Sustainable Drainage Systems  
 
7.20.  Sustainable drainage  systems (SuDS ) are designed to manage the drainage of surface 
water in the urban environment. They provide an alternative, or addition to, traditional 
drainage systems that drain surface water into underground piped drainage.  SuDS 
techniques seek to capt ure, use, dela y or absorb rainwater and are important as they 
help to reduce the causes and impacts of flooding. They also remove pollutants from 
urban run -off at source and provide benefits for amenity, recreation and wildlife.  
 
7.21.  We recognise that the use of SuDS may no t be appropriate in all circumstances and will 
depend on the nature of the proposed development and its location; however, our 
approach is that all major development proposals should ensure that SuDS are put in 
place unless clear evidence is provided that they would be inappropriate.  
 
7.22.  We also recognise the cumulative impact of a smaller number of developments could 
have a significant impact on flood risk and in these circumstances the use of SuDS should 
be considered.  
 
7.23.  It is important that Su DS are conside red at an early stage of the development process to 
ensure the delivery of well designed, appropriate and effective schemes whilst also 
providing multifunctional benefits.  The aim will be for surface water to be directed to 
sustainable outfa lls as high up  the drainage hierarchy as reasonably practicable:  
 
• discharging into the ground (infiltration);  
• to a surface water body;  
• to a surface water sewer, highway drain, or another drainage system; and  
• to a combined sewer.  
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  168 
 7.24.  We will seek advice from Leicestershire  County Council, as the Lead Local Flood 
Authority, to ensure that the development’s proposed standards of operation are 
appropriate and that there are clear arrangements  for on -going maintenance over the 
lifetime of the development.  
 
Policy CC2: Sustainab le Drainage Systems (SuDS)  
 
We will ensure that development includes appropriate measures to manage flood risk in 
an integrated way that achieves wider benefits for communities and the environment. We 
will support major development that:  
 
• provides, where appr opriate, Sustainable Dra inage Systems that are integrated into 
development proposals having been considered as part the masterplanning of the site;  
• prioritises Sustainable Drainage Systems where the development is in an area at risk 
of flooding , in accorda nce with the criteria se t out in Policy CC1;  
• ensures, where Sustainable Drainage System are used, surface water is directed to 
sustainable outfalls in accordance with the drainage hierarchy;   
• ensures that the design, construction and ong oing maintenance o f Sustainable 
Drainage S ystems is carefully and clearly defined; and  
• ensures Sustainable Drainage Systems provide multifunctional benefits for amenity, 
recreation and wildlife, that utilise natural features, where possible.  
 
Renewable an d Low Carbon Energ y  
 
7.25.  Carbon emissions in Charnwood fell 26% between 2005 and 2015 to 894 ktCO 2 due to a 
reduction in local energy consumption and the use of cleaner energy sources. However, 
there is still an over reliance on the use of fossil fuels in the  UK and much of the fuel used 
in the natio n’s power stations is imported.  
 
7.26.  Whilst we have seen a reduction in energy consumption and emissions in our Borough, 
we still need to do more to reinforce our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. One way we 
can achieve this is to sig nificantly increase the proportion of renewable and low carbon 
energy generated within our Borough.  
 
7.27.  Renewable energy technologies produce energy from natural resources that will not run 
out. The most common technologies are energy from w ind (wind turbines ), energy f rom 
the sun (solar panels) and energy from water ( hydroelectricity ). Low carbon technologies 
are not completely renewable as they may still have carbon emissions associated with 
them albeit much smaller than conventional fossil  fuel burning tech nologies, a n example 
of such technologies is energy recovery from waste.   
 
7.28.  The existing renewable and low carbon installations in Charnwood are shown in the table 
below which also includes fewer common technologies. We are supporting the delivery 
of our Climate Chang e Strategy and meeting our carbon reduction commitments by 
encouraging further renewable sources of energy supply in the Borough. Whilst we have 
the most technical potential for wind and solar energy, other renewable energy or low 
carbon technol ogies, such  as district heating and micro and domestic scale installations, 
will also be considered positively.  
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  169 
 Table 7: Renewable and Low Carbon Installations in Charnwood  
Renewable Energy and 
Low Carbon Technologies Capacity  Location 
Solar  64.8 megawat ts Five solar farms at Wymeswold, Six 
Hills and Barrow upon Soar, with the 
largest solar farm at Wymeswold 
Airfield.  
Wind 2.57 megawatts  Two wind power installations, one at 
West Beacon Farm and the larger 
one at the Severn Trent Sewage 
Treatment Works, W anlip.  
Anaerobic Digestion  5 megawatts  Three anaerobic digestion plants at 
Wanlip and Loughborough.  
Landfill Gas  1.6 megawatts  One landfill gas facility at 
Mountsorrel Landfill Site.   
Energy Recovery - Newhurst Quarry near Shepshed 
has planning permis sion and  could 
process 350,000 tonnes of waste per 
year.  
 
7.29.  Increasing the amount of energy, we produce from renewable and low carbon 
technologies will help to secure energy supply whilst also helping to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, sl ow climate change and stimulate investment in new jobs and 
businesses.  
 
7.30.  We recognise that renewable energy installations are generally large in scale and can 
have a significant impact on the character and appearance of parts of our Borough, 
potentially hav ing an impact upon  our landscape, biodiversity, heritage assets and the 
amenity of local residents. We have a positive strategy for renewable energy and low 
carbon technologies which supports the potential for suitable development whilst 
ensuring that any adverse impacts ar e satisfactorily addressed, including cumulative 
landscape and visual impacts.  
 
7.31.  We have identified suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy sources on our 
Policies Map. We know that the main technical potential is for wind and s olar energy and 
that identifying opportunity areas, based on low to moderate landscape sensitivity, offers 
a reasonable balance between landscape harm and increasing renewable energy 
capacity in our Borough.  
 
7.32.  These opportunity areas reflect a combined und erstanding of the sens itivity of each 
landscape character area and the likely impacts of different sizes of renewable energy 
installations and are set out in the tables below.

7.33.  Proposals for renewable energy installations will be expected to have regard to our 
landscape sensitivity e vidence and this w ill inform the scale of installation that will be 
appropriate in each landscape character area.  
 
7.34.  Whilst our evidence tells us these areas have the most potential, any individual proposals 
for energy installations wo uld need to be supporte d by robust eviden ce and detailed site -
based assessment taking into account other issues such as heritage and flood risk.  In 
some cases, an Environmental Impact Assessment may be required.  
 
 
 
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  171 
  
7.35.  We will support proposals for wind energy installations where  they are located within the 
area identified on the Policies Map or in a neighbourhood plan as suitable for renewable 
energy installations and where consultation has been undertaken and it can be 
demonstrated that the planning imp acts identified by affecte d local communitie s have 
been fully addressed and, therefore, the proposal has their backing.  
 
7.36.  Our local communities may also identify suitable locations for, and state the range of, 
renewable and low carbon technologies, includin g community energy project s that could 
be accommodated in their area through neighbourhood plans.  
 
Policy CC3: Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Installations  
 
Proposals for renewable and low carbon energy installations will be supported where any 
adverse im pacts, including cumulativ e impacts have bee n fully addressed,  including 
impacts on local amenity, the historic environment and the setting of heritage assets, 
noise and odour, the wider landscape, biodiversity and public  safety.  
 
Where any localised adverse impacts remain, propos als will be only b e supported where 
these adverse impacts are outweighed by the wider environmental, econo mic or social 
benefits of the scheme. 
 
In addition, we will require wind energy development involving one or more wind turbines 
to: 
 
• be located in an area identified as  suitable for wind energy on the Policies Map or in a 
neighbourhood plan;  
• be of an appropriate scale in that area, taking account of the evidence on landscape 
sensitivity; and  
• demonstrate that, following consultation, the planning impacts  identified by aff ected 
local communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has th eir 
backing.  
 
Proposals within the Safeguarded Area shown on the Policies Map will not be permitted if 
they adversely affect the operational integrity of E ast Midlands Airpo rt, aircraft operations 
or radar and navigation systems.  
 
In all cases, the contri bution of the renewable and local carbon energy proposals to cutting 
greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonising our energy system will be balanced with 
other policy and mate rial considerations. 
 
We will support neighbourhood planning groups to consider ide ntifying locations and the 
range of renewable and low carbon technologies that could be accommodated within 
neighbourhood plans.  
 
 
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  172 
 Sustainable Constructio n 
7.37.  We recognise tha t the construction process for new developments in our Borough uses 
a significant a mount of resources and generates a large amount of waste. To reduce this 
impact on our environment during the construction phase, developments will need to  take 
account of t he principles of sustainable development by carefully managing the 
production, use and disposal of materials and sourcing materials with minimum 
environmental impact, such as those that are from local sources, recycled or reused. This 
also includes reducin g energy consumption and waste, creating a healthy 
environmentally friendly environ ment and protecting the natural environment.  
 
7.38.  We encourage all new developments to be designed to exceed national sustainable 
building standards to maximis e the use of energ y efficiency and energy conservation in 
their design, layout and orientation.  
 
7.39.  All major development proposals should demonstrate their sustainability by setting out 
the actions that have been taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in t heir design, 
havin g regard to:  
 
1. Reducing the need for energy, reducing CO 2 emissions and reducing the heat 
island effect through design features that provide natural heating, cooling and 
lighting, using landform, building layout orientation, massing and la ndscaping;  
2. Generating the residual energy required through the use of low or zero carbon 
energy technologies; and  
3. Adapting to the effects of climate change whilst contributing to health and well -
being.  
 
7.40.  We will encourage all proposals to demonstrate how th ey will reduce the  energy, water 
and materials used in the construction an d operation of the new buildings including the 
environmental benefits and impacts of the proposal.  
 
7.41.  It will be important that the design and layout of new buildings does not preclude  the later 
install ation of renewable or low carbon technologies. For examp le, spacing, orientation 
and roof space will be important in the installation of solar energy technologies. Ensuring 
good energy efficiency in the fabric of buildings will make the l ater installation of heat 
pumps more viable. Larger schemes also offer the  opportunity to explore the future 
potential for district heating. The design and layout of new buildings will also be important 
in encouraging people to make sustainable choices, fo r example, travell ing by sustainable 
modes of transport. 
 
7.42.  Our sustainable urban extensions provide the opportunity to maximise the potential for a 
reduction in carbon emissions through their design and layout. We will encourage these 
schemes to provide a 1 0% reduction in CO 2 emissions when compared to the Building 
Regulations at  the time the detailed scheme is proposed. We recognise the impact which 
such an ambitious package could have on viability; however, some of the best ways to 
improve environmental pe rformance are thro ugh simple decisions on the layout and 
orientation of bu ildings and spaces. We will offer the flexibility for the scheme to be 
designed to achieve the best range of these measures. We will support schemes that 
compensate for CO 2 emissions  where reductions are not possible through the design and 
construction of a development.  Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  173 
  
7.43.  We will support energy efficient buildings and work with our partners to secure funding 
and deliver projects that support a low carbon economy across Charnwood. We wi ll 
encourage on si te, near site and off-site compensatory measures for dev elopment, taking 
into account their location and opportunities available.  
 
Policy CC4: Sustainable Construction  
 
We will adapt to and mitigate against the effects of climate change, by requiring all n ew 
developments and refurbishments to take account of sustainable development principles.  
 
We will do this by:  
 
• encouraging high standards of energy efficiency in sustainable construction processes 
including the use of materials with low embodied carbon an d passive cooling and 
heating, optimal levels of thermal insulation, passive solar design and locally sourced 
and recycled materials;  
• encouraging the use of renewable and low carbon supply systems and connection to 
low carbon heat network s; 
• minimising cons truction waste, including designing out waste during the design stage, 
selecting sustainable and efficient build ing materials and reusing materials where 
possible;  
• supporting developments that reduce waste, provide for accessible and unob trusive 
sustainabl e waste management facilities such as refuse/ recycling/ composting bin 
storage and allow convenient waste colle ctions;  
• requiring that sustainable water management solutions such as sustainable drainage 
systems, green roofs and/or rainwat er harvesting syst ems are incorporated into 
proposals, where viable;  
• requiring residential development to meet the Building Regula tions optional water 
efficiency requirement of 110 litres/per person per day;  
• encouraging non -residential development in exces s of 1,000sqm gros s floorspace to 
achieve the equivalent of BREEAM 3 credits for water consumption as a minimum;  
• combating the hea t island effect by encouraging green roofs, green walls, increased 
tree cover, waterways and the suitable layout of external s paces;  
• requiring the layout, orientation and design of buildings to improve efficiency of 
heating, cooling and lighting and to max imise the potential for daylight and passive 
solar gain; 
• encouraging the design and layout of new buildings which enable low c arbon energy 
gener ation to be installed from the start where viable, or at a later stage, including 
district heating; 
• encouraging the effective use of land by reusing land that has been previously 
developed, provided that it is not of high environmental va lue; and  
• supporting new development that protects environmental resources including local air 
quality and our most versatile agric ultural land.  
 
We will expect major development proposals to demonstrate how the need to reduce 
emissions has influenced the d esign, layout and energy source used.  
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  174 
 Sustainable Travel  
7.44.  Transport plays an important role in allowing our communities to gain access to jobs a nd 
services and should be considered in the earliest stages of development proposals. Our 
vision is that our co mmunities will hav e better access to jobs and services, with a choice 
to walk or cycle safely and that for longer journeys people will be able to  take advantage 
of the excellent connections by bus or rail in Charnwood. This vision is a fundamental 
part of our development st rategy, which seeks to direct development to those locations 
where there is a genuine choice to walk, cycle and use public tran sport to travel to jobs 
and services.  
 
7.45.  Our walking and cycle networks have seen significant investment in recen t years, 
including  the Loughborough Town Centre Transport Scheme, which has helped to secure 
an increase in the number of journeys made by foot a nd bicycle. Making areas, such as 
Loughborough Town Centre, more accessible by foot and bicycle will also help revitalise 
and fur ther improve our local economy. The River Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor 
also provide opportunities for walking, cycling a nd other leisure activities.  
 
7.46.  Part of National Cycle Route 6 connects Birstall in the south of the Borough to 
Loughborough and S hepshed in the north, via the Soar Valley villages. This is part of our 
network of safe cycle routes which includes the Connect  2 Project in the Watermead area. 
There are also plans for a new bridge at Watermead Country Park which will sp an the 
River Soar improving cycling and footpath access along the river and canal corridor 
between Leicester City Centre and Birstall, Thurmaston  and Syston. We will continue to 
work with our partners, including Leicestershire County Council, Leicester Cit y Council 
and SUST RANS to deliver walking and cycling links across the Borough.  
 
7.47.  We will expect major developments in the Borough to make provisi on for improving and 
extending our walking and cycle networks and ensuring priority is given first to 
pedestria ns and cycle movem ents. We will also explore opportunities for improved 
signage, safe well -lit routes and increased connectivity between urban an d rural areas. 
We will promote the health benefits of walking and cycling for healthier lifestyles and 
improved  well-being. More people walking and cycling will also mean less congestion and 
emissions on our roads, improving air quality for our local commu nities.  
 
7.48.  Travel by bus and train is essential for longer journeys which cannot be made on foot or 
by bicycle. W e benefit from a w ell-connected bus network in Charnwood which offers 
commuters reliable and direct routes between Loughborough, Shepshed and our  smaller 
settlements and further afield to Leicester, Derby, Nottingham and East Midlands Airport. 
There is a P ark and Ride at Bi rstall which provides bus services into Leicester.  
 
7.49.  However, less than half of our community uses a local bus service once a m onth because 
of the congestion on local and inter -urban services at peak periods and poor 
interchanges. We also  recognise that pe ople are more likely to use buses for their 
journeys where there is easy access to half hourly or more frequent services within  less 
than a 400m walk. However, in some rural areas there is not easy access to bus services.  
People are also  more likely to use the bus rather than their car if there are good quality 
passenger facilities and the bus has priority over the car on congest ed routes.  
 Chapter 7  Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  175 
 7.50.  There is a Midland Mainline railway station located in Loughborough, which was improved 
in 2012 as  part of the Lough borough Eastern Gateway Scheme. It is the busiest station 
in Leicestershire outside the city and provides excellent local and n ational rail connections 
to Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield and London. There is good parking at the tr ain 
station, and i t is also served by local bus services with good access for walking and 
cycling. The Ivanhoe Railway Line provides a popular an d well -used local passenger rail 
service and links Syston, Sileby, Barrow upon Soar and Loughborough with Leice ster and 
Nottingha m. The Great Central Railway is a heritage railway and important regional tourist 
attraction. There may be potential in the fut ure for the Great Central Railway to support 
the area’s quarrying industry once the line is fully reconnected a t Loughborough.  
 
7.51.  Major growth in housing, employment and jobs is planned at the East Midlands Enterprise 
Gateway and at the HS2 hub in Toton to the north of the Borough.  A priority for the local 
plan will be ensuring that bus and rail services from Charnw ood, particularly  those within 
the Leicestershire International Gateway, to these destinations are frequent, efficient and 
reliable.   
 
7.52.  We know that sustainable travel in rural areas is more difficult due to distances between 
homes, jobs and facilities and  accessibility to  public transport. We will work with our 
partners, developers and service providers to support innovative sustainable travel 
solutions in our rural areas including demand responsive buses, community mini buses, 
car sharing and community ra il partnerships.  
 
7.53.  Policy DS6 expects that new developments will be comprehensive and well -designed, 
and located adjacent to existing transport networks. Improving connectivity and 
integration between sustainable transport modes and existing transport netw orks will 
ensure that travelling sustainably is an easier option for our community by being fast, 
efficient and value for money. We will also help to reduce the need to travel by ensuring 
that the right mix of uses in new developments is a priority.  
 
7.54.  Sense of place is impo rtant to our residents and the good design of sustainable transport 
infrastructure can have a positive influence on this.  We will ensure that this infrastructure, 
including bus stops, cycle parking infrastructure, signage, lighting and c harging points fo r 
electric vehicles, is well designed and contributes to making places that are safe, secure 
and attractive. We will also require developments, where possible, to reduce the negative 
impacts of vehicles such as excessive volumes of fumes a nd noise which ca n also have 
a negative impact on health and well -being.  
 
7.55.  We will work with our partners, developers and service providers including bus operators, 
Leicestershire County Council, Leicester City Council and Network Rail to ensure routes 
are economically viab le and that operators are able to make improvements to transport 
infrastructure, existing services and provide new services where these are required. 
Leicestershire County Council through its Passenger Transport Policy and Strategy 2018 
places the onus on site promoters to come forward with passenger transport proposals 
appropriate to the scale and nature of their development as opposed to seeking 
contributions through S106 agreements.   
 
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  176 
 7.56.  Working with our local partners, we will ensure tha t sustainable tran sport strategies are 
aligned, and investment is targeted to the places where it is needed most in our Borough.  
 
7.57.  We will support our local communities, through their neighbourhood plans t o identify 
sustainable travel opportunities suitabl e for their local area.  
 
Policy CC5: Sustainable Transport  
 
We will support sustainable patterns of development which will minimise the need to travel 
and seek to support a shift from travel by private car to walking, cycling and public 
transport.  We will  support major development that: 
 
• provides excellent accessibility to key facilities and services by walking, cycling and 
public transport, including for people with restricted mobility;  
• is info rmed by a robust transport assessment and travel plan which co nsiders 
sustainabl e travel options at the outset so that they form an integral part of the 
development;  
• provides well -lit, safe and attractive walking and cycling routes and secure cycle 
shelter s; 
• secures, where possible, new and enhanced bus services, inc luding new bus sto ps, 
where development, is more than a 400m walk from an existing bus stop;  
• ensures sustainable transport infrastructure is well designed, integrated with the Green 
Infrastructu re and contributes towards making high quality places;  
• contrib utes to the infras tructure required to improve the speed, reliability and 
attractiveness of public transport including, where appropriate, bus gates, bus priority 
measures and bus links; and  
• reduces, as far as possible, the negative impacts on air quality  in accordance wit h 
policy EV11.  
 
We will work with our partners to secure funding for and delivery of sustainable transport 
improvements  
We will support neighbourhood plans in identifying sustainable travel opportunities 
suitable for their local area.  
 
Electric Vehicle C harging Points  
7.58.  We recognise that for some people travel by car will remain the only available or preferred 
option for some journeys. The impact of those journeys on CO 2 emissions can be reduced 
if they are made in low emissi on vehicles. The Government’s T en Point Plan for a Green 
Industrial Revolution published in 2020 confirms its ambition to end the sale of new petrol 
and diesel cars and vans by 2030. We will make a positive contribution to reducing CO 2 
emissions by working  with our par tners to deliver a n integrated network of affordable 
electric vehicle charging points in locations which are safe, accessible and convenient 
throughout Charnwood. We will also consider the potential for e -scooter and e -bike 
charging points. 
 
 Chapter 7 Climate Change  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  177 
 7.59.  We require ne w developments to make provision for electric vehicle charging points to 
encourage our residents to switch to low carbon vehicles. We will also work with 
infrastructure providers to trial new technologies such as street lamppost charging point s 
and rapid c harging hubs and t he timely instalment of cable routing.  
 
Policy CC6: Electric Vehicle Charging Points  
 
We will significantly increase the number of electric vehicle  charging points in the 
Borough.  We will support development that:  
 
• provides an electric vehicle charge poi nt or cabling routing for each new residential 
dwelling (including flats) with a dedicated car parking space ; and  
• provides at least 1 charging point  or cable routing per 5 car parking spaces for new 
non- residential developments with more than 10 parking sp aces.   
 
We will work with our partners and developers to deliver infrastructure for electric vehicles 
and ensure charging points are provided at appropriate locations.   Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  178 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
 
8.1. Our built and natural environment is fundamen tal to our way of life. Our communities and 
the buildings we use are nestled in a rich setting formed by our landscape and the wildlife 
it contains. These, and the relationships between each of them, give us our sense of 
place.  
 
8.2. We want our existing and ne w communities to l ive and work in a high quality and healthy 
environment. Our vision seeks to both protect and enhance our built and natura l 
environment. A more attractive environment also helps us to attract economic investment.  
 
8.3. We recognise the intrinsi c value of the nat ural environment, its value as natural capital 
and the range of ecosystem services that it provides. We also recognise th at access to 
high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and recreation contribute to health 
and well -being and to the cohesio n of our communities.  
 
8.4. Protecting and enhancing the natural environment can help in our efforts to reduce 
climate change and to adapt to it. The buildings and townscapes of our built environment 
that are of heritage value also perform ong oing functions as homes and business 
premises.  
 
8.5. Green spaces and wildlife habitats are also present in our towns and villages. Similarly, 
parts of the Borough’s built environment and heritage occur in the countryside as well as 
in our towns and villages. A s such, much of th is chapter is relevant to all development, 
regardless of where it is proposed.  
 
8.6. Neighbourhood plans offer the opportunity  for local communities to identify ways in which 
the natural and built environment can be protected and enhanced in t heir local area.   We 
will encourage neighbourhood plan groups to explore these opportunities.  
 
Landscape  
 
8.7. Landscape covers land outside a nd within the defined Limits to Development and 
includes all of the visible features of both the natural and built en vironments. In different 
places the landscape has its own distinctive character that is valued by our communities. 
Our Landscape Character Assessment identifies 6-character areas within Charnwood:  
 
• Langley Lowlands  
• The Soar Valley  
• The Wolds  
• Wreake Valley  
• High Leicestershire ; and  
• Charnwood Forest.  
 
 
 
  
Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  180 
 8.8. We want to make sure the landscape as a whole and the features of these character 
areas continue to be recognised for their distinct quality. Protecting our landscape 
character and allowing sustainable d evelopment that su pports our rural areas is a delicat e 
balance.  The consideration of whether proposals for new development accord with Policy 
EV1 will be informed by relevant local landscape character assessments.  
 
Policy EV1: Landscape  
 
We will carefull y manage developme nt to protect the Borough’s distinctive landscape.  We 
will do this by : 
 
• requiring new development to protect landscape character and to reinforce sense of 
place and local distinctiveness ; and  
• requiring new development to maintain the sep arate identities o f our towns and 
villages.  
 
Green Infrastructure  
 
8.9. The natural environment and the different types of green spaces that make it up benefit 
from a connectivity between these spaces. This network of formal and semi -natural green 
spaces acros s the Borough is k nown as Green Infrastructure. It is important for providing 
habitat and landscape connectivity for wildlife; offering safe and attractive cycling and 
walking routes for people, including non -motorised users; helping us to manage flooding;  
and, countering t he heat island effect in urban areas by reducing the heat retained in 
buildings and streets.  
 
8.10.  Our strategically important areas of Green Infrastructure include the National Forest and 
the Charnwood Forest Regional Park, Ri ver Soar and Gra nd Union Canal cor ridor and 
the Green Wedges which extend from the Leicester urban area. We have therefore 
developed specific policies for these. However, outside these areas other Green 
Infrastructure and features of the natural environmen t continue to pl ay an important ro le. 
Other green infrastructure can also be identified in neighbourhood plans.  
 
Green Wedges  
 
8.11.  Green Wedges are a long-standing  policy designation used by the city of Leicester and 
the districts that surround it.  The functions of Green We dges are:  
 
• to guid e development form;  
• to provide a green lung into the City;  
• to ensure that as the urban area grows, it is accompanied by open areas for people 
and for wildlife and  
• to safeguard the identities of communities within and around urban areas.   
 
8.12.  Green Wedges are distinct from other types of open space including Areas of Local 
Separation, in that they provide a conti nuous corridor of land into urban areas therefore 
linking town and countryside.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  181 
 8.13.  Together with our partners we have a shared methodo logy for reviewing  our Green 
Wedges and we have used this to consider which of our networks of green spaces 
perform the func tions of a Green Wedge. We have also considered the opportunity for 
Green Wedges to be provided in association with our new strategi c developments.  
 
8.14.  Our strategy proposes the following Green Wedges as part of our Green Infrastructure 
network:  
 
• Leicester ( Beaumont Leys)/Birstall/Thurcaston/ Cropston/Anstey/ Glenfrith/ Groby 
(GW1)  
• Birstall/Leicester/Thurmaston (Soar Valley North) (GW2)  
• Leicester Hamilton  (GW3).  
 
8.15.  Our development strategy includes allocations of land within areas of Green Wedge and 
development proposals for these sites should be considered against the policy for the 
Leicester Urban Area and policies for specific sites.   
 
Policy EV2: Green Wedges  
 
We will work with our partners to manage the pattern of development to protect areas of 
Green Wedge defined on the Policies Map to ensure they fulfil their functions to provide a 
green lung into the City, open areas for people an d for wildlife, an d to safe guard the 
identities of communities within and around urban areas.  
 
We will support development in Green Wedges where it:  
 
• Is small scale and retains the predominantly open and undeveloped character of the 
Green Wedge; 
• retains a nd creates green n etworks b etween the countryside and open spaces within 
the urban areas; and  
• retains and enhances public access to the Green Wedge, especially for recreation.  
 
Areas of Local Separation  
 
8.16.  Our towns and villages are concentrated along the ri ver valleys of the  Soar and the 
Wreake and around the edge of the city of Leicester. As these towns and villages have 
grown the spaces between them have got smaller. Our communities have increasingly 
become concerned about their identities as separate plac es. 
 
8.17.  Areas of Loca l Sepa ration are a longstanding local plan designation. They are areas of 
open countryside that separate two neighbouring settlements. They are distinct from 
Green Wedges as their main purpose is preserving settlement identity, and they a re 
based on landsc ape ch aracter, the visual appearance of the area and maintaining 
connectivity with the wider landscape setting of a settlement.  
 
8.18.  Areas of Local Separation have been used successfully to guide development in areas 
between our towns and vil lages. The policy has ma intained the character and identity of 
individual settlements and prevented their coalescence.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  182 
 8.19.  We have reviewed the evidence regarding how existing Areas of Local Separation are 
working and whether there is a need for new ones and the following Area s of L ocal 
Separation are identified on the Policies Map:  
 
• Loughborough/Woodthorpe (ALS1) 
• Quorn/Mountsorrel (ALS2)  
• Mountsorrel/Rothley (ALS 3)  
• Sileby/Cossington (ALS4)  
• Sileby/Barrow upon Soar (ALS5)  
• Thurcaston/Cropston/The Ridgeway Area o f Rothley (ALS6)  
• Wanlip/Birstall (ALS7)  
• Rearsby/East Goscote (ALS8)  
• East Goscote/Queniborough (ALS9)  
• Queniborough/Syston (ALS10)  
• Syston/Thurmaston (ALS11)  
• Syston/Barkby (ALS12)  
• Anstey/Newtown Linford (ALS13) 
• Quorn/Loughborough (ALS14)  
• Birstall/Rothley (ALS 15) 
• Loughborough/ Hathern (ALS16)  
 
8.20.  In identifying our development strategy, we have carefully balanced the need for 
development against a range of sustainability indicators, and the scope to mitigate 
adverse effects.  This process has resulted in housing al locations in area s previously 
identified as Areas of Local Separation, but these allocations will require careful planning 
through their design and layout to minimise the impact on the physical and perceptual 
separation between the built areas of settlemen ts.   
 
Policy EV3: Areas of Local Separation  
 
We will protect the predominantly open and undeveloped character of Areas of Local 
Separation defined on the Policies Map.   
 
We will only support development in Areas of Local Separation that:  
 
• preserves settl ement identity; an d  
• clearly maintains the phy sical and perceptual separation between the built -up areas of 
settlements.  
 
Charnwood Forest and the National Forest  
 
8.21.  Charnwood Forest is an important and distinctive upland landscape for the region 
punctuate d by rocky outcrop s and fast flowing streams. The landscape is well wooded 
including large tracts of ancient woodland. The majority of fields within Charnwood Forest 
are rectilinear in shape while some have been enlarged to allow for the introduction of 
arable crops. Local stone vernacular is visible in buildings and walls and there are many 
sites of nationally and locally valued ecological importance, including former quarries, 
woodland and heath grasslands in the Forest. Historic estate parklands add to t he Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  183 
 distinctiveness  of the landscape and long p anoramic views are possible from numerous 
parts of the area. Two thirds of Charnwood Forest is within Charnwood; the remainder is 
within the neighbouring areas of North West Leicestershire District and Hinckley  and 
Bosworth Boro ugh. 
 
8.22.  The distinctive geolog y and land cover within Charnwood Forest results in a rich ecology, 
with a wide variety of biodiversity including Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) priority habitats, 
supporting a range of threatened species inclu ding European Prot ected Species. Its 
significa nce for ecology and biodiversity is also recognised by the Charnwood Forest 
Living Landscape Scheme and the Charnwood National Character Area Profile.  
 
8.23.  Charnwood Forest has been identified as a Regional Park an d, together with o ur partners, 
we have prepare d landscape evidence which defines the boundary of the Park, and this 
is shown on the Policies Map.  The partnership has been successful in securing £2.78m 
of funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for  a Landscape Partn ership Scheme 
to create a st ep-change in the way Charnwood Forest’s heritage and landscape is 
explored, understood and cared for. The scheme will run between 2020 and 2025 and 
will deliver 18 integrated projects.  We will support the obje ctives of the sche me through 
the local plan.  
 
8.24.  The Partnership is also pursuing other means to secure the recognition of the distinctive 
and unique qualities of the Charnwood Forest Regional Park which may include UNESCO 
Geo Park status in recognition of th e special value of  the area’s geology.   
 
8.25.  Char nwood Forest is fringed by towns and villages as well as being accessible to 
residents in the wider sub -region. It experiences significant pressure from visitors with 
much of the visitor pressure focussed on a few honey pot site s including Bradgate Park, 
Beacon Hill Country Park and the Outwoods all of which are in our Borough. Similarly, 
we will support the aims of the Landscape Partnership Scheme to provide a high-quality  
experience for visitors through both n ew or improved sma ll-scale tourism facilities  and 
through rural diversification. It is essential that visitor growth is managed in a way that is 
compatible with the special and unique character of Charnwood Forest.  
 
8.26.  Charnwood Forest marks the eastern exte nt of the National  Forest.  The National Forest 
seeks to create a National Forest between the ancient forests of Needwood in 
Staffordshire and Charnwood in Leicestershire and extends over an area of 200 square 
miles O riginating in the early 1990’s the wood land cover within the National Forest has 
increased from the original 6% to nearly 22% by March 2021.   
 
8.27.  The relationship between the Charnwood Forest and the National Forest is illustrated on 
the Key Diagram.  Within  the Borough, all areas of National For est are overlapped  by the 
area of Charnwood Forest, the latter extending over a broader area.  
 
8.28.  We will support the National Forest Strategy 2014 -2024, and any subsequent National 
Forest Strategy, which supports rural regeneration and demonstrates the benef its of a 
forest close to a large population. We will support the aims of the National Forest Strategy 
to create a visitor destination for the National Forest as a whole, whilst recognising the 
unique character of Char nwood Forest. We will also support the Charnwood Forest Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  184 
 Regional Park and aims of the National Forest Strategy by ensuring new developments 
in the Charnwood Forest area meet the National Forest Planting Guidelines.   
 
8.29.  Our vision recognises the importance o f Charnwood Forest and it has shaped ou r 
development stra tegy for homes and jobs, especially around Loughborough and 
Shepshed.  
 
Policy EV4: Charnwood Forest and the National Forest  
 
The Charnwood Forest Regional Park and National Forest are defined on th e Policies  Map.  
We will work with our partners to protec t and enhance the Charnwood Forest Regional 
Park and support the aims of the National Forest Strategy.  We will support development 
that:  
 
• supports the woodland economy and rural diversification, in cluding sustainable small -
scale  tourism  and recreation op portunities which protect, and enhance the distinctive 
landscape character of the Charnwood Forest;  
• protects and enhances the biodiversity of the Charnwood Forest Regional Park, 
consistent with the a ims of the National Character Area prof ile of Charnwood;  
• provides tree planting within the Charnwood Forest Regional Park, in accordance with 
the National Forest Planting Guidelines;  
• provides an improved network of public rights of way within Charnwood Forest and 
between nearby settlements inc luding the establishment of a network of off -road links 
for walkers, cyclists and equestrians; and  
• improves accessibility for people with mobility issues including improved footpaths 
and parking for people with disabilities.  
 
River Soar and Grand Union Can al Corridor  
 
8.30.  The R iver Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor contain significant wildlife habitats, and 
this is recognised by the Soar and Wreake Living Landscape Scheme. The corridor also 
has links to the wider River Soar and River Wreake catchments. Many p eople within our 
communities live close to the corridor and enjoy the opportunities it provides for walking, 
cycling, the navigation of boats and other leisure activities. However, there are nearby 
villages that suffer from a lack of access to green spaces .  
 
8.31.  The River Soar  and Grand Union Canal Strategy, which was prepared with our partners, 
aims to improve and promote a 23 -mile-long corridor which runs from Kilby Bridge in 
Oadby and Wigston to the south, through the city of Leicester to Loughborough Meado ws 
in the north.  
 
8.32.  The River Soar and Grand Union Canal Strategy identifies hubs at Loughborough, Barrow 
upon Soar and Thurmaston for leisure activities. We are supportive of this strategy and 
we will improve access to green spaces for our communities by en couraging improved  
links between our villages and the River Soar. The Strategy identifies the need to provide 
tourism facilities at Watermead Country Park and also recognises the challenges facing 
the corridor including its ability to deliver economic bene fits. We will work  with our partners 
to improve the tourism offer and to maximise the economic benefits delivered along the 
River Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor.  Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  185 
 8.33.  There will also be an opportunity for local communities, through neighbourhood plans, to  
identify ways in which the River Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor can be preserved 
and enhanced.  
 
Policy EV5: River Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor  
 
We will work with our partners to protect and enhance the River Soar and Grand Union 
Canal Corrido r.   
 
We will supp ort development that:  
 
• provides high quality walking, cycling and bridle path links, between the River Soar and 
Grand Union Canal Corridor and our towns and villages, including for people with 
reduced mobility; 
• delivers hubs and other hi gh-quality tourism  opportunities linked to  the River Soar and 
Grand Union Canal at Loughborough, Barrow upon Soar and Thurmaston;  
• protects and enhances the biodiversity value of the River Soar and Grand Union Canal, 
and the strategically important links in  the wildlife netw ork between them;  
• prote cts and enhances the water bodies and resources of the River Soar and Grand 
Union Canal; and  
• actively seeks opportunities to enhance the River Soar and Grand Union Canal 
Corridor, links to it and its management inc luding its wildlif e and biodiversity.  
 
We will support local communities through neighbourhood plans to identify ways in which 
the River Soar and Grand Union Canal Corridor can be preserved and enhanced.  
 
Biodiversity and Geodiversity  
 
8.34.  Our Borough benefits  from a rich and v aried range of habitats and species which reflect 
our diverse landscape character.  Few places in the region are fortunate enough to 
possess the array of habitats provided by the river valleys of the Soar and Wreake, and 
the uplands of Ch arnwood Forest and  the Leicesters hire Wolds.  
 
Designated and Non -Designated Sites  
 
8.35.  The ecological interest provided by our natural environment is highly valued by our 
communities and should be protected for future generations. The significance of 
Charnwood ’s natural environ ment is recogni sed by statutory designations including 19 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which are identified as being of national 
importance. Alongside these there are 5 Local Nature Reserves (LNR) and 218 Local 
Wildlife Sit es (LWS) which have an important ecological value and contribute to our 
Borough’s natural environment.  
 
8.36.  Geology and geological formations are also an important part of our natural environment.  
They help contribute to our sense of place and are important f or aesthetic, educational 
and his toric reasons.  We have nationally significant sites of geological interest in the 
Borough, including statutory geological SSSIs, and 4 Regionally Important Geological 
Sites (RIGS). The majority of these relate to Charnwood  Forest.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  186 
 8.37.  These st atutory and local designations are complemented by landscape and habitat 
features which have not been formally designated but provide important wildlife corridors 
and stepping stones. Undesignated landscape and habitat features, for examp le trees, 
ponds an d hedges make an important contribution to Charnwood’s wider ecological 
networks and are essential to the continued health of the more valuable sites. For 
example, they create a means for wildlife movement and dispersal through the landsc ape 
as wel l as being habitats with value in their own right, and as such should be protected 
and enhanced.  
 
8.38.  Trees can be important individually and within formal groups, copses and woodland.  
Development should seek to protect and enhance these assets for our commun ities.    
Ancient and Veteran trees in Charnwood are also important to us as their age, size and 
condition create biological, cultural and visual interest which cannot easily be replaced. 
These trees provide ecosystems that support a wide range o f other pl ants and  wildlife, 
many of which require the special environment created by an old tree. The loss of such 
valuable trees and habitats in Charnwood will be resisted unless there are overriding 
exceptional circumstances and their loss can be compen sated.  
 
Conservati on, Restoration and Enhancement  
 
8.39.  We recognise that there has been a loss of habitats and species in Leicestershire over 
the past 50 years, reflecting the national picture.  The most threatened priority habitats 
and species for conservatio n at a nat ional le vel are identified through the England 
Biodiversity List. At a more local level the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland 
Biodiversity Action Plan sets out habitats and species of local conservation concern in 
Charnwood and the rest of Le icestershire and R utland.   
 
8.40.  We must manage our natural environment to limit damage and habitat fragmentation and 
give appropriate support to wider duties, such as the Water Framework Directive.   
 
8.41.  The existing pattern of development in Charnwood poses very  significa nt chall enges for 
wildlife, as built development is concentrated from the edge of Leicester along the Soar 
and Wreake Valleys up to Loughborough.  As growth has taken place the gaps have 
narrowed between our settlements, which is a serious concer n for our ecologic al network 
because it causes the most significant features to become more isolated from each other 
and from the wider landscape . Our development strategy seeks to ensure that landscape 
scale habitat connectivity is maintained between the River Soar, Rothle y Brook, 
Charnwood Forest and the broader ecological network including the strategically 
important links in the wildlife network .  
 
8.42.  Managing, enhancing, restoring and creating habitats can help to reverse this decline and 
sustain the bene fits from our natu ral environment which we currently enjoy.   Charnwood 
Forest and the National Forest, along with the floodplain of the River Soa r and River 
Wreake valleys are recognised as having high value for wildlife because of the quality of 
existing  habitats. Whilst these areas will be a focus for nature recovery, other parts of the 
Borough will also be targeted including the Wolds.  
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  187 
 8.43.  We will  work with our partners on nature recovery prioritising areas which support 
protected species and contain prio rity habitats.  This will include supporting initiatives 
such as the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust’s ‘Living Landscapes’ schemes for 
the Charnwood Forest and the Soar and Wreake which aim to restore, recreate and 
reconnect fragmented habitats t o create a resilie nt and healthy environment, accessible 
and useful for people and wildlife.   
 
8.44.  Neighbourhood plans also offer the opportunity to protect and enhance sites which are 
important for wildlife, biodiversity and geodiversity locally. These sites  may already be 
locally designated however there may be opportunities to enhance or improve 
connections between these or to designate new wildlife  sites.  We will work with 
neighbourhood plan groups to explore these local opportunities.  
 
8.45.  We have a statutor y duty to improve prospects for biodiversity. This means protecting 
restoring and enhancing designated sites and local wildlife -rich habitats and wider 
ecological networks which provide essential supporting habitat to designated sites.  This 
landscape scal e approach will be  an important means of mitigating the impact of climate 
change on biodiversity.  
 
Measurable Biodiversity Net Gain  
 
8.46.  We will improve  biodiversity in our Borough by requiring a 10% net biodiversity gain when 
development takes place.  This sh ould be achieved t hrough a combination of retaining 
important features of the site and  by making on site biodiversity enhancements to  ensure 
an overall 10% net biodiversity gain is achieved, which contributes to restoring and 
enhancing the wider ecological  networks and biod iversity of the Borough.  
 
8.47.  We may consider biodiversity offsetting where it can be evidenced that on-site 
improvements are not possible, may result in piecemeal mitigation on small sites, or 
where better opportunities exist to secure net g ain elsewhere. In essence this can allow 
ecological harm caused by development in one location to be compensated by habita t 
enhancement and creation in another where this provides the best opportunity to enhance 
and restore biodiversity networks.   
 
8.48.  Biodive rsity net gain mea ns leaving the natural environment in a measurably better state 
than beforehand. Biodiversity Impact Ass essments (BIA) are used to measure the impact 
of development taking account of the proposed mitigation.  To achieve net gain, a 
develo pment must have a higher biodiversity unit score after development than before 
development.  A suitable BIA metric should be used to allow the assessment of 
biodiversity impact of a given development, and where appropriate the size of contribution 
required  to offset the eco logical impact of that development.  
 
8.49.  Features provided by development to provide net gain should usually  relate as closely as 
possible to the impacts that they are proposed to mitigate. Net gains in biodiversity can 
be provided for all de velopment proposal s from a single dwelling to much larger strategic 
developments through a variety of measures, for exampl e: 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  188 
 • ensuring open spaces, landscaping and other areas include areas of wildflower 
meadows, urban woodland, community woodland and othe r biodiversity sup porting 
features;  
• sustainable drainage systems which benefit wildlife;  
• removing barriers to wildlife mov ement and restoring connections;  
• planting suitable trees and shrubs in landscaping; and  
• other features such as integrated bird and bat  boxes which can h elp to enhance the 
ecological value of developments and in some cases may be used to provide specific 
mitigation for protected or notable species and can, where there is a specific 
requirement for such features, result in biodiversity net  gain.  
 
8.50.  To demonst rate that development proposals have met the requirements of Policy EV6, 
they will need to be accompanie d by an ecological survey, where this is relevant to the 
type of development proposed and its relationship with biodiversity and geodi versity 
interests.   Proposals should also be able to demonstrate how they have been designed 
to minimise their impact on e cology. Ecological surveys should be undertaken by a 
suitably qualified and/or experienced ecologist and will need to include a Biodiv ersity 
Impact Asse ssment to measure the net gain achieved on site or loss that would need to 
be compensated.  The assessme nt should be proportionate to the scale and impact of 
the development.  
 
Policy EV6: Conserving and Enhancing Biodiversity and Geodive rsity  
 
We will con serve, restore  and enhance our natural environment for its own value and the 
contribution it makes to our communities and economy and ensure it is resilient to current 
and future pressures.  
 
We will ensure that biodiversity, ecological ne tworks and geodive rsity interests are 
protected, restored, enhanced and resilient.  We will do this by seeking 10% biodi versity 
net gain and supporting development that:  
 
• protects and enhances national and local priority habitats and species;  
• protects and enhances irreplaceable habitats including trees, veteran trees and ancient 
woodland;  
• protects and enhances biodiversity networks, including strategically important links in 
the wildlife network between our most valuable habitats;  
• supports nature recovery p articularly in are as which have protected species and 
priority habitats;  
• protects features of geodiversity value and enh ances their interpretation;  
• ensures biodiversity and geodiversity are maintained during construction; and  
• improves the water quality of  any water body as  required by the Water Framework 
Directive.  
 
Development proposals should be accompanied by an ecological survey including a 
Biodiversity Impact Assessment and demonstrate how they have been designed to 
minimise ecological impact and pro vide 10% net gain on site in the first instance or 
through biodiversity offsetting, where appropriate.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  189 
 Developmen t proposals which harm internationally, nationally or locally designated 
biodiversity and geodiversity sites and/or Charnwood’s priority habit ats and species wi ll 
not be supported, unless there are exceptional circumstances.  It must be demonstrated 
that:  
 
• there is no alternative site available; and  
• there are clear and convincing public benefits of the development that significantly 
outweigh the  nature conservati on or scientific interest of the site.  
 
Where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated, we wil l require adequate mitigation 
measures, relocation or as a last resort compensatory measures providing a 10% net gain 
in biodiversity value ab ove the habitat lo st. 
 
Tree Planting  
 
8.51.  Trees are an essential part of our environment, individually and in groups they provide a 
habitat for wildlife, enhance our natural landscape, help to reduce flood risk, and offer 
space for recreation and enjoyment of  the natural world . They can also help to lower 
temperatures, especially in urban areas, and importantly of fset CO 2 emissions.  
 
8.52.  In Leicestershire the tree population changed significantly in the late 1970s with more 
than 200,000 mature trees lost from the landscape to Dutch  elm disease. Since then, the 
effects of other disorders, the impacts of residential and commercial development, and 
changes to farming methods were primarily responsible for a further reduction in 
individual trees in the 1980s and 1990s.  Today, our eviden ce tells us that semi natural 
and plantation woodlands account for 12.16%  of the area of the Borough. This figure does 
not include hedgerows, scrub, scattered trees or trees in urban areas.  
 
8.53.  More recently there have been some positive dev elopments with the  introduction of tree 
planting initiatives in areas such as the National Forest to create new woodlands.  Our 
Borough enjoys the benefits of such initiatives as it contains  part of the National Forest 
and the Charnwood Forest Regional Par k. To take advanta ge of this we are proposing to 
work with our partners to achieve high lev els of tree planting across the Borough, not only 
within the National Forest and Charnwood Forest, but also in other rural and urban areas. 
This will enable us to en sure all our commu nities benefit from tree planting and to 
enhance our Green Infrastructure  and ecological networks.  
 
8.54.  We want new residential developments to make a significant contribution to tree planting 
as an integral part of their landscaping schemes . We understand th at this may not be 
appropriate in every case, for example if there are sp ace constraints or where tree 
planting may impact on important landscapes or habitats. In such instances it may be 
more appropriate to agree to tree planting elsewhe re. The Woodland T rust’s Emergency 
Tree Plan for the UK 2020 recommends that for every tree  removed, three more should 
be planted. This will help to significantly increase tree coverage in Charnwood, and we 
will be supportive of developments that adopt thi s approach. For de velopments in 
Charnwood Forest, the National Forest Planting Guidelines w ill apply.  
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  190 
 8.55.  We will expect developers to follow a sequential approach to tree planting: firstly, within 
the development site in accordance with a landscape plan; s econdly, where on site 
planting is not possible due to the size or characteristics of the s ite or the impact upon 
habitats and biodiversity then planting should take place in the vicinity of the development, 
and thirdly, if the opportunities for local plan ting are limited t hen tree planting should take 
place elsewhere in the Borough through a co mmuted sum with priority given to those 
areas which are deficient in parks and gardens and natural and semi natural open space.  
Wherever new tree planting is propos ed, consideration should be given to the proximity 
of underground sewers to prevent damage to the sewerage network.     
 
8.56.  We will encourage our local communities through neighbourhood plans to identify 
locations for additional tree planting.  
 
Policy EV7: Tr ee Planting  
 
We wi ll seek to protect and enhance our natural environment by increasing the number of 
trees in Charnwood.  We will support development that:  
 
• retains existing trees where appropriate;  
• provides new tree planting on site, including replacing any removed non -woodland tree 
with at least three new trees; and  
• applies the latest National Forest Planting Guidelines for development proposals within 
the area of the National Forest and Charnwood Forest Regional Park.  
 
Any new trees planted should be na tive species suita ble for the location and be of benefit 
to local biodiversity.  We will expect the planting of new trees to take proper consideration 
of long -term  management and maintenance including impact on highways and sewerage 
network.  
 
Where on sit e planting is not possible due to the size of site, its characteristics or the 
impac t upon biodiversity, we will encourage trees to be planted at a suitable location 
outside the site.  
 
We will encourage neighbourhood plans to identify suitable locations fo r additional tree 
planting and to promote tree planting on public and privately owne d land by the wider 
community.  
 
Heritage  
 
8.57.  Alongside the importance of our natural environment, the built environment in Charnwood 
also contributes greatly towards our quali ty of life, the en joyment of our surroundings and 
understanding of our history. The heritage assets and historic environment in our Borough 
signify Charnwood’s long history and are irreplaceable resources which contribute greatly 
to our well -being and sens e of place. We rec ognise that our historic environment is 
essential in creating a di stinctive, enjoyable and thriving place in which we live and work. 
It can help economic growth, attracting investment and tourism, and provide a focus for 
successfully rege nerating our Borou gh.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  191 
 8.58.  Our nationally designated heritage assets include nearly 800  Listed Buildings, such as 
the Grade I listed Prestwold Hall, Ulverscroft Priory Ruins and the Triumphal Arch at 
Garendon Park. There are 21 Scheduled Monuments from the Hi ll Fort at Beacon Hill to 
Bradgate House, the home of Lady Jane Grey. We have three Registered Parks and 
Gardens at Bradgate Park, Garendon Park and Prestwold Hall.  
 
8.59.  We want to protect the listed buildings and other designated heritage assets in our 
Borou gh and ensure that  the special architectural and historic interest they represent are 
preserved for future generations and continue to reflect Charnwood’s unique chara cter.  
 
8.60.  There are 38 Conservation Areas in the Borough, including most of our traditional  village 
and town centres as well as some Victorian, Edwardian and 1920s residential suburbs.  
 
8.61.  The Conservation Areas in our Borough acknowledge the important contrib ution of the 
historic cores of our towns and villages, along with more recent suburbs, to  the high-
quality  built environment we enjoy. We regularly monitor their character and appearance 
through Conservation Area Character Appraisals to identify opportunit ies for 
improvement and ensure that they continue to be of architectural and historic mer it.  
 
8.62.  We also have  more than 200 locally listed buildings, which are non -designated heritage 
assets of historic or architectural interest identified for their contribu tion to our local 
environment and heritage. Neighbourhood plans provide an opportunity fo r local 
communitie s to identify and protect local heritage assets which are of importance to their 
local community.  
 
8.63.  We accept that to fully appreciate our heritage a ssets it is important we ensure that their 
setting is respected.  This may include a vari ety of views of th e asset and its surroundings, 
and we will seek to ensure that they are not compromised by inappropriate or 
unsympathetic development.  
 
8.64.  Archaeologica l remains also form part of our historic environment providing evidence of 
earlier human activity in Charnw ood which should be protected to help understand our 
past. Whilst some are recorded through the Leicestershire and Rutland Historic 
Environment Recor d (HER) other sites are yet to be discovered but may still be important.  
 
8.65.  Some of our bu ildings and struct ures of historic importance are at risk of falling into 
disrepair as they are no longer required for their original purposes.  Alternative uses can 
help retain these valued buildings by addressing that risk, but any changes to them must 
be carefully consid ered to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s 
conservation and any aspect of the proposal.  
 
8.66.  Historic England has identified el even heritage assets at risk in our Borough including the 
Triumphal Arch and the Temple o f Venus at Garendo n Park, along with the Park itself; 
Taylor's Bell Foundry; Ulverscroft Priory Ruins; churches at Rothley, South Croxton and 
Woodhouse; a Roman villa at Barkby Thorpe, and the Shelthorpe Conservation Area.  
 
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  192 
 8.67.  We have worked with our partn ers to ensure that  the development of the West of 
Loughborough Sustainable Urban Extension addresses the risk to Garendon Park and its 
assets. The remaining heritage a ssets at risk in our Borough will be monitored and we 
will proactively seek opportunities  for their restora tion and re -use, supporting appropriate 
development schemes that ensure their repair and maintenance.  
 
8.68.  We will ensure that our heritage assets and their settings are safeguarded from 
inappropriate development whilst the character and app earance of our Con servation 
Areas are preserved and enhanced. A development proposal will need to fully consider 
the significance of the heritage asset and the im pact of the development on the asset. 
This should be supported by evidence and the level of de tail should be pro portionate to 
the assets’ importance. Development that has the potential to affect a heritage asset or 
its setting will be expected to demonstra te an understanding of the significance of the 
asset and/or its setting proportional to its im portance.  
 
8.69.  Our pol icy states that we will encourage the sympathetic reuse of our historic assets and 
where we consider the loss of a heritage asset to be clearly justified by the benefits to the 
public, we will seek to ensure investigation and recording of  the asset for the  community.  
 
8.70.  The reuse of historic assets supports our aim of mitigating the impacts of climate change 
by minimising the use of new natural reso urces and preventing wastage of existing 
resources. The sensitive retrofitting of historic bui ldings and conserv ation areas with 
energy efficiency measures and micro -renewables is a crucial part of their conservation 
and ensuring that they have a sustainab le future.  
 
Policy EV8: Heritage  
 
We will conserve and enhance our historic environment includ ing our heritage a ssets 
(which include archaeological assets) for their own value and the contribution they make 
to the community, environment and economy.  We will support development that:  
 
• protects and enhances heritage assets, including non -designated heritage assets, and 
prevents harm to their significance and setting;  
• incorporates Charnwood’s distinctive local building materials and architectural details 
to make a positive contribution to the  character and appearance of the area;  
• has been informed by our Conservation A rea Character Appraisals, Landscape 
Character Appraisals, Village Design Statements and neighbourhood plans;  
• supports the sympathetic reuse of buildings of architectural or histo ric importance, to 
ensure they continue to make a positive c ontribution to the  historic environment, and 
which reinforce local distinctiveness and sense of place;  
• conserves, protects and enhances heritage assets at risk through neglect, decay or 
other thr eats; and  
• sensitively retrofits energy efficient measures an d micro -renewables  to historic 
buildings and in conservation areas, whilst protecting heritage assets and their setting 
for the future in accordance with DS6 Design and CC4 Sustainable Constructio n. 
 
We will support neighbourhood plans in identifying and p rotecting local he ritage assets 
which are of importance to their local community . 
 Chapte r 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  193 
 Open Spaces Sport and Recreation  
 
8.71.  Open spaces are an important resource with multiple benefits for people, particularly for 
their health and well -being. As our population in creases the pressu re on current provision 
will mount and we need to ensure that our communities have access to open s paces 
which meet their needs, as well as having the opportunity to practice sport and 
recreational activities at good quality, well designe d accessible facil ities.  Design has an 
important role to play in encouraging people to be more active by improving a ccessibility, 
enhancing amenity and increasing awareness.  
 
8.72.  We have identified nine types of open space, sport and recreation facilities:  
 
• Parks and gardens –  from major parks to small memorial gardens;  
• Natural and semi -natural urban green spaces – from wo odlands to grasslands;  
• Amenity green space – often small spaces which improve the local environment and, 
in some cases, provide recreationa l value;  
• Provision  for children and young people – primarily for play and social interaction;  
• Outdoor and indoor spor ts facilities – including playing fields;  
• Allotments, community gardens and urban farms – for people to grow produce;  
• Cemeteries, disused c hurchyards and oth er burial grounds – primarily used for 
burials but can also provide open space, ecological value an d amenity benefits;  
• Green corridors – accessible linear spaces for walking and cycling which can include 
rights of way, cycle paths, bridle ways and towpaths and waterways;  
• Civic spaces – comprising civic and market squares and village greens.  
 
8.73.  We have unde rtaken assessments of our communities’ needs for open space, sport and 
recreation facilities, along with opportunities for new provision. T his evidence was u sed 
to inform the Council’s Open Spaces Strategy and to inform our standards for provision 
of open space and facilities from new development.  
 
8.74.  New provision can often best serve the community on site as an integral part of the 
development , but consideratio n should also be given to the enhancement of existing 
provision off site. New development often places greater demand on existing sites and 
facilities in the locality, and so in cases where provision on site may be inappropriate, we 
will expect a contribut ion towards enhancing existing provision and/or the provision of 
new facilities off site. We will assess if there is any shortfall in provision  created by new 
development by taking account of our evidence on supply and demand for open spa ces. 
 
8.75.  We have used  our evidence to develop the following standards of provision set out in the 
table below and will apply these to all major new residential deve lopments based on an 
average of 2.4 persons per dwelling. We will apply the open space provisio n standards 
having  regard to the type of accommodation proposed.

cover and allotments.  
100-249 
residential units 
(240 to 598 
persons)  Typically,  this might include on site provision of amenity green 
space, natural and semi -natural green space, provision for 
young people and/or children’s pl ay and off-site contributions 
towards parks and gardens, indoor and outdoor sports facilities, 
canopy cover and allotments.  
250+ units (600

sports facilities and recreation provision in accordance with ou r 
standards and with a presumption for on-site provision in 
accordance with our policy.    
 
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  196 
 8.78.  Because of the benefits provided by open space, sport and recreation facilities, we are 
proposing to protect existing areas unless their loss c an be justified. D evelopment 
proposals which affect playing pitches will require strong justification due to the health 
and recreational value they provide. To ensure that the needs of our communities are met 
our approach is to secure the provision, qualit y and accessibilit y of open space, sport and 
recreation facilities by planning condition or a Section 106 legal a greement.  We will also 
encourage our communities to protect and enhance locally important open space, sport 
and recreation facilities through neighbourhood plan s.  
 
8.79.  We have provided detailed guidance on the maintenance arrangements we would expect 
for open spaces, sports and recreation facilities in our Open Spaces Strategy. Open 
space sites can be transferred to the ownership of the Borough Cou ncil, Parish Counc il 
or retained through management companies. Where land is transferred to the ownership 
of the Borough Council or Parish Council the payment of a commuted sum to ensure 
ongoing maintenance will be required. In those cases where on site pr ovision is retaine d 
and maintained under a management company, we expect the open space to be 
managed to a high standard and be available for the whole community  and not restricted 
to occupiers of that specific development. We will secure these arrangement s in a S106 
legal agree ment.  
 
Policy EV9: Open Spaces, Sport and Recreation  
 
We will work with our partners to meet the open space, sport and recreation facilities needs 
of our communities to support their health, well -being and cohesion.  
 
We will support major residential devel opment where they meet the needs generated by 
the proposed community and that:  
 
• provide on-site open space, sport and recreation facilities in accordance with our 
standards, having regard to the latest assessment of needs and priorit ies, the quantity,  
acce ssibility and quality of existing provision and viability; and/or  
• contribute towards off site provision in accordance with our standards, where on site 
provision is not possible or desirable.  
 
We will require new and enhanced open space, sport and rec reation facilities to contribute 
towards healthier and more active lifestyles by:  
 
• being accessible to the whole community, functional, of high quality and active design, 
visible and safe, and including facilities for a range of ages;  
• enabling links to be created with surrounding recreational networks and facilities 
(including public rig hts of way, cycle paths, bridleways and towpaths);  
• providing appropriate and practical landscape design solutions that reflect the identity 
and quality of place whilst meeti ng the current and future needs of communities in a 
sustainable and creative way; a nd 
• specifying the responsibilities for management and maintenance prior to 
commencement of development and, if the site is to be transferred to the Borough  
Council or its no minee, agreeing a maintenance payment.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  197 
 We will protect our open space, sport and r ecreation provision identified on the Policies 
Map, and any future provision made as part of new development, unless it can be 
satisfactorily demonstrated that:  
 
• the propose d development is ancillary to the existing recreational use of the site; or  
• the pro vision is surplus to requirements as evidenced by an assessment of need; or  
• alternative provision of an equivalent or greater standard will be provided in an 
accessible loca tion nearby.  
 
Flood alleviation schemes within areas of open space will generally b e supported, 
provided they do not have an adverse impact on the primary function of the open space.  
 
We will support neighbourhood plan groups in protecti ng and enhance loc ally important 
open space, sport and recreation facilities through neighbourhood plans.  
Indoor Sports Facilities  
 
8.80.  We enjoy a good range of existing sport and leisure facilities in Charnwood; however, 
some existing facilities are now agein g, are of a poorer  quality, or require long term 
replacement and refurbishment. We have set out our priorities for new or enhanced 
provision of these facilities through the Action Plan  in our Indoor Built Sports Facility 
Strategy and these include:  
 
• retain ing existing level s of community accessible sports halls and fitness provision in 
the Borough as a minimum, but recognising that these need not necessarily be the 
same facilities as at present;  
• promoting investment into additional swimming pool provision i n accordance with the 
evidence of need;  
• encouraging investment in ageing facilities which need to be replaced or refurbished 
in accordance with Sport England and national governing bod y standards; and  
• supporting opportunities for participation to be provid ed in a wider rang e of places 
and spaces particularly at a local level.  
 
8.81.  To support these objectives, we will seek contributions from new developments towards 
new or enhanced provision  either on site or off site, having regard to viability and our 
evidence  of need. This sho uld also be supported by information on how management and 
maintenance of the facility will be undertaken.  We will calculate the contributions required 
from new deve lopments using our evidence of needs and priorities.  
 
8.82.  We will ensure th at any contributio ns sought are based on a tailored approach to each 
development, using our evidence to justify our approach.  Where a proven need exists, 
we will encourage pooled cont ributions to facilitate provision. In assessing whether new 
provision is  required consider ation will be given to the quantity, quality and accessibility 
of existing provision in the local area.   
 
 
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  198 
 Policy EV10: Indoor Sports Facilities  
 
We will encourage healthier lifestyles across our communities and increase the amount of 
regular physical a ctivity undertaken through the provision of indoor sports facilities.  
 
We will seek developer contributions from major development in accordance wit h Policy 
INF1 to support the provision of new indoor sports facilities, or improvements t o existing 
facilit ies, based on an assessment of need and our evidence of quantity, quality and 
accessibility of provision. We will support the provision of new indoor  sports facilities that 
are designed to respond to changing participation trends and oppo rtunities.  
Where p rovision of new indoor sports facilities is located within school and college sites, 
public access to these facilities will be sought and secured through community use 
agreements.  
 
Air Quality  
 
8.83.  The Government’s Clean Air Strategy 2019 re cognises that clea n air is essential for life, 
health, the environment and the economy and that we must act to tackle air pollution 
which shortens lives.  Air pollution can be hugely harmful to our health and Publ ic Health 
England estimates that 5% of deat hs in Charnwood ar e attributable to long -term exposure 
to particulate air pollution, the same rate as for the country as a whole.   
 
8.84.  Older people, the young and those with existing lung or other health conditions,  for 
example asthma, are particularly at ri sk, with the poten tial for reduced life expectancy. 
Increasing temperatures can heighten the impact of air pollutants, and so climate change 
further raises the importance of addressing air quality issues.  
 
8.85.  Our evi dence tells us that the air quality in Char nwood is very good  and compliant with 
the National Air Quality Objective standards. These standards are to ensure that those in 
our community who are most susceptible to the effects of poor air quality do not suff er ill 
health as a result.  However, there are four Air Quali ty Management Areas in Charnwood 
in Syston, Mountsorrel and two in Loughborough. These have been declared because of 
emissions from transport or local industry and they are at risk of experiencin g air pollution 
levels above those set out in the UK Air Qual ity Regulations.   
 
8.86.  There have been no exceedances of air quality objectives in the Borough in recent years 
and our evidence predicts that there will be an improvement in air quality in Charnwood  
over the plan period.  Therefore, the focu s of our approach is towards prevention of 
exceedances rather than tackling pollution when limits have been surpassed.   
 
8.87.  There are important links with other policies in the local plan.  Our development strategy 
seeks to minimise the need to travel by pri vate car and CC5 S ustainable Travel aims to 
see a modal shift to sustainable modes of transport. These policies along with our policy 
for electric vehicle charging points seek to reduce emissions from vehicles.  T he policies 
in our environment chapter seek  to protect and en hance aspects of our natural 
environment which is important for the absorption of air pollutants.  A proactive rather 
than reactive approach will help us to improve air quality across the whole o f the Borough.  
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  199 
 8.88.  Some developments may requ ire an air quality  assessment where there is the risk of a 
significant air quality effect, either from a new development causing an air quality impact 
or creating exposure to high concentrations of pollutants for new residents. Th e purpose 
of the assessmen t will be to deter mine the predicted impact of a development on local air 
quality, public health and/or the local environment, to help determine the appropriate level 
of mitigation from a development.  
 
8.89.  An assessment will be requi red for proposals of:  
 
• 10 or more dwellings  (or a site area of more than 0.5 hectares) or more than 1,000sqm 
for all other uses (or a site area greater than 1 hectare) and  
• the development has more than car 10 parking spaces or the development will have 
a centralised energy facili ty or other centra lised combustion process.  
 
8.90.  Assessments will need to be proportionate to the nature and scale of development 
proposed and the potential impacts (taking into account existing air quality conditions), 
and because of this are likely to be lo cation specific  
 
8.91.  We recognise the importance neighbourhood plans can play in helping to improve air 
quality locally whereby our communities can identify measures suitable to their local 
areas.  
 
Policy EV11: Air Quality  
 
We will expect developments to suppo rt our aim to impr ove air quality in the Borough. We 
will support development that:  
 
• does not lead to a significant impact upon, and deterioration of, local air quality 
resulting in unacceptable effects on human health, l ocal amenity or the natural 
environ ment;  
• does not im pede the achievement of any air quality objective(s), particularly in 
locations currently or historically declared as Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs);  
• does not introduce a significant new source of  any air pollutant;  
• does not expose  its users or occu piers to concentrations in excess of air quality 
objectives;  
• is designed to minimise  the potential for air pollution to become trapped close to the 
ground; and  
• is supported by an air quality assessment, where appropriate.  
 
We will encour age neighbourhood plans to identify suitable air quality management 
measures to help improve air qualit y in their local area.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chapter 8 Environment  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  200 
 Burial Space  
 
8.92.  As our population grows, we will also need to ensure that sufficient space is available for 
burials in the future. The Borough  Council has assessed how best to meet its long term 
need for burial space and has identified a new 9.1ha site at Nanpantan which will help us 
to provide for the needs of the Loughborough area. Phase 1 of the cemetery was granted 
planning  permission in Sep tember 2020.   
 
8.93.  Elsewhere in the Borough our evidence shows that burial provision is likely to be sufficient 
to deal with the dema nd for burials at most locations for at least twenty years taking into 
account the number of deaths, the pop ulations served by  the burial grounds and 
increasing population as a result of housing growth.    
  
8.94.  The cemetery allocation lies within an area of sensitive landscape at the edge of 
Charnwood Forest Regional Park, and is visible from areas of higher ground , notably from 
the Outwoods.  The layout and landscaping of later phases of the cemetery will need 
careful consideration so that they are integrated into the surrounding landscape, with 
particular attention given to views of the cemetery from areas of high er ground.   
 
 
Policy EV12 Burial Space  
 
9.1ha of land are allocated at Nanpantan  for burial space.    
Proposals for new cemetery space should minimise the impact of development on the 
landscape by making use of additional planting comprising native specie s and naturalistic  
schemes to enhance the relationship between the development an d its wooded setting and 
helping to create a vegetated appearance to the edge of the built form of Loughborough.    
  Chapter 9 Infrastructure and Delivery  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  201 
 Chapter 9 Infrastructure and Delivery  
 
9.1. Infrastructure inc ludes all services  and facilities necessary to support development 
including esse ntial utilities such as gas and electricity, water supply and sewage 
treatment, broadband and transport.   Green infrastructure is also an important part of 
delivering sustain able development, including the provision of open space and recreation 
facilities , while community infrastructure including schools, health centres, and 
community buildings provide the framework of physical facilities needed to support and 
sustain a commun ity. 
 
9.2. We will ensu re that development provides infrastructure to facilitate and d eliver the plan’s 
development strategy. This strategy has been based on an assessment of the 
infrastructure needs of individual site allocations to ensure that development is 
sustainable. We ha ve worked in partnership with infrastructure providers and deli very 
agencies to assess requirements and ensure that all development proposals are 
supported by appropriate on site and off-site infrastructure.  We will continue to work 
closely with these bod ies to ensure the timely delivery of infrastructure and the Cou ncil 
will work with parish councils through a process of continuous engagement and ongoing 
liaison to understand community needs while also ensuring a close alignment with the  
neighbourhood pla nning process.   
 
9.3. An Infrastructure Schedule is included as an Appendix to the local plan, setting out the 
infrastructure required to support our development strategy. In addition, our Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan will be regularly update d as more evidence  becomes available  and 
investment decisions are finalised. We will also continue to work closely with 
infrastructure providers to ensure their future investment plans take account of the 
development strategy and are aligned to support gro wth in the Borough .  
 
9.4. We will assess  each planning application to ensure that the impacts of the proposed 
development can be mitigated, and the policies of this plan are fully implemented. We 
have not introduced a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and wi ll continue to sec ure 
developer cont ributions through Section 106 Legal Agreements to mitigate the impacts of 
development. Our decisions will be taken in accordance with the Government’s CIL 
Regulations 2010 (as amended), which state that a planning obliga tion within a lega l 
agreement should  be:  
 
• necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;  
• directly related to the development; and  
• fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  
 
In accordance with the regulations n ew development can not be used to fun d an existing 
shortfall in infrastructure; it can only be required to address the needs arising from new 
development itself.  
 
9.5. We will work with infrastructure providers to consider whether development proposals 
require i nfrastructure whic h can only be prov ided through pooling contributions from a 
number of different developments. This will apply to a range of infrastructure including 
education, health, local and strategic road improvements and flood protection and 
resilie nce schemes.   
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  202 
 Educ ation  
 
9.6. We have wor ked closely with the Local Education Authority to assess the current capacity 
of schools and their ability to cater for new growth , and to determine where, and how, 
additional capacity to support growth should be provide d. Whilst the prov ision of 
secondary  school and early years places can be achieved through appropriate individual 
site contributions having regard to the adequacy of local provision, our development 
strategy will require significant new and expanded primar y school provision  which cannot 
be a chieved without a coordinated approach. To provide certainty for communities, 
developers and providers, the sites required to contribute have been specified in Policy 
DS3. This does not preclude other sites contributing to these new and e xpanded schools 
or prevent Leicestershire County Council and Charnwood Borough Council agreeing an 
alternative approach to education provision to take account of the timing of delivery, for 
example.  
 
9.7. The sites identified in Policy DS3 do  not account for a ll the primary sch ool provision 
required by our development strategy.  All development sites will be required to contribute 
to education provision in accordance with Policy INF1 and having regard to Leicestershire 
County Council’s policy on developer contr ibutions.   
 
Health  
 
9.8. Our engagement with the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) has shown that there 
are capacity constraints in terms of primary care health provision at some locations due 
to rising numbers of patients which has been e xacerbated by the ageing popula tion and 
the difficulty of recruiting doctors and medical staff.  
 
9.9. New development will be expected to contribute to the reasonable costs of enhanced 
service provision. Improvements are most likely to be in the form of extensi ons to existing 
premises to provide more treatment rooms and ancillary facilities or modification s to 
improve the patient experience. The funding and delivery of entirely new GP practices 
will be supported where necessary.  Planning decisions will be infor med by continued 
joint working and evidence of need including the Estates Strategy prepared colle ctively 
by Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland CCGs.  
 
Power  
 
9.10.  Western Power Distribution has advised the Council that there are currently no known 
capacity co nstraints which wo uld limit the implementation of the plan. We will continue to 
work closely with  them to ensure that the capacity of the system is sufficiently robust to 
cope with any changes arising during the plan period. For example, our evidence point s 
to significant c hanges in demand arising from the move to low carbon energy, such as 
the antici pated growth in electric vehicles, supported by local plan Policy CC6 for new 
electric vehicle charging points.  We are also aware that availability of supply can change 
within a short space of time, as new connections take place, and significant developme nts 
such as the Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park could result in high levels of 
electricity demand. We will work closely with the developers and Wester n Power 
Distributi on to ensure that any capacity issues are addressed.  
 
 
 
  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  203 
 Water  
 
9.11.  Severn Trent W ater has advised that water supply is not expected to be a constraint to 
development because the water supply network is pressurised and therefore has 
flexibil ity to provide for  new connections. There will however be a need for improvements 
to capacity at some waste water treatment works that could otherwise be a constraint to 
growth, including Wanlip (where improvements are programmed) and Shepshed (where 
capacity improvements a re likely to be needed towards the end of the plan period). We 
will continue to  work closely with Severn Trent Water to ensure that growth needs are 
addressed, and the implementation of major capital investment takes place in accordance 
with the trajectori es of housing growth.  
 
Broadband  
 
9.12.  Superfast broadband is a critically important  infrastructure now commonly referred to as 
the ‘fourth utility’ alongside electricity, gas and water supply. We want Charnwood to be 
a well- connected Borough in order to reduce  the need to travel, support higher levels of 
home working and inward investmen t and improve economic competitiveness. 
Leicestershire County Council’s support for enhanced broadband coverage, ‘Superfast 
Leicestershire’ is focussed on area s not served by co mmercial operators. The greatest 
need is likely to remain in rural areas in the  east of the Borough where in the region of 
1,000 premises remain unconnected. We will continue to support the full roll out of 
superfast broadband to achieve the Government’s t arget of a full fibre UK wide network 
and ensure that all of our businesses and  communities are able to take advantage of the 
opportunities that it presents.   
 
Viability  
 
9.13.  The local plan’s policy requirements together with local and natio nal standards have  been 
assessed to consider the impact they are likely to have on development vi ability. The 
assessment demonstrates that our policies are realistic, and that the total cumulative cost 
of all relevant policies will not undermine deliverabi lity of the plan. We will expect 
applicants to share with us the full results of any site-specifi c viability appraisals so that 
the process for assessing the deliverability of infrastructure is fair and transparent.    
 
 
Policy INF1: Infrastructure and Dev eloper Contributio ns   
 
We will work with infrastructure providers, developers and partner organisations to ensure 
the delivery of new and improved infrastructure necessary to support our development 
strategy and maintain sustainable and healthy communitie s.  We will suppor t deve lopment 
that:  
 
• is supported by robust evidence of the infrastructure needed to mitigate impacts and 
support sustainable development;   
• contributes to the reasonable costs of on site, and where appropriate off site, 
infrastructure n eeded to mitigate the impacts of the development through the use of 
Section 106 Legal Agreements, or in the case of highways, Section 278 Legal 
Agreements; and   
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  204 
 • contributes to the reasonable costs of any infrastructure required to mitigate the 
impacts of th e development stra tegy i ncluding through pooling of developer 
contributions where the impacts can only be addressed in a comprehensive way.   
 
We will seek to enter into planning performance agreements with promoters of 
strategically important sites to ensu re a programmed ap proach  to determination and 
implementation.  
We will relate the type, amount and timing of infrastructure to the scale of development, 
its viability and the impact it has on the site and surrounding area.   Where viability is 
identified a s a barrier to del ivery,  we will expect all promoters of major development to 
enter with us into an open book viability appraisal.  
 
The Local and Strategic Road Network   
 
9.14.  Our priority is to improve the sustainable transport offer in our Borough and Policy  CC5 
will help ach ieve this, but we know that our communities will still need to make some 
journeys by car, for example our evidence tells us that nearly 64% of people who live in 
Charnwood make their journey to work by private cars.   
 
9.15.  Charnwood benefits from good accessib ility, with the local road network connecting into 
the strategic road network of the M1 motorway and the A46.  The A6 runs through the 
centre of the Borou gh providing access to destinations north and south.   The Leicester 
and Leicestersh ire Strategic Grow th Plan identifies the importance of key transport 
corridors including the A46 Corridor which is also identified as a pan regional strategic 
priority by M idlands Connect. Aligning growth and transport infrastructure along this 
corridor wi ll be an important strategic priority and the Borough Council is supporting a 
partnership agreement to ensure a coordinated approach.     
 
9.16.  The key strategic and local routes in Charnwood benefit the local economy; however, 
congestion along these roads has an impact upon bus iness efficiency and reduces the 
attractiveness of the Borough for inward investment. Our development strategy will place  
more pressure on the network, and we have worked closely with Leicestershire County 
Council, Leicester City Council and Highways Engla nd to understand what the impacts 
will be and what measures are required to mitigate that impact.   
 
9.17.  Our evidence tells u s that by 2037 the highway network in the Borough will be close to 
capacity in some areas with the development which is already committ ed in Charnwood 
and the surrounding areas. To ensure that the development provided for in this plan and 
in other district s does not have a severe impact on the highway network we will require 
mitigation measures and a wider strategic prog ramme for highway improvements to be 
developed with our partners.  
 
9.18.  We will expect development to mitigate the impact of additional traffic  by improving 
accessibility, encouraging travel by sustainable modes of transport and through the 
necessary highway i mprovements. Devel opment should not have an unacceptable 
impact on highway safety, and assessment of the impacts should include considerati on 
of the cumulative impacts of growth and the need for pooled contributions to ensure that 
the network remains robus t. Consideration w ill be given to the cross -boundary 
implications arising from development and, where applicable, the potential for co - 
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  205 
 ordinating developer contributions with those of neighbouring authorities to mitigate 
impacts will be investigated.  Propo sals for highway i mprovement works, including those 
to the strategic road network, will be required to conform to the relevant design stand ards.  
 
9.19.  We will continue to work with key stakeholders including Leicester City Council, 
Leicestershire County Council , Highways England  and Housing Market Area partner 
authorities, to develop strategies to support growth, minimise the impacts of our 
develo pment strategy on the local and Strategic Road Network and maximise the delivery 
of transport infrastructure to meet the needs of our r esidents and businesses.    
 
Policy INF2: Local and Strategic Road Network  
 
We will work with Leicestershire County Coun cil, Leicester City Council Highways England 
and wider HMA authorities to mitigate the transport impacts of our devel opment strategy 
and improve the efficiency of our local and strategic road network.   
 
We will support development that:   
• is supported by a robust transport assessment of the impact of the development on 
the road network, including any cumulative impacts;   
• provides the nece ssary infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of the development with 
infrastructure which supports susta inable transport choices (including walking, 
cycling and the use of public transport) prioritised before any improvements to the 
local  and strategic roa d network; and   
• contributes to the reasonable costs of measures required to mitigate the cumulative 
impa cts of the development strategy upon the local and strategic road network,  in 
accordance with Policy INF1.    
 
  Appendix 1 -  Monitoring  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  206 
 Appendix 1 - Monitorin g 
 
It is important  that our local plan can be implemented and that the delivery and effectiveness of 
its policies against our objectives and timescales are monitored to ensure that our spatial vision 
for Charnwood is being delivered.  
 
Our profile of Charnw ood at the start o f this plan is compiled from statistics and information which 
comes from our evidence base, helping us i n identifying the issues which are important for the 
future of our Borough. The profile has provided a clear picture of how Charnwood looks now and 
has provided the foundation for our vision of Charnwood which this local plan will seek to deliver.  
We will carry out monitoring of the local plan each year to determine how successfully it is working. 
If any part of the local plan is not de livering as we int ended, or if circumstances have changed 
significantly then we will consider changes to our policies to s upport the successful delivery of 
new development and growth.  
We have based the framework for monitoring the local plan on its policie s, which in turn w ere 
prepared to meet the plan’s vision and objectives. Our performance monitoring framework is set 
out in the following table and details how we intend to check the delivery of the policies contained 
in the local plan and the spatial visi on which the polic ies seek to implement. The framework 
identifies the key indicators for each policy that will be used to monitor the delivery of our local 
plan objectives. It shows the strategic relationship between policy and objectives and how we will 
monitor the success ful delivery of our objectives.  
Each year we produce an Authority Monitoring Report (AMR), formerly the Annual Monitoring 
Report, which provides data and information on how our policies are performing and what effect 
they are having on Ch arnwood. The repor t looks at the progress of plan preparation; the duty to 
cooperate; development needs; delivery of local  plan policies; infrastructure delivery; 
neighbourhood planning; and developer contributions. We will use our monitoring framework to 
set out in our AMR  how well policies are achieving their objectives; whether the targets in our 
local plan are being met; and whether there have been any unintended consequences which we 
have identified.  
Managing Delivery  
Our supporting text for each poli cy sets out how it  will be delivered, with most policies delivered 
through the development management process. We will ens ure that we continue to provide a high 
quality and efficient service to assist in the timely delivery of sustainable development.  
We recognise that the  delivery of housing and economic growth, together with the provision of 
essential infrastructure, is vi tal for us to deliver our vision for the Borough. A key aim for our local 
plan is to ensure that sufficient homes are being built or i n the pipeline to meet our identified need. 
We have prepared a housing trajectory to accompany our local plan which shows how we expect 
our strategy to deliver the houses we need to meet our housing requirement.  
We will check the number of houses that are  being delivered e ach year against our trajectory and 
the housing requirement. This will enable us to consider the implica tions of any shortfall or surplus 
of housing and will be reported through the AMR.  
Our trajectory has been produced using information from a variety of sources. It takes into account 
projected completions from sites which have planning permission, includin g our sustainable urban Appendix 1 -  Monitoring  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  207 
 extensions. We have worked with the developer interests involved to agree projected rates of 
delivery and phas ing of infrastruct ure to inform our trajectory.  
We will also use our AMR to report two further tests related to the delive ry of new homes which 
have been introduced by the Government, the Housing Delivery Test and the Five -Year Housing 
Land Supply Assessme nt. The tests look  at housing completions over a three -year rolling average 
and at the supply of housing sites that could be built in the next five years. We will use these tests

 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  256 
  
Appendix 4 – Design Gu idance  
 
This appendix sets out  design guidance to support Policy DS5 High Quality Design on the 
design of development.  The first part provides more general guidance on responding to the 
landscape, the relationships between the different elements that make  up developments and the 
desig n of open spaces.  The second part provides more detailed, illustrated guidance on house 
extensions, amenity and car parking.  
 
Part 1: General Guidance  
A. Responding to the Landscape  
 
When  designing  developments  on the edge  of towns and  larger  villages a  crucial consideration is  
making sure  that the new built form represents a  harmonious extension to the existing settlement  
edge. This can be achieved by:  
• responding creatively to topographical changes in the landscape;   
• avoiding private amenity space backing di rectly onto open countryside;  
• creating a network of varied  amenity  spaces  and other  green  spaces,  e.g. wildlife  
corridors,  creating a transition between the Countryside and the development;  
• retaining existing mature trees, hed gerows and other planting thro ughout the development 
including at the boundary wit h the Countryside.  Solitary  existing  trees  in particular  can 
become  important  and distinctive  landmarks  on new  developments, contributing to  the 
character of  a place. Existin g groups  of trees  can also  serve as attractive natural  buffers 
that can soften  the impact  new development  can have on adjacent buildings and spaces;  
• using  building  materials  on dwellings  that assimilate  to the colour  palette  and texture of  the 
open  country side and the sensitive  use of street  lighting  at the settlement  edge.  
 
For developments  within  smaller  villages  in the Borough,  siting  is an important  design 
consideration.  Proposals  in these  areas  should  not appear  out of place  amongst  skylines viewed 
from open countryside, respecting  the existing building scales, mass, rooflines and materials.  
 
B. Relationships Between Elements  
 
It can be helpful in achieving good design to consider how the various elements that make up a 
development combine to create a whol e.  The following relationship  is a fundamental part of this 
approach:  
• The street pattern provides for movement routes and establishes the blocks in 
which built development can take place.  
• Street blocks are divided into individual plots part of which is oc cupied by built 
forms.  
• Built f orms are made up of easily recognisable components such as walls, roofs, 
doors and windows which are made of different materials.  
 
 
 
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  257 
 Street Pattern  
For large development s proposin g a networ k of new streets , the street s shoul d be organised in a 
hierarchy of p rimar y, secondary and minor routes.  
 
Primary  routes  form the main  connections  through  the development.  They  will usually be the 
widest routes in the scheme, accommodating vehicle, pedestrian and cycle flows in equal 
measure.  On primary  routes,  the inclusi on of street  trees  (ideally  larger  species),  planting  and 
street furniture such  as benches  can help to avoid  the dominance  of hard surfaces  within the 
highway corrido r. 
 
Secondary  routes  are narrower  than primary  routes  and should be designed  to ensure veh icles 
are required  to travel at  lower  speeds. The priority should  not be  on providing e fficient tra ffic flows 
but in  encouraging sustainable modes of travel and creating quiet street environments in  the 
interests of resident amenit y. Stree t parkin g is more suite d to secondar y route s and shoul d be 
embedde d within their design, though it should not overly  dominate the street -scene and  ideally 
should be located on one side and not both.  Secondary  routes  can also incorporate  a well-
defined  and attractive  publi c realm,  by providing  planting  and street  furniture,  albeit  to a lower  
extent than primary  routes.  They have narrower widths so, in terms of street tree provision, smaller 
species of trees may be more appropriate.  
 
Minor  route s are pedestrian  and cyclist  focused and  should  include  measures  in place to 
minimis e the spee d of vehicula r traffic. Thes e route s shoul d be well connecte d like other routes  but, 
ideall y, they should  create  a sense  of seclusion  and calm  from busier  routes.   Street trees  and 
planting  can help encourage  this, as well as consideration  of creating surfaces that are shared 
between vehicles and pedestrians.  
 
Scale,  Mass and Proportion  of Built Forms  
All new development should be  of a scale,  mass  and height  which  respects its surrounding  
conte xt. 
 
Scale  is the impression  of a building  when  seen  in relation  to its surroundings  and in relation 
to the size of a person. Development should have elements which relate well in size to an 
individual human being.  The  starti ng point  for understanding  the most  appropriate  scale  for new 
buildings  on a site is  the size, height  and form of the neighbouring  ones,  as well as the scale  of any 
adjacent public or private spaces.  
 
Mass  refers to the impact of a building ’s volume, shape  and arrangement on the street  scene.  It 
is commonly  referred  to as ‘bulk’.  Good  massing  should  consider  the relationship between the 
proposed development and existing buildings and spaces, as well as the character of the street -
scene. Inappropriate develo pment massing may lead to an a ssortment of problems beyond 
aesthetics,  such as ov erbearing impact.  
 
Proportion  refers  to the magnitude  of each  part of a building,  and of each  part of a building to 
anothe r. New buildings should feature common components, s uch as windows and doors,  as well 
as any other  architectural  details,  which  are in proportion  with one another and with the features 
on neighbouring buildings.  
 
 
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  258 
 Materials and Detailing  
Red brick  for walls  and clay pantiles  or grey slate  are the most  freque nt types  of traditional buildi ng 
material s in many of the Borough ’s settlements , particularly ones within the Wolds.  
 
 
In the Charnwood  Forest,  stone  is a common  traditional  building  material,  howeve r, this is 
harder  to replicate, as  access  to stone for building purposes  is limited. Emphasis should be placed  
on choosin g the type of stone s that strongl y complemen t the traditional  stonework present on many 
historic buildings in the Forest.  
 
Exposing  timber  on elevations  could  enhance  the relationship  between  new development and the 
woodla nd character of Charnwood Forest. Howeve r, care should be given to the use of timber as 
a building material – exposed timber upon dwellings is often low quality and weathers poorl y. The 
Council will encourage new outbuildings to display timber in their ele vations to enhance the forest 
character in Charnwood.  
 
In certain  locations,  the use of contrasting  building materials  can be a beneficial  way of 
enhancing the character of a street and introducing a level of variety.  
 
The choice of material s which do not deteriorat e in their attractivenes s over time is important in 
maintaining the quality of a development throughout its lifetime.  
 
C. Open Spaces and Streets  
 
Public Open Space  
Public  open  space  that is attractive,  inviting  and safe to use can enable  opportunit ies for socia l 
interactio n and help facilitat e more  active lifestyles , both of which are key contributors towards 
building a strong sense of place.  In light of the Covid -19 pandemic, ensuring access to public 
open space has b een shown to be of critical im portance for maintaining health and well -being.  
 
Successful public open spaces can be achieved by:  
• integrating them as part of route hierarchy so that they are easy to find and support  more  
sustainable  movement  patterns  across  the development,  accommodatin g pedestrian  and 
cycling  routes  as well as serving  as spaces for people to  participate in activities;  
• clearly identifying them  as part of the street  scene,  for example by featuring  strong  
landmark features  or characteristic  styling (for example, differen t pavin g patterns ); 
• ensuring they are well  defined  spaces  in their own right considering matters such as scale 
and proportion;  
• including an appropriate level of greener y, which can help make them more relaxing and 
tranquil envir onments, as well as help towar ds biodiversity  gain on new developments.  
• making them easily adaptable to accommodate the variety of activity that is likely to take 
place within them.  
 
For new publi c space s it is importan t that long term maintenanc e strategi es are considered at an 
early stage in the design process, and this should involve discussions with key stakeholders such 
Leicestershire County Council as the Local Highway Authorit y. 
 
 
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  259 
 Private Amenity Space  
It is important that residential schemes provide an adequate  level of private  amenity  space  so that 
future  residents  can maintain  more  active lifestyles.  
 
Any private  amenity  space  provided  on new development  should  provide  an identifiable 
demarcation from neighbouring  public  space,  without compromising  the aesthetic  quality of new 
development.  
 
Communal  Open Space  
Communal  open  space  provides  groups  of residents  a form of amenity  space  in lieu of private 
space on individual plots.  Communal  open  space  should  be provided  with some  sense  of 
enclosure  in the interests  of maintaining  privacy and securit y, whilst being reasonably overlooked 
by the surrounding residences that it caters to.  
 
Opportunitie s to provide  direc t acces s from groun d floor dwelling s or apartment s fronting onto 
communal amenity space shou ld be balanced with the need t o preserve the private amenity value 
of those dwellings through clearly defined boundaries.  
 
Streets  
Streets  should  be viewed  as places  in their own right and not merely  designed  to meet highways  
standards;  developers  should  pursue  opportunities  to make  them attractive  and multi- functional, 
which may mean performing roles that are often associated with well -designed public space.  
 
In approaching  the design  of new streets,  developers  should  consider  the needs of the most  
vulnera ble road users  first – pedestr ians, then  cyclists,  then public  transport users. Restricting 
some streets to pedestrians and cyclists only can increase the amount  of connections within a 
development, in turn creating better connectivity across the whole com munity and help encourage 
peop le to pursue healthier lifestyles.  
 
When designing residential development, developers should ensure that it provides a network of 
interconnected streets as this will improve the sustainability of the development by allowing 
residents and visitors quicker and more varied routes to facilities or public transportation nodes. 
Streets that are closed off from neighbouring ones or an over -reliance on ‘cul -de-sacs’ should be 
avoided as they do not make the best use of land. However, there is value in implementing  cul-
de-sacs in residential development to provide safer environments, reduce traffic flows and create 
quieter street environments.  Linking cul -de-sacs to other streets via safe and attractive walking 
and cycling connections i s a recommended approach.  
 
Street furniture 
The provision  of street  furniture such as benches, signage and lighting  can accentuate  the role 
of streets  as public space, increasing  their functionality  as places facilitating  social  interaction  as 
well as providing  a sense of character to streets.  
 
Street  furniture  should  be provided  proportionate  to the width  of the street,  so as not to 
unnecessarily clutter the street -scene and potentially detract from the character of the area. Street 
furniture should be located where it would not cause danger to people with disabilities for example 
people with visual impairments. It should also be alig ned in a linear manne r, to minimise 
obstruction to tra ffic flows.  
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  260 
 Lighting  is a particularly  important  type of street  furniture  and a good  lighting  scheme  can 
encourage  the use of streets  throughout the  evening  and at night -time. Lighting  which illuminate s 
building s can be a usefu l mean s of highlightin g a certai n building ’s statu s within the street  scene, 
providing visual i nterest  and legibility  at nigh t. Lighting  placed in paving can also aid with wayfindin g 
and increas e the visua l interes t of streets , space and pathways.  
 
Well-designed  street  furniture  should  be a principal  consideration  when  designing  the stree t 
itself, to ensur e that the type of furniture is in keepin g with the characte r of the street. Detail s of stree t 
furniture  shoul d be include d as part of a plannin g application , ideall y within a design and access 
statement  or similar accompanying document.  
 
Highway  Safety and Traffic Calming  
The following  key principles  should  be considered  when  designing streets serving new 
development:  
• The majority  of new residential  streets  should  be designed  so that vehicular  traffic is 
encouraged to go slowly and carefully (i.e. a t speeds of 20mph or less).  
• Designing streets to even lower speeds (10mph or less) may  also allow  for opportunities  
to provide shared surfaces, accommodating all road users without the need to install 
kerbs. It may be more appropriate to provide these type s of streets on residential 
schemes with higher densities, or schemes with a more enclo sed street network.  
• Design  concepts  that encourage  lower  traffic speeds, for example through building height 
to street width ratios, the presence of street trees and the  placement of buildings at cor ners, 
should be considered. 
• Traffic calmin g measure s includin g spee d humps  and raise d surfacin g should only be relied 
on as additional measures to control tra ffic – they tend to be inappropriate for buses and 
may prove hazardo us to cyclists.  
 
Walking and C ycling Routes  
When  providing  attractive  and safe walking  and cycling  routes  on proposals,  developments 
should:  
• prioritise connections to important community buildings such as schools, leisure centre s 
and shop s and ensur e that they are more direc t than roads, to help encourage modal shift 
from cars and introduce signage where appropriate;  
• accommodate buildings with active frontages along pedestrian and cycle priority routes, 
to provide adequate natural surveillance and encourage  vitalit y; 
• avoid providing rou tes that pass to the rear of buildings, as these may not be able to 
provide adequate natural surveillance and can become underutilised as a result;  
• ensure that pedestrian and cycle routes are mostly straight and continuous and  do not 
curve in ways which ma y hide people from vi ew; 
• ensure that pedestrian and cycle routes are well lit, via the provision of street lamps or 
feature lighting that is built into the public realm;  
• give attentio n to the amoun t of landscapin g that align s pathways,  particularly hedges, 
which when fully grown can provide hiding spots for criminals.  
• Ensure routes are well signed to help with wayfinding.  
 
 
 
 
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  261 
 Crime Prevention  
Design considerations such as movement patterns, the physical form of buildings and t he amount 
of activity that is generated within a development can also reduce the risk of criminal activity within 
a development through the amount of natural surveillance that results from them.  
 
Natural surveillance provides effective security measures wi thout resorting to other surve illance 
features such as CCTV.  Natural surveillance can be increased through the placement and layout 
of new buildings and open amenity space, and enabling buildings to overlook the public realm 
and open space through the pla cement of windows and building  entrances.  The level of 
surveillance of a space has a direct impact upon how people perceive the space in terms of safety 
and security.  
 
Entrances to buildings should open upon streets or spaces; if an entrance is hidden fro m public 
view, it could be per ceived as unsafe.  
 
Inclusivity  
Good urban design can significantly contribute to  environments  that address  the needs of 
vulnerable  groups,  such  as elderly people,  people with disabilities  and children.  Examples of 
features  that can make public spaces more  inclusive include:  
• minimising reflective or shiny surfaces and utilising contrasting colour schemes to 
highlight important safety features  to accommodate the needs of visually impaired 
people;  
• Including ramp s and avoiding  excessiv e level change s to cater for wheelchai r users and 
people with prams and pushchairs;  
• providing quiet or tranquil spaces or areas (an example being sensory gardens ), 
particularl y on developments  which are designe d to accommodate elderly people.  
 
Childre n’s Play Areas  
When  they are required  on new development,  children ’s and young  people ’s play space should  
be located  in parts  of the development  where  natural  and passive  surveillance  can be maximised, 
for instance surrounded by homes fronting onto the pla y space. There should,  howeve r, be an 
appropriate separation between  any neighbouring  dwellings  and the play space in the interests of 
reducing any noise and disturbance. Any streets surrounding  the play space  should  be traffic-
calmed  and routes  to and from the space should be as safe as possible and overlooked by 
properties.

 Part 2: Illustrated Guidance  
 
A. House Extensions  
 
The spaces  between  and around  buildings  can be important.  Extensions  which  fill the gaps 
between houses can change the whole charact er of the area.  
 
One example  is where  an extension  to a semi -detached house  creates  a “terracing  effect”. 
Setting back  an extension  from the front line of the house  and/or  using  a different  roof form can  
be ways  to overcome  this e ffect. House  extensions ca n affect the appearance and ch aracter of 
both the property being extended and the surrounding area.  
 
 
Some  streets  have  a well-defined  building  line and this can be important  to the character and  
appearance  of the area.  A new building  which  does  not follow this line can break  up the  street  
scene  and change  the fundamental  character of an area.  For example,  building a garage in front 
of the main wall of the house is likely to look out of place where there is a  line of houses  and where  
garages  are generally  sited  in rear gardens.  What  is important is that any new buildings should 
relate to the form and appearance of existing buildings.  
 
 
 
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  263 
 It is important  that any extension  respects  the basic  shape,  proportions  and size of the existing 
propert y. The shape, pi tch and style of roof will be of particular importance.  
 
 
 
 
Extensions  should  be designed  so that the main  property  is still the dominant  building.  The 
roof and eave lines shoul d be lower than the existin g house . Settin g back the extension behind  the 
front wall of the existing  house  can often  help to achieve  a satisfactory  design.  
 
The size, style and proportion  of new doors  and windows  are important  consideration  in the 
desig n of new extensions . If too many  openings are included,  the balanc e of the building may be 
upset,  as there  may be too much  window  area compared  to brick  work.  Windows with  different  
proportions  and patterns  of panes on the same  wall create  an unsettling  and unbalanced 
appearance.  
 
 
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  264 
  
 
 
 
 
Windows  in the roof can be one useful  way of opening  up extra  floor space.  Unless  there are  
existing dormers  in the area, new  dormers  are likely  to be out of character with its surroundings.  
Rooflights provide  an alternative. If dormers  are used,  they should  be as small as possible.  They 
should mat ch the window style and roof p itch of the existing propert y. Dormers  should  be kept as 
low as possible.  Dormers  which  are higher  than the ridge  line are likely  to be unacceptable  
particularly  in prominent  or sensitive  locations.  In general  dormers  or rooflights  should  be kept to 
those  areas  which  are most  difficult to see.

 B. Amenity  
 
Good  design  of homes ensures  the relationship  between  neighbouring  buildings  and land uses  
is compatible  and harmonious  and does  not cause  unacceptable  harm  to, or loss of, the amenity 
enjoyed by tho se who live there.  
 
Protecting  Occupier  Privacy  
Protecting  the privacy  of the occupants  of dwellings  is an important  element  of the quality of 
residential environments. Proposed development should seek to provide reasonable s pace  
between  buildings  in order to minimise  overlooking.  As a general  rule, transparent window s shoul d 
not be place d on elevation s facin g window s servin g main habitabl e rooms of dwellings, such as 
kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms where this would give r ise to overlooking of either p ropert y. 
The use  of obscure  glass  or rooflight windows can  offset the loss  of privacy  however these types 
of windows may  not be  acceptable choices to serve  main  habitable  rooms  if they create  poor 
standards  of amenity  for future occupiers. Obscured or  roof mounted windows  will usually  be 
acceptable serving  ancillary  rooms  in a home, such as hallways and bathrooms.  
 
For dormer  windows,  restricting  the size of the window and setting  back  from the eaves can be 
a possible solution to protect neighbouring privac y. 
 
Overshadowing  and Loss of Light  
Access to sunlight ( light directly  from the sun) and daylight (other diffuse or reflected  light) is 
beneficial for reducing the need  for artificial lighting consumption  and providing  more  natural 
forms  of heating. New  development which significantly  reduces the level of sunlight  or daylight  
enjoyed  by neighbouring  buildings  is likely to result in a loss of amenity to the occupiers of 
neighbouring buildings.  
 
For houses,  the 45°degree guide line is a helpful  measure  for considering  whether development 
(particularly extensions) would  cause  a loss of daylight to  a windo w.  It is not  valid for windows  
which  directly  face the extension.  For these cases, the 25°degree guideline below should be used.  
 
The figure below  shows  the application  of the 45°-degree  guideline  and is explained  as follows:  
Take the elevation of the window wall and draw diagonally down at an angle of 45° away from the  
near top corner  of the extension. If  the extension  has a pitche d roof, then the top of the  extension  
can be taken  as the height  of its roof halfway  along  its slope.  Then  take the plan and draw 
diagonally back at an angle of 45° towards the window wall from the extension.  
 
A significant  amount  of light is likely  to be blocked  if the centre  of the window  lies within 45° 
angle of the elevation. For patio doors the vertical midpoint of the window is  usually taken to be 
a point 1.6m above ground level.  Here the centre of the window lies outside the 45° angle on 
the elevati on, so the impact of the exten sion is likely to be small.  
 
 Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  267 
  
 
 
 
Where  a proposed  building  is close  to a facing  habitable  room  window  (less  than 3 times the 
heigh t of the propose d buildin g abov e the centr e of the existin g window) , the 25°degree  guideline  
should be used to establish if a material loss of daylight is possible.  
 
A material  loss of sunlight  can occur  when  part of the proposed  development  is within  90 degrees  
of a south  facing  window  on an adjacent  property  and where  the height  exceeds the 25°de gree 
angle as indicated below:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  268 
 The figure below illustrates  the circumstances  where  there  is a possible  material  impact upon  
sun lighting.  In analysing  the sunlight impact  on the existing  window  no check  will need to be 
made for proposed extension  A and new building C, as they  lie within 90°degree of due north of 
the windo w. 
 
Proposed  extension  B should  be checked,  as should  new building  D, if the building  is above 
the 25° line described above.  
 
Main living room s and conservatorie s may be particula rly sensitiv e to a significan t reduction in 
sunlight,  but each  case  should  be looked  at carefully  as existing  obstructions and  the presence 
of other windows are all important considerations in reaching an overall conclusion.  
 
 
 
 
 
Further  guidance  on plann ing for daylight  and sunlight  can be found  from the Building Research 
Establishment1 and the Council will use this guidance in assessing potential loss of sunligh t and 
dayligh t particularl y in case s wher e the loss of either  sunlight  or daylight is marginal . 
 
Separation  Distances Betwee n Dwellings  
When considering  the layou t of dwelling s on a site, developer s shoul d conside r the distance tha t 
separate s rear elevations of individual  dwelling s in the interes t of protectin g the privacy and avoiding 
overbearing impact for both existing and f uture residents.  
 
The guidance  measurements  for separation  distances  are provided  below. It is important to note 
that these do not serve as strict requirements . The distance s will be applie d having regard  to the 
 
1 Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight A Guide to Good Practice Second 
Edition 201 1 
 
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  269 
 wider  design  issues  and site context but  will generally  be more  important considerations when 
developing sites that are close to existing buildings.  
 
Wher e rear buildin g elevation s containing  main habitabl e room windows , the followin g distances 
provide a guide to protec t the loss of privacy: 
• 21 metres for 2 storey dwellings;  
• 27.5m for 3 storey dwellings and above; and  
• 27.5m where main habitable room windows above ground floor level w ould overlook 
existing conventional dwellings.  
 
The separation  distance  should  be increas ed by 1m for every  0.4m  difference  in floor levels 
between dwellings.  Single  storey  back  to back  development  is not so critical  in terms  of 
overlooking  although dif ferences in ground levels should be considered.  
 
Wher e elevations containing  main ground  floor habitabl e room window s would face windowless 
flank walls, the following distances provide a guide to avoid over dominance:  
• 9.5m minimum distance between the two elevations where a flank wall is single storey;  
• 12.5m for 2 storey flank walls; and  
• 15.5m for 3 storey flank walls.  
 
Single storey flank walls can be sited closer where a hipped roof form is proposed.  Where  there  
is a difference  in ground  levels  the separation  distance  should  be adjusted  by 
1m for every 1m level variation.  
 
Waste and bin  storage  
Bin storage areas should  be seen as an important design consideration in developments. Both 
storage and  collection points for bins  need  to be  considered as  part of  the overall  design  in order  
to reduce  amenity issues  relating  to residents’ access  to bins and the proble m of ‘bin blight’ which 
can diminis h qualit y of space s within  the development. Developmen ts shoul d demonstrat e three key 
need s – to provide convenience  for both residents  and waste  collectors,  to be safe to use and 
avoid  being  a detra cting feature of the character of  the area and the development’s architectural 
quality.  
 
Ideall y, the storage  of domesti c waste in wheeli e bins is best located  to the rear of dwellings and away 
from the main frontage. Howeve r, this may not always be feasib le or practical so  in these  
circu mstances,  waste  storage  areas  should  effectively  mask  or screen  wheelie bins from building 
frontages, ideally within purpose -built structures embedded into the design of the development.  
 
Car Parking  
 
Poorly thought  out car parkin g can be detrimenta l to the stree t scene , make place s function less 
well. Car parking in the wrong place can  cause  obstructions  to pedestrian  and cycle  movements 
and larger vehicles which may need to access the development, including emergency vehic les 
and waste collectors.  
 
When  designing  the layout  of developments,  developers  should  use Leicestershire County 
Council’ s Highways Design Guide which provides guidance on car parking in relation to the scale Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  270 
 of proposals and the type of development2. As such, accommodating  parking  shoul d be a 
fundamenta l design consideration at the start of designing schemes.  
 
Many  residential  developments  can accommodate  a degree  of parking  provision  on the street,  
but this needs  to be limited  to prevent  parked  vehicles  dominating  the street  scene. Gene rally, a 
mix of on street and  a variety  of off-street provision  can often be  the best approach to successfully 
managing parking, particularly on larger schemes.  
 
On street parking  
Parking  provision  on streets  should  ensure  that traffic  is able to pass  parked cars with  adequate  
room.  For this reason,  on street  parking  which  is not accommodated in parking  bays should  only 
be provided  on one side of the street.  
 
On street parking  bays  
Paralle l parking  can be visuall y intrusiv e upon  the street- scene but with the use of recessed parkin g 
bays incorporatin g appropriat e landscapin g and stree t trees , the impac t of vehicles on the character 
of building frontages can be softened.  
 
 
 
Parking  squares  
Parkin g square s can remov e parke d vehicles off street s and away from dwellin g frontages, reducing  
the visual  impact of  parked  cars. Howeve r, they still need  to be in convenient locations.  
Landscaping in  the form of street trees or  planting beds can  help break up monotony  caused  by 
expanses  of tarmac  or paving.  Different sty les of paving  patterns and  materials  can also help 
provide  a degree  of variation  in the street -scene character when  providing  parking  squares,  as 
well as help to easily  distinguish  them  from other  street functions. 
 
 
2 For general parking standards, regarding  the number of spaces required for different types of residential 
development, plea se refer to the Leicestershire Hi ghways Design Guide – Section DG14: Vehicle parking and 
making provision for service vehicles.  Thes e are the adopted parking standards which apply to new development 
in the Borough.  
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  271 
 Off str eet parking  
Parking  provision  located off the street  should  generally  be maximised  wherever  possible.  
There are several key methods for accommodating off street parking provision..  
 
Facing  dwellings:  This approach  to parking  provision  is more  likely  to be used  by residents  
to park their c ars because  they will be visible  from within  their homes.  The provision  of spaces  in 
front of  new dwellings  should  be balanced  by appropriate  quantities  of landscaping  so that the 
frontages  are not dominated  by large  expans es of tarmac  or paving.  To help measure  this, 
developers may want to consider applying a 50/50 approach for larger dwellings in balancing 
parking spaces with landscaping:  
 
 
 
 
Tandem  parking  spaces  serving  two neighbouring  properties  should  ideally  be sepa rated by 
landscaping strips at le ast a metre in width. These landscaping strips can increase permeability 
and reduce large expanses of hard surfacing. Any landscaping strip should serve a clear purpose 
such as provide planting or serve as part of a SuD s scheme. 
 
 
Appendix 4 – Design Guidance  
Charnwood Local Plan 2021 -37  Pre-Submission Draft July 2021  272 
 Parking  courtyards  can effectively remove  vehicles  from obstructing  the street  however they  
need  to be afforded  adequate  levels  of surveillance  in order  for them  to be perceived as  safe and 
therefore more  likely  to be used  by residents. Simply  adding parking  areas behind houses w ithout 
consideration of whether they will be well overlooked should be avoided.  
 
When providin g rear parking  courtyard s on residentia l schemes , developer s shoul d carefully consider  
the layout  of the dwellings  that surrounds  them  and make  sure dwellings  are able to provide both 
natural surveillance upon the courtyard and positively contribute to its characte r. 
 
Although  located  away  from the street  itself,  rear parking  courts  can still be afforded 
characterful street features  such  as landscaping, trees  and appropriate street furniture. Parking 
courts should be a fforded similar design considerations to public realm, so that they can be 
attractive  spaces in their own right.  
 
Garages:  The placement  of detached  garages  should  positively  respond  to the wider  layou t 
of adjacent  buildings  and the neighbouring  street  scene  – in particula r, detached  garages 
serving dwellings should not extend beyond the building line.  
 
Integral  garages  can be a better  use of space  than detached  ones  but should  be designed 
appropriately  so that they do not serve to overly dominate the host dwelling or wider street -scene. 
Integral garages should not take up more than a quarter of the principal or front elevation of a 
dwelling. For this reason, integral gar ages would generally not be accep table for single storey 
dwellings unless a sensitive design solution can be demonstrated.  
 
 
 
 
Additional  principles  for well -designed  parking  
• Where  there are a number  of parking  spaces,  covered  parking  spaces  can contribut e to 
the continuit y of built form and improv e the desig n qualit y within parkin g courtyards.  
• The use of permeable  paving  for parking  spaces  that would  not create  excess  surface 
runoff shoul d be explored , particularl y in areas which suffer from surfac e water flooding.  
• Electric car chargin g points should be discreetly installed and should avoid being placed 
on principal elevations. If they are installed in parking areas or to the front of properties,  
consideration  should  be given  to their appearance so that they do not appear incongruous 
with the character of the surrounding area.  
• The storage of bicycles on schemes should not be ignored, especially where car 
ownership/use is likely to be lo wer. Access to cycle parking facilities should be 
convenient, secure a nd adequately provide for visitor s. Scope for designated space 
within the home to store bicycles should also be explored.

settlements  are Anste y, Barrow  upon Soa r, Mountsorrel, Quorn, Rothley and Sileb y. 
Sequential Test: There  are two areas  in which  a specific logical  sequence  is applied  to taking 
planning decisions.  For town centres the Sequential Test guides main town ce ntre uses towards 
town centr e locations first, then, if no town centr e location s are available,  to edge of centr e locations, 
and, if neithe r town centr e location s nor edge of centr e location s are available , to out of town centre 
locations,  with preference  for accessible  sites which  are well connected  to the town  centre.  When 
dealing  with flooding risk , the Sequential Test is used  to steer  new development  to areas  with 
the lowest probability of flooding. The aim is to steer new development to Flood Zone 1 (a reas 
with a low probability  of flooding).  Where  there  are no reasonably  available  sites in Flood  Zone  1, 
available sites in  Flood Zone 2  (areas with a  medium probability of flooding) can  be considered. 
Only where  there are  no reasonably available sites in  Flood Zones 1  or 2 would sites in  Flood 
Zone 3 (areas with a high probability of flooding) be considered.  Glossary
