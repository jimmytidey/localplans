Foreword 
 
 
To meet the needs of Allerdale ’s communities we 
need a plan that provides for new jobs to diversify and grow our economy and new homes for our 
existing and future population whilst balancing the 
need to protect the natural and built environment.  
 This document, which covers the area outside the 
National Park, forms the first part of the Allerdale 
Local Plan and contains the Core Strategy and 
Development Management policies. It sets a clear 
vision, for the next 15 years, for how new 
development can address the challenges we face. 
The Core Strategy will guide other documents in 
the Allerdale Local Plan, in particular the site 
allocations which will form the second part of the 
plan. 
 
This document is the culmination of a great deal of public consultation over 
recent years, and extensive evidence gathering by the Council.  The policies in 
the Plan will shape Allerdale in the future, helping to deliver sustainable economic development, jobs and much needed affordable housing for our 
communities.

Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
1What is the Allerdale Local Plan? 
 
1. The Allerdale Local Plan contains the Council ’s planning policies for 
the use and development of land up to 2029. The Plan covers the parts of Allerdale that are outside the Lake District National Park, as shown 
on the Key Diagram (Appendix 2).  
 2. The Local Plan determines how the planning system will help to shape 
your community, as part of the National Planning Policy Framework. The Plan contains the Council's main collection of planning policy 
documents outlining the growth and spatial strategy for the local area 
and planning policies for managing development proposals through 
the planning application process. 
 3. Together these policies guide and deliver the aspirations of not only 
Allerdale Borough Council but also other key service providers and stakeholders, whose input will be essential to the successful 
implementation of the Strategy 
 
 
Figure 1 Local Plan Structure  
 
4. There are a number of different types of documents within the Local 
Plan including: 
 
 
 
Introduction 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
2Development Plan Documents (DPDs)  
5. These are statutory documents that provide the basis for all planning, 
development and conservation decisions in Allerdale. The principal 
component is the Local Plan which consists of both Strategic and 
Development Management Policies (Part 1).  Over the next few years a 
Site Allocations Document will provide an important second part of the Local Plan, while other DPDs may, if required, include Neighbourhood 
Plans and Area Action Plans. 
6. Site Allocations DPD will be the second part of the Local Plan. It 
allocates sites for a range of different uses such as housing, 
employment, open space and nature conservation having regard to the 
settlement hierarchy, the future role and function of each settlement/tier 
and the level of housing and employment growth identified in the 
Strategic Policies of the Local Plan. Furthermore, the process reviews 
the development boundaries of the towns and villages within the 
settlement hierarchy.   
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)  
7. These provide detailed guidance on various planning matters, including 
the interpretation of evidence base, and further explanation of the 
policies in the Development Plan Documents. SPDs can include design 
guides, area development briefs and masterplans; however, they must 
be justified and may only be used to help ensure delivery and 
successful implementation of policy.   
Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs)  
 
8. Allerdale publishes an annual report on the wider social, economic and 
environmental position of the Borough, and monitors the effectiveness 
of plan policies. 
 
Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) 
 
9. This is the Council ’s statement on how the local community and others 
will be involved in the preparation of the Local Plan and the consideration of planning applications.  
 
Evidence Base 
 
10. The Local Plan is supported by a number of evidence base documents 
that have both informed the preparation of policies, and will be used to help implement policies over the plan period. These documents 
accompany the Plan and as appropriate will be kept up-to-date over 
the plan period.  
 Introduction 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
311. Evidence has been collected in all the key areas of policy and studies 
carried out covering; housing, employment, retail, climate change and 
energy, transport, environment, communities and infrastructure.  
Allerdale ’s evidence base documents are listed in the tables after each 
of the relevant policies and can be found online at www.allerdale.gov.uk/localplan.  
 
Sustainability Appraisal 
 
12. A sustainability appraisal (SA) identifies and evaluates the impact of a 
plan on the economy, community and environment. It is produced 
alongside a new plan and suggests ways to avoid or reduce any 
adverse impacts arising from the plan as well as maximising positive 
impacts. Undertaking a sustainability appraisal of the Allerdale Local 
Plan is a statutory requirement of the Planning and Compulsory 
Purchase Act 2004. 
13. To be effective, the sustainability appraisal must be an integral part of 
the plan making process and inform the development of alternative 
options.  At the start of the plan preparation a sustainability appraisal 
scoping report was prepared which provided a baseline report covering 
the Plan Area and identified the sustainability issues, which the 
development plan seeks to address.  Consultation on the scoping 
report and development of the appraisal has been carried out with the 
statutory consultees as specified in the Strategic Environmental 
Assessment Directive and other appropriate stakeholders.  
Habitats Regulation Assessment 
 
14. Under Regulation 48 of the Habitats Regulations 1994 an Appropriate 
Assessment (AA) is required when a plan would be likely to have a significant effect on a European wildlife site. The scope of the AA will 
depend on the location, size and significance of the proposed plan. 
Scoping on the need for an AA was undertaken at the same time as 
the SA scoping report and was published for comment at the same 
time. As an AA is considered necessary it is published alongside the 
full sustainability appraisal for the Allerdale Local Plan. Natural England 
is the only statutory consultee with respect to Appropriate Assessment; 
however, the Council has engaged with other organisations that could 
have an interest in the scope and AA process. 
 15. It should be noted that an Appropriate Assessment is a self-contained 
step in a wider decision making process required by the Habitats Regulations.  The conclusion of the Assessment has enabled the 
Council to understand whether a proposal or plan would adversely affect the integrity of protected wildlife and habitats, and therefore, 
develop appropriate policy and strategy.  Introduction 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
4How to use the Plan 
 
16. To ensure a comprehensive approach to sustainable development it is 
important that the Local Plan is read and used as whole.  However, to 
aid understanding it is split up into policy sections. The first section sets 
the level of growth, spatial strategy, and other key development 
principles.  These are followed by area-based policies that set a clear 
focus for each of the Locality areas highlighting key issues and helping 
the implementation of the plan.  
 17. The remaining strategic policies are thematic and relate to the overall 
development strategy as follows: 
· Housing; 
· Economy; · Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure; · Built and Historic Environment; · Natural Environment. 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Local Plan Content  
 18. Each policy within the Local Plan is accompanied by explanatory text to 
aid understanding and implementation of the policy approach. In addition policies are linked directly to; national policy, local evidence, 
strategic objectives and other plans and strategies. Some cross-
referencing to other policies in the Development Plan is also provided, 
but it should be noted that all policies within the Plan are mutually 
dependent and should be read together as a whole. 
 
Introduction 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
5Neighbourhood Planning 
 
19. The Localism Act, 2011, introduced new rights and powers to allow 
local communities to shape new development by preparing Neighbourhood Plans. 
 20. The Local Plan provides the framework within which appropriate 
community-led planning policy documents can be brought forward, helping local communities to plan and shape decisions on future 
development in their areas. Neighbourhood plans must be in 
conformity with the strategic policies of the development plan (S1 - 
S37), but communities can develop new policies and proposals, and 
adapt development management policies and the forthcoming 
allocations in order to address local issues.  
 21. Allerdale Borough Council is committed to supporting local 
communities in neighbourhood planning, and in helping them to explore the right solution for their area. Once adopted Neighbourhood 
Plans form part of the Development Plan and can help ensure that 
planning decisions reflect the aspirations and needs of local 
communities. Neighbourhood Planning is optional, and as such the 
Council will produce a complete development plan to reflect the whole 
of the plan area. 
 
Cross Boundary Working 
 
22. Allerdale Borough Council has prepared the Local Plan by working 
together with neighbouring local planning authorities and partners to 
ensure effective strategic planning and coordination of issues that have 
implications across administrative boundaries.  
 23. Allerdale now has a duty to cooperate in the preparation of 
development plan documents outlined in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Localism Act 2011. The Act requires the 
Council to engage ‘constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis’ , 
while, national planning policy expects local authorities to plan cooperatively on strategic issues and provide evidence of successful 
strategic cross boundary cooperation for examination as part of the 
‘Test of Soundness’  at Examination.  
 24. Although much of the plan preparation process preceded the Localism 
Act and NPPF, the Council has a strong history of collaboration in strategic planning, with adjoining districts, at county and regional level 
through both Structure Plans and Regional Spatial Strategy.  
 25. A topic paper detailing how we have met our ‘duty to cooperate ’ has 
been produced and accompanies the Plan.  
 Introduction 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
6What else is it delivering? 
 
26. The Local Plan will bring together and integrate many policies and programmes that have an influence across the Borough. There are a 
large number of plans and strategies that will be central to the Local 
Plan and will help to shape the policy direction in the various 
documents.  
 27. The Local Plan and especially the Strategic Policies consider the key 
planning issues facing the Borough and in so doing will help deliver the 
wider vision and priorities set out in Future Generation: A Strategy for 
Sustainable Communities in West Cumbria. Together with the Cumbria 
Sub-regional Spatial Strategy, the Allerdale Local Plan as a spatial planning framework can help provide the key spatial expression of the 
Sustainable Community Strategy, delivering its social, economic and 
environmental priorities and outcomes.  
 28. A key role of the Plan is also to develop a clear and effective 
relationship between the policies and proposals of the plan and other Council documents such as the Council Plan, Housing Strategy and 
locality plans; in addition to the County level Local Transport Plans and 
other key strategies such as those on health, communities and 
education.  The Local Plan will directly deliver, or help to deliver, the 
objectives of these and other strategies as they relate to Allerdale. 
 29. Furthermore, it  will assist the delivery of other strategies and policies 
such as Britain ’s Energy Coast: A Masterplan for West Cumbria and 
the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint.  
  Allerdale: A Spatial Portrait 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
7Allerdale: A Spatial Portrait 
 
30. Allerdale is located in Cumbria in the northwest of England and is 
bordered to the west by the Solway Firth and Irish Sea, and to the 
north across the Solway, Scotland. Within Cumbria, Allerdale ’s 
neighbours include Carlisle City Council and Eden District Council to the east and to the south Copeland and South Lakeland District 
Councils. The southeast quarter of the Borough is covered by the Lake 
District National Park.  
 31. Allerdale Local Plan Area excludes the National Park and covers an 
area of 763km². 
 
 
 Figure 3 Population – Main Settlements 
1 
 
Population 
 
32. Including the National Park, Allerdale ’s usual resident population at 
census day 2011 was 96,400; an increase of 2,913 people (+3.1%) since 2001. The Borough is predominately rural in nature with an 
overall population density of 78 people per square kilometre making it

Allerdale: A Spatial Portrait 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
8in 2011 the 19th least densely populated local authority in England and 
Wales.  This is most noticeable in the north where settlements are 
small and dispersed while the main urban centres are located in the 
south, where the majority of the population resides.   
 
33. Allerdale, like Cumbria, has an older population profile than England 
and Wales and the population is ‘ageing ’ at a faster rate than the 
population nationally. Comparing the district ’s age profile in 2001 and 
2011, demonstrates that the numbers of residents in the 0-14 and 30-44 age groups have decreased over the last decade, while numbers of 
residents in the 15-29, 45-59, 60-74, 75-84 and 85+ age groups have 
increased.  
 
Figure 4 Resident Population by Broad Age Group 2001 & 2011 
 34. The issue of an ageing population is not uniform across the Borough 
with the rural north and areas around Silloth, and Cockermouth tending to have a greater number and proportion of elderly people (2011 
Census, Office for National Statistics). 
 
Housing 
 
35. There are approximately 45,500 houses within Allerdale. The vast 
majority are owner occupied (69%). Around 19% of homes are rented 
from a housing association or social landlord, which is significantly 
more than the national average. The privately rented sector accounts 
for just 10% of dwellings (2011 Census, Office for National Statistics). 
 36. The average house price in Allerdale is £157,000 (Streetvalue 2012); 
however, it varies considerably between parishes from a low of £97,000 in Maryport to an average of over £303,000 in Bridekirk. 
Furthermore, the Allerdale Strategic Housing Market Assessments 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000

Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
9(2011) demonstrate that despite the variation in house prices and 
incomes across the area, affordability is a severe problem throughout 
the Plan Area.  
 37. Within the Plan Area access to affordable housing is a key issue in 
Cockermouth, the surrounding villages and also within the rural settlements in northern Allerdale. Whilst higher concentrations of 
affordable homes are present within the main urban centres of 
Workington and Maryport, there is an imbalance between existing 
provision of social housing type and the needs of the population. The 
need for housing renewal and improvement is also an issue in many of 
Allerdale ’s settlements with areas suffering from low demand, empty 
properties and declining condition.  
 
38. A joint  study by Cumbria Council and districts into the needs of Gypsy 
and Travellers across the county reported that Allerdale had the highest level of unauthorised sites within Cumbria. The study identified 
24 authorised pitches within the Borough at that time, with an 
anticipated need for 39 additional pitches by 2016 (Cumbria Gypsy and 
Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment 2008). 
 39. The Allerdale Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
demonstrates that the availability of suitable housing land across the Borough is not considered to be an issue.  
 
Economy 
 
40. Employment type in Allerdale is largely dominated by manufacturing 
and construction, the public sector and the retail and service sector 
(including hotel, leisure and tourism sectors). In the rural north, 
agriculture is still an important sector for employment and the 
economy.  
 41. The median household income is well below the national average of 
£24,900; however, this varies greatly across the Plan Area. Incomes are highest in Bridekirk where median household income is £38,000 
and are lowest in Maryport at £20,600, where the lower quartile income 
is just below £11,000 (CACI paycheck 2012). In 2012 average weekly 
workplace earnings within Allerdale were also below the national 
average at £397, while resident earnings are above the national 
average at £506. This reflects the number of service sector enterprises 
in the district and the popularity of Allerdale as a place for those in 
professional occupations to live. Those in professional jobs are often 
involved in occupations outside the Borough related to the nuclear 
activities at Sellafield. Of the 9,200 Sellafield workers over 1,400 live in 
Workington (15%), while Cockermouth and Maryport are also important 
locations for workers (Britain ’s Energy Coast – Investment Strategy: 
Nuclear Topic Paper 2011). 
 Allerdale: A Spatial Portrait 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
1042. Allerdale also has a lower proportion of working age population with 
high level qualifications (22% NVQ4 and above) compared to the 
national (33%) average (ONS Annual Population Survey 2011).  
 
Sustainable Community and Infrastructure 
 
43. Allerdale is a Borough of contrasts, some areas, particularly in and 
around Cockermouth are considered to be some of the least deprived 
areas in the country with a high quality of life. This is compared to 
some neighbourhoods in the south of Workington and in Maryport, 
which rank amongst some of the most deprived parts of the country. 
Indeed, parts of Moss Bay in Workington rank within the top 1% most 
deprived neighbourhoods in the UK (Index of Multiple deprivation 
2010).  
 44. Life Expectancy varies considerably across the Allerdale Local Plan 
Area, with 12 years difference between Moss Bay Ward (Workington), where estimated life expectancy is 72 years, and Wampool Ward 
(Rural North), where life expectancy is 84 years (Office for National 
Statistics). 
 
45. The Allerdale Local Plan Area is somewhat remote from national 
transport networks. Connections to its nearest motorway, the M6, are 
either along the A66(T) via Keswick and Penrith or north via Carlisle 
along the A595. Journeys from the main urban centres can often take 
up to an hour just to get access to national transport networks.  
 46. Rail services run along the West Cumbrian Coastal Railway, 
connecting to the West Coast Main Line at Carlisle and Lancaster (via Barrow). Most of the main centres in the Plan Area, with the exception 
of Cockermouth and Silloth, are serviced by the railway. Key service 
centres are also generally well connected by bus; however, services 
within more rural settlements vary. Some villages, particularly the 
larger local centres are well served while others, particularly in the 
north of the area, only see a very limited service. 
 
Built and Historic Environment 
 
 
47. Allerdale ’s historic environment contributes significantly to its 
landscape and townscape character. There are a wide range of historic assets including Hadrian ’s Wall and associated structures ( ‘Frontiers of 
the Roman Empire (Hadrian ’s Wall) World Heritage Site ’), pre-historic 
structures and archaeology, medieval churches, defensive castles, 
mansions and pele towers, 17th and 18th century farmhouses and 
associated agricultural buildings, medieval farming and coastal 
villages, medieval towns with many Georgian frontages and buildings 
as well as Victorian developments.  There are also historic planned 
areas such as the Georgian streets in Maryport and Portland Square, 
Workington and the Victorian resort of Silloth.   Allerdale: A Spatial Portrait 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
11 
48. Allerdale ’s heritage assets include:  
 
• Listed Buildings : Total (1,328) 
•    Grade I (29) 
•    Grade II* (33) 
•    Grade II (1,266) 
• Conservation Areas: 21 
• Ancient Monuments: 80 
• Registered Parks and Gardens:  1 
• World Heritage Sites:  1 
 
49. Allerdale ’s historic environment contributes significantly to the local 
economy through its tourism and leisure industries, both directly as 
visitors come specifically to see assets of historic and cultural heritage 
such as Hadrian ’s Wall, historic houses open to the public and 
museums and, also indirectly, through the attractions of its historic towns and villages as places to stay and visit.   Despite the strong 
contribution of the historic environment to the economy, there are 
areas where the heritage is ‘at risk’  having lost some of its significance 
through inappropriate changes. 
 Natural Environment  
 
50. Allerdale has a rich natural environment, recognised on an 
international, national and regional scale. The far north and the Solway Firth are also internationally designated as Special Conservation Areas 
and Special Protection Areas to be afforded the highest levels of 
protection. There is also an extensive spread of Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest across the Plan Area, which are nationally protected. 
 51. The area provides a range of important habitats for a number of key 
protected species. Coastal areas are recognised as being home to Natterjack Toads and the Small Blue Butterfly. Great Crested Newts, 
Otters and Red Squirrels are also found throughout the Plan Area. The 
area in and around Dean Moor is recognised as a Hen Harrier 
Protection Zone and the marshes of northern Allerdale provide 
important habitat for wild geese and swans (Cumbria County Council 
Biodiversity Data Network). 
 52. Landscape is also a key asset, with parts of Allerdale forming part of 
the Lake District National Park. Within the Plan Area the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers the coastal strip north of 
Maryport and over the border into Carlisle.  
  Vision and Objectives 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
12Vision 
 
By 2029 Allerdale ’s communities will be sustainable, prosperous, safe,  
healthy and vibrant. The economy will be strong, diversified and well connected, with a growing and highly skilled population, with high 
employment, capitalising on skills and opportunities in the nuclear, energy and 
tourism sectors. 
 
It will be a place that has adapted to meet the challenges of climate change, 
has a diverse and extensive network of accessible green infrastructure, 
unspoilt landscape and coastline and areas rich in biodiversity and 
geodiversity. 
 
It will be a place where all sections of society have access to affordable, well 
designed homes that meet a range of needs, close to jobs, services and 
sustainable transport, where historic environments are conserved and 
enhanced and sustainable development, investment and successful 
regeneration has created prosperous towns supported by sustainable rural 
communities. 
 
Workington - will have retained and enhanced its role as West Cumbria ’s 
principal residential, educational, leisure, cultural and commercial centre. 
Taking advantage of its port and rail links it will have been a focus for major 
development delivering a stronger employment base, housing renewal and 
greater choice of housing as well as a vibrant town centre with an expanded 
night time economy.  
 Maryport - will have enhanced its role as a key residential, employment and 
visitor centre, ensuring deprivation has been reduced significantly. The town 
will be a key tourist destination building on its harbour, coastal location, rich 
Roman and Georgian heritage and environmental assets. 
 
Cockermouth  - will have retained its vibrant town centre and high quality 
historic environment. The housing market will be more balanced with greater 
access to affordable housing and wider job opportunities. The town is resilient 
to the risk from flooding through the delivery of appropriate infrastructure.  
 Wigton - will have developed its role as an important housing, commercial, 
employment and educational centre in North Allerdale. In particular the role of 
the town centre and the condition of its historic fabric will have been 
enhanced, meeting the retail and service requirements of its catchment 
population.  
 Silloth  - will have an enhanced tourism sector having capitalised on its close 
proximity to the Solway Coast AONB and its historic environment. The role of 
the Port of Silloth will be maintained and enhanced, while the local community 
will have a more balanced age structure, with greater access to employment 
and services.

Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
18Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
S1 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development 
 
53. The Government published the National Planning Policy Framework in 
March 2012. The NPPF (11-16) sets out the definition of what is meant 
by “presumption in favour of sustainable development ” and states that 
policies in Local Plans should follow the approach as the golden thread running through both plan-making and decision taking. In recognition of 
the presumption the Allerdale Local Plan includes the following policy.  
 
S1 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development 
When considering development proposals the Council will take a positive 
approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development 
contained in the National Planning Policy Framework. It will always work 
proactively with applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals 
can be approved wherever possible, and to secure development that 
improves the economic, social and environmental conditions in the area. 
Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan (and, 
where relevant, with polices in neighbourhood plans) will be approved without 
delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 
Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are 
out of date at the time of making the decision then the Council will grant 
permission unless material considerations indicate otherwise – taking into 
account whether: 
a) Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and 
demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the 
policies in the National Planning Policy Framework taken as a whole; 
or 
b) Specific policies in that Framework indicate that development should 
be restricted. Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
19S2 Sustainable Development Principles 
 
54. The purpose of planning is to help achieve sustainable development. 
Sustainable development is about making sure that people can satisfy their basic needs in the present, while ensuring that future generations 
can also look forward to the same quality of life. There are three 
interconnected pillars of sustainable development: economic, social 
and environmental. These pillars need to be considered together to 
deliver development that is truly sustainable, and the planning system 
has a pivotal role in ensuring solutions. The Local Plan is the key tool 
in achieving this aim and therefore it is important that it provides an 
overarching policy to promote sustainable development in all its forms 
throughout the Plan.  
 55. The principles of what the Council considers to constitute sustainable 
development are set out in Policy S2. 
 
S2 Sustainable Development Principles  
The Local Plan will promote sustainable development as a core principle 
running through the entire plan. All development within the Plan Area, 
regardless of scale or nature, will be assessed against this policy. 
Economic 
The Council will: 
· Promote the economic opportunities from the West Cumbria Economic 
Blueprint including key projects identified in the implementation plan;  
· Allocate land and premises of the right quality, scale and location to meet 
the needs of both new opportunities and the expansion of existing 
businesses; 
· Support the rural economy by encouraging appropriate new economic 
opportunities, expanding business, new methods of working, together with 
traditional industries and farm diversification; 
· Promote Workington ’s role as West Cumbria ’s principal retail and leisure 
destination; 
· Enhance town centre vitality and viability by improving the retail, 
commercial, cultural and leisure offer and quality of the built environment;  
· Support the delivery of high quality tourism attractions and accommodation 
as well as key projects; 
· Support the delivery of school facilities, training programmes and lifelong 
learning through providing opportunities and the provision of up to date 
facilities, in particular, supporting the role of the Energy Coast Campus; 
· Encourage the development of renewable or low carbon energy resources 
in appropriate locations given the potential wider environmental, Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
20community and economic benefits; 
· Improve communications within the area as well as nationally and 
internationally, both in terms of digital connections, transport infrastructure 
and services.  
 
Social 
The Council will: 
· Promote sustainable, well designed, safe and accessible places that 
respect the setting and character of the surrounding area;  
· Promote inclusive, cohesive and empowered communities and encourage 
community involvement in the design, development and management of 
places;  
· Ensure a good standard of amenity for existing and future residents; 
· Provide decent homes that meet the needs of households now and in the 
future; 
· Promote health, well-being and active lifestyle by protecting, maintaining 
and enhancing green infrastructure, sports and recreation facilities; 
· Support the sustainability of communities by supporting a shared provision 
of services, employment opportunities, physical and social infrastructure 
and transport options; 
· Ensure physical and social infrastructure is fit for purpose and support 
improvements to ensure sufficient capacity for planned development;  
· Ensure development (either cumulatively or in isolation) will not harm 
highway safety and does not exceed the capacity of the local transport 
network.  
 
Environmental 
The Council will: 
· Reduce Allerdale ’s carbon footprint and support a low carbon future; 
· Ensure that the impact of new development on climate change is mitigated 
and that a comfortable, resilient and liveable environment is achieved 
across the Plan Area by adapting to the effects of climate change; 
· Promote coastal recreation whilst ensuring the protection of habitats, 
species and landscape; 
· Minimise the impact on natural resources by avoiding pollution, promoting 
waste reduction / recycling and by promoting renewable or low carbon 
energy and avoid sterilisation of mineral resources; 
· Promote high standards of design that make a positive contribution to the 
local area and ensure that, wherever possible, existing natural, historic 
and environmental assets are enhanced and in all circumstances Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
21conserved; 
· Encourage development to incorporate the principles of sustainable 
construction to improve energy efficiency, provide renewable energy, 
reduce water consumption and waste and use sustainably sourced 
materials; 
· Ensure the efficient use of land and infrastructure, encouraging the reuse 
of previously developed land that is not of high environmental value; 
· Ensure that potentially unstable land resulting from historic mining 
operations is identified, assessed and addressed appropriately; 
· Conserve and enhance the diversity and distinctiveness of towns, villages 
and landscapes including the character, appearance and significance of 
Heritage Assets; 
· Protect, maintain, enhance and re-connect the range and vitality of 
habitats and species to allow species to adapt to climate change and 
create a viable ecological network within and out with the Plan Area; 
· Ensure that landscape character and local distinctiveness is protected, 
conserved and wherever possible enhanced; 
· Minimise the risk to people and property as a result of flooding and ensure 
that future development will not undermine existing flood defences or other 
flood alleviation methods; 
· Ensure the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) is explored and 
implemented wherever possible; 
· Protect soils, water sources and water quality, and ensure they are 
resilient to climate change;  
· Support local food production and farming to reduce the area ’s food miles 
by avoiding significant development on the best and most versatile 
agricultural land where possible; 
· Minimise the need to travel, promote mixed use developments and 
increase the opportunities to make journeys by foot, cycle or public 
transport.

22S3 Spatial Strategy and Growth  
 
56. S3 sets the framework for development across the Plan Area, outlining 
the Council ’s approach to the scale, location and distribution of growth. 
It defines the settlement hierarchy, which sets out the role of 
settlements, including the form and scale of development that would be 
expected within the towns and villages and what is acceptable in the 
open countryside.  
 
S3      Spatial Strategy and Growth  
Provision will be made for the delivery of at least 5,471 net additional 
dwellings and at least 54 hectares of employment land over the plan period 
2011 - 2029.  
· Residential development will be phased and managed according to the 
Housing Trajectory in order to meet at least an annual average net 
additional dwelling requirement of 304 dwellings per annum and to 
maintain a rolling five year supply of housing land; 
· The Council will seek to maintain and review a rolling supply of high 
quality employment land. 
 
Due to the long term nature of the Local Plan the annual average growth 
figures could be exceeded if justified by evidence of need, demand, 
infrastructure capacity and fit with spatial strategy. The level of uptake of land 
will be reviewed annually to ensure that the housing trajectory and 
employment allocations are responsive to changes in economic and market 
conditions.   
New development will be located in accordance with the spatial strategy and 
will be concentrated within the towns and villages identified in the settlement 
hierarchy. The scale of development proposed will be expected to be 
commensurate to the size of the settlement and reflect its position in the 
settlement hierarchy.

Figure 5 Settlement Hierarchy  
Proposals outside of defined settlements will be limited to: 
a. Housing essential for rural workers in the operation of a rural based 
enterprise; 
b. Housing following the rural exceptions policy; 
c. An appropriate diversification of an existing agricultural or land 
based activity; 
d. The optimal viable use of a heritage asset or appropriate enabling 
development to secure the future of heritage assets; 
e. A recreation or tourism proposal requiring a countryside location; 
f. Facilities essential to social and community needs; 
g. The replacement of an existing dwelling; 
h. A suitably scaled extension to an existing building; 
i. The conversion or reuse of a suitable existing building; 
j. Other development requiring a countryside location for technical or 
operational reasons. 
 
 
57. Allerdale is a predominantly rural area and all its communities have a 
role in sustainable growth. The level of growth and spatial strategy will ensure that the majority of development will be located in the existing 
urban centres that provide the best range of services, employment 
opportunities and access to public transport. This makes the best use 
of existing infrastructure, reduces the need to travel and ensures the 
ongoing sustainability of these centres.  In order for smaller rural 
settlements to remain sustainable there needs to be opportunities for 
appropriate small-scale development in order to help meet the local 
need for housing and employment outside the main centres. 
 
Role of Settlements  Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
24 
58. Policy S3 sets out the five tiers of the settlement hierarchy:  
a) Principal Service Centre  b) Key Service Centres 
c) Local Service Centres 
d) Rural Villages 
i) Limited Growth Villages ii) Infill/Rounding Off Villages 
 
59. The defined settlements within the hierarchy of the Plan Area serve 
different roles. These roles have been identified though an assessment of their individual characteristics and functional relationships with their 
surrounding area. 
 Principal Centre 
60. Focus for major new development in Allerdale. This top-level of the tier 
will support significant housing growth often delivered in large sites. 
This tier is central to the delivery of other policy aspiration such as 
affordable housing over the plan period. Approximately 35% of the 
housing growth will be directed to the Principal Service Centre. The 
principal centre will have the widest range of services in terms of public 
transport, employment, retail, education and leisure facilities.  
 Key Service Centres 
61. These towns offer a wide range of services and function as service 
centres for a wider rural hinterland. Housing growth will often be large 
scale, dependent on the attributes of the centre; delivery will often be in 
large to medium sites.  In combination the Key Service Centres (KSCs) 
will receive approximately 39% of the housing growth. These 
settlements have the ability to serve day-to-day needs of local and 
surrounding residents and offer a varied range of employment land to 
meet the needs of local and regional businesses.  
 Local Service Centres 
62. This tier consists of larger villages with a more limited range of 
services, but all have a school, shop and public transport. These 
villages would accommodate a smaller scale of housing development 
that will help contribute towards maintaining the vitality of the 
settlement. In combination the Local Service Centres (LSCs) will 
receive up to 20% of the housing growth. In addition a small level of 
employment land may be required to meet local needs for small flexible 
premises and shared facility units such as workhubs.  
 Rural Villages 
63. In the settlements identified as villages, a limited level of development 
will be supported in order to help retain the vitality of these 
communities. This level of the hierarchy is split into two further 
categories; Limited Growth Villages and Infill/Rounding Off Villages; 
 Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
25Limited Growth Villages: New housing and employment will be 
restricted to small-scale development within the designated 
settlement boundary.  
Infill / Rounding Off Villages: Very small scale development may 
be appropriate to respond to local needs and to contribute to the 
vitality of rural communities. For this level of the hierarchy 
settlement limits will be removed and development will be directed 
by criteria in Policy S5 for very small scale rounding off and infill 
plots. These plots are expected to be appropriately sized, unless 
the proposal is to deliver affordable housing in accordance with 
Policy S9 (Rural Exception Sites).  
 64. Rural and Community services will be protected and enhanced, while 
employment opportunities will be small scale to meet appropriate needs while alternative provision such as live work units and small 
hubs will be encouraged. 
 65. Rural Villages (Limited Growth and Infill/Rounding Off) will receive a 
share of up to 6% of the housing growth.  
 
The Countryside 
66. In an exception to the spatial strategy, Policy S3 allows for certain 
types of development in the open countryside and villages/hamlets not 
named in the above hierarchy.  The specific cases are listed in the 
policy and further detail provided throughout the Local Plan.  
 Cross Boundary issues 
67. Through the Lake District National Park’s Core Strategy (CS18) there 
is the opportunity for the housing need identified in the parishes of 
Boltons, Westward, Sebergham and Castle Sowerby to be delivered 
within specific adjoining parishes within the National Park, provided the 
occupant of the new homes meet the local connection criteria and any 
other occupancy requirements. Caldbeck is designated as a rural 
service centre in the National Park’ s Core Strategy and would be a 
focus for such development. All new housing approved under policy LDNP CS18 would be subject to occupancy restrictions.  
 68. Applications for new housing within the Allerdale Planning Authority 
area of these parishes will be subject to polices within the Allerdale Local Plan.  
 
Housing Allocations 
 
69. S3 sets out the strategy to deliver 304 dwellings per year, representing 
an aspirational, yet deliverable target. The policy provides an indication of the growth across the different settlements in the Plan Area. The 
figures for the Principal and Key Service Centres are not ceilings and 
will be fully assessed in the Site Allocations DPD. When allocating 
housing numbers the Council will consider the housing requirement in 
the context of current housing commitments, together with a windfall Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
26rate of 10% and lapse rate of 20%. The Site Allocations DPD will be 
developed with communities and stakeholders and will be subject to 
separate consultation.   
 70. The Council will seek to maintain five years worth of deliverable 
housing sites against their housing requirement with an additional buffer of 20% (given the past delivery of housing in the Plan Area) to 
provide a realistic and achievable supply that will help ensure choice 
and competition in the land market.
 
 71. The Site Allocations DPD will identify specific sites to accommodate 
the broad distribution of housing and employment growth set out in the spatial strategy. Furthermore, the DPD will review settlement 
boundaries and revise them as appropriate to the settlement role in the 
hierarchy and the level of growth that can be accommodated. Revision 
of boundaries will be undertaken in consultation with communities and 
stakeholders, the allocation of growth between settlements and of 
individual sites, will amongst other things, take into account; 
 
· The Local Plan strategy, especially the growth targets set out in S3; 
· Policy requirements, such as the need to deliver affordable housing; · The availability of appropriate land as identified through the 
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) as being 
suitable for development, and sites submitted to the allocations 
process; 
· The level of current housing commitments (Appendix 4) and 
completions since the beginning of the Plan Period (2011) 
· Infrastructure requirements and constraints; 
· Key constraints such as the natural environment (including Natura 
2000 sites), landscape, the historic environment; 
· The ability of the settlement to accommodate growth without 
harming its character, setting or the surrounding landscape. 
 
72. Given the water supply issues identified by key delivery agencies the 
release of land for development will be dependent on there being sufficient capacity in the existing local infrastructure to meet the 
additional requirements arising from new development, or when 
suitable arrangements having been put in place for the improvement of 
the water supply infrastructure necessary by the development. Where 
there is a need for extra capacity this will need to be provided in time to 
serve the development or the relevant phase of the development, in 
order to ensure that the environment is not adversely affected. 
 
73. The settlement boundaries show the area where development should 
be encouraged.  There is a strong presumption against proposals 
outside the defined limits of development of the Principal Service 
Centre, Key Service Centres, Local Service Centres, Limited Growth 
Villages. Development adjacent to Infill / Rounding Off Villages should 
be in accordance with Policy S5. 
 Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
27Employment Allocations 
 74. Evidence from the joint West Cumbria Employment Land and Premises 
Study (2008) and subsequent update (2012) suggests that in Allerdale there is a projected need for 60 ha (B1 10.7ha, B2 34.0ha and B8 
15.8ha) of land between 2011-2030. Given the importance and 
concentration of land at Lillyhall and several other large sites located 
across Workington, and in order to respond to future requirements and 
meet the needs of the whole Plan Area, the Plan will use the evidence 
as a base and allocate ‘at least ’ 54 ha of land for the plan period.  
 75. The level of growth will be allocated across each tier of the settlement 
hierarchy based on the role and size of the settlement as well as its environmental and infrastructure capacity. This will be considered 
during production of the Site Allocations DPD.  
 76. In order to meet both strategic and local needs, employment land will 
be distributed across the Plan Area broadly following the pattern outlined in Policy S3, taking into account: 
 
· Role and size of the settlement; 
· Infrastructure requirements and capacity; · Key constraints such as the natural environment (including Natura 
2000 sites), landscape, the historic environment; 
· The ability of the settlement to accommodate growth without 
harming its character, setting or the surrounding landscape 
· The importance of the current strategic and successful 
employment sites to the overall strategy for Allerdale ’s economic 
future; 
· The existing pattern of supply; · The need for flexibility, choice and churn in the market. 
 
77. The Employment Land Review Update (2012) suggested there are 100 
ha of available employment land across the Plan Area. Therefore, it concludes that there is scope for de-allocation of poorly performing 
sites and those that no longer meet the needs of modern business. 
Policy S12 provides further details on this process.

29S4 Design Principles 
 
78. Good design is indivisible from good planning.  The Council will require 
that all development proposals are of the highest standards of design and will contribute positively to the site and surroundings in terms of 
visual amenity and functionality. 
 
S4 Design Principles 
 
Achieving high quality design for all development is a key objective of the 
Local Plan. Good design relates not only to the appearance of a development 
but to how it functions within its location and to how it contributes towards a 
sustainable community. The Council will plan positively for well designed and 
inclusive places, including individual buildings, public and private spaces and 
wider area development schemes. 
 
Proposals for all new development (including conversions, extensions and 
alterations) will therefore be required to demonstrate high standards of design 
and must: 
 
· Be visually attractive, of appropriate scale and appearance; 
· Respond positively to the character, history and distinctiveness of its 
location and integrate well with existing development; 
· Improve connections between people and places through the provision 
of well thought out layouts, public realm, landscaping, streetscape and 
public and private green spaces; 
· Enhance, protect and integrate effectively with the historic and natural 
environment; 
· Function well by ensuring suitable standards of access and amenity 
are achieved and maintained in relation to the development itself and 
the local area; 
· Safeguard environmental quality and the amenities of occupiers of both 
proposed and existing property; 
· Incorporate sustainable construction methods that reduce energy 
consumption and allow for future adaptation in response to changing 
life needs; 
· Optimise the potential of the site by ensuring appropriate density and 
mass of development and considering, where appropriate, mixes of 
use that might be incorporated, such as green and other public space. 
These should be considered in the context of the identified needs of 
the area; 
· Make appropriate provision for those with reduced mobility and/or 
disabilities; 
· Ensure the development provides a safe environment which maximises 
personal safety and minimises opportunities for crime and antisocial 
behaviour. 
 Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
30Applications for developments which offer a poor standard of design and 
which fail to positively contribute to the character or quality of the site and 
surrounding area will be refused. 
 
79. This policy provides an overarching framework of requirements for the 
design of all development and should be used in conjunction with all other policies in the Local Plan to inform decisions on design. 
 80. National policy places a high requirement on good design to contribute 
positively to making places better for people and communities.  Good design does not solely relate to the appearance of a building or 
development, but also to how it functions and allows its users to 
interact with their neighbourhoods, communities and wider 
environment. All developments will be required to contribute positively 
and respect the local character, history and identity of the site, the area 
and its wider surroundings. 
 81. The Council will expect all developers to have regard for relevant good 
practice guidance documents, such as Building for Life 12 (CABE/Design Council), Safer Places (Secure by Design) and Manual 
for Streets (Department for Transport), Building in Context, and 
Constructive Conservation: Sustainable Growth for Historic Places 
(English Heritage)  
 82. The Council will produce supplementary planning guidance documents 
to guide development in relation to design.

 Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
31S5  Development Principles  
 
83. The spatial strategy sets the spatial framework across the Plan Area 
outlining the Council ’s approach to the scale, location and distribution 
of growth. 
S5  Development Principles 
 
New development will be concentrated within the physical limits of Principal, 
Key and Local Service Centres, Limited Growth Villages and appropriate 
development adjacent to Infill / Rounding Off Villages as identified within the 
settlement hierarchy. The scale of the development proposed will be expected 
to be commensurate to the size of the settlement and reflect its position within 
the hierarchy. Where available and if appropriate the Council will encourage 
and prioritise the effective reuse of previously used land and buildings or 
vacant and underused land. 
 
For settlements within the hierarchy, proposals, including conversions, will be 
acceptable provided that the proposed development is in conformity with all 
policies set out within the Local Plan and: 
 
a) The development is of a scale and design which will not detract from 
the character of the settlement; 
b) The development includes acceptable arrangements for car parking 
and access; 
c) The capacity of local infrastructure and/or environmental assets would 
not be exceeded by the proposed development; 
d) The site of the proposed development is not considered to have 
significant amenity value; 
e) The site is not considered to make a significant contribution to the 
character of the settlement in its undeveloped state; 
f) The development will not incur any significant harmful effects on 
environmental or heritage assets, habitats or wildlife, which cannot be 
successfully mitigated. 
 
As well as fulfilling the above criteria, development within / adjacent 
Infill/Rounding Off Villages will: 
 
(i) Be of a scale that is sympathetic to the role of the settlement and 
respect its appearance and physical capacity; 
(ii) Be within or well related to the form of the settlement and to existing 
buildings within the settlement; 
(iii) Protect, maintain or enhance the local distinctiveness, character and 
landscape and historic setting of the settlement, and 
 
Development within Infill/Rounding Off Villages must not:  
 
· Result in the loss of important historic, green infrastructure or natural 
features which provide valuable local amenity;  Strategic Policies – Spatial Strategy and Principles of Development 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
32· Exacerbate the adverse effects of ribbon development 
· Result in further adverse effects of areas of sporadic development in 
otherwise open countryside 
· Result in settlements joining together. 
 
84. The spatial strategy directs the majority of development to Principal, 
Key and Local Service centres.  In order to ensure the sustainability of smaller settlements a limited amount of development will be allowed 
within some Rural Villages, split between those with a settlement limit 
(Limited Growth Villages) and those that will be allowed development 
which rounds off and fills in sites within the existing built fabric of the 
village.   
 85. All development within Infill / Rounding Off Villages will be of a very 
small scale and relative to its size. Proposals for larger scale development in Infill / Rounding Off Villages, or development which 
does not comply with the criteria in S5 will be directed to the 
appropriate tier of the settlement hierarchy, or may be appropriate to 
be considered under Policy S9.
 
 86. Following the Council ’s regeneration and sustainability objectives, the 
effective reuse of previously developed and vacant sites is encouraged within the Plan Area.  However, it is acknowledged that given the 
evidence contained with the latest Allerdale Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment the major proportion of allocations will be on 
greenfield land that meets the policy requirements of Policy S5 and the 
Local Plan.

Strategic Policies – Area Based

87. The Workington locality is situated on the west coast of the Borough 
and comprises Workington; Allerdale ’s Principal Service Centre, the 
Local Service Centre of Great Clifton and the outlying Rural Villages of 
Camerton and Little Clifton. Despite having the smallest area, the 
Locality has the highest population and density of development of the 
Allerdale Locality areas. 
 88. The Workington Locality is accessible by a wide range of means of 
transport.  The A66, A595 and A596 are strategic roadways which provide access to Penrith and the M6 motorway in the east, 
Whitehaven and Sellafield to the south, and Maryport and Carlisle to 
the north.  The town of Workington is served by both rail and bus 
services, however, the railway station is somewhat distant from the 
town centre. It is well connected to national cycle paths and forms part 
of the C2C cycle route. 
 89. Workington is a major West Cumbrian centre for housing, employment, 
retail and leisure services, and given the relatively good transport links it has been identified as the principal location for future housing and 
employment growth.   
 90. Manufacturing industries have historically formed the locality ’s primary 
economic base and continue to provide significant levels of employment; however, the current largest employer for the Workington 
Locality is Sellafield.  The nuclear industry will continue to play a major 
role in the economic prosperity of Workington as many of its key 
employment sites, such as Lillyhall and the Port of Workington, form 
part of the Energy Coast Innovation Zone. 
 91. Workington is an area of contrasts - whilst most of the Locality enjoys 
high quality of life, low rates of crime and easy and ample access to open space and countryside, many of its neighbourhoods suffer from 
high levels of deprivation. 
92. Earliest records of a settlement located in the Workington locality relate 
to archaeological finds indicating a Viking settlement at the mouth of 
the River Derwent. Furthermore, as with much of Allerdale, Roman 
forts and watchtowers were sited along the coast, which are included in 
the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site.   Workington ’s modern history 
is inextricably linked with the Curwens Family from at least the 12 Century and to the establishment of a port after discovery of coal and 
iron ore. These natural resources led to the growth of the iron and steel 
industry which contributed to the expansion of the town into the early 
20th century.    
 93. The central and coastal areas of Workington are now largely modern, 
but Workington has three Conservation Areas.  Firstly, Portland Square 
is an area of attractive Georgian townhouses, built by the Curwen 
Family of Workington Hall in the 1770s. It is on high land to the east of 
the main town and is set out in a grid around Portland Square, a long Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
35rectangular cobbled space. Some buildings in the area suffer from a 
lack of maintenance, due largely to the relatively poor local economy. 
Secondly, Brow Top, which has buildings of great character that face 
north overlooking a lower plateau. The buildings are mainly 18th and 
19th Century and range from large classical ‘villas ’, to smaller terraced 
properties. The south facing properties to the rear form the north side of Finkle Street, one of the Town ’s shopping streets, and are 
dominated by their ground floor shop frontages. Lastly, St Michael ’s 
Conservation Area is named after the large church which, together with 
St Michaels’ s school is set within an open area of grassland. St 
Michael ’s rectory is a 16th Century Grade 1 listed building which is also 
of significant architectural character. St Michael ’s was one of the first 
parts of Workington to be developed, however, the majority of the existing architecture is Victorian, with the context provided by the 
railway station. The area suffers from being dissected by two busy 
roads as well as some underinvestment in its buildings and its public 
realm.  A loss of traditional features has led to this conservation area 
being categorised as ‘at risk’ .   
 94. Despite being the most urbanised of the Plan Area Localities, 
Workington has a diverse natural environment.  The River Derwent flows from the Lakeland fells in the east, through the northern section 
of the locality to the Solway and provides a scenic and internationally 
protected corridor for wildlife and habitat conservation.  Conversely, the 
historical industrial legacy has left many areas of previously developed 
land which also provide valuable wildlife habitats for protected species. 
 
Workington Area Policy 
 
In relation to the following issues in the Workington Locality, the Council will: 
 
Housing 
· Taking into account committed development direct approximately 35% 
of the overall housing growth to Workington (including Seaton, Stainburn, Siddick and Harrington) amounting to an average of 106 
homes per year; 
· Allow smaller numbers of housing in the Local Service Centre of Great 
Clifton and the Limited Growth Village of Little Clifton/Bridgefoot. Reflecting its designation as an Infill/ Rounding Off Village very small 
scale development will be expected in Camerton;   
· Expect the Site Allocation DPD to allocate appropriate sites to meet the 
growth targets. Where available the reuse of previously used land will 
be encouraged, however, given the evidence the majority of sites are 
likely to be on greenfield land; 
· Expect open market housing sites in Workington to deliver 20% 
affordable housing on site (subject to viability). On all other qualifying sites in the Locality the Council will aim to deliver 25% affordable 
housing targets;   Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
36· Target areas of empty and poor housing to prioritise for housing 
renewal and improvement. 
 
Economy 
· Expect the majority of the Plan ’s employment needs to be met in key 
sites in the Workington Locality as it is central to the delivery of the Allerdale ’s economic strategy;  
· Seek to maximise the strategic economic role of Lillyhall as part of the 
Britain ’s Energy Coast Innovation Zone, by promoting the growth of the 
energy sector, research and development clusters, education and 
skills, and the development of high quality, large format industrial and 
commercial uses; 
· Support the development of superfast and next generation broadband 
across the Locality, with a focus on the key business locations such as 
Workington town centre and Lillyhall industrial estate; 
· Work closely with partners to enable development of land around the 
Port of Workington to capitalise on and compliment the Port ’s role in 
the movement of freight and the potential role in servicing the energy, 
nuclear and distribution sectors; 
· Encourage the growth of job opportunities on existing employment 
sites such as Derwent Howe in order to unlock their potential; 
· Support proposals for the redevelopment of Derwent Forest site for 
appropriate uses such as large scale leisure development and tourism activities of a predominately open nature, renewable energy schemes 
or educational facilities, while protecting and enhancing its heritage and 
ecological assets; 
· Support the continued development of the Energy Coast Campus; 
· Identify land to meet the evidenced need for retail and leisure 
development within, and on the edge of, Workington town centre, 
reflecting its role as West Cumbria ’s principal retail and leisure 
destination. The Council will seek to improve the vitality and viability of the town centre by supporting a wide and diverse range of shops and 
leisure uses within the centre and by encouraging a thriving evening 
economy; 
· Implement the new town centre boundary which allows the centre to 
grow and adapt to changing needs over the plan period, ensuring there is enough land available for appropriate development; 
· Protect designated primary frontages to secure the retail shopping core 
of the town centre; 
· Secure designated secondary frontages which promote a wider range 
of town centre uses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and offices. 
 
Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
· Support proposals in Workington to create a multi modal transport hub 
with the potential for mixed use development and additional car 
parking; 
· Support improvements and enhancements to rail services including the 
functionality, facilities and bus links at Workington train station; Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
37· Facilitate the expansion of the Port of Workington by enhancing 
important infrastructure such as road and rail access;  
· Encourage the improvement of health and fitness by supporting the 
development of a new or improved sports and leisure opportunities, 
including a new sports and leisure centre in Workington; 
· Support improvements and better access to existing, or the creation of 
new, educational facilities within the town of Workington; 
· Support redevelopment of the Derwent Valley area for a mix of uses 
that may include leisure and employment.  Particular encouragement will be given for proposals that seek to improve and enhance 
Workington ’s sports and leisure facilities; 
· Support development which provides and improves leisure facilities 
and recreational areas for young people; 
· Support proposals which improve utility provision; 
 
Built and Historic Environment 
· Seek the continued protection of the attractive historic buildings within 
the conservation areas of Portland Square, Brow Top and St Michael ’s; 
· Conserve and maintain the Grade I listed building and schedule 
ancient monument of Workington Hall and enhance the exceptional beauty of its historic Curwen Park and gardens and recognise the 
importance of this area for recreational uses, as a habitat for protected 
wildlife species and a significant green infrastructure asset; 
· Recognise the high environmental and amenity value of some 
brownfield sites in the Locality. 
 
Natural Environment 
· Protect and enhance the special character of the River Derwent and 
River Derwent Corridors as Natura 2000 sites and the Siddick Pond Site of Special Scientific Interest, as well protecting and enhancing 
other biodiversity and geodiversity assets; 
· Support the development of the England Coast Path , which seeks to 
establish an unbroken walking route along the coast of England and 
provide enhanced and secure access to the coastal margin; 
· Support proposals which minimise the risk of flooding and effectively 
contribute to flood defence management.

38S6b  Maryport 
 
Figure 7 Maryport Locality  
 
Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
3995. The Locality of Maryport is situated on the west coast of the Borough to 
the north of Workington and encompasses the Key Service Centre of 
Maryport, the Local Service Centres of Flimby, Broughton Moor and 
Dearham and the Rural Villages of Crosby and Crosby Villa.  
 96. First founded as a Roman Fort in connection with Hadrian ’s Wall, the 
town of Maryport grew from its port and harbour activities. It has a rich maritime history which still characterises much of the town ’s identity, 
both in the built environment and through its cultural influences.  Much of the old town is within a Conservation Area characterised both by its 
historic harbour and the 18th/19th Century Georgian style buildings laid 
out in a grid pattern of long streets.  At the heart of the Conservation 
Area is Fleming Square providing an architectural focus to the 
Georgian development. Main issues facing the historic environment 
relate to Maryport ’s Conservation Area is the lack of maintenance and 
under use of some of the buildings as a result of the poor local economy, as well as some poor quality shopfronts. 
 97. Since the decline of its port and harbour activities, Maryport has heavily 
relied upon tourism for its economy and the town has several visitor attractions, largely based around its maritime and roman connections.  
Maryport also has two large industrial estates which house a number of 
national and local businesses. It has good transport links and is 
accessible by road primarily from the A596.  It has both rail and bus 
services, however the railway station is currently somewhat divorced 
from the town centre by the main A596 road.  The town of Maryport is 
connected to the national cycle network and forms part of the C2C 
cycle route. 
 98. The Maryport Locality has the second largest population within the 
Plan Area, yet the local business, retail and leisure services are somewhat limited with the consequence that many of its residents rely 
on Workington for their shopping or leisure needs.   
 99. Unemployment and worklessness are issues within the Maryport 
Locality and educational attainment levels are also low within some of the more deprived areas. 
 100. The wider Locality of Maryport has many important natural assets with 
much of the north of the locality encompassed within the Solway Coast AONB.  A large tract of land to the south of the town of Maryport is also 
designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is habitat to 
many protected species.   
 
Maryport Area Policy 
 
In relation to the following issues in the Maryport Locality, the Council will: 
 
Housing Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
40· Taking into account committed development direct approximately 12% 
of the overall housing growth to Maryport amounting to an average of 
37 homes per year ; 
· Allow smaller numbers of housing in the Local Service Centres of 
Flimby, Broughton Moor and Dearham, while the Limited Growth Village of Crosby will see small scale growth.  Reflecting its designation 
as an Infill/ Rounding Off Village very small scale development will be 
expected in Crosby Villa; 
· Expect the Site Allocation DPD to allocate appropriate sites to meet the growth targets. Where available the reuse of previously used land will 
be encouraged, however, given the evidence the majority of sites are 
likely to be on greenfield land;
 
· Expect open market housing sites in Maryport to deliver 20% 
affordable houses delivered on site (subject to viability). On all other qualifying sites in the Locality the Council will aim to deliver 25% 
affordable housing targets;   
· Target areas of poor housing and prioritise for housing renewal and 
improvement. 
 Economy 
· Provide a mix of employment land opportunities across the Locality and 
support high quality development and refurbishment of existing employment sites such as the Glasson, Solway and Risehow industrial 
estates; 
· Support existing and new businesses by welcoming appropriate 
expansion and promoting flexible business start up and ‘move on ’ 
space; 
· Promote Maryport as a key tourism destination and encourage the 
development of strategic visitor attractions such as the harbour/marina, 
Roman Maryport and Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site ; 
· Promote the vitality and viability of Maryport town centre by 
encouraging a greater mix of retail and leisure uses, particularly those which may attract visitors and support the role of Maryport as a tourism 
and leisure destination; 
· Implement the new town centre boundary which allows the centre to 
grow and adapt to changing needs and increase the capacity of the centre to attract new development, such as leisure and cultural 
facilities. The new town centre boundary bridges the gap between the 
traditional shopping area of the town and the harbour side where there 
will be allocated land for new leisure and cultural facilities; 
· Protect designated primary frontages along Senhouse Street and 
Curzon Street where the shopping core of the centre will be secured; 
· Secure designated secondary frontage between the primary retail area 
of Senhouse Street and the harbour bridge where a wider range of town centre uses such as restaurants, cafes and offices will be 
encouraged and protected and which will draw visitors from the upper 
town centre down to the marina area; Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
41· Support proposals for the redevelopment of the harbour/marina for a 
mix of uses, which may include leisure, retail, employment and 
residential uses; 
· Support proposals which seek to improve the Maryport ’s tourism offer 
with high quality hotel and leisure facilities.  Development which supports and maximises the outdoor recreational opportunities 
available through the harbour/marina, such as sailing and surfing and 
which relieve visitor pressure on sensitive coastal environments of the 
Solway Coast AONB and Natura 2000 habitat sites will be particularly 
encouraged; 
· Support and promote festivals which draw visitors to the town and 
support a thriving cultural scene, such as the Maryport Blues Festival. 
 
Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
· Work with partners to support the improvement and integration of bus 
and rail services through the development of a Maryport transport hub; 
· Support improvements to the West Cumbria Coastal Railway service; 
· Work with partners to maximise the roll out of superfast and next 
generation broadband across the Locality to both residential and 
business users; 
· Support development which provides and improves leisure facilities 
and recreational areas for young people; 
· Support a sustainable future for the Wave Centre; 
· Support proposals which improve utility provision. 
 
Built and Historic Environment 
· Seek the continued protection of the heritage assets and architecture, 
particularly within the attractive conservation area including Maryport ’s 
Fleming Square; 
· Continue to recognise the national archaeological importance of the 
Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site and the Roman fort at Camp Farm.  
Efforts to progress archaeological investigations in the area shall be supported and protection will be given to the archaeological and 
historic integrity of Roman Maryport. 
 Natural Environment 
· Support the development of the England Coast Path , which seeks to 
establish an unbroken walking route along the coast of England and provide enhanced and secure access to the coastal margin; 
· Protect and enhance biodiversity and geodiversity assets across the 
Locality; 
· Continue to protect the nationally designated historical park of 
Netherhall which is a locally important area of green space within Maryport; 
· Continue to safeguard the protected areas of the Solway Coast AONB 
from harmful development and ensure that all development is consistent with the objectives of the Solway Coast AONB Management 
Plan.

42S6c  Cockermouth 
 
 
Figure 8 Cockermouth Locality  
 101. The locality of Cockermouth covers an area between the Lake District 
National Park in the east to the Workington Locality in the west.  It encompasses the Key Service Centre of Cockermouth, the Local 
Service Centres of Brigham and Broughton and the Rural Villages of 
Bridekirk, Branthwaite, Broughton Cross, Dean, Deanscales, Dovenby, 
Eaglesfield, Greysouthen, Mockerkin, Papcastle, Pardshaw, Tallentire, 
and Ullock. 
Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
43102. The town of Cockermouth is an attractive historic market town built 
upon the meeting of the River Cocker and the River Derwent.  It 
benefits from its advantageous position adjacent to the Lake District 
National Park and both the A66 and the A595, making it an attractive 
residential location.  
 103. Cockermouth has a rich historical environment with the whole of the 
town centre being encompassed within a Conservation Area, and features many Listed or protected buildings.  The medieval market 
town layout is very evident, particularly the oldest parts; Market Place, 
Castlegate, the Castle & Kirkgate as well as parts of Main Street. Some 
of the buildings in this area have considerable 17th Century and 
possibly older elements behind the facades, while much 
redevelopment and re-facing of buildings was carried out in the 
Georgian period.  One of the best examples being Wordsworth House, 
the birthplace and childhood home of William Wordsworth.  From the 
late 18th Century the town developed larger industries initially using 
water from the two main rivers. Some of the issues affecting the 
Conservation Area come from the quantity of traffic travelling through 
its heart, while there are also examples of poor quality shopfronts, 
signs and public realm. 
 104. In the wider locality Papcastle Conservation Area is located adjacent to 
the site of a Roman fort and is surrounded by a rich archaeology.    Its modern origins come from mills and industries using the river although 
it is largely residential now and functions as a suburb of Cockermouth 
but retains the physical character of a distinctive settlement.   The 
village has grown organically with a variety of vernacular buildings 
including farmsteads and small cottages as well as a number of larger 
detached houses of more polite architecture of various styles. 
 105. The town centre of Cockermouth is vibrant, attractive and functions 
well as both a service centre and tourist destination. The attractiveness of Cockermouth as a residential location has led to high house prices 
which have increasingly become beyond the reach of many local 
residents, therefore the need for affordable housing has become a 
priority.  Much of the town of Cockermouth is prone to high levels of 
flooding, as was seen in 2009, and efforts continue with the towns flood 
defences to ensure its future resilience. 
 
106. A large number of the residents within the Cockermouth Locality work 
at Sellafield and commute via private car.  The town is also popular as 
a location for new businesses with several successful and high quality 
commercial business parks developed over recent years. Given the 
Town ’s successful property market there is limited opportunity for new 
development within the town itself and therefore a need to consider providing more land in the development plan. Cockermouth is served 
by regular bus services but is not on the railway line. 
 Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
44107. The outlying villages within the Cockermouth Locality share the 
attractive residential qualities of the town, as well as the problem of 
availability of local affordable housing.  Furthermore, in some of these 
villages access to services such as shops and schools are limited. 
 108. As a successful and popular location, attracting many affluent families, 
the residents of the Cockermouth Locality enjoy a high quality of life, high educational attainment and low levels of deprivation. 
 109. Cockermouth is well known for its scenic location and easy access to 
the countryside and the nearby Lake District.  The Rivers Derwent and Cocker are both internationally protected wildlife and habitat corridors. 
 
Cockermouth Area Policy 
 
In relation to the following issues in the Cockermouth Locality, the Council will: 
 
Housing 
· Taking into account committed development direct approximately 10% 
of the overall housing growth to Cockermouth amounting to an average of 30 homes per year ; 
· Allow smaller numbers of housing in the Local Service Centres of 
Brigham and Broughton and the Limited Growth Villages of Bridekirk, Eaglesfield, Greysouthen, Dean, Branthwaite and Tallentire. Reflecting 
its designation as an Infill/ Rounding Off Village very small scale 
development will be expected in Broughton Cross, Deanscales, 
Dovenby, Mockerkin, Papcastle, Pardshaw, and Ullock;   
· Expect the Site Allocation DPD to allocate appropriate sites to meet the 
growth targets. Where available the reuse of previously used land will 
be encouraged, however, given the evidence the majority of sites are 
likely to be on greenfield land;
 
· Expect open market housing sites in Cockermouth to deliver 40% 
affordable houses delivered on site (subject to viability). On all other qualifying sites in the Locality the Council will aim to deliver 25% 
affordable housing targets.   
· Encourage the provision of housing to meet the needs of the older 
generation and for people with specific housing needs. 
 
Economy 
· Address lack of available employment sites and increase the range on 
offer to meet both ongoing local needs and those of the nuclear and energy supply sectors; 
· Support proposals which build upon the existing vitality and viability of 
Cockermouth town centre including, allocating land to improve retail 
provision and choice (particularly convenience); 
· Implement new town centre boundary which allows the centre to grow 
and adapt to changing needs over the plan period, ensuring there is enough land available for appropriate development; 
· Protect designated primary frontages to secure the retail shopping core 
of the town centre along Main Street and Station Street; Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
45· Secure designated secondary frontages which promote wider mixed 
uses within the town centre such as cafes, restaurants, pubs, bars, etc 
- which draw visitors along the main town centre area towards the 
Market Place. Extend the main town centre area to include the Market 
Place, and encourage and promote this area as a place for leisure and 
culture; 
· Support the provision, improvement and protection of small scale retail, 
leisure and community services in rural settlements; 
· Encourage tourism proposals which capitalise on the high visitor 
numbers to the Cockermouth area, particularly, sustainable forms of 
tourism and leisure attractions, such as Roman Papcastle, and the 
provision of high quality accommodation. 
· Support and promote festivals which draw visitors to the town and 
support a thriving cultural scene, such as the Taste Cumbria festival. 
 
Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
· Support proposals which improve utility provision; 
· Encourage improvements to the accessibility of Cockermouth town 
centre through improvements to the town car parks, with linked 
improvements to local public transport provision and cycle networks; 
· Work with partners to maximise the roll out of superfast and next 
generation broadband across the Locality to both residential and 
business users. 
 Built and Historic Environment 
· Seek the continued conservation and enhancement of the Locality ’s 
historic assets, including Cockermouth ’s distinctive architectural 
characteristics; 
· Promote development in accordance with the Cockermouth Design 
Guide. 
 
Natural Environment 
· Protect and enhance the special character of the River Derwent and 
River Derwent corridors as Natura 2000 sites and Sites of Special Scientific Interest as well as protecting and enhancing other 
biodiversity and geodiversity assets; 
· Support proposals which minimise the risk of flooding and effectively 
contribute to defence management; 
· Ensure development has regard for the landscape character of the 
Locality, with particular focus on the setting of the Lake District National Park.

110. The Wigton Locality covers a large area of land in the north of the 
Borough, stretching from the Lake District National Park in the south east to the Solway Firth in the north west.  The Locality is 
predominately rural and agricultural in nature with the Key Service 
Centre of Wigton, Local Service Centres of Kirkbride and Thursby and 
the Rural Villages of Anthorn, Bowness-on-Solway, Bolton Low 
Houses, Glasson, Ireby, Kirkbampton, Little Bampton, Newton Arlosh, 
Oulton, Port Carlisle and Waverton. 
 111. The town of Wigton is a historic market town and remains a centre for 
agricultural commercial activity and a service centre for the northern rural communities.  There are also several significant industrial 
employers within the town.  Wigton town centre evolved from a 
medieval street plan and has many significant heritage assets.  The 
whole of the town centre is within the Conservation Area and many of 
its buildings are Listed or protected.   
 112. WIgton churches and former market places give the town its layout, 
whilst its narrow central streets form the shopping core.  The town grew significantly in the early 19th Century with industrial developments and 
this led to a large expansion of residential development, mostly in the 
local Georgian style. It also has some small Victorian terraced housing, 
which add positively to the character of the Conservation Area. 
Although the town centre is thriving in many ways - it has low vacancy 
rates and a high number of successful independent traders - the built 
environment has degraded over recent years and some of the larger 
buildings are in a poor state of repair. 
 113. The Wigton Locality has a rich historical landscape with much of the 
northern area within the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site.  A number 
of the outlying villages are encompassed by Conservation Areas and 
there is a wide and diverse selection of Listed Buildings scattered 
throughout the locality. Bowness on Solway Conservation Area is on 
the site of a Roman fort on Hadrian ’s Wall and is built up on the banks 
of the Solway Estuary.  Its 12th Century St Michael ’s church is thought 
to be built on the granary of the Roman fort. It is the largest village on 
the western Solway Plain and has grown organically with much 
vernacular architecture including farm buildings, as well as later 
Victorian properties. In close proximity Port Carlisle Conservation Area 
is one mile east of Bowness and was developed as a port in the early 
19th Century.  Most of the large sandstone docking quay remains and 
is an important part of the history and character of the Conservation 
Area. Port Carlisle ’s houses were built at the time as the construction 
of the canal in the early 19th Century mainly on one single sided street. The architecture is simple but very well proportioned and almost all of 
its buildings are listed.   
 114. Wigton is located between the two main roadways of the A595 and 
A596 which run between Workington and Carlisle.  Given its close Strategic Policies – Area Based 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
48location to Carlisle commuting for employment and services is 
common, and has in part contributed to an increase in recent housing 
development. It is served by regular bus services and it has a railway 
station, although this is somewhat detached from the town centre. 
 115. The outlying villages of the Wigton Locality are dispersed widely across 
the area and are diverse in size and character.  They largely retain their primary agricultural function, yet some lack services such as 
shops and bus services, leaving some communities relatively isolated.   
  
116. Of all the Localities within the Plan Area, Wigton is the most 
ecologically diverse in terms of natural environmental assets.  The whole of the northern section of the locality, including the Solway Firth, 
Plains, Wetlands, Muds and Flats are protected by international wildlife 
and habitats designations, such as the Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites, 
national designations such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
and local designations such as County Wildlife sites.  Furthermore, the 
coastal area of the Solway Firth itself is nationally protected for its 
intrinsic natural beauty through the designation as the Solway Coast 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). 
 
Wigton Area Policy In relation to the following issues in the Wigton Locality, the Council will: 
 
Housing 
· Taking into account committed development direct approximately 10% 
of the overall housing growth to Wigton amounting to an average of 30 homes per year; 
· Allow smaller numbers of housing in the Local Service Centres of 
Kirkbride and Thursby and the Limited Growth Village of Kirkbampton, Bolton Low Houses, Glasson, Newton Arlosh and Ireby. Reflecting

be encouraged, however, given the evidence the majority of sites are 
likely to be on greenfield land;
 
· Expect open market housing sites in Wigton to deliver 20% affordable 
houses delivered on site (subject to viability). On all other qualifying sites in the Locality the Council will aim to deliver 25% affordable 
housing targets;   
· Support efforts to make use of long term empty housing, especially 
within Wigton town centre.

49Through the Lake District National Park’ s Core Strategy (CS18) there is the 
opportunity for the housing need identified in the parishes of Boltons, 
Westward, Sebergham and Castle Sowerby to be delivered within specific 
adjoining parishes within the National Park, provided the occupants meet the 
local connection criteria and any other occupancy requirements. Caldbeck is 
designated as a rural service centre in the National Park’ s Core Strategy and 
would be a focus for such development. All new housing approved under policy LDNP CS18 would be subject to occupancy restrictions.  
 
Applications for new housing within the Allerdale Planning Authority area of 
these parishes will be subject to polices within the Allerdale Local Plan.  
 
Economy 
· Encourage appropriate levels of employment growth following the 
spatial strategy through the identification of additional employment land; 
· Promote existing and new businesses by welcoming appropriate 
expansion and supporting proposals for small flexible business start-up and ‘move on ’ space as well as alternative methods of provision such 
as the role of work hubs in providing facilities as a focal point for rural businesses; 
· Promote the sustainability of the Locality by directing and where 
necessary allocating land for retail, leisure and cultural proposals to 
Wigton town centre and by encouraging a vibrant evening economy to 
serve local communities and attract visitors; 
· Support production of Area / Town Centre Action Plans in partnership 
with the community to improve the prospects and viability of Wigton town centre; 
· Encourage appropriate levels of growth following the spatial strategy 
and promote alternative methods of provision, such as the opportunity for live/work units in rural areas; 
· Support appropriate rural and farm diversification schemes, particularly 
through the encouragement of small scale tourism development, or food and drink production businesses; 
· Protect the character and sustainability of rural settlements by setting 
policies that vigorously protect village and community services such as 
shops and pubs. 
 
Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
· Work with partners to support traffic management and infrastructure 
projects in order to tackle congestion, ease heavy traffic movement and improve the public realm within Wigton town centre; 
· Support development which provides and improves open space 
provision, leisure facilities and recreational areas for young people, particularly in isolated rural villages; 
· Support proposals to improve facilities at Wigton rail station such as 
the creation of additional car parking; Strategic Policies – Area Based

50· Work with partners to maximise the roll out of superfast and next 
generation broadband across the Locality to both residential and 
business users; 
· Support proposals which improve utility provision. 
 Built and Historic Environment 
· Safeguard and protect the attractive and distinctive Georgian 
architectural heritage within Wigton town centre and the wider villages, promoting improvements and enhancements to maximise the character 
of the buildings and public realm within conservation areas; 
· Protect the distinctive character of villages and settlements by ensuring 
that all new development respects and enhances existing traditional 
designs and features; 
· Continue to recognise the international archaeological importance of 
the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site.  Efforts to progress 
archaeological investigations in the area shall be supported and 
protection will be given to the archaeological and historical integrity of 
findings and remains. 
 Natural Environment 
· Continue to safeguard and where appropriate enhance the 
internationally protected Natura 2000 sites, including the numerous SSSIs of the Solway Mosses and Marshes, and protect and enhance 
other biodiversity and geodiversity assets; 
· Protect the nationally protected Solway Coast AONB from harmful 
development and ensure that all development is consistent with the 
objectives of the Solway Coast AONB Management Plan; 
· Ensure development has regard for the landscape character of the 
Locality, with particular focus on the setting of the Lake District National Park; 
· Support the development of the England Coast Path , which seeks to

117. The Locality of Silloth is in the north west of the Borough on the Solway 
Coast and encompasses the Key Service Centre of Silloth, the Local Service Centre of Abbeytown and the Rural Villages of Blitterlees, 
Mawbray and Skinburness. 
 118. The town of Silloth was established as a Victorian seaside resort and 
much of the existing town centre retains the attractive grid street pattern and architecture of this time. Behind the beach and promenade 
is a strip of trees and The Green, a very large grassed area separating 
the sea from the main town. The town ’s Victorian architecture is well 
preserved and the majority of the town centre is within the Conservation Area with many of the buildings being Listed or 
protected.   
 119. The Green and the impressive three storey Victorian architecture 
fronting it provides a very distinctive Victorian Seaside Resort character, however, while Silloth town centre has an attractive built 
environment, it currently suffers a limited choice of retail and leisure 
businesses.  A greater variety of businesses would optimise its 
potential as both a residential location and tourism destination. The 
Locality as a whole has a rich historic landscape with much of the area 
within the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site.  A number of the outlying 
villages are Conservation Areas and there is a diverse selection of Listed Buildings scattered throughout the locality. 
 120. Silloth is a popular visitor destination due to its central position within 
the Solway Coast AONB and it has a popular golf course and several holiday parks.  Other economic activities within the town are based 
around the Port of Silloth and a number of industrial units nearby.  
 121. The Silloth Locality has an unbalanced population with a significantly 
higher proportion of elderly people than any other area within the Borough.   
 
 122. Silloth makes a significant contribution to the Borough ’s natural 
environment through a range of ecologically diverse and important assets.  The entire coastal sections of the locality are protected under 
the international designations of Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites, 
national designations such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
and local designations such as County Wildlife sites.  Furthermore, the 
Solway Firth and Coast themselves are protected for their intrinsic 
natural beauty and are nationally protected through as the Solway 
Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) designation. 
 Silloth Area Policy 
 In relation to the following issues in the Silloth Locality, the Council will:

Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site. Development for tourism and 
accommodation facilities will be directed to Silloth and Abbeytown in order to relieve pressure on sensitive landscapes and habitats and 
support the rural economy;  
· Encourage appropriate levels of employment growth in accordance 
with the spatial strategy and promote alternative methods of provision, such as the opportunity for live/work units; 
· Recognise the importance of the Port of Silloth to the economy of the 
Locality and wider Borough, while ensuring that development does not result in an adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites; 
· Promote sustainability by promoting Silloth town centre as the 
Locality ’s Key Service Centre and directing retail, leisure and cultural 
proposals of appropriate scale and nature to the town centre wherever 
possible; 
· Support appropriate rural and farm diversification schemes, particularly 
through the encouragement of small scale tourism development, or 
food and drink production businesses; 
· Protect the character and sustainability of rural settlements by 
protecting village and community services such as local shops, village halls and pubs.

123. The Aspatria Locality is situated in the centre of the Borough, north of 
Maryport, stretching from the A595 in the east to the Solway Coast in the west.  The locality encompasses the Key Service Centre of 
Aspatria, the Local Service Centres of Allonby and Prospect and the 
Rural Villages of Blencogo, Blennerhasset, Bothel, Fletchertown, 
Gilcrux, Hayton, Langrigg, Oughterside, Parsonby, Plumbland, 
Torpenhow, and Westnewton. 
 124. The town of Aspatria evolved due to coal mining; however, its main 
economic activities are now manufacturing and food industries.  The town centre is small in scale and spreads along the main route of the 
A596 road.  There are limited retail and leisure services with the 
consequence that many residents travel to Wigton, Maryport or Carlisle 
for their shopping and leisure requirements.  The town centre 
environment is of poor quality in certain areas, in part due to the level 
of heavy traffic that passes through the town. 
 125. The Aspatria Locality has a diverse historic landscape with parts of the 
area within the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site.  A number of the 
outlying villages such as Allonby are Conservation Areas and there is a 
wide selection of Listed Buildings scattered throughout the Locality. 
Allonby is set on a wide sweeping bay with extensive views south to 
Maryport and north to Dumfries and Galloway. It originated as a fishing 
and farming settlement with local services providing for farms further 
afield. It has strong Quaker links and a history of attracting wealthy 
incomers and benefactors, which has led to the construction of many 
interesting buildings in a variety of architectural styles. It has thrived 
into the 20th & 21st Centuries as a destination for holiday makers and 
day trippers as well as a desirable place to live. 
 126. The Locality has a varied natural landscape with the coastal sections 
near Allonby nationally protected for their intrinsic beauty as part of the Solway Coast AONB. Allonby is a popular visitor destination amongst 
locals for access to its coast and beaches and is host to a number of 
outdoor recreational activities.  Much of these areas also form 
important wildlife and habitat protection areas and are internationally 
protected as Natura 2000 sites.  The countryside and coastal areas 
offer many opportunities for tourism and recreational activities to 
promote the local economy with the village of Allonby being particularly 
well placed to receive additional tourist numbers whilst relieving visitor 
pressures on the sensitive coastline and habitats.

S7 A Mixed and Balanced Housing Market  127. The creation of sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities is a key 
objective of both Allerdale Borough Council and national government. Policy S3 sets out the spatial strategy for residential development over 
the plan period. It is vital to the success of this strategy that the right 
types of homes are delivered so the whole community is suitable 
housed irrespective of their personal circumstances.  
 
S7 A Mixed and Balanced Housing Market 
 
The Council will work with partners to promote sustainable, inclusive and 
mixed communities by ensuring that all new residential development 
contributes to improving the balance of housing and meets the identified 
needs of the whole community. The Local Plan will ensure the development of 
sustainable mixed communities by: 
 
· Maximising the delivery of affordable housing through the Plan Area; 
· Ensuring residential development makes a positive contribution to the 
overall housing mix; 
· Ensuring the sustainable use of housing land and stock; 
· Making provision for the identified needs of an ageing population and 
ensuring that the specific requirements of different groups are met; 
· Improving the quality and suitability of the existing housing stock; 
· Supporting the essential need for a rural worker to live permanently at, 
or near to their place of work; 
· Encouraging high standards of design and infrastructure that create 
sustainable and inclusive communities. 
 128. Allerdale faces a number of significant housing challenges that need to 
be addressed to achieve a more balanced housing market. This policy sets a comprehensive framework to provide focus and direction to 
enable these challenges to be met.  
 
129. It is important that the Local Plan provides enough homes to meet the 
aspirations of local people and to attract new people to live in the area 
in order to support economic objectives.  In addition to ensuring that 
sufficient housing is delivered, the Local Plan must ensure that the 
housing needs of different types of households is fulfilled by providing 
the right types and mix of housing within the Plan Area.  Providing the 
right types of homes is key to ensuring that development does not 
compound the existing housing problems, such as affordability, and to 
ensure that we provide for current and future residents.  It is expected 
that the mix of housing will vary site-by-site and will be informed by 
local evidence provided by an up-to-date Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment or other credible evidence source.  
 Strategic Policies – Housing 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
61130. Encouraging the use and redevelopment of empty and unsuitable 
homes is also an important part of the strategy for sustainable 
development. Policy DM1 provides detail to help support development. 
 131. As a central part of the spatial strategy S3 directs development to 
defined settlements across Allerdale, and to avoid isolated new homes in the open countryside. In meeting the accommodation needs of all of 
Allerdale, national policy allows for an exception to this approach for 
affordable housing (S9  Rural Exception Sites) and the essential need 
for a rural worker, such as those employed in agriculture, forestry or 
other land based industries, to live permanently at or near their place of 
work in the countryside. Policy DM2 details the requirements that will 
be used to assess such proposals.

62S8 Affordable Housing  
 
132. The provision of affordable homes is one of the Council ’s key priorities. 
The majority of affordable housing that is built across the Plan Area is delivered as part of new development. Therefore, planning policies 
have a central role in helping to deliver low cost homes through quotas 
of affordable dwellings being negotiated and delivered on open market 
housing sites.  
 
133. In 2012 the average house price in Allerdale stood at approximately 
£157,000, and while this is not considered high by national standards, 
when compared to average household income they are considered 
unaffordable, with an average ratio of 5:1. At entry level the problem is 
more pronounced and many local people, especially younger people, 
often find themselves priced out of the market.  
 134. The Strategic Housing Market Assessments (SHMA) identify a need for 
affordable housing in the Plan Area of approximately 181 dwellings per annum to meet backlog and emerging needs. This must be placed in 
the context of the growth targets of 304 identified in S3 new dwellings 
(both open market and affordable) each year over the plan period. This 
equates to nearly 60% of the annual housing requirements. The 
assessments also indicated that across the Plan Area most of the need 
was for social rented units rather than shared ownership dwellings.  
 135. The tenure needs provided by local evidence is as follows; 
 
Housing Market Area Annual Need 
(households) Socially Rented Intermediate
 
Workington and 
Maryport 106 80% 20% 
Cockermouth 39 70% 30% 
Wigton 36 60% 40% 
Allerdale 181 74% 26% 
 
Figure 12 Affordable Housing Need (Allerdale SHMA 2011)  
 136. The Housing Viability Assessment has been produced to demonstrate 
the levels at which housing development is capable of being delivered profitably while at the same time providing an appropriate level of 
affordable housing and tenure mix. The viability of providing affordable 
housing has been considered in addition to the overall level of need 
when setting the quotas in the policy.

S8  Affordable Housing  
 
The Council will seek to maximise the delivery of affordable housing across 
the Plan Area by working with partners, developers and local communities. In 
order to address the need for affordable housing the Council will seek a 
proportion of affordable homes from residential development in perpetuity. 
Affordable housing will be provided on-site, apart from in exceptional 
circumstances. 
 
Within the Principal and Key Service Centres housing development of 10 
dwellings (or 0.3 ha) or more will be required to make provision for 20% 
affordable housing. Given the level of need identified in the Cockermouth 
Housing Market Area provision will be made for 40% in this settlement.  
 
Outside of KSCs housing development of 5 dwellings (or 0.15ha) or more will 
be required to make provision for 25% affordable housing.  
 
The Council will require the provision of affordable housing to be in clusters 
throughout the development so as to be indistinguishable from open market 
dwellings. The Council will normally seek a tenure split of 75% social rented 
and 25% intermediate affordable units, but will take into consideration the 
identified local need and site specifics, including viability.  
 
The Council recognise that in some cases viability of housing sites can be 
marginal and therefore a flexible approach is required. Where the viability of 
schemes fall short of the policy requirements, the onus will be on the 
developer/ landowner to clearly demonstrate the circumstances justifying a 
lower affordable housing contribution or a different tenure mix. 
  
137. Policy S8 sets out the circumstances for securing affordable housing 
through open market development. Providing appropriate tenure and affordability are key to meeting housing needs and to developing 
mixed, balanced and inclusive communities. The need for and type of 
affordable housing will be regularly reviewed and monitored throughout 
the plan period, and evidence updated and maintained to inform 
application of policy. 
 138. The proportion of affordable housing sought in Policy S8 has been 
developed using the available evidence of need identified together with local viability and market evidence provided. Policy S8 states that 
within Principal and Key Service Centres qualifying proposals should 
make provision for 20% affordable housing, with the exception of 
Cockermouth where the level of provision is 40% given the high level of 
need, and the evidence of a more viable housing market. For the rest 
of Allerdale Local Plan Area the Council seeks to secure an affordable 
provision of 25%. Where the proportion of affordable housing sought 
will result in the provision of a part unit the number will be rounded up 
or down to provide the nearest whole unit.  
 Strategic Policies – Housing 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
64139. Policy seeks affordable housing contributions from housing 
development of over 10 dwellings in Principal and Key Service 
Centres, and from housing sites of 5 dwellings and above elsewhere. 
The approach is justified in the context of the scale of affordable 
housing need in the district, past delivery, coupled with the fact that 
small housing sites have been and will continue to be an important 
source of housing land supply. The Council considers that this context 
provides a strong justification for seeking contributions from small 
housing sites. 
 140. To assist in the creation of mixed, inclusive communities, affordable 
housing should be provided on-site as part of well-designed mixed tenure schemes. On sites where the proportion and tenure split results 
in the delivery of a small number of affordable dwellings, it may be 
necessary to determine the tenure provided based on local evidence 
such as parish based housing market assessments. In exceptional 
circumstances where site specific issues preclude the provision of on-
site affordable housing, or where provision can be better met on an 
alternative site in the local area, off-site contributions may be accepted 
as an alternative. 
 141. Affordable housing units will be dispersed throughout a development 
and of high quality design, so as to be indistinguishable from other development. Where the dwellings are being released to a Registered 
Provider they must meet that provider ’s own standards and/or those 
imposed by funding requirements. In determining the level of integration consideration will be given to the management and 
maintenance associated with the proposal, as well as the types of 
dwellings to be delivered. Guidance may be sought from the 
Registered Provider (or equivalent) to ensure resultant development 
meets their requirements.  
 142. The provision of affordable housing as part of open market housing 
development must be flexible to variations in market as well as site specific conditions over the plan period. It is therefore recognised that 
the provision of affordable housing can affect the profitability and the 
viability of housing development. In line with national policy the Council 
will work with developers where viability is compromised by policy 
requirements. In such cases the onus is on the applicant to 
demonstrate to the Council ’s satisfaction that the development is made 
unviable. A full financial appraisal will be required to support discussions.  
 143. An Affordable housing SPD will be produced by the Council to assist 
the delivery of affordable housing, providing details on policy requirements, definitions, viability assessment and appropriate 
development standards.

66S9  Rural Exceptions Sites 
 
144. The affordability of rural housing is a major problem in many parts of 
the Plan Area. In many rural areas property prices have increased to a level where people within the community, particularly young people and 
young families, can no longer afford them.  
 
S9  Rural Exceptions Sites 
 
The Council will support rural affordable housing exception sites in Local 
Service Centres and Rural Villages, provided that: 
 
a) The development will meet or assist in meeting an identified evidence 
based need for affordable housing in the area, which could not 
otherwise be met; 
b) The site is well-related and sympathetic to the form and character of 
the settlement, demonstrates good design and allows accessibility to 
community services and facilities within it; 
c) The scale is in keeping with the settlement ’s setting and its role in the 
hierarchy; 
d) The site is considered to be the most suitable to meet the identified 
need; 
e) The applicant enters into an appropriate legal agreement that ensures 
the accommodation will meet the need for local affordable housing in 
perpetuity. 
  
In some circumstances a small proportion of open market housing may be 
allowed where it can be shown that the scheme will deliver significant 
affordable housing and viability is a key constraint. 
 145. This policy provides an exception to the spatial strategy and provides 
the opportunity for the delivery of small numbers of rural housing on land outside, but adjoining the development limits of Local Service 
Centres and Limited Growth Villages, or adjacent to the existing built 
area of Infill/Rounding Off Villages, that may not fulfil all the criteria set 
out in policy S5. 
 146. In order to qualify as a rural exception site the development must meet 
a proven need for affordable housing in the parish, or the wider adjoining parishes, and accord with the criteria set out in Policy S9. 
Affordable housing on these rural exception sites should seek to 
address the needs of the local community and should be retained as 
part of the affordable housing stock in perpetuity. 
 147. In exceptional circumstances the Council may also consider a proposal 
for a rural exception development that includes cross-subsidy from open market sales on the same site. In such case the onus is on the 
applicant to demonstrate to the Council ’s satisfaction that the open Strategic Policies – Housing

67market element is essential to the viable delivery of the development. A 
full financial appraisal will be required to accompany any application.

68S10  Elderly Needs Housing 
 
148. Allerdale has a rapidly ageing population with a rate that is ahead of 
the national average. This has clear implications for the future delivery of housing over the plan period and therefore it is essential that 
planning policy be provided to ensure that the needs of older people 
are met over the plan period. The Local Plan aims to give all adults that 
require provision of care more choice and control over where and how 
they live and how they receive care. 
 
S10  Elderly Needs Housing 
 
The Council will encourage the provision of housing to maximise the 
independence and choice of older people and those members of the 
community with specific needs. When assessing the suitability of sites and/or 
proposals for the development of residential care homes, extra care housing 
and continuing care retirement communities, the Council will have regard to 
the following: 
 
a) The local need for the accommodation proposed; 
b) The ability of future residents to access essential services, including 
public transport and shops; 
c) Whether the proposal would result in an undue concentration of such 
provision in the area; 
d) Impact upon the local environment and the character of the area. 
 
In addition to the provision of specialist accommodation, the Council aims to 
ensure that older people are able to secure and sustain on-going 
independence either in their own homes or with the support of family 
members. To enable this, the Council will: 
 
e) Encourage the incorporation of Lifetime Homes Standards within all 
new residential development to enable new housing to be adaptable to 
meet household needs over time; 
f) Support evidence-based proposals for the creation of self-contained 
annexes and extensions to existing dwellings in order to accommodate, 
for example, an elderly or disabled dependent. 
 
Proposals for a self-contained annex should accommodate the functional 
need of the occupant(s), be proportionate in scale and remain ancillary and 
subservient to the main dwelling throughout the lifetime of its occupancy.  
Where appropriate, the Council will consider the use of planning conditions to 
restrict occupancy and subsequent sale.  
 
149. The policy seeks to promote and encourage the delivery of elderly 
needs accommodation throughout the Plan Area. This approach is a direct response to the issue of a rapidly ageing population across the 
Plan Area identified in the Local Plan evidence base. 
 Strategic Policies – Housing 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
69150. Currently there are no extra care housing facilities within Allerdale. 
Extra care housing helps older people to live as independently as 
possible, offering self-contained accommodation in a choice of tenures 
with access to 24-hour care on site. Cumbria County Council ’s Extra 
Care Strategy considers requirements around extra care housing, and planning policy will give consideration to its provision during the Site 
Allocations process.  
 151. Continuing care retirement communities, also have a role to play in the 
provision of care for older people. These developments are much larger in scale and also offer housing with independence, a range of 
facilities and activities that are not care related, alongside a range of 
care and support services.  
 152. Lifetime Homes are designed to provide flexibility to allow dwellings to 
meet the changing needs of their occupiers over time and enable people to stay in their own homes for longer. The provision of Lifetime 
Homes can play an important role in meeting future housing needs and 
forms a key strand of the overall strategy to meet the accommodation 
needs of older people. Furthermore the policy makes provision for 
residential annexes which also provides flexibility and choice in 
meeting the needs of the population.

70S11  Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Sites 
 
153. The creation of sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities is a key 
objective of Council.  In order to help meet the accommodation needs of all communities, the Local Plan makes provision for the Gypsy and 
Traveller community and Travelling Showpeople both in policy and by 
the evidence based allocation of suitable sites for the plan period.   
 152.154. The Cumbria Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment 
(2013) was undertaken by  the six Cumbrian District Councils and the National Park Authority. The study determined that across Cumbria 
there are a total of ten authorised Gypsy and Traveller sites which have 
a total of 132 pitches, two private temporary sites (14 pitches), two 
private transit sites (37 pitches) and three private unauthorised sites 
(13 pitches). Across the County there are also three permanent 
Showperson yards (39 plots) and one unauthorised yard (two plots). 
This reveals an increase in the overall provision in Cumbria since a 
similar study in 2008 and a similar level of authorised sites. At the time 
of the study in 2013 there were two private unauthorised sites within 
Allerdale, with a total of eight pitches. In addition, two private 
Showmen ’s yards were recorded, one authorised providing 24 plots 
and one unauthorised providing two plots.  
155. The study identified the need for 10 Permanent and 10 transit Gypsy 
and Traveller Pitches in the Allerdale Plan Area, in addition to the need 
for 21 Showperson Plots over the Plan Period.  In accordance with 
national policy the Local Plan will allocate sufficient suitable sites to 
meet the level of need identified by the Cumbria Gypsy and Traveller 
Accommodation Assessment (Figure X).

71 
To meet the identified long term needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople the Council will identify appropriate sites through the Site 
Allocations DPD.  In allocating sites, and for the purpose of considering 
planning applications, proposals should demonstrate that any development: 
 
a) Has safe and convenient access onto the road network, adequate 
parking and can be accessed by a reasonable range of transport 
modes; 
b) Is related to a defined settlement and is located within reasonable 
distance of community facilities including education and health 
provision; 
c) Would offer appropriate level of amenity and privacy to both site 
occupiers and neighbouring residents/occupiers; 
d) The scale of the site is in keeping with the local context, character and 
nearest settled community; 
e) Does not result in significant adverse effects on the landscape, Natura 
2000 sites, biodiversity and geodiversity; 
f) Conserves and enhances the historic environment and historic assets; 
g) Includes adequate landscaping, including screening to minimise the 
potential impact on the surrounding area; 
h) Can be served by the necessary utilities infrastructure; 
i) Includes a plan for the long term management of the site; and 
j) Does not result in industrial, retail, commercial, or commercial storage 
activities apart from the proven need for storage required in relation to 
a travelling circus or show. 
 
 
 
156. Policy S11 sets out the criteria that will be used when allocating 
traveller sites, and for the consideration of planning applications. The Council will aim to ensure that any new provision is provided in a 
location that suits the living and working patterns of the Gypsy and 
Traveller community as well as ensuring reasonable proximity and 
access to community facilities and services.  
 157. The Council will continue to work in partnership with other districts in 
Cumbria to maintain an up-to-date evidence base that will inform targets and site selection in the Site Allocations DPD. This evidence 
will be kept up-to-date and used to ensure that the full accommodation 
needs are met over the whole plan period.

S12  Land and Premises 
 
158. Allerdale ’s main employment areas are found in and around the main 
towns, with notable local sites located throughout the area including in 
smaller settlements and rural locations. A clear hierarchy of premises is 
on offer across the Plan Area. Lillyhall is a prime employment and 
business location in West Cumbria, popular for inward investment and 
large scale occupiers. It offers a mixed range of high quality industrial 
and commercial premises, as well as small-scale offices and mixed 
quality industrial and commercial premises. Elsewhere in the Plan Area 
high quality office locations are located at Cockermouth and Dovenby 
Hall Estates.  
 159. Further important employment sites are located in Workington, 
clustered around the Port of Workington and Derwent Howe. Local industrial units are also available at Glasson in Maryport however the quality in these locations can be low. Modern units of reasonable 
quality can be found in Wigton, with further locally important industrial 
sites located around the Port of Silloth.  Units are also located in other 
rural areas, but some have poor infrastructure and other constraints. 
 
S12  Land and Premises 
 
The Council will plan proactively to support sustainable economic 
development by ensuring sufficient quality employment land is available to 
accommodate current and future needs identified in S3. The Council will 
ensure a diversity of quality sites is available to meet new and existing 
business needs across the Plan Area and as such, Strategic, Business Park 
and Local Needs Sites will be set out in the Site Allocations DPD.  
 
Existing employment sites and allocations will be retained and safeguarded 
until these are reviewed through the site allocations process. During the 
review the Council will consider whether the sites meet, or can be improved to 
meet the needs of modern business and consider opportunities to de-allocate 
sites of poor quality which may be better suited to alternative uses. The 
Council will develop robust criteria in order to review site suitability and where 
de-allocation is suggested priority will be given to alternative uses in 
sequence.  
 
The Council will support development, redevelopment and change of use 
proposals within employment sites as defined on the Proposals Map, 
providing that the proposal is included within the use class B1, B2, B8 or 
appropriate Sui generis (employment). Proposals for office B1(a) will be 
directed to defined town centres, and will be expected to satisfy the 
appropriate tests outlined in national policy to confirm they cannot be located 
as such. Proposals out with these uses will only be permitted where they also 
accord with other plan policies. 
 Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
74The Plan will support the upgrade, extension or intensification of existing 
business where the scale and use are appropriate for the local area and the 
proposal does not result in overriding adverse impacts on the surrounding 
area. 
 
Proposals outside allocated employment land or that are currently used for 
employment uses will be discouraged and developments directed in sequence 
to existing allocations and then previously developed land within the 
settlement. Where proposals are able to demonstrate why they cannot be 
appropriately located, they will be considered on their merit taking into 
account local impacts and other Plan policies.  
 
160. Policy S12 follows national guidance and ensures that enough quality 
land is available to meet the future employment requirements identified in S3 over the plan period. It ensures that consideration is given to 
provision of all the Plan Area ’s employment needs, including local 
sites. As a result a hierarchy of available sites will be produced to help raise the quality of employment land on offer by prioritising investment 
and enabling provision of public support for the appropriate sites.  
 161. To encourage the sustainable economic growth of Allerdale, the 
Council will allocate sufficient quality employment land to accommodate current and future needs of new and existing businesses 
according to the spatial strategy. The Council will provide a diversity of 
sites to meet different business needs such as strategic, business park 
and local needs across the Plan Area. 
 162. This policy approach underpins many of the strategic objectives of the 
Plan, such as providing support and enhancement for town centres and directing development of offices to the most sustainable locations. 
Policy, in the first instance, directs office development to town centres 
as the key and most sustainable location for quality office development 
following national policy and the conclusions of the Employment Land 
and Premises Study (2008) and Update (2012). Where proposals are 
able to satisfy the appropriate sequential tests outlined in national 
policy they will be supported at the next most sustainable location.  
 163. The Employment Land Update (2012) concludes that Allerdale has an 
excess of employment land with approximately 100 hectares allocated compared to a requirement for at least 60 hectares to 2030. The study 
concludes that as a result there is the potential to de-allocate some 
under performing sites, and consider alternative uses. However, it is 
important to retain employment sites that currently make a contribution 
to local employment, as well as retaining important or valuable sites for 
future employment uses. The policy ensures that there is a considered 
review of employment sites in the Site Allocations DPD and only sites 
that no longer meet the needs of modern business, or are of poor 
quality and have little prospect of being developed or improved are 
removed. Further detail on the requirements for non-employment 
development on allocated employment land is outlined in DM3. Strategic Policies – Economy

164. A criteria based approach will be used to review the existing 
employment land stock within an employment Site Allocations DPD, priority could be given to alternative uses in sequence.  
 165. The policy also supports the intensification and expansion of existing 
businesses subject to the requirements of DM4.

166. A key objective of the Local Plan is to facilitate Allerdale ’s economic 
strategy to ensure that we successfully grow and diversify the Borough ’s economy. ‘Britain ’s Energy Coast; a Masterplan for West 
Cumbria ’ was published in 2007. It aims to provide a focused strategy 
for both public and private sector to build on the area ’s existing 
expertise in the nuclear industry and deliver the national priorities of tackling climate change and securing the nation ’s energy supply, while 
also transforming and diversifying the West Cumbria economy. 
 
167. West Cumbria is the UK ’s most important location for nuclear and 
related activities, including environmental remediation, engineering and decommissioning. The nuclear industry provides around 37 % of West 
Cumbria ’s Gross Value Added (GVA) and accounts for 22% of jobs in 
the area. The aim of the Energy Coast Masterplan is to capitalise on the £8billion investment in new nuclear facilities and maximise the 
opportunity to diversify in to other nuclear and energy sectors.  
 168. The West Cumbria Economic Blueprint was published in 2012 and sets 
out Britain ’s Energy Coast ’s vision for the development of the local 
economy over the next 15 years. At the centre is the Energy Coast 
Innovation Zone (IZone), which provides a focus for growth and 
investment along the coast of West Cumbria.  
 
 S13  Energy Coast Innovation Zone  
 
The Council will work with partners to maximise the economic opportunities 
identified in the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint by supporting the Energy 
Coast Innovation Zone through: 
 
a) Allocating land in line with its aims and objectives; 
b) Prioritising important land for investment and maintaining a portfolio of 
high quality sites; 
c) Supporting tourist development of Allerdale ’s harbours; 
d) Playing a key role in delivering supporting infrastructure, such as road 
and other transport upgrades, Port of Workington, energy, broadband 
and community infrastructure as well as an appropriate stock of 
housing; 
e) Supporting development that contributes towards improving education, 
training and skills; 
f) Supporting other key projects identified in the implementation plan. 
 
In recognition of the importance of key sites to achieving the aims and 
objectives of the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint the Local Plan will 
support and encourage the appropriate development of the Lillyhall Industrial 
Estate and Port of Workington. 
 
Lillyhall Estate  Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
77 
Lillyhall will make a key contribution to employment in West Cumbria with an 
emphasis on integration of industry, commerce, research and development, 
education and training. Lillyhall will continue to be the focus for advanced 
manufacturing and clean tech businesses, while facilitating the application of 
knowledge and skills in responding to the challenges of sustainable energy 
production and low carbon solutions. 
 
The Council will promote and encourage the continued development of 
Lillyhall as a key employment site with a focus on: 
 
· A broad mix of large scale prestige occupiers; 
· Encouraging research and development, innovation and business 
clusters; 
· Opportunities from new and existing education, training and skills sites; 
· Promoting the refurbishment and redevelopment of existing uses; 
· Improving the public realm and green infrastructure. 
 
Development according with the Lillyhall Master plan and future investment in 
high quality design and public realm is supported. In order to maintain the 
importance and draw of Lillyhall, incremental small scale development will be 
discouraged and once allocated, the release of employment land for non 
employment uses (or uses of land that are not consistent with the aims and 
objectives of this site) will be strongly resisted.  
 
Port of Workington 
 
The Port of Workington has a key role as a strategic gateway and economic 
driver for the West Cumbrian economy in the future, with a particular focus on 
the energy and transportation sectors. The Council will work closely with the 
Port Authority and partners to deliver the appropriate infrastructure and 
conditions to support future uses and enable the Port to fulfil its vision. The 
Council will ensure that future transport routes are safeguarded and any 
development within and around the site does not prejudice the Port ’s 
continued development.  
 
Where necessary the Site Allocations DPD will provide site-specific details to 
ensure that land is available to meet the aims and objectives of the Port.  
 
169. Policy S13 recognises the importance of fulfilling the aspirations of the 
Energy Coast in achieving sustainable economic growth, by transforming and diversifying the West Cumbria economy. It focuses 
on delivery of the Energy Coast Innovation Zone as a key to 
implementing the Economic Blueprint for West Cumbria. 
 170. Although the boundaries of the Innovation Zone are flexible and not 
‘hard and fast ’ it is intended to cover key sites in West Cumbria such as 
Workington and Whitehaven town centres, the Port of Workington, 
Lillyhall, Westlakes Science and Technology Park, Sellafield, the 
Moorside (NuGen) site and the Low Level Waste Repository (Drigg). Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
78Key to achieving the aims and objectives is ensuring that a high quality 
portfolio of employment sites is maintained with a focus on the key 
sites of Westlakes Science and Technology Park, Lillyhall and the Port 
of Workington.   
 171. Key evidence emphasises the importance of these sites to the 
economic future of West Cumbria as well as the need to maintain the differentiation and focus of each site. The complementary nature of 
these important sites is key to meeting the challenges and 
opportunities set out in the Economic Blueprint and as such Policy S13 
sets out the roles of the Port of Workington and Lillyhall as being 
distinct from that of Westlakes Science and Technology Park in 
Copeland. 
 172. It is vital that in the development of these key employment sites 
appropriate importance and due weight is given to other plan polices, especially the impact on the nature conservation features, biodiversity 
and geodiversity, including Natura 2000 sites, habitats and species. An 
Assessment of Likely Significant Effect should be carried out on any 
developments with potential for impacting directly or indirectly on 
Natura 2000 sites. Appropriate Assessment will be required for any 
development with a likely significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where 
proposals have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites, that 
cannot be made acceptable through mitigation, they should not be 
allowed to go ahead. Where mitigation is proposed, measures should 
be clearly defined and where appropriate secured by planning 
obligations. 
 173. In addition to the more strategic role of Lillyhall and the Port it is also 
important that the Council allocate sufficient quality land over the Plan Area to ensure the economic prosperity of the whole of Allerdale and to 
ensure the effects of the Innovation Zone ripple out as widely as 
possible. As such the Site Allocations DPD will provide a basket of 
sites throughout the Plan Area as well as the sites directly related to 
the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint or its Implementation Plan. 
Policy S12 provides more details on the framework for this process. 
 174. In order to achieve the economic objectives of the Blueprint it is vital 
that there is a timely provision of infrastructure to enable and support growth. Improvements to transport infrastructure are vital to underpin 
the investment in nuclear decommissioning, potential new nuclear 
projects, as well as encouraging spin off activities and diversity of the 
West Cumbrian economy. Several key projects are identified such as 
improvements to access to the Port of Workington, the railway and the 
A595.  Policy S22 and S23 provides support and the necessary 
protection of land for these schemes.  Support is also provided in this 
policy for other infrastructure such as broadband, housing, education 
and skills which are key to making the Blueprint a reality.

80S14  Rural Economy 
 
175. Creating sustainable rural communities is a key objective of the Local 
Plan. A careful balance needs to be achieved in supporting and 
promoting proposals that assist the economic sustainability of 
communities, whilst protecting and enhancing the environment. 
Enabling appropriately scaled growth of new and existing rural 
enterprise, is therefore central to growing the rural economy.  
 
S14  Rural Economy  
 
The Council is committed to supporting the economic prosperity and 
sustainability of rural communities by enabling appropriately scaled economic 
development.  
 
New Business Uses in Rural Areas 
 
Encouragement will be given to new business uses of appropriate size and 
nature within the settlement hierarchy. Including: 
 
a) The provision of small employment units that serve local and 
community needs, and the development of multi user ‘workhubs ’ within 
Local Service Centres and Rural Villages;  
b) New and innovative methods of working such as ‘live work’ ; combining 
small flexible business and residential space in to a single unit.  
 
In the open countryside new development will only be permitted where the 
proposal involves the appropriate re-use of rural buildings, or: 
 
c) In the case of a ‘live work’  unit, as an extension to an existing dwelling; 
d) Has a locational requirement, such as an equestrian development.  
 
Expansion of Existing Rural Businesses 
 
Proposals for the expansion of existing businesses will be supported outside 
of the settlement hierarchy where it can be demonstrated that it is an 
established business and it is not viable to relocate within the settlement 
hierarchy, and proposals; 
 
e) Re-use existing buildings wherever possible; 
f) Which seek to expand the business outside of the existing curtilage 
must demonstrate that that it is essential to the needs of the business; 
g) That involve any new buildings or extensions must be of appropriate 
scale and nature to their location;  
 
Farm Development 
 
In order to support the continued economic viability of farming and other land 
based enterprises, the Council will support proposals; Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
81 
a) For the diversification of activities that are of a scale and nature 
appropriate to the location;  
b) For appropriately designed and related agricultural development and 
buildings. 
 
In all cases development should not have significant adverse effect on nature 
conservation features, biodiversity and geodiversity, including Natura 2000 
sites, habitats and species, and should accord with all other plan policies.   
 
176. Policy S14 supports the spatial strategy and seeks to ensure that the 
majority of growth is directed towards the larger settlements throughout the Plan Area. In order to support job creation and prosperity in rural 
areas the Council will support appropriate sized new enterprises within 
Local Service Centres and Rural Villages as defined in the settlement 
hierarchy. Promoting appropriate growth within existing towns and 
villages improves the sustainability of the lower tier settlements whilst 
protecting the open countryside from unfettered development.  
 177. Particular encouragement is given to the provision of businesses which 
serve local and community needs and to workhubs which can offer many benefits to traditional office based models of working. A workhub 
is “an office when needed ” space for people running small, home-
based or start-up businesses, who need a flexible business base. They provide a high quality workspace which can be used flexibly, sharing 
costs and facilities assisting innovation and sustainable economic 
development within rural communities.    
 178. Policy S14 also encourages other new work practices such as live/work 
units within settlements, for example by extending existing dwellings or re-use of redundant/underused buildings in the open countryside. 
Live/work unit is the name given in planning to small-scale 
developments which are designed for dual use including both 
residential and business floorspace. Live/work is a formal division of 
space and is distinct from ‘home working ’ which is a residential unit 
with ancillary or informal working space. These units are attractive for business start ups and growing enterprises as they can provide more 
affordable work space than traditional units. Furthermore, there are key 
sustainability benefits to working and living in one location and as such 
the Council supports their appropriate development subject to Plan 
policies.  
 179. In order to support the sustainable growth and expansion of the rural 
economy the Council recognises that in certain circumstances it may be appropriate to facilitate economic growth in the open countryside.  
Policy restricts development in the open countryside to proposals that 
re-use rural buildings in compliance with Policy S31, where the 
retention and reuse of vacant or derelict rural buildings is seen as 
favourable. To encourage the retention of small and medium sized 
businesses in rural areas, proposals for appropriate extensions and Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
82business expansion will be supported, subject to environmental impact 
and requirements of Policies S14 and DM4. In order to provide further 
protection for the countryside proposals must demonstrate that the 
business is established and that it is not viable to re-locate to within the 
settlement hierarchy.  
 180. Policy S14 also encourages rural enterprises which have a clear need 
to be located in a rural location, such as some tourism, agricultural and equestrian proposals. The Council recognises changes in the 
agricultural and land based industries over recent years, and therefore 
this policy provides support for the principle of farm diversification and 
support for the sustainable growth of agricultural businesses. More 
detailed policy relating to diversification of agricultural and land based 
businesses is provided in DM5. The requirements for equestrian 
developments are detailed in DM6. This approach offers support to the 
rural economy, and allows room for growth whilst protecting the 
countryside from unfettered developments. 
 181. Certain types of development have to be located in the countryside, 
such as buildings or other structures used in connection with agriculture. Not all agricultural development requires planning 
permission, however it is recognised that often these buildings may 
have to be large to meet with agricultural requirements. Given the 
potential scale of development and the rural location it is essential that 
policy ensures buildings or structures have a minimum impact on the 
countryside.

83S15  Education and Skills 
 
182. Raising the level of attainment, skills, training and increasing access to 
life long learning is vital to both raising the economic success and the 
quality of life within Allerdale. In order to achieve key economic aims 
and objectives there needs to be a workforce equipped with the right 
skills to meet opportunities for economic growth and innovation.  
 
S15  Education and Skills  
 
The Local Plan has an important role in raising the quality of life of the current 
and future population within Allerdale. Raising educational attainment together 
with diversifying and increasing the skill base will help the area become a 
more attractive area to invest, locate and grow business.  
 
The Council will work with partners to support and encourage development 
that contributes towards raising the level of education, skills, opportunities and 
innovation. Development of education and skills will be promoted through: 
 
a) Supporting the development of higher and further educational facilities; 
such as the continued development of the Energy Coast Campus;  
b) Proactive planning policies to support the Energy Coast Innovation 
Zone and the integration of innovation and research and development 
together with skills, education and training;  
c) Encouraging new skills development and commercial opportunities with 
further education partners in support of economic objectives while 
capitalising on current resources; 
d) Enhancing enterprise and training and skills for the local workforce by 
working in partnership with education facilities and employers to 
promote lifelong learning and skills development;  
e) Working with partners to proactively plan for the provision of schools in 
the right location and of sufficient size for future population 
requirements. 
 
 
183. This policy helps deliver the plan ’s strategic objectives and is important 
in the sustainable economic development of Allerdale.  It seeks to 
support new opportunities offered by the Energy Coast and as set out 
in the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint, while also providing the 
skills, education and learning to help foster successful diversification, 
growth and innovation across Allerdale ’s economic sectors.  
 184. The Energy Coast Campus includes an alliance of institutions including 
The University of Cumbria, University of Central Lancashire, GEN II, Lakes College, The University of Manchester and Centre of Leadership 
Performance (NMP) with an aim of delivering targeted education and 
training to equip people with the right skills needed to take advantage 
of the major opportunities arising from the Energy Coast and other 
sectors, now and in the future. Through key sites located at Lillyhall Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
84and Westlakes Science and Technology Park (Copeland Borough 
Council) valuable training and education opportunities will be 
encouraged and supported in order to capitalise on these assets and 
provide the skilled workforce to meet economic and social goals across 
West Cumbria. 
 185. The policy provides support and encouragement to the development of 
educational facilities and skills developments, recognising the need to improve Allerdale ’s skill base to develop and diversify the economy. A 
key element of this is achieved by working with partners in the provision and enhancement of sustainable educational facilities (both 
schools and further education facilities).

85S16  Town Centres and Retail 
 
186. Town centres are important places for communities as they provide a 
focal point for business activity, social interaction and diversity.  Town centres have an important role in achieving the Council ’s economic 
objectives as vibrant and viable centres and have the potential to attract investment and visitors to the area whilst improving the quality 
of life for residents.  
 187. The West Cumbria Retail Study (2009) identifies a significant capacity 
for future retail development within Allerdale over the plan period. This policy sets out the Council ’s strategic approach to development of retail 
and mixed uses within existing town centres. 
 
S16  Town Centre and Retail 
 
The Council will promote the vitality and viability of town centres within the 
Plan Area by encouraging a diverse mix of uses in high quality environments 
which attract a wide range of people at different times of the day, and which 
are safe and accessible to all.  
 
The Council will support retail development in accordance with the following 
hierarchy of centres.  
 
Principal Centre: Workington 
Key Service Centres: Maryport, Cockermouth, Wigton, Silloth, Aspatria 
Local Service Centres – as defined within the settlement hierarchy. 
 
Proposals for main town centre uses will be expected to be located within the 
existing centres. Retail development will be of a scale commensurate with the 
settlement ’s role and function, and will not undermine the balance of the 
hierarchy. Applications for main town centre uses outside of these defined 
centres will be refused where the applicant has not demonstrated compliance 
with the sequential approach to site selection, or where there is clear 
evidence that the proposal would have a significant adverse impact on the 
vitality and viability of a nearby centre. 
 
Developments which promote diverse and vibrant evening economies within 
town centres are encouraged where proposals would not have a harmful 
effect on the amenity of residents or the local area. 
 
Town centre development will conserve and enhance the character and 
distinctiveness of each town centre in terms of high quality design and 
materials and will ensure the architectural and historical assets of the centre, 
and their wider settings, are protected and enhanced. 
 
The Council will support the operation of markets of appropriate scale and 
character within the hierarchy. 
 Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
86Town centre development will be expected to increase the attractiveness of 
the built and natural environment through improvements to the public realm 
and green infrastructure network. 
 
The Council will promote the accessibility of towns and villages and support 
the improvement of public transport links and the cycle and footpath network. 
 
The Council will seek to preserve and enhance the distinctive character of 
Rural Villages and the sustainability of small communities by supporting the 
creation, improvement and protection of small retail and community facilities 
which promote social and cultural interaction and provide for people ’s day to 
day needs. Support will be given to the improvement of existing, and the 
creation of new facilities which are of appropriate character and scale and 
where the proposal is justified and is compatible with its location.  
 
188. This policy aims to promote a robust and complementary hierarchy of 
centres by directing the majority of large retail and leisure developments to the most sustainable location (the Principal Centre) 
whilst allowing smaller Key Service Centres to remain competitive and 
flexible to changing needs.  
 189. Workington is identified as West Cumbria ’s Principal Retail Centre and 
accordingly will be the focus of the majority of large retail, leisure, cultural and office investment. Workington has a large catchment area 
and is represented by four of the leading supermarket chains. Whilst 
Workington is comparable in size to the neighbouring town of 
Whitehaven it performs a complementary role, providing a modern 
destination for leading comparison retail brands alongside the attractive 
historical centre and independent shops that Whitehaven offers. 
 190. The Key Service Centres of Maryport, Cockermouth, Wigton, Silloth 
and Aspatria perform supportive roles to their catchment areas, offering key services to the local and visitor populations. At the current time 
only Cockermouth is represented by one of the leading supermarkets 
which has been identified by the Retail Study as significantly 
‘overtrading ’.  The study also shows that the towns of Maryport and 
Wigton both suffer significant levels of convenience shopping ‘leakage ’ 
to Workington and Carlisle, suggesting a future need for additional 
convenience goods floorspace in Cockermouth, Maryport and Wigton. 
 191. Local Service Centres and Rural Villages play vital roles in supporting 
communities by providing access to small scale retail, leisure and cultural facilities which provide for peoples day to day needs and social 
interaction.  The enhancement and protection of these facilities is a key 
priority and are protected under Policy S26. 
 192. As part of the Town Centre Reviews (2012) the existing boundaries of 
each of the Principal and Key Service Centres have been reviewed and revised as considered appropriate to allow growth and adaptation over 
the plan period. The revised town centre boundaries are shown in Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
87Appendix 4 and the Proposals Map. As shopping habits change, and 
with the increase of internet shopping, the retail core of some town 
centres may diminish over time. It is important therefore that these 
centres are allowed to adapt to reflect their role as the social and 
cultural heart of the community and a wider mix of uses, particularly 
leisure and cultural uses, are encouraged and accommodated within 
existing centre boundaries. 
 193. The Council will actively support a broad and varied mix of uses to 
promote the vitality and viability of town centres within the defined boundaries, having regard for the protection of primary and secondary 
frontages where defined. Main town centre uses will be applied in line 
with national policy with the inclusion of medical clinics, which it is 
considered, also contribute to the sustainability of centres. National 
policy recognises that residential properties can complement the 
function of town centres, particularly through the use of vacant upper 
floor units or high density redevelopment schemes. The Council will 
seek to ensure an appropriate balance is maintained between the 
protection of town centre viability, the promotion of the evening 
economy and the amenity of residential properties.  
 194. Main town centre uses will be expected to be located within the defined 
boundaries in line with the sequential approach, set out in Policy DM9. Where the quantitative or qualitative capacity for retail or leisure 
development cannot physically be accommodated within the limits of 
the defined town centres, suitable sites will be identified on the edge of 
centres as part of the Site Allocations process.

88S17  Tourism, Coastal and Countryside Recreation 
 
195. The outstanding scenery, coasts and countryside of Allerdale are a 
major attraction to visitors to the area.  A strategic priority of the Local Plan is to promote economic growth by supporting key tourism 
activities such as outdoor recreation, improvement of accommodation, 
food and drink production and improvements to the historic 
environment. The Council will seek to promote and diversify the 
tourism economy whilst prioritising the conservation and protection of 
sensitive landscapes, habitats, species and biodiversity. 
 
S17  Tourism, Coastal and Countryside Recreation 
 
Proposals for new tourism attractions and facilities will be expected to be 
located sequentially as follows: 
 
a) Principal, Key and Local Service Centres; 
b) Rural Villages and other locations where the attraction has a locational 
dependence upon an existing heritage or environmental asset and is 
consistent with environmental objectives. 
 
In sensitive coastal areas and countryside, any new tourism development 
should be of an appropriate design and scale in keeping with the rural 
character of the area. Development should not result in significant adverse 
effect (either directly or indirectly) on the coastal or countryside landscape, 
wildlife or habitats, particularly within the Solway Coast AONB AONB, and 
Natura 2000 sites, and should conserve and enhance  historic assets 
including the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site. 
 
Support will be given to measures which would relieve tourist pressures on 
the most sensitive areas of the Borough and which would protect vulnerable 
habitats, biodiversity, landscapes and historical assets. 
 
Proposals will be encouraged which support key tourism projects and 
destinations which have the transformational potential to significantly improve 
the social and economic prosperity of the area, such as: 
 
i) Maryport Harbour 
ii) Derwent Forest 
iii) Derwent Valley 
iv) Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site 
v) Solway Coast AONB 
 
Proposals which offer new or improved visitor accommodation will be 
supported within Principal, Key and Local Service Centres. 
 
Tourism accommodation will also be supported in other locations where it has 
no significantly harmful impact (directly or indirectly) on the countryside or Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
89coast in terms of landscape quality or ecological / biodiversity value, is of 
appropriate scale and design and it: 
 
c) Forms part of a farm diversification scheme; 
d) Forms part of an extension proposal for an existing hotel or guest 
house and it will enhance or maintain the viability of the business; 
e) Forms part of an extension, realignment or relocation of an existing 
camping or caravan site to a less sensitive location which would reduce 
the impact on nature conservation areas and the local environment; or 
f) Is part of a scheme to upgrade ancillary facilities at an existing holiday 
park or camping or caravan site. 
 
Proposals for new static caravan sites or parks within the Solway Coast 
AONB will be strongly resisted. Proposals for all holiday accommodation 
which fall outside the above criteria will be refused. 
 
Proposals to remove residential occupancy conditions on camping, caravan 
and chalet sites will be assessed against policies for provision of new 
housing. 
 
Proposals which involve the loss or change of use of a tourism business to a 
non-tourism business will only be granted where the applicant has 
demonstrated that the business is no longer fit for purpose or financially viable 
through a robust marketing exercise as set out by the Council.  
 
196. The Local Plan area covers the whole of the Borough outside of the 
Lake District National Park. 
 
197. Tourism provides an important source of income to the towns and 
communities of Allerdale in the form of visitor spending on accommodation, food and drink, recreation activities and shopping, and 
also to the local business supply chain and wholesalers.   
 198. Allerdale ’s greatest tourism assets lie within its natural environment, 
with the majority of visitors to the area considering the scenery and landscape to be the most important factor in the enjoyment of their trip.  
The coastline in particular offers excellent opportunities for outdoor 
recreational activities and sports and is host to a number of national 
events such as kite surfing and golfing championships. 
 199. As well as being the area ’s most valuable tourism asset, the unspoilt 
countryside and coastlines are also the area ’s most sensitive resource.  
Much of the Plan Area is protected by international, national, regional 
and local designations such as the Natura 2000, World Heritage, 
Solway Coast AONB, SSSI and County Wildlife sites.  Whilst the desire 
to develop the tourism industry is high, the priority must always be to 
conserve and protect the natural and historic environment from 
detrimental development.  This presents an even bigger challenge 
when considering that some of the area ’s key tourism destinations are 
difficult to access via public transport, placing a high dependency upon Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
90private car use.  The Council will therefore strive to seek a balance 
between the aspirations for economic prosperity with the need to 
conserve and protect the natural environment.  The Council will co-
ordinate between partners such as Cumbria Tourism, the AONB 
Partnership, Natural England and English Heritage to support their 
plans and deliver a joint strategy to promote sustainable tourism across 
the Plan Area. All development within the AONB will be in accordance 
with the Solway Coast AONB Management Plan and within Hadrian ’s 
Wall World Heritage Site, the Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site 
Management Plan.  
 
200. An Assessment of Likely Significant Effect should be carried out on any 
developments with potential for impacting directly or indirectly on Natura 2000 sites. This will consider in-combination effects of other 
proposals and developments along the Solway Firth. Appropriate 
Assessment will be required for any development with a likely 
significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where proposals have a 
significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites that cannot be made 
acceptable through mitigation, they should not be allowed to go ahead. 
Where mitigation is proposed, measures should be clearly defined and 
where appropriate secured by planning obligations. 
 
201. As part of a managed approach to promoting sustainable tourism, the 
Council will seek to ensure that development is located within the most sustainable locations in accordance with the spatial strategy.  
Proposals for tourism attractions and accommodation will be expected 
to be located sequentially in Principal, Key and Local Service Centres 
before other locations will be considered.  Proposals for developments 
which seek to attract visitors for outdoor recreation activities in the 
coast or countryside will be encouraged towards Key and Local Service 
Centres. These settlements can provide complementary facilities and 
amenities and will relieve visitor pressures on the AONB, World 
Heritage Site and Natura 2000 sites, as well as being visitor 
destinations in their own right. 
 202. The Council will encourage development which will promote tourism 
activities in the following sectors, which have been identified as being significant areas of opportunity for the Plan Area, and Western Lake 
District, tourism sectors: 
 
· The improvement in provision and quality of accommodation 
stock.  There is currently a significant shortage of quality 
accommodation facilities within the Plan Area, particularly in 
north Allerdale for those wishing to visit the AONB, World 
Heritage Site or golf clubs. 
· The improved provision of business accommodation and 
conferencing facilities.  As part of the Council ’s strategy to 
promote the Innovation Zone there is a need to significantly 
improve the accommodation stock, conference and leisure Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
91facilities available to business people visiting the area, as well 
as local businesses hosting events. 
· The promotion of the local food and drinks industry.  Cumbria is 
becoming a well known destination for ‘food tourism ’ with visitors 
attracted to the high number of farmers, producers, suppliers, 
restaurants and hotels offering distinctive local produce.  The 
success of the ‘Taste Cumbria ’ festival has highlighted the 
demand and opportunities for local businesses to expand in this area, particularly rural businesses and farm diversification 
schemes. 
· Outdoor recreation and adventure activities.  Allerdale has an 
abundance of outstanding coast and countryside which offers a huge range of opportunities for visitors to enjoy walking, cycling, 
sailing, kite surfing and a variety of other adventure activities.  
‘Adventure recreation ’ has recently become one of the most 
successful tourism sectors in the UK, attracting a wide range of visitors. The Council will support proposals for facilities and 
infrastructure to support the outdoor recreation market where 
they are appropriately located and in line with environmental 
objectives.   
 
 
203. Support will be given to proposals and initiatives which will increase the 
attractiveness of the area to visitors whilst improving environmental conditions, infrastructure and social facilities for the resident population 
such as improvements to sea bathing quality and provision of sports, 
leisure and open space.  The Council will support proposals for 
improvements to the cycling and public rights of way networks, 
including improved access for those with disabilities, and ensure that 
existing paths and routes are protected and do not suffer degradation.  
The Council will support the enhancement and protection of the 
England Coast Path which seeks to establish an unbroken walking 
route along the coast of England and to provide enhanced and secure 
access to the coastal margin.

93S18  Derwent Forest 
 
204. The Derwent Forest site, at Broughton Moor, is a former Royal Navy 
Armaments Depot, which at 425 hectares is one of the largest derelict sites in the North West of England. The site has lain largely redundant 
since 1992. 
 205. The site is strategically placed between the Lake District and the West 
Cumbria coast and provides a unique opportunity to establish West Cumbria as a visitor destination in its own right as well as capitalising 
on visitor numbers to the National Park. The role of Derwent Forest in 
the regeneration of West Cumbria is recognised in a number of key 
strategies including the Energy Coast Masterplan, sub regional spatial 
strategy, Cumbria Tourism Destination Plan and Cumbria Economic 
Plan. 
 206. The site has been closed to public access for over 50 years. Over that 
time, it has developed an environmental character with a wide variety of species of plants and animals, and hosts many historic assets and 
features. These characteristics will need to be given consideration 
before any development takes place. Additionally, given the nature of 
the site ’s historic use as an armament storage facility there are a 
number of ground and decontamination works that need to be undertaken before new development can take place.  
 207. Given the scale, nature and strategic potential of the Derwent Forest 
site the Allerdale Local Plan includes a stand-alone exception policy to guide development over the plan period, recognising the types of 
acceptable uses and the exceptional nature of the site.  
 
S18  Derwent Forest 
 
In assessing any proposals for the use and/or redevelopment of Derwent 
Forest, the Council recognises the need to secure a mix of uses for the 
project to be viable to enable the restoration of the site to an appropriate level 
of use. The Council will therefore support the following uses either individually 
or in combination: 
 
· Large scale leisure development of a predominately “open ” nature; 
· Hotel/restaurant and conference centre; 
· A Festival site; 
· Tourist related development including accommodation to meet a 
variety of needs, a visitor centre, model farm, forestry and agricultural 
uses, public art initiatives and appropriate ancillary facilities sufficient to 
service tourist requirements only; 
· Residential development, sufficient to achieve the viability of the project 
and secure the overall restoration of the site; 
· Eco-Hamlet; Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
94· Institution(s) standing in their own grounds, to include education but to 
exclude prison uses; 
· Renewable energy schemes of an appropriate scale and character; 
· Small scale employment space ancillary to the main uses of the site; 
· Infrastructure to support the development. 
 
Other proposals considered as ancillary to the main uses, listed above, will be 
considered if they make a positive contribution to the viability of the overall 
scheme, provided such uses are supported by appropriate evidence. 
 
Any proposal will be expected to; 
 
a) Provide a comprehensive masterplan for the site, including phasing, to be 
submitted as part of any planning application to ensure delivery of a 
coherent solution for the site and avoid a piecemeal approach; 
b) Demonstrate the social, economic and environmental benefits it will bring 
to the local economy and community; 
c) Provide a whole site solution and incorporate significant elements of public 
access, including the continuation and enhancement of the C2C cycle 
route through the site; 
d) Give consideration to sustainable modes of transport that will form an 
important part of any transport assessment/plan required to support 
proposals; 
e) Ensure the siting, design and scale of all elements of the proposed 
scheme are appropriate, and will safeguard and enhance important 
landscape features, valuable historic assets, existing wildlife species and 
habitats and demonstrate how the wider landscape context has been 
taken into account. The proposal will seek to minimise and where 
appropriate mitigate adverse impacts; 
f) Ensure that off-site infrastructure is adequate to accommodate any 
proposals and that the site is remediated to an acceptable level for the 
proposed end use. 
 
208. The key aspirations of the policy are to encourage economic growth 
and stimulate employment leading to sustainable long-term development, sympathetic to the environment and the characteristics of 
the site.  Policy identifies a range of uses that may be suitable for the 
site; these include leisure uses that are predominately open in nature, 
hotel, tourist development, such as golf courses, or cycle tracks. Policy 
S18 also suggests that an Eco-Hamlet may be appropriate. An Eco-
Hamlet is a mixed use development designed with the aim of meeting a 
high level of environmental and ecologically beneficial criteria, and 
creating a strong community spirit. Any dwellings delivered would be 
considered alongside the comprehensive site proposals.  
 209. Renewable energy schemes, of an appropriate scale, are also seen as 
a suitable use.  
 
210. In order to enable the development, part of the site has potential to be 
suitable for new housing. To facilitate the investigation of the scope Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
95and potential of the site, and to support the development of a 
masterplan and appropriate site assessments, a limited amount of 
residential development will be supported as a stand alone 
development. Any proposal will have to demonstrate how it will 
contribute to site investigation and appraisal.  
 211. Further residential development to achieve the viability and secure the 
overall restoration of the site may also be supported where it is demonstrated that objectives of the Policy are met.  
 212. Given the nature of Derwent Forest, and the site history it is recognised 
that in many cases the viability of development may be marginal, and as such the Council will work with partners and any developer and 
adopt a flexible approach to considering a comprehensive proposal. 
The Council acknowledges that the site lies outside any defined 
settlement and as such would be treated as an exception to normal 
planning policy. As a consequence any proposal would not be 
expected to fully meet policy requirements related to housing mix and 
affordable housing, where this would impact on the overall viability of 
the development.  
 213. In all cases a comprehensive masterplan is required to ensure that 
development results in a coherent and well-planned future use that secures the important network of habitat, species and green 
infrastructure as a whole. If appropriate, the Council will consider 
adoption of an agreed masterplan as a Supplementary Planning 
Document to help facilitate delivery of the project.  
 214. Policy S18 strikes a balance between maximising the opportunities that 
this site provides while respecting the landscape setting, historic assets, the quality of the biodiversity and habitat on the site, as well as 
the infrastructure required to support development.  
 215. The development provides a unique opportunity to diversify the local 
economy, particularly the visitor and leisure sector, provide local jobs and bring back into use one of the largest previously developed sites in 
the region.

97S19  Renewable Energy and Low Carbon Technologies 
 216. The UK Renewable Energy Strategy sets a national target to provide 
15% of electricity and heat from renewable and low carbon sources by 2020. Renewable energy is an important issue nationally as well as 
locally across the communities of Allerdale.  
 217. The Cumbria Renewable Energy Capacity and Deployment Study 
(2011) considers the renewable energy potential across Cumbria and provides the evidence to support renewable energy policies within 
Local Plans. It considers an extensive range of renewable energy 
sources, translating potential into a realistic deployable capacity up to 
2030 in order to help Cumbria to meet Government energy targets.  
 218. The overall level of renewable energy currently deployed across 
Cumbria is 295MW of which 70% is located within Allerdale Local Plan Area. The Study found that Cumbria has a high natural resource for 
renewable energy. However, as it also has a large number of high 
quality landscapes and designations, the level of resource that is 
realistically achievable is significantly reduced.  
 219. The study indicates that within the Plan Area there is also a large 
renewable energy resource, and suggests that there is a realistic potential for an extra 80MW by 2030. This additional supply is likely to 
come from a mix of technologies, with the onus on micro renewable 
technologies and commercial wind developments. Given the current 
number of wind developments and the future deployment, both singular 
and cumulative impact will be key considerations. The future 
development of the renewable resource, especially micro generation 
presents an exciting economic opportunity in terms of job creation, 
investment and economic diversification and is well aligned with the 
aspirations of the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint. 
 
S19  Renewable Energy and Low Carbon Technologies 
 
The Council will seek to promote and encourage the development of 
renewable and low carbon energy resources given the significant wider 
environmental, community and economic benefits. Proposals where impacts 
(either in isolation or cumulatively) are, or can be made acceptable will be 
permitted. 
 
The Council will take a positive view where; 
 
a) Proposals (either in isolation or cumulatively); 
           i) Do not have an unacceptably adverse impact on the amenity of 
local residents (such as air quality/emissions, noise, odour, water 
pollution, shadow flicker); Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
98          ii) Do not have significant adverse impact on the location, in relation 
to visual impact and impact on the character and sensitivity of the 
surrounding landscape; 
           iii) Do not have an adverse effect on any European/International 
protected nature conservation site (including SACs, SPAs and 
Ramsar sites, candidate SACs, potential SPAs and proposed 
Ramsar sites) including its qualifying habitats and species, either 
alone or in-combination with other plans or projects. 
           iv)    Do not have a significant adverse effect on any National nature 
conservation site (Site of Special Scientific Interest; National 
Nature Reserve), except where the benefits of the development 
clearly outweigh both the impact on the site and any broader 
impacts on the wider network of National sites.    
            v)    Do not result in loss or harm to a Local nature conservation site, 
including habitats or species supported by Local Sites, unless it 
can be demonstrated that there is a need for the development in 
that location and that the benefit of development outweighs the 
harm or loss. 
           iv) Do not have unacceptably adverse impact on heritage assets and 
their settings; 
b) In the case of wind turbines, it can be demonstrated that the 
development would not result in a significant adverse effect (either in 
isolation or cumulatively) on protected bird species, including 
designated sites and migration routes; 
c) Appropriate operational requirements are addressed (including 
accessibility and suitability of road network, ability to connect to the 
grid, proximity of any relevant feedstock); 
d) Appropriate measures are included for the removal of structures and 
the restoration of sites, should sites become non-operational;  
e) Potential benefits to the local economy and the local community, 
including agriculture and other land based industries are considered. 
 
Within Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site and its buffer zone, and the Solway 
Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty only small scale renewable energy 
schemes, which preserve the special qualities of these designations and 
accord with the aims and objectives of their Management Plans will be 
acceptable. 
 
Renewable energy proposals are expected to provide supporting evidence 
including landscape, visual and environmental assessments and to 
demonstrate that any negative impacts have been made acceptable. Where 
mitigation is required to make impacts acceptable these will, where necessary 
be secured through Planning Obligations. Developers will be expected to work 
with local communities from an early stage and deliver benefits to the local 
area where the proposal is located.   
 
220. Policy S19 sets a positive framework for the development of renewable 
energy across the Plan Area reflecting both national planning policy and local evidence.  
 Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
99221. In order to ensure that only appropriate development takes place, the 
policy adopts a criteria based approach to encourage acceptable 
proposals to come forward to help meet national renewable energy 
targets. This addresses each proposal on its merits, and works in 
conjunction with other local plan polices to ensure the maximum level 
of resource is harnessed while ensuring that any impacts are, or can 
be made acceptable. Following bothcommunity concerns and 
evidence, this policy, ensures that amenity, landscape, biodiversity and 
geodiversity, Natura 2000 sites as well as historic assets are protected. 
Great emphasis is placed on the consideration of the potential for 
cumulative adverse impacts arising from the growing number of 
renewable developments across the Plan Area.  
 222. In some instances renewable and low carbon energy proposals can 
result in unacceptable impacts that preclude development in some areas. For example, inappropriately located wind turbines have the 
potential to impact on protected bird flight paths and sites, as well as 
protected landscapes such as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, or 
heritage assets.  
 223. The Habitats Regulations Assessment produced alongside this plan 
suggests that without detailed assessment and bird surveys it is difficult to prove that further wind turbines will not have a cumulative effect on 
the SPA bird populations during construction and operation of the wind 
farms. Therefore, wind development proposals will be expected to 
demonstrate that there will be no significant adverse effects on 
protected bird or bat species, when considered alone and in-
combination with other existing and proposed wind turbines or vertical 
structures. The Allerdale Local Validation Checklist provides further 
details on the circumstances and survey scope that will be expected.  
 224. An Assessment of Likely Significant Effect should be carried out on any 
developments with potential for impacting directly or indirectly on Natura 2000 sites. Appropriate Assessment will be required for any 
development with a likely significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where 
proposals have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites that 
cannot be made acceptable through mitigation they should not be 
allowed to go ahead. Where mitigation is proposed, measures should 
be clearly defined and where appropriate secured by planning 
obligations.  
 225. In order to address community concerns and in the interests of 
residential amenity and safety, a minimum separation distance of 800m between wind turbines (over 25m to blade tip) and residential 
properties will be expected. It is recognised that in some cases due to 
site-specific factors such as orientation of views, landcover, other 
buildings and topography it may be appropriate to vary this threshold, 
where it can be demonstrated through evidence that there is no 
unacceptable impact on residential amenity. Shorter distances may 
also be appropriate if there is support from the local community.  Strategic Policies – Economy

226. Further guidance related to wind development is provided in the 
Cumbria Wind Energy Supplementary Planning Document and any update here after.  
 227. In some cases the large scale nature of some renewable technologies 
can give rise to unacceptable impacts which could make them unacceptable; such as large wind turbines on protected landscapes 
such as the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB), and Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site. Within these 
sensitive landscapes the policy ensures that renewable schemes are in keeping with the aims and objectives of the designated areas, and of a 
scale that will result in minimal impact.

101S20  Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
 
228. Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are usually large scale 
developments such as new harbours, power generating stations (including large wind farms), and electricity transmission lines, which 
require a type of consent known as ‘development consent ’ under 
procedures governed by the Planning Act 2008 (and amended by the Localism Act 2011). 
 229. The role of Allerdale Borough Council and the status of the local plan in 
relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are explained below. 
 230. Applications for planning consent, Development Consent Orders 
(DCOs), for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate Major Infrastructure Unit and 
determined by the Secretary of State. 
 231. Planning policy for NSIPs is set out in National Policy Statement 
(NPSs) which are not part of the statutory development plan; however, the Council has had regard to them in preparing the Allerdale Local 
Plan. Because NSIPs are subject to a separate planning process within 
the national planning regime, the local plan does not have policy status 
for NSIP decision making by the Secretary of State.  
 232. The Council will be an important statutory consultee when any 
Development Consent Order is made. It will prepare a Local Impact Report, to which the Planning Act 2008 (section 104 (2) (b) and (d) 
states that the Secretary of State must have regard. The Local Plan, 
along with other relevant evidence and considerations will inform the 
Local Impact Report and any other representations the Council makes. 
The Council will seek a statement of common ground with the 
developer before an application is submitted to the Major Infrastructure 
Planning Unit. 
 233. The Council will be the decision maker for any elements of 
development associated with or ancillary to the NSIP development dealt with under its powers as a Planning Authority.  Any such 
development will be considered by the Council against National Policy 
Statements and its Local Plan. 
 
S20  Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
 
The Council will actively engage from the pre-application stage with the 
developer of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project to ensure: 
 
a) A robust programme of community consultation with the local 
community and stakeholders is achieved; Strategic Policies – Economy 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
102b) That appropriate mitigation measures are considered to reduce the 
potential impact on the day-to-day activities of the local community and 
businesses as a result of the proposed development. This would 
include the impact on local infrastructure and services; 
c) That, where appropriate, the developer locates any temporary workers 
in the Principal or Key Service Centres close to services and public 
transport routes, reflecting the Local Plan Policies and Site Allocations; 
d) Sustainable forms of transport will be encouraged to move construction 
materials and workers during construction, operation and 
decommissioning; 
e) The maximisation of the local socio-economic opportunities for the 
West Cumbrian economy in terms of increased training and 
employment opportunities, improvements to local infrastructure and the 
development of local business opportunities. 
 
The Council will, where appropriate, prepare and submit a Local Impact 
Report to the Major Infrastructure Planning Unit as part of the Development 
Consent Order process. It will seek to assess both positive and negative 
impact on local communities, jobs and businesses, infrastructure and the 
natural and historic environment. 
234. As stated above Allerdale is not the consenting authority for Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Projects. The Council will use policy S20 and 
in collaboration with partners and developers where appropriate and 
seek to engage with the Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, to ensure 
that the development has regard to the principles of the development 
plan and the following policy.

103Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
S21  Developer Contributions 
 
235. Delivery of the Local Plan needs to be supported by infrastructure, 
community facilities and services that ensure continued sustainable development throughout the Plan Area. The Council is committed to 
ensuring that necessary infrastructure is available to meet the needs of 
development, while ensuring that the requirements of local areas and 
residents and the quality of the environment is not compromised.  
 
S21  Developer Contributions  
 
The Council will work with partners to deliver infrastructure, services and 
community facilities to improve the sustainability of its communities. In 
accordance with the provisions set out within national policy, the Council will 
require new developments to secure infrastructure improvements which are 
necessary to make the development acceptable by planning condition or 
obligations. 
 
Planning obligations may also be required for the initial and ongoing running 
and maintenance costs of services and facilities, and to compensate for the 
loss or damage caused by the development. 
 
The infrastructure, facilities and services to which development may be 
required to contribute include (this list is not exhaustive): 
 
Physical infrastructure 
Transport improvements (including public transport) and its resulting 
maintenance;  
Car parking; 
Footpaths and cycle ways; 
Drainage infrastructure; 
Heritage assets; 
Flood risk and surface water management; 
Waste management; 
Broadband and communication networks; 
Low carbon energy and renewable energy infrastructure.

104Environmental improvements; 
Public realm (including public art). 
 
It is the Council ’s intention to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
where it is satisfied that it can be done without compromising development 
viability. The Community Infrastructure Levy will be subject to a separate 
Development Plan Document. 
 
A Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) on developer contributions will 
be prepared which will set out the formulae and charges which the Council 
would seek to apply in relation to planning obligations. 
 
The Strategy for Infrastructure will support the delivery of the strategy for 
development. It will be a “living ” document and subject to regular updating. 
The Strategy will provide a base for the SPD and for the introduction of a CIL. 
 
236. The Council has produced a Strategy for Infrastructure which sets out 
the likely infrastructure required to ensure sustainable development. The Strategy details the infrastructure requirements identified by 
partner public and private sector service providers as being needed to 
support the growth proposed over the Local Plan period. It covers the 
existing status of infrastructure in individual settlements in terms of 
capacity for growth, the nature of additional infrastructure needed to 
accommodate additional growth proposed, the likely costs of providing 
such infrastructure and any funding sources where known. The 
proposed growth must be deliverable in the timescales or phases 
indicated and the Infrastructure Plan is key to demonstrating 
deliverability of the plan using planning obligations to secure the 
delivery of vital infrastructure. 
 237. Planning Obligations are currently delivered by Section 106 
Agreements which are legally binding agreements between local authorities and applicants/landowners which can form part of planning 
applications. These agreements can be used to ensure that new 
development meets, or contributes to meeting, the infrastructure 
requirements necessary to enable the development to go ahead. 
Planning Obligation must meet the following tests: 
 
· Be necessary to make the development acceptable in planning 
terms; 
· Be directly related to the development; and 
· Be fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the 
development. 
 
238. It is the intention of the Council to investigate, and should it be viable, 
introduce Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to assist with the provision of strategic infrastructure. This will sit alongside on-site 
mitigation of infrastructure requirements through continued use of 
Section 106 planning obligations.  A Supplementary Planning 
Document on Planning Contributions will be developed to support Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
105implementation and application of the policy. The Council will not adopt 
a CIL unless it can be demonstrated that this can be done without 
compromising development viability.  Should CIL be adopted this will 
be the subject of separate public consultation and examination. 
 239. The viability of a proposed development will continue to be carefully 
considered. Where the development is unable to deliver all the policy requirements for reasons of viability, an ‘open book ’ approach will be 
used.  The applicant will be expected to demonstrate to the Council ’s 
satisfaction that the development will be made unviable.  A full financial 
appraisal will be required to support discussion.  In this case any 
planning obligation will be reviewed in line with national and Council 
policy.

106S22  Transport Principles 
 
240. Providing a sustainable transport network to serve the communities of 
the Plan Area is essential for improving accessibility, enhancing economic vitality, protecting the environment and promoting quality of 
life. A key objective of spatial planning is to ensure that jobs, housing, 
shopping, leisure facilities and services are accessible by public 
transport, walking and cycling. Policy S22 underpins the spatial 
strategy and helps to deliver sustainable development.  
 
S22  Transport Principles  
 
New development should be located in areas which help to reduce journey 
times and have safe and convenient access to public transport, open space, 
Key and Local Service Centres and utilities. Where possible, new 
development should actively seek to improve travel choice and reduce the 
need to travel using private motor vehicles.  
 
Exceptions to this policy will be considered for suitable development in rural 
areas that meets the requirements of other local plan policies and can 
demonstrate that provisions for sustainable access have been incorporated 
into the development. The Council will support rural transport schemes and 
shall work with partners to enhance services whenever possible.  
 
All new development in the Plan Area will:  
 
a) Be required to improve accessibility and movement in the local area 
reflecting the Local Transport Plan; 
b) Ensure they can be accessed safely and that they do not compromise 
the safety of any transport route, including railway lines and level 
crossings;  
c) Ensure they can access all major traffic attractors (employment, retail, 
schools and leisure) in a reliable time; 
d) Encourage attractive and well-connected street networks that, where 
necessary, make provision for heavy goods vehicles; 
e) Make provision for pedestrians and cyclists to be given the highest 
priority within town centres and new development, and facilitate links 
with public transport nodes and hubs; 
f) Where necessary be accompanied by Transport Assessments/Travel 
Plans in accordance with local and national guidance; 
g) Protect and, where appropriate, enhance or create new designated 
public rights of way; 
h) Be required to ensure the accessibility requirements of vulnerable 
people are taken into account; 
i) Be required to protect, enhance and capitalise upon sustainable 
transport links offered by green infrastructure corridors wherever 
possible; Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
107j) Be required to provide adequate levels of car parking, cycle facilities, 
and where appropriate incorporate charging points for electric and 
hybrid vehicles. 
 
241. It is important that the local plan actively manages the pattern and the 
location of major development to make best use of public and sustainable transport. The spatial strategy seeks to encourage 
sustainable travel in order to minimise the impact on the strategic and 
local road network, and to help achieve wider aims and objectives. This 
will help to support healthy, inclusive and sustainable communities as 
well as reducing the adverse impacts of travel.  
 242. It is also important to encourage people who do have access to a car to 
use it less or where possible, stop using it. Opportunities for sustainable transport choices are more limited in rural areas.  
Therefore, it is important to promote sustainable transport options and 
encourage community led transport schemes where existing public 
transport is limited or unavailable in order to facilitate a modal shift; 
moving people and journeys from private cars onto public transport. 
The priority for improving bus services and passenger facilities will be 
those serving the Principal and Key Service Centres as the main 
centres for jobs, housing, shopping, leisure facilities and services. 
 243. The Third Cumbria Local Transport Plan (2011 – 2026) addresses local 
transport issues across Cumbria by developing transport objectives which support wider goals and ambitions, and sets out plans for 
implementation. It is vital that the Allerdale Local Plan and the Local 
Transport Plan are consistent and support each other in their aims and 
objectives. The spatial strategy plays a key role in directing 
development to sustainable locations and, along with other plan 
policies, reflects the objectives set in the Local Transport Plan. S22 
ensures that new development reflects key accessibility principles of 
the Local Transport Plan ensuring better accessibility, safety, reliability 
and more efficient connectivity. Guidance on ensuring that transport 
principles are reflected in good design are detailed in Policy S4 and the 
Manual for Streets.  
 244. Dedicated pedestrian and cycle routes will be provided in a manner 
that is convenient, safe and well integrated with other transport links and developments where appropriate. New development should be 
linked with new/existing routes by using appropriate tracks/roads, paths 
and green infrastructure. These routes should ensure ease of access 
around the development and permeability across and to existing 
development. Furthermore, development must provide appropriate 
facilities for cycle parking within the new development commensurate 
with the scale of development and local standards. 
 245. New development can potentially have both a positive and negative 
impact on transport, therefore transport impacts of new developments need to be assessed in accordance with national guidance. Policy S22 Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
108requires a Transport Assessment and Travel Plan to accompany 
planning applications in line with the thresholds identified in national 
guidance and in accordance with the Highways Agency guidance in 
respect of planning applications, for any development which could 
influence travel on the Strategic Road Network. 
 246. Travel Plans must be consistent with Council policies and requirements 
as set out in the Council Local Validation Checklist. Development will 
only be permitted where the Travel Plans, Transport Assessments or 
Transport Statements are accepted and there is adequate provision for 
existing and future transport infrastructure. Where necessary these will 
be secured through planning obligations.  
 247. Car ownership is an essential part of daily life for many people in 
Allerdale, especially in the north of the Plan Area. The parking provision within new developments has to find an appropriate balance 
between providing enough car parking to help support the local 
economy, reflecting the area ’s rural nature where car usage is 
sometimes the only realistic travel option, and over provision of parking. Too many car parks can encourage further car use and 
therefore increased congestion and CO2 emissions. , Providing too 
many spaces can also result in poorly designed and often cluttered 
places. However, providing too few parking spaces can result in 
indiscriminate parking which can have a negative impact on road safety 
and on the overall streetscape.The rural nature of the Plan Area must 
be considered in setting appropriate levels of parking provision in new 
development. 
 248. Other key issues in setting parking standards include car ownership; 
the accessibility of the development; the type, mix and use of development; and the overall aims and objectives of sustainable 
development. Local guidance will be provided setting out details on 
incorporating parking in new developments with appropriate standards 
for managing parking in the Plan Area.

109S23  Supporting and Safeguarding Strategic Infrastructure 
 
249. Comprehensive and timely delivery of strategic infrastructure is vital to 
achieving the aims and objectives of the Plan, and underpins the 
spatial strategy for growth. The strategic infrastructure requirement of 
new development needs to be established and where appropriate land 
protected to ensure improvements occur alongside new development. 
Strategic infrastructure can cover a range of physical, social, and 
economic improvements including schemes related to transport, health, 
education and utilities.  
 
S23  Supporting and Safeguarding Strategic Infrastructure  
 
The Council will support priorities and improvements set out in the Local 
Transport Plan and other delivery documents by working with partners and 
ensuring development will not prejudice the implementation of proposed 
schemes and projects. 
 
The Council will: 
a) Support the establishment of viable transport hubs across the Plan 
Area;  
b) Protect the approved route of the Workington Southern Link Road from 
Moss Bay Road to the A596 as detailed in the Local Transport Plan as 
part of the Strategic Links to Workington Development Areas 
proposals;  
c) Protect the routes of strategic transport links as and when route plans 
become available; 
d) Seek improvements to the West Cumbrian Coastal Railway service 
and encourage greater movement of freight via railway; 
e) Protect and enhance access to the Ports of Workington and Silloth; 
f) Support efforts to improve the flood resilience of Allerdale ’s 
infrastructure; 
g) Support and lobby for infrastructure improvements required to enable 
delivery of economic growth and sustainable communities; 
h) Protect sites for important infrastructure when these become available; 
i) Support proposals to secure future drinking water supplies for West 
Cumbria. 
 
250. Many of the key infrastructure projects are set out within the Local 
Transport Plan and are identified as key to delivery of the Council ’s 
aims and objectives. The planning system needs to be able to ensure 
that development proposals do not constrain the provision of these 
transport projects, and ensure the implementation of the Transport 
Plan in order to support the level of growth identified in Policy S3. As 
such, the policy provides a level of support and safeguarding of 
important land when routes or sites are known. Policy also provides 
support for safeguarding non-transport infrastructure, such as major 
education, health and sites needed for the upgrade of utility sites. 
Where projects are advanced to a certain level, safeguarded land or Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
110safeguarded lines will be identified on a map in the Site Allocations 
DPD. 
 251. Policy provides support for transport hubs, which will enable more 
sustainable and integrated transport connection to employment, services and the strategic transport network throughout the Plan Area 
and beyond. Improving connectivity and enabling more sustainable 
transport within the Plan Area and to outside centres is key to 
improving economic, social and environmental aims.

111S24  Green Infrastructure 
 
252. Green infrastructure is the network of multi-functional green and blue 
spaces found within and between the settlements across the area.  A green infrastructure asset can be counted as anything which makes a 
contribution to a network of outdoor natural or man-made open spaces, 
habitats or linkages between them.  These can include, but are not 
limited to, woodlands, parks, rivers, private gardens, allotments, trees, 
ponds, cycle paths, coastal areas, footpaths, sports pitches or 
farmland. 
 
S24  Green Infrastructure 
 
The Council will promote the creation, enhancement, maintenance and 
protection of a range of green infrastructure assets that contribute to a diverse 
network of natural and man-made green and blue spaces, links, habitats and 
landscapes, which is accessible to all. The Council will work with partners and 
developers to: 
 
a) Promote high quality, attractive places which allow everyone to enjoy 
direct and regular contact with the natural environment; 
b) Seek to ensure green infrastructure is woven into new development 
wherever possible; 
c) Protect, manage, enhance and create key natural and semi-natural 
habitats and wildlife corridors, including watercourses, wetlands, 
woodlands (including ancient woodland and trees) and parklands; 
d) Seek to alleviate open space deficiencies in existing communities 
whilst ensuring all new open space provision is high quality, attractive 
and safe; 
e) Promote design and management of parks and natural green spaces to 
increase biodiversity and maximise their function as nature reserves; 
f) Promote health and fitness through provision of open space and 
opportunities for community involvement in outdoor exercise, sport and 
active recreations; 
g) Encourage use of street trees, where appropriate, to define streets, 
improve the urban environment and provide linkages in habitat 
networks; 
h) Promote creation of multi functional habitat networks, such as 
communal / private courtyards, pocket green spaces and green 
buildings, which are responsive to a range of microclimatic conditions 
and provide an experience of nature on people ’s doorstep; 
i) Seek the creation of new and enhanced links and corridors between 
towns and settlements such as cycle ways and footpaths; 
j) Promote improvements in air, water and soil quality and more 
sustainable drainage and flood mitigation solutions; 
k) Seek the protection and rehabilitation of landscapes and habitats 
damaged or lost by development or land management practices; Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
112l) Maximise opportunities to enhance and create assets which have the 
potential to attract visitors, create employment and attract investment 
to the area; 
m) Explore the potential of existing and new green infrastructure assets to 
provide opportunities for renewal energy schemes; 
n) Promote opportunities for farmers, foresters and other land managers 
to diversify and promote woodland management, including 
opportunities for new planting schemes; 
o) Support key specific projects which would contribute significantly to the 
Green Infrastructure network. 
 
253. The main purpose of promoting green infrastructure is to maximise the 
multi-functional nature of assets improving the sustainability and attractiveness of the development, to the social, environmental and 
economic benefit of all.  
 254. The Green Infrastructure Study identifies specific green infrastructure 
assets within the Plan Area and will be kept up to date in order to inform developers about the potential of existing green infrastructure 
assets within the local area.  The study collates data from a series of 
partner sources including the Open Space, Sports and Recreation 
strategies, the Cumbria Rights of Way Improvement Plan, Cumbria 
Strategic Cycle Network Map, Cumbria Biodiversity Database, Solway 
Coast AONB Management Plan, Allerdale Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment and the Cumbria Landscape Character Assessment. 
 
255. Clear priorities for the protection and enhancement of the green 
infrastructure network will be set out in an SPD to identify deficiencies, deliver new assets and ensure the optimum integration between green 
networks and development.

114S25  Sports, Leisure and Open Space 
 
256. A key priority of the Council is to promote healthy lifestyles through 
improved access to sports, leisure and open space, which also have positive economic and environmental benefits. Improved access can 
be achieved not only by improving the provision and quality of existing 
sports and leisure facilities, but by promoting opportunities to enjoy 
outdoor recreational activities, open spaces and the countryside.  
 
S25  Sports, Leisure and Open Space 
 
The Council will seek to maintain, enhance and protect the provision of formal 
and informal sports and recreation facilities and public open space throughout 
the Plan Area.   
 
The improvement of play, sports and other public open space provision will be 
delivered in the following ways: 
 
a) By identifying deficiencies in indoor and outdoor sports and leisure 
facilities/open spaces, as identified in adopted Open Space, Sport and 
Recreation strategies, and by ensuring that new development makes 
quantitative or qualitative improvements to provision in line with these 
strategies; 
b) By requiring residential developments to make provision for well 
designed public open space, either through on site provision of new 
open space or by financial contribution to enhance or create off-site 
provision and management of public open space (based on standards 
set out in adopted Open Space, Sport and Recreation strategies)  
c) By securing, where appropriate, developer contributions towards the 
creation of new areas of open space, or sports facilities, in localities 
where a deficit has been identified within the Open Space, Sport and 
Recreation Study, or where development may lead to a deficit; 
d) By ensuring that new indoor sports and leisure facilities are located in 
the most sustainable locations in accordance with town centre policies; 
e) Through giving priority to addressing the deficiency in the provision of 
play and recreation spaces designed for children and young people; 
f) By ensuring the ongoing protection and improvement of both new and 
existing provision through appropriate management and maintenance 
arrangements; 
g) By encouraging and securing more community use agreements with 
schools and private sports facilities. 
 
For major employment and retail developments, the Council may seek the 
provision of open space, in addition to the landscaping and public realm 
requirements to provide amenity for users. 
 
Where open space is to be provided as part of a development, the amount, 
type and form will be determined having regard to the nature and size of the Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
115development proposed and the community needs likely to be generated by it 
as identified in adopted Open Space, Sport and Recreation strategies. 
 
The Council will seek to safeguard existing areas of open space, land and 
buildings used for sports and recreational activities, having regard for deficits 
and surpluses identified in Open Space, Sport and Recreation strategies. 
Development proposals that will result in the loss of open space, sports and 
recreational facilities will not be permitted unless: 
 
h) An assessment has been undertaken which has clearly shown the 
open space, buildings or land to be surplus to requirements; or 
i) The loss resulting from the proposed development would be replaced 
by equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity and quality in a 
suitable location; or 
j) The development is for alternative sports and leisure provision, the 
needs for which clearly outweigh the loss. 
Development on land adjoining areas of public open space, sports and leisure 
facilities that would erode the quality and/or jeopardise its use and enjoyment 
by the public will be resisted. 
 
The Council will protect the structure, character, principal components and 
setting of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest within the Plan Area. 
Proposals within or adjacent that are deemed to have a detrimental impact will 
not be permitted. The Council will support proposals that involve the removal 
of inappropriate structures and/or uses that detract from their special historic 
interest. 
 
257. The Allerdale Open Space, Sports and Recreation strategies consist of 
integrated documents including the Open Space Study and the Playing Pitch strategy.  These documents form up to date assessments of the 
need for open space, sports and recreation facilities within the 
Borough, identifying, mapping and cataloguing each asset by type, 
such as indoor sports, outdoor sports, amenity space, church 
yards/cemeteries, parks and gardens, allotments etc.  Specific 
requirements in terms of the Borough ’s quantitative and qualitative 
provision and future requirements are identified within these assessments, and will inform Council decisions on priorities for 
improvement of provision. 
 258. The Allerdale Open Space, Sports and Recreation strategies and 
community engagement exercises have shown a significant deficiency in leisure and recreational facilities for children and, in particular, 
teenagers.  The Council will seek to address these deficiencies as a 
priority in improving provision. 
 259. In accordance with the spatial strategy and town centres policies, the 
first preference for location of intensive sports and leisure development will be within, or on the edge of, existing town centres to maximise the Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
116benefits for existing and new communities and reduce the need to 
travel.  
 260. Existing outdoor sports and leisure facilities across Allerdale are 
valuable assets for the communities in which they are located and in some instance the wider area.  This importance relates to not only their 
function, but also to the amenity value and their contribution to the 
green infrastructure network.  Where appropriate, and especially as 
part of large scale residential developments, new formal and informal 
green spaces will form part of the comprehensive design proposal.  
When considering proposals, the Council will have regard to the 
changing needs or demands for such facilities. 
 261. The Council will secure, where appropriate, developer contributions 
toward open space, sport and recreation provision, whilst being mindful of development viability, in accordance with Policy S21. The Council 
will produce an SPD to aid interpretation and guide developers in 
relation to the Open Space, Sports and Recreation strategies and 
requirements for provision.

117S26  Community and Rural Services 
 
262. Good community facilities are an essential element of a successful, 
healthy and inclusive society. Community facilities can include, but are not limited to, community halls, local shops, theatres, public houses, 
meeting places, schools, sports venues, cultural buildings, higher 
education facilities, health centres, childcare providers and places of 
worship, cemeteries, allotments, etc. 
 
S26  Community and Rural Services 
 
Proposals for neighbourhood community facilities will be supported where it 
can be demonstrated that the service will enhance the sustainability of the 
community and conserve and enhance the heritage, character and local 
distinctiveness of the area. In the case of retail, the maximum size of any unit 
acceptable will be determined by the needs arising in the catchment and will 
not undermine the vitality and viability of any other centres. 
 
The Council will protect existing community facilities which provide for 
people ’s day to day, social and cultural needs. Proposals which would result 
in the loss of an existing community facility will be refused unless it can be 
demonstrated that: 
 
a) Alternative facilities are similarly accessible by walking; 
b) There is no known demand for the continued community use, and 
evidence has been submitted of genuine efforts having been made to 
market and sell the enterprise as a going concern or to sell or let the 
property as premises for its current use.  A robust marketing exercise 
will be agreed with the Council. 
 263. Community facilities such as theatres, local shops, village halls, public 
houses and schools etc are at the heart of a thriving, sustainable and inclusive society.  This is particularly relevant in rural areas and 
isolated neighbourhoods where these facilities not only provide for 
peoples day to day needs, but also provide a source of social and 
cultural interaction.   
 264. The Council will protect these valuable services, encourage the 
creation of new facilities and support improvements and enhancements to those existing. Facilities should be of a scale appropriate to the size 
of the settlement in accordance with the spatial strategy. 
 265. The Council encourages the sharing of facilities so that a building can 
be used by different groups for different purposes wherever possible. This will help to ensure the facility remains viable and makes efficient 
use of buildings. Examples may include educational buildings that are 
also used for entertainment, childcare and other educational and sports 
activities, or health care facilities that are designed to be used for both 
health and social care purposes. Strategic Policies – Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
118 
266. A priority of the Council is to promote healthy lifestyles through 
improving people ’s access to sports and recreation facilities.  The 
Open Space, Sports and Recreation Study identifies deficiencies in the 
provision of indoor and outdoor sports facilities as well as public green 
spaces.  The Council will seek to address deficiencies in the Plan Area 
by ensuring that new development contributes to this provision either 
through the creation of new facilities or by making contributions to the 
improvement of existing. 
 267. In September 2012 the Government introduced the Community Right 
to Bid as part of the Localism Act which gives community groups the right to bid and buy community facilities which are important to them.  
Local Authorities will be required to maintain a list of assets of local 
value which have been nominated by the local community, and when 
listed assets come up for sale or change of ownership, the Act gives 
community groups the time to develop a bid and raise money to buy 
the asset when it comes on the local market.  The Council will support 
communities who wish to explore these new rights.

Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
119Built and Historic Environment 
S27  Heritage Assets  
 
268.   Allerdale ’s historic environment contributes enormously to its 
economy and to its attractiveness as a place to live and therefore to the quality of life of its residents and workforce.  Its historic environment 
attracts many tourists and visitors to the district and as such its 
conservation and enhancement is very important to the local economy. 
 269. Allerdale ’s historic environment includes all of its heritage assets 
including:  
 
a) Listed Buildings
2:  Total (1,328) 
b)     Grade I (29) 
c)     Grade II* (33) 
d)     Grade II (1,266) 
e) Conservation Areas: 21 f) Scheduled Ancient Monuments: 80 
g) Registered Park Parks and Gardens:  1 
h) World Heritage Sites:  1 
i) Non-designated heritage assets such as vernacular/historic 
buildings and archaeological sites of regional and local interest 
 
270. Heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource; therefore, decisions 
affecting their future must be taken with full understanding of the consequences. 
 
S27    Heritage Assets  
The historic environment including all heritage assets and their settings will be 
conserved and enhanced in a manner appropriate to their intrinsic historic 
value and significance, their importance to local character, distinctiveness and 
sense of place, and to other social, cultural economic or environmental 
benefits/values. 
The Council will work with partners to seek the conservation and 
enhancement of all designated or non-designated heritage assets within the 
Plan Area. 
In determining applications that could affect the significance (including 
character, appearance, historic value, value to people and setting) of a 
heritage asset and/or archaeological asset,  the following factors will be taken 
into account:    
· The level of significance of the heritage asset(s). 
· The impact of the proposal on the significance (including setting) of the 
                                                
2 (It should be noted that these figures are based on the number of listings, but many listings 
include more than one building, so the total number of buildings that are listed is greater). Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
120heritage asset(s) .  
· How the significance and/or setting of the asset could be better 
revealed.  
· Opportunities for mitigating climate change without damaging 
significance. 
 
Only proposals which do not harm any positive qualities of the heritage 
asset(s) will be approved, unless there is a clear and convincing public benefit 
to the proposal that will outweigh the harm caused to the asset(s). If the public 
benefits of a proposal outweighs and justifies the loss of a heritage asset, it 
must be fully recorded in accordance with agreed criteria which will be 
proportionate to the value and significance of the heritage asset. 
Where there is evidence of deliberate or conscious damage to, or neglect of, 
a heritage asset, the Council will take action that may involve prosecution, 
serving an Urgent Works or Repairs Notice to prevent further decay or adding 
the building to the National Buildings at Risk Register. 
Schemes which help ensure a sustainable future for Allerdale ’s heritage 
assets, especially those identified at being at risk of loss or decay will be 
supported. 
 
 
271. Policy S27 sets out a framework for all decisions that affect heritage 
assets and provides a presumption in favour of conserving all heritage assets and against allowing harm to assets.    The strength of this 
presumption will be affected by the level of designation and importance 
of the heritage asset and the amount of public benefit of the proposals.     
 272. The strongest presumption against any damage will be accorded to 
those with the highest designations. For example, Hadrian ’s Wall World 
Heritage Site, where proposals that cause damage to its ‘Outstanding 
Universal Value ’ would have to be wholly exceptional.   
 
273. Applications that will affect the significance of a heritage asset 
(positively or negatively) should include a Heritage Statement which explains the value of the heritage asset (including an explanation of its 
character, appearance, historic value, value to people and its setting), 
how the proposal will affect any of these qualities, and an explanation 
of the public benefits of the proposal.    The complexity and depth of 
the Heritage Statement should be proportionate to the significance of 
the heritage asset(s) and the scale of impact upon the asset(s) 
 274. Locally designated and non-designated heritage assets can be 
protected by this policy where there is evidence of their value or significance to the local community or economy, and a lack of sufficient 
public benefit to outweigh any loss to them.

121275. There are 21 Conservation Areas designated in the Allerdale Local 
Plan Area which vary considerably in size, type and character.  Article 
4 directions, which remove certain permitted development rights, have 
been applied to some houses within conservation areas in order for the 
Council to retain control over alterations that could affect character.  
Any proposals for change should conserve or enhance its character.   
Proposals for demolitions of buildings within conservation areas will 
only be considered acceptable if it is clear that the replacement 
buildings or space will contribute at least as much to, and will 
preferably enhance, the character and significance of the conservation 
area. The Council will review its conservation areas when appropriate, 
and will seek to provide up to date conservation area appraisals which 
identify the architectural and historic interest, distinctiveness and 
character of the conservation area.  
 276. There is the opportunity to identify and locally list those assets that are 
significant or which may provide an important environmental, social and economic benefit for the local area. These are locally important 
historic buildings and other heritage assets that make a valuable 
contribution to the character or history of the Borough. Where 
appropriate the Council will provide support for communities to identify 
locally significant historic buildings. 
 277. Where the demolition or partial demolition of a heritage asset is 
proposed, an appropriately detailed recording shall be undertaken and deposited with the relevant local Historic Environment Record. When 
development affecting archaeological sites and assets is acceptable in 
principle, the Council will seek to ensure mitigation of damage through 
preservation of the remains in situ as a preferred solution. When in situ 
preservation is not justified, the developer should make adequate 
provision for excavation and recording before or during development. 
Where necessary the Council will secure the recording of loss by 
appropriate planning conditions or obligations.

122S28  Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site 
 
278. Hadrian ’s Wall was designated as a World Heritage Site by the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 
1987 as the most complex and best preserved of the frontiers of the 
Roman Empire. It is an internationally known icon of the North of 
England and exists over a wide tract of Northwest Allerdale. It has a 
valuable recreational, social and economic value, both to those who 
live and work in the area, and visitors and tourists. The Hadrian ’s Wall 
Path National Trail and the Hadrian ’s Cycleway provide important 
recreation and leisure facilities for a large numbers of cyclists, walkers 
and visitors. 
 
279. Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site Management Plan provides the 
framework for management of the site to ensure its preservation for present and future generations, and addresses the issues and 
opportunities that World Heritage status offers. Although it is not a 
statutory document it brings together the policies and aspirations of a 
wide range of individuals and organisations in order to directly 
influence other plans and strategies. The Management Plan 
encompasses the Wall itself and a buffer zone on either side and 
currently covers the period 2008 – 2014.  
 
S28  Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site 
 
There is a presumption in favour of preserving the fabric, integrity and 
authenticity of archaeological sites that form part of Hadrian ’s Wall World 
Heritage Site. Development that would have a detrimental effect on 
archaeological remains and their setting will be refused. 
 
Proposed development in the Buffer Zone should be assessed for its impact 
on the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site, and 
particularly on key views both into and out of it. Development that would have 
an adverse impact on Outstanding Universal Value will be refused. 
 
Proposed developments outside the boundaries of the Buffer Zone will be 
assessed for their effect on the Outstanding Universal Value. Any proposals 
that would have an adverse effect on this will be refused. 
 
New development within Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site and its Buffer 
Zone, which enhances or better reveals its significance, will be supported.  
 
Significant development proposals affecting Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage 
Site and its Buffer Zone will require a formal environmental impact 
assessment to ensure their impacts and implications for the longer term are 
evaluated in full. 
 
280. Policy S28 reflects both national policy and the Hadrian ’s Wall World 
Heritage Site Management Plan and defines Hadrian ’s Wall World Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
123Heritage Site as a designated heritage asset of the highest 
significance.  Given the significance there is a strong presumption in 
favour of the conservation of the Outstanding Universal Value of the 
World Heritage Site. The Plan ensures that substantial harm to, or loss 
of such a site is wholly exceptional. Following the management plan 
the policy encourages opportunities for new development within world 
heritage site and settings that enhance or better reveal the 
significance. 
 281. The Buffer Zone protects the setting of the World Heritage Site, 
however, beyond its designated boundary it is also important to have regard for the site as inappropriate development can still have an 
adverse impact upon the qualities of the site.

124S29  Flood Risk and Surface Water Drainage 
 
282. Flooding occurs naturally, but can also result from human interference 
with natural processes such as changes to river channels or their flood plains, increases in runoff from land, or blocked drainage systems. 
Flooding becomes a problem when it has an adverse impact on 
people, property, infrastructure or the environment.  
 
S29  Flood Risk and Surface Water Drainage  
 
Developments should be avoided in locations that would be at risk of flooding 
or where it would increase the level of flooding elsewhere. Development 
within areas at the greatest risk of flooding, as identified within the Allerdale 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SRFA) and/or Lead Local Flood Authority 
(LLFA) Local Flood Risk Management Strategy, will be strongly resisted.  
 
In order to minimise the risk to people, property and places from flooding, the 
Council will: 
 
a) Assess all proposed development sites through both the Site 
Allocations process and development proposals against the SFRA 
and/or LLFA Local Flood Risk Management Strategy and ensure that 
new development is fully compliant with the national policy and 
guidance. 
b) Ensure that developments identified in national policy as requiring a 
Flood Risk Assessment, should ensure that as a minimum, the scale 
and nature of the assessment should be appropriate with the 
development proposals and should be completed in accordance with 
national policy and guidance.  
 
The Council will expect all developers to demonstrate that they have 
separated surface water from foul drainage to remove pressure on foul 
drainage system. The Council expect the incorporation and/or retention of soft 
landscaping, permeable surfaces, water storage systems and infiltration 
systems (SuDS) to have been considered for all developments. 
 
The Council will expect all new developments to defer to the drainage 
hierarchy, seeking to incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in 
preference to discharge to local watercourses or the main sewer. Proposals 
seeking to discharge surface water to local watercourses or the main sewer 
will normally be resisted, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of 
the Council that: 
 
c) Local ground conditions render a SuDS system impractical; or  
d) The cost of installation, maintenance and, where appropriate, operation 
would render the scheme economically unviable.  
 
In circumstances where a SuDS system is deemed practical and viable, 
developers will be required to seek the approval of the SuDS Approval Body Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
125(SAB) and to submit a management plan outlining how the system will be 
maintained and managed in the long term. Developers will be required to 
enter into a planning obligation in order to secure the long term management 
responsibilities of the SuDS in perpetuity.  
 
283. Allerdale has many areas at risk of both tidal and fluvial flooding, with 
almost the entire Plan Area being covered within the River Derwent Catchment Flood Management Plan (CFMP). Within the Plan Area the 
towns of Workington and Cockermouth (the main towns in the River 
Derwent CFMP area) have developed upon the natural floodplains of 
the Rivers Derwent and Cocker and for this reason the towns have a 
long history of flooding. 
 284. There are a number of options for managing development in flood risk 
areas, however guidance set out in the NPPF (Technical Guidance) is to adopt a sequential approach that directs development to suitable 
sites within areas of lower flood risk before those in medium to high risk 
areas are considered.   
 285. Allerdale ’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) highlights a 
number of areas within the Plan Area at risk from either tidal or fluvial flooding. It is the main source of evidence for local flood risk 
information and should be used, along with up to date guidance from 
the Environment Agency and County LLFA, as the main point of 
reference for both the Council and developers to inform decisions.   
 286. Flood Risk Assessments will be required in accordance with national 
policy and the details required set out in the Local Validation Checklist.  Flood Risk Assessments should be carried out in consultation with the 
Council and the Environment Agency at the earliest opportunity to 
ensure that optimum solution designs are achieved and to prevent 
problems at later stages. 
 287. The Council will strongly resist development in high flood risk areas, 
steering development to lower flood risk areas. 
 
288. In addition to tidal and fluvial flooding, there is a significant risk from 
surface water flooding within the area.  Cumbria County Council is the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) and has produced a Cumbria 
Surface Water Management Plan (CSWMP) which outlines the 
preferred surface water strategy across the County and is the main 
vehicle for managing local/surface water flooding. 
 289. A hierarchy of drainage options for disposing of surface water must be 
considered and discounted in the following order: 
· Continue and/or mimic the site ’s current natural discharge process; 
· Allieviate flows into green engineering solutions such as ponds, 
swales, or other open water features for gradual release to a watercourse and/or porous subsoils; Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
126· Attenuate by storing in tanks or sealed systems for gradual release into 
a watercourse; 
· Direct discharge to a surface water only sewer; 
· Controlled discharge into the combined sewerage network, only if it can 
be demonstrated that there are no other viable options. 
 
 
290. If new development is shown to increase storm sewer overflows it will 
be necessary to phase the development to allow the existing infrastructure to be improved.  Culverting of waterways should be 
avoided. 
 291. The Council will expect all new developments to defer to the drainage 
hierarchy. A key objective of the Local Plan is to encourage the use of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) within new development 
as they slow down the volume and rate of run off following heavy 
rainfall, thereby reducing the risk of surface water flooding.  SuDS 
schemes can also be a valuable way of achieving net environmental 
gains through the creation of green infrastructure assets and habitats 
(retention ponds, swales, tree planting etc). 
 292. As Lead Local Flood Authority Cumbria County Council will approve 
the use of SuDs. This is due to their responsibility for approval of all 
drainage plans, and adoption and maintenance of SuDS. The scales of 
development covered will be specified by the LLFA 
 293. Surface water drainage issues have implications for waste water 
capacity infrastructure across the Plan Area which currently suffer from localised overloading. The Council will work with Cumbria County 
Council, United Utilities, Natural England and the Environment Agency 
to gain a full understanding of the capacity issues.

127S30  Reuse of Land  
 
294. There is a history of vacant previously developed land throughout the 
Plan Area, but concentrated in the South West of the Plan Area, in and around Workington.   
 
S30  Reuse of Land  
 
Previously Developed Land (Brownfield) 
In line with local regeneration and sustainability objectives, the Council will 
encourage and where appropriate prioritise the effective reuse of previously 
developed and vacant sites within the Plan Area.   
 
Proposals for windfall development on greenfield sites may be required to 
carry out a sequential test to demonstrate that there are no available 
previously developed sites, which are not of high environmental value, within 
the settlement that could suitably accommodate the scheme. 
 
Contaminated and Unstable Land 
For proposals for development of land where there is risk of potential onsite 
contamination or ground instability, an investigation into the quality of the land 
will be required. In circumstances where the proposal involves a site that is 
known to be contaminated or unstable, the Council will require an assessment 
to be submitted with the application.  This must be carried out by a suitably 
qualified person to the current British Standards and in accordance with local 
guidance.     
 295. Policies encourage redevelopment of previously developed land and 
support schemes that involve the restoration and regeneration of these sites, provided these sites are not of high environmental value.  Vacant 
land can provide an ideal habitat in which plant and animal wildlife can 
thrive, especially if left undeveloped and undisturbed.  A sequential test 
may be required for windfall proposals on greenfield land to 
demonstrate that no suitable previously developed sites are available, 
the thresholds for which are set out in Policy DM16.   
 296. Given their former use, many previously developed sites are 
contaminated with chemicals, oils and other pollutants that can pose risk to human health and the natural environment.  Consequently 
proposals involving the reuse of contaminated sites must be rigorously 
assessed to ensure that the extent and nature of the contamination is 
identified and a suitable scheme for remediation of the site can be 
achieved, while ensuring the development does not affect habitats, 
species and protected sites.   
 297. Where development is proposed on a site known to be contaminated or 
have the potential to be contaminated as a result of industrial activity (e.g. Gasworks, petrol stations, filled ground, steelworks, railway land), 
a preliminary risk assessment will be required.  This must be carried Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
128out by a suitably qualified person to the current British Standards and 
in accordance with guidance set out in Development of Potentially 
Contaminated Land and Sensitive End Uses: An Essential Guide for 
Developers (Jan 2013) or any subsequent guidance. 
 298. A history of coal mining within the Borough has left a legacy on the 
land.  Whilst most past mining activity is generally benign in nature, potential public safety and stability problems can be triggered and 
uncovered by development activities. Problems can include collapses 
of mine entries and shallow coal workings, emissions of mine gases, 
incidents of spontaneous combustion and the discharge of water from 
abandoned coal mines.  Therefore it is important that proposals for new 
development delivered through the Local Plan recognise the problems 
and how they can be addressed.  Where a proposal has been identified 
by the Council as being on land where there is a risk of ground 
instability, an appropriate investigation into the quality of the land will 
be required.

129S31 Reuse of Rural Buildings and Replacement of Dwellings in the 
Countryside 
 
299. Changes in agricultural practices, including the increased use of large 
vehicles and larger buildings, have meant that rural barns are sometimes no longer fit-for-purpose and stand empty.  When assessed 
in isolation, the deterioration and/or loss of such buildings does not 
appear to be significant, yet when assessed in a cumulative context, 
the impact on the landscape can be considerable.  Redundant rural 
buildings, of traditional design, often have the potential to be adapted 
into high quality buildings which can alleviate development pressures 
on green field land and reduce the demand for new buildings in 
sensitive locations. 
  
S31  Reuse of Rural Buildings and Replacement Dwellings in the 
Countryside 
 
The Council will encourage proposals that involve the conversion and reuse of 
redundant rural buildings in the open countryside in circumstances where it 
can be demonstrated that the scheme will contribute to the ongoing 
sustainability and vitality of the local economy and community. 
 
Proposals for the reuse of rural buildings that are located outside of the 
settlements identified in the settlement hierarchy may be acceptable when: 
 
a) The scale of development proposed is proportionate, taking into account 
the open countryside location; 
b) Policies in relation to access, parking and amenity can be satisfied without 
detriment to the building or its rural setting; 
c) The proposal would not generate any significant increase of traffic on 
minor and/or unsuitable roads that would be prejudicial to highway safety. 
Only buildings that are demonstrated to be structurally sound will be 
considered to be suitable candidates for conversion under the provision of this 
policy.   
 
National policy recognises that in order to promote sustainable development, 
new isolated homes in the open countryside should be avoided. The Council 
will therefore give preference to proposals involving the reuse of buildings for 
business or community uses that will lead to the provision of new business 
premises or services for local communities.  Proposals for the conversion of 
rural buildings to residential use will only be acceptable in line with national 
policy and where the building can be converted without substantial alteration 
to the original footprint.  
 
Replacement Dwellings in the Countryside 
 Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
130In the open countryside proposals to replace/rebuild dwellings will be 
acceptable provided that: 
 
d) The proposal is well designed, of appropriate scale for its location and 
does not detract from the character or distinctiveness of the location; 
e) The relevant building to be replaced substantially exists and is not deemed 
to have lost its lawful use as a dwelling. 
 
Proposals for the replacement of dwellings in the countryside will be only be 
acceptable in line with national policy and where the building can be replaced 
without substantial alteration to the original footprint. 
 
 
300. In order to conserve the historic character and to ensure the 
sustainable continued use of serviceable buildings, the Council will support proposals for their reuse.  
 301. The most popular form of reusing rural buildings is for residential 
conversions; however housing development should be in line with the Council ’s spatial strategy and developed in the most sustainable 
locations. National policy states that isolated homes in the countryside should be avoided unless special circumstances apply.  A priority of the 
Local Plan is to promote the sustainability of rural communities and the 
diversification of the rural economy.  It is therefore considered that the 
reuse of rural buildings for economic or community purposes is the 
most preferable option.  
 302. Many traditional rural buildings provide habitats for bats, birds and 
other wildlife.  All bats and their roosts are protected under EU legislation and an ecological assessment will be required for all 
proposals where there is likely to be a bat or roost presence.  The 
details required in a bat survey are set out in the Local Validation 
Checklist. 
 303. Many disused rural buildings are of traditional design and contribute 
towards the area ’s historic landscape.  Good design, responsive to 
local building traditions and landscape character, is essential if 
converted buildings are to enhance, rather than compromise local 
sense-of-place.  The Council will expect the highest quality designs for 
conversions of redundant buildings.  English Heritage provide a range 
of publications which offer detailed guidance on how to achieve high 
quality conversions which respect the building ’s historic significance 
and are in keeping with the character of Allerdale ’s countryside.

132S32  Safeguarding Amenity 
 
304. What constitutes ‘amenity ’ is a wide ranging and flexible concept.  
Some aspects which affect amenity are practical and tangible such as traffic generation, pollution, noise, nuisance and even the way of life of 
a neighbourhood.  Other aspects are less clearly defined, such as 
expectations of standards of space, provision of facilities and social 
impacts of development.  The Council will seek to ensure that all 
development achieves a good standard of amenity for all existing and 
future occupants of land and buildings.  
 
S32  Safeguarding Amenity 
 
Support will be given for proposals which make a positive contribution to the 
area by maintaining or improving the quality of the environment and amenity.   
 
The development of new housing or other environmentally sensitive 
development will normally be resisted in locations where there is potential to 
incur statutory nuisance or  poor standards of residential amenity by virtue of 
impacts such as air pollution, noise, smell, dust, vibration, light or other 
pollution. 
 
Proposals will not be supported where they would: 
 
a. Result in pollution or hazards which prejudice the health and safety of 
communities and their environments, including nature conservation 
interests and the water environment which cannot be overcome by 
appropriate mitigation measures; 
b. Result in a detrimental effect on the local area in terms of visual 
amenity, distinctive character or environmental quality; 
c. Generate severe highway infrastructure or network problems in relation 
to access, road safety, traffic flow or car parking; 
d. Have an unacceptable effect on residential amenity and surrounding 
land uses in terms of loss of privacy as a result of overlooking, or 
increased sense of enclosure as a result of overbearing development 
or a loss of sunlight/daylight received by the property as a result of 
overshadowing; 
e. Cause significant adverse environmental impact in relation to 
landscape, biodiversity or geodiversity, cause pollution to the water 
environment or cause deterioration of the Water Framework Directive 
Classification Status; 
f. Unduly prejudice the satisfactory development or operation of adjoining 
land and/or the development of the surrounding area as a whole. 
 305. This policy aims to ensure that new developments do not harm the 
safety or amenity of existing and future residents or the natural environment. This includes minimising air, noise, light, water quality or 
odour pollution, that would be harmful to other land uses, human 
health, tranquillity or the natural and built environment. National policy Strategic Policies – Built and Historic Environment 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
133states that Councils should aim to avoid and mitigate the impacts of 
potential pollution associated with development. 
 306. The Plan Area contains a number of installations and forms of 
infrastructure that give rise to various forms of pollution and which involve the use of hazardous substances.  Where a proposed 
development is near to a site of major chemical hazard the Council has 
a duty to refer the application to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
who may advise against approval.  
 307. Not all proposals involving the introduction or increase in the use of 
hazardous substances on a site will require planning permission.  Where they do, the Council will, in consultation with the HSE and other 
appropriate bodies, seek to ensure that any risk to the safety of the 
public is minimal.  Similar considerations are also relevant when 
development is proposed in close proximity to hazardous installations.  
Where such proposals would entail a significant increase in the risk to 
public safety they will be resisted. Furthermore, proposals may be 
resisted where the nature of development will incur the creation of a 
HSE safety protection zone, such as PADHI, which may prejudice the 
potential future or allocated development nearby. 
 308. Both national and local policies for town centre development 
encourage a broad mix of uses within existing centres to promote vitality and viability.  However, some town centre uses such as pubs, 
clubs, restaurants and hot food takeaways have the potential to 
adversely impact upon the residential amenity of those living nearby. 
This is particularly relevant within the Plan Area as the majority of town 
centres have historic street patterns and therefore a high concentration 
of residential properties within the town centre boundaries.  The 
Council will seek to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved 
between town centre viability and residential amenity. Developments 
with the potential to create noise, odour, litter or any other nuisance will 
be resisted in close proximity to residential properties where the 
impacts cannot be successfully mitigated. 
 309. The Council will enter discussions with developers to guide potential 
nuisance creating proposals to less sensitive areas wherever possible.  Development which, either on its own or cumulatively, would result in 
noise, odour or light pollution, would harm environmental quality or 
would pose a risk to health and safety, which cannot be mitigated to an 
acceptable level, will be resisted.

S33  Landscape 
 
310. Allerdale has a distinctive and diverse landscape covering an area that 
incorporates the Solway Coast Area Of Natural Beauty (AONB) in the north west, and the Lake District fells in the east. As well as the 
nationally protected AONB, the wider Plan Area has large tracts of 
unspoilt countryside that are both highly scenic and vulnerable and 
require protection from development pressures.  These include the 
coastal plain areas outside of the AONB, the lowland fells and river 
corridors on the fringe of the Lake District.  The character and beauty 
of the landscape significantly improves the quality of life of residents, 
and has major social and health benefits.  It is also a major attraction 
for those wishing to visit, or locate to the area, thereby performing an 
important role for the local economy. 
 
S33 Landscape 
 
The landscape character and local distinctiveness of the Plan Area shall be 
protected, conserved and, wherever possible, enhanced.  
 
An assessment of the impact on the landscape character will be required for 
all major residential, commercial and industrial developments and may also 
be required for any other development which the Council considers may 
impact upon the landscape, particularly within sensitive or protected areas.  
 
Cumbria Landscape Character Assessment Toolkit (or successor documents) 
will be used to inform the detailed assessment of individual proposals. 
Proposals for development should be compatible with the distinctive 
characteristics and features of Cumbria ’s landscape types and sub types. 
Proposals will be assessed in relation to: 
 
a) locally distinctive natural or built features, 
b) visual intrusion or impact, 
c) scale in relation to the landscape and features, 
d) the character of the built environment, 
e) public access and community value of the landscape, 
f) historic patterns and attributes, 
g) biodiversity features, ecological networks and semi-natural habitats, 
and 
h) openness, remoteness and tranquillity. 
 
The Council will support proposals that involve the removal or a reduction in 
the impact of existing structures and land uses that are detrimental to the 
visual quality of the landscape.  
 Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
136311. This policy supports the Strategic Objectives, setting out the Council ’s 
approach to the protection and enhancement of the distinctive and 
sensitive landscapes within the Plan Area. 
 312. The Plan Area contains a diverse range of landscape types, all of 
which are valued for their intrinsic character and beauty.  Many areas of the Plan Area are protected by national designations such as the 
AONB as well as serving as habitats and wildlife corridors which are 
also protected by international, national and local designations such as 
the Natura 2000, SSSIs and County Wildlife sites. Proposals for 
development which may impact upon the landscape will be judged 
against the policy criteria and decisions will be informed by the 
Cumbria Landscape Character Assessment toolkit, having regard for 
the designated status of the landscape and its contribution to the wider 
ecological network.  All major applications will be expected to provide a 
landscape assessment, proportionate to the scale and expected impact 
of the development in relation to the surrounding character and 
context.  
 313. It is the Council ’s intention to produce further guidance on landscape 
character at a district level in order to inform decision making through the development management process.  
 314. The requirement for an application to be accompanied by Landscape 
Character Assessments will be determined by the Council and set out in the Local Validation Checklist.

137S34  Development in the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty 
 
315. A significant area of coastal land in the north west of the Plan Area is 
within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated as nationally important because of its landscape quality.  
The Council, with partners, have adopted a Management Plan to 
secure the ongoing conservation and enhancement of the area whilst 
providing a vision for the future role of the AONB and a guide for 
appropriate development. 
 
S34 Development in the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty 
 
All development within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
must conserve and/or enhance the distinctive landscape character, quality 
and heritage of the area.  
 
When considering proposals for development within the AONB, the Council 
will ensure that development is in accordance with the aims and objectives of 
the Solway Coast AONB Management Plan.  
 
Proposals both within or adjoining the AONB will be expected to have regard 
to the Solway Coast AONB Landscape and Seascape Character Assessment 
and ensure; 
 
a) The scale, siting or design of proposed development is appropriate to 
the landscape setting; 
b) Existing landscape features are incorporated in a way which preserves 
or enhances the character of the area and mitigates the effects of 
development. 
 
Planning permission for major developments within the AONB will be 
considered in accordance with national policy and will be resisted except 
where exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated. 
  
316. This policy supports Strategic Objectives, setting out the Councils 
intention to provide the highest level of protection to the nationally designated landscape of the Solway Coast AONB. 
 317. The Council wishes to promote the AONB as an area to be enjoyed by 
both residents and visitors.  Easy access to the coast and countryside for walking and cycling is beneficial to the local population to promote 
healthy lifestyles, and to the local economy in attracting visitors and 
tourism expenditure.  The AONB contains highly sensitive landscapes, 
an abundance of international, national and locally important wildlife 
species and habitats and important heritage assets (including Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
138Hadrian ’s Wall World Heritage Site), which are vulnerable to harm from 
even small scale development and visitor pressures.  
 
318. This policy sets out the Local Plan ’s priority of conserving and 
enhancing the AONB whilst allowing development where it meet these goals. Development for tourist accommodation and facilities will be 
encouraged towards the Key and Local Service Centres of Silloth, 
Aspatria and Allonby, wherever possible, to help relieve pressure upon 
the sensitive areas of the AONB.

139S35 Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity and Geodiversity 
 
319. Allerdale has an abundance of biodiversity and geodiversity assets.  
There are a number of internationally protected areas under EU Habitats and Birds Directives, collectively known as Natura 2000 sites, 
as well as many areas of national and county importance. A key priority 
of the Local Plan is to promote sustainable development whilst 
conserving and enhancing biodiversity and geodiversity. 
 
S35 Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity and Geodiversity 
 
Conditions for biodiversity will be maintained and improved and important 
geodiversity assets will be protected. Nationally and internationally protected 
sites and species will be afforded the highest level of protection. A high 
priority is also given to the protection of locally identified biodiversity or 
ecologically valuable assets. The Council will seek positive improvements to 
the quality of the natural environmental through sustainable development 
resulting in net gains for biodiversity across the Plan Area. 
 
Developments, projects and activities will be expected to:  
 
a) Protect and enhance key ecological habitats and wildlife corridors and 
stepping stones including watercourses and wetlands;  
b) Maintain, and where appropriate enhance, conditions for priority 
habitats and species identified in the Cumbria and UK Biodiversity 
Action Plan Priority Species and habitats or the Cumbria Biodiversity 
Data Centre at Tullie House;  
c) Maintain and where appropriate enhance recognised geodiversity 
assets identified in the Local Geodiversity Action Plan for Cumbria;  
d) Protect soil and water resources in line with Policy S36;  
e) Contribute to Allerdale ’s green infrastructure network in line with Policy 
S24; 
f) Protect existing trees, hedgerows and woodland (including ancient 
trees and hedgerows) that are considered important to the local 
community, contribute positively to the character of the area and/or are 
of a nature conservation value. 
 
Development that present significant economic or social benefits for the local 
community may be permitted where the Council, in consultation with relevant 
partner organisations are satisfied that any necessary impacts can be 
mitigated or compensated through appropriate habitat creation, restoration or 
enhancement on site or elsewhere secured via planning conditions, 
agreements or obligations. Where a development poses significant harm to an 
irreplaceable habitat which cannot be mitigated or compensated for, 
permission will be refused. 
 320. The sites of biodiversity and geodiversity importance within the Plan 
Area comprise a hierarchy of international, national, regional and locally important areas.   Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
140 
321. The Solway Firth Marine Site comprising Upper Solway Flats and 
Marshes SPA/Ramsar sites and, Solway Firth SAC, South Solway Mosses and the River Derwent and River Derwent and Bassenthwaite 
Lake SAC including the River Derwent corridors are considered to be 
key sites within the Plan Area, being of international importance and 
classified as Natura 2000 sites.   
 322. There are also many nationally, regionally and locally important Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Regionally Important Geological and Geomorphological sites (RIGGs) and County Wildlife sites. 
 323. As well as these officially designated areas, it is important to recognise 
that valuable natural assets, particularly those related to biodiversity, can be found in both the rural and urban settings across the Plan Area.  
Vacant previously developed land can provide ideal habitats in which 
plant and animal wildlife can thrive, especially if left undeveloped and 
undisturbed.  Furthermore, existing features of green infrastructure 
such as parks, roadside verges and even domestic gardens create a 
network of biodiversity corridors and stepping stones in which wildlife 
can both reside in and travel through.  Therefore, there is a need to 
ensure that development within both rural and urban areas does not 
damage habitats or encroach upon land forming part of the wider 
network of wildlife habitats. It should be noted that development which 
falls within 8m of a watercourse designated as a main river requires 
approval by the Environment Agency. 
 324. There are significant consequences for the long-term protection and 
adaptability of biodiversity and the ability of wildlife and habitats to respond to climate change. There is a need to expand and re-connect 
the existing areas and restore habitats where they have been 
destroyed. Development proposals should be accompanied by 
sufficient information to assess the effects of development on protected 
sites, species, biodiversity or geology, together with any proposed 
prevention, mitigation or compensation measures. They will need to 
demonstrate that they will not adversely impact upon nationally and 
internationally designated sites. The requirement for ecological 
assessments are set out within the Council ’s Local Validation 
Checklist. 
 
325. As part of the Site Allocations process, potential for adverse impacts on 
Natura 2000 sites will be an important consideration when choosing and prioritising sites for development.  The first priority is to avoid 
development sites with the potential to create adverse impacts on 
Natura 2000 sites.  Such sites will not be selected unless it can be 
demonstrated at the time of site selection that these impacts can be 
mitigated using techniques with a demonstrable record of success 
elsewhere. Development will not be approved where the potential 
effect(s) on any Natura 2000 site(s) cannot be avoided or successfully 
mitigated. Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
141 
326. The Council will work with partners, including Cumbria County Council 
and the Cumbria Local Nature Partnership, to identify and map components of the local ecological networks, informed by the Cumbria 
Biodiversity Action Plan and the Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre.  
The Council will work with the Cumbria Local Nature Partnership to 
identify potential Nature Improvement Areas and produce a strategy for 
the creation, protection, enhancement and management of networks in 
the area.  The Council will also produce a Green Infrastructure SPD to 
identify deficiencies in the GI network, deliver the creation of new GI 
assets and ensure the optimum integration between green networks 
and developments.

142S36 Air, Water and Soil Quality 
 
327. Allerdale has relatively low levels of pollution due to the rural nature of 
the area and, to date, no Air Quality Management Areas have been designated.  Air quality in both urban and rural areas is constantly 
threatened by pollution from human activity.  This policy sets out the 
Councils approach to ensuring that air and water quality are protected 
and enhanced, and that soil quality is maintained and not eroded. 
 
S36 Air, Water and Soil Quality 
 
The quality of air and water resources within the Plan Area will be protected 
and opportunities for enhancement will be pursued. 
 
Unless adequate mitigation measures can be secured, development 
proposals will be resisted that would have a demonstrable direct and/or 
indirect adverse impact on; 
 
a) Air quality and/or atmospheric conditions;  
b) The characteristics of surrounding soils and substrata - through either 
physical (compaction, erosion) or chemical (pollution, contamination);  
c) The chemical composition and quality of waterbodies in the Plan Area; 
d) The Water Framework Directive and the status of the watercourse. 
Whilst having regard for the economic and other benefits of the best and most 
versatile land, where development is considered necessary, the Council will 
seek to ensure the use of poorer quality land in preference to that of a higher 
quality. 
 328. Although pollutants associated with the burning of fossil fuels for 
domestic and industrial purposes have declined nationally, pollutants and particularly particulates produced mainly by motor vehicles have 
increased.  In Allerdale, traffic congestion in some of the larger 
settlements combined with atmospheric conditions, can give rise to 
periodic localised air quality issues. 
 329. Land quality varies from place to place. The Agricultural Land 
Classification (ALC) provides a method for assessing the quality of 
farmland to enable informed choices to be made about its future use 
and thus helps underpin the principles of sustainable development. The 
ALC system classifies land into five grades, with Grade 3 subdivided 
into Subgrades 3a and 3b. The best and most versatile land is 
catagorised as Grades 1, 2 and 3a. This is the land which is most 
flexible, productive and efficient in response to inputs and which can 
best deliver crops for food and non food uses. The Council will ensure 
that the best and most versatile land is safeguarded wherever possible 
from development. 
 330. Almost the entire Plan Area is covered by the River Derwent catchment Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
143area, which incorporates four significant river systems (Derwent, Ellen, 
Wampool and Waver) which drain the northern fells of the Lake District 
and the Solway Basin into the Irish Sea.  These are sensitive water 
courses with sites of important nature conservation and biodiversity.  
The quality of bathing water around the coast also has economic 
implications as the quality and cleanliness, or perceived cleanliness, 
has direct impacts upon visitor numbers, particularly those wishing to 
take part in outdoor recreational activities such as kite surfing.  The 
Council will ensure that river and sea water quality continues to meet 
the standards and objectives set out in the EU Water Framework 
Directive and North West River Basin Management Plan.

144S37 Shoreline Management and Coastal Development 
 
331. The coastline is one of Allerdale ’s most valuable economic, social, 
environmental and historic assets.  The outstanding scenery, 
seascapes and harbours attract visitors, the ports are an important 
source of employment and commerce; the miles of beaches and 
shores provide free access for local residents to enjoy outdoor 
recreation and sports and the numerous internationally protected 
wildlife and habitat designations are an extremely important 
environmental resource. 
 332. The potential impacts of climate change, such as coastal flooding, 
coastal erosion and habitat change affect a diverse range of human economic activities including recreation and tourism, ports and 
shipping, transport and commerce. 
 
S37 Shoreline Management and Coastal Development 
 
Any proposals for new dwellings or conversion of existing buildings to 
residential use will not be permitted in the Coastal Change Management Area 
identified on the Proposals Map. 
 
Proposals for new community facilities, commercial and business uses will 
only be permitted in the Coastal Change Management Area in circumstances 
where: 
 
a) The need for a coastal location can be justified and; 
b) A Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment has been submitted that 
confirms that there will be no increased risk to life or significant 
increase in risk to property.  
Proposals for new or replacement coastal defence schemes will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that the works are consistent with the 
management approach for the frontage presented in the relevant Shoreline 
Management Plan and there will be no material adverse impact on the 
environment. 
 
Proposals for the relocation and replacement of community facilities, 
commercial business uses and dwellings that are under significant threat of 
collapse due to coastal erosion will be permitted, provided that:  
 
c) The replacement building[s] is located an appropriate distance inland 
with regard to the Coastal Change Management Area indicated on the 
proposals map and other information in the relevant Shoreline 
Management Plan and, where possible, it is in a location that is close 
to the coastal community from which it was displaced;  
d) The replacement building[s] is of a comparable size in terms of volume 
and floorspace to the existing building[s]; Strategic Policies – Natural Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
145e) The existing site is either cleared and made safe or put to a temporary 
use beneficial to the local community;  
f) The proposal does not have a detrimental impact upon the landscape, 
heritage, townscape or biodiversity of the area.  
 
333. The North West England and North Wales Shoreline Management Plan 
sets out a strategy for managing risks from flooding and coast erosion along the Allerdale coastline. Coastal Change Management Areas are 
identified on the Proposals Map and are shown in Appendix 5.  
 334. The southern section, which includes the towns and ports of 
Workington and Maryport, are key coastal centres and consequently, these areas will be protected into the long term.  The Cumbria Coastal 
Railway runs adjacent to the coastline between Whitehaven and 
Maryport and therefore the need to provide protection from flooding 
and erosion along this section will also be necessary. In contrast, the 
long term plan for the majority of the northern section of the coastline is 
to allow for a naturally evolving shoreline by enabling sediment to build 
up on beaches and allow the dunes to evolve unconstrained as a 
natural defence. 
 335. This policy sets out the Council ’s approach to shoreline management 
and development near the coast.  This approach is considered the most appropriate as it will contribute to reducing costly erosion control 
measures through a system of managed retreat.  Effective shoreline 
management policies will also help to maintain the natural shoreline 
dynamics and preserve important coastal environments.  
 336. An Assessment of Likely Significant Effect should be carried out on any 
developments with potential for impacting directly or indirectly on Natura 2000 sites. Appropriate Assessment will be required for any 
development with a likely significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where 
proposals have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites that 
cannot be made acceptable through mitigation they should not be 
allowed to go ahead. Where mitigation is proposed, measures should 
be clearly defined and where appropriate secured by planning 
obligations.

DM1  Housing Renewal and Empty Properties  
 
In areas of housing market failure and where there are empty properties the 
Council will work closely with partners, including the local community, to 
identify ways in which the neighbourhoods can be strengthened and returned 
to prosperity. 
 
In areas of low demand or unsustainable housing, the Council will encourage 
proposals that involve; 
 
a) Improvement and refurbishment of existing housing stock; 
b) The delivery of new housing that would improve the social mix of the 
area; 
c) Environmental improvements, enhancement of public realm, access 
and open space. 
 
The Council will normally seek to resist the demolition of existing housing 
stock where possible and will expect the potential for refurbishment and re-
use to be fully explored. In cases where the Council is satisfied that 
refurbishment is economically unviable, unlikely to reverse the market failure 
or where clearance will enable a wider regeneration project the proposals will 
be supported.  
 
In considering planning applications for the demolition of residential 
development, the Council will seek appropriate level of site restoration. Large 
clearance projects will be expected to demonstrate that suitable alternative 
use has been secured. 
 
337. The Council recognise that for some areas of Allerdale housing 
renewal and empty properties are important issues that need to be tackled in order to ensure communities have access to successful 
places and good quality housing. Bringing empty properties back into 
use and improving the quality of housing on offer is key to helping 
achieve sustainable and mixed neighbourhoods and helps provide 
quality housing for the current and future communities.

149DM2  Rural Workers Dwellings  
 
Proposals for the construction of rural worker ’s dwellings outside defined 
settlement will be supported provided it can be demonstrated that there is an 
essential need for a rural worker to live permanently at, or near to their place 
of work. 
 
New permanent dwellings in the countryside for rural workers will only be 
permitted where the business unit is established and has been profitable and 
economically viable for at least three years and; 
 
a) There are no other dwellings or buildings locally which could be re-
used to fulfil the need; 
b) Where a need has been identified, a rural workers’  dwelling, should be 
of a size, cost and construction commensurate with the established 
functional requirement. 
 
For newly-established rural enterprises the Council may consider the 
stationing of a caravan or other form of temporary accommodation on the site 
for a limited period of time to allow the viability of the holding or enterprise to 
be proven over a three year period. In such cases a robust business plan will 
be required in addition to fulfilling the criteria set out above. 
 
Dwellings permitted under this policy will be subject to an occupancy condition 
limiting occupancy to; a person solely, mainly or last working in the original 
qualifying business enterprise, a surviving spouse or partner of such a person, 
or any resident dependants.  
 
Proposals for the removal of occupancy conditions would only be permitted if 
the applicant can demonstrate that long term need for a Rural Workers 
Dwelling has ceased, and the Council is satisfied that the dwelling has been 
sufficiently marketed.  
 
Where the removal of occupancy condition has been justified, the Council 
may require it to be replaced by an alternative condition to enable the dwelling 
to meet an identified local affordable need.  
 
338. The spatial strategy S3 directs development to defined settlements 
across the Plan Area, and seeks to avoid isolated new homes unless there are special circumstances. One such exception is for the 
essential need for a rural worker, such as those employed in 
agriculture, forestry or other land based industries to live permanently 
at, or near their place of work in the countryside.  
 339. Restrictions on the removal of occupancy conditions on rural workers 
dwellings are used to restrict residential developments that otherwise would not have been acceptable in the rural locations. If it can be 
satisfactorily evidenced that there is no long-term need for the dwelling 
for the purposes for which it was originally permitted then occupancy 
conditions can be removed and in the first instance offered to meet an Development Management Policies – Housing

150identified local affordable need. This reflects the significant affordable 
housing shortage that is especially evident in some rural areas.

340. It is important to retain a good mix of employment sites that make a 
contribution to existing and future employment. Many of the higher 
quality and local sites are subject to development pressure for 
conversion to other uses such as residential and retail.  
 341. Policy DM3 protects existing and allocated employment sites against 
non-employment uses to help ensure that there is a sufficient supply of DM3 Protection of Employment Sites 
Proposals for redevelopment or to de-allocate existing employment sites or 
land, to an alternative use may be granted where the applicant has 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that; 
a) All or part of the site does not, and could not be reasonably be 
upgraded to meet the current or long term needs of modern business; 
b) The loss of the site would not significantly impact upon the long term 
supply of the Plan Area employment land in terms of quality and 
quantity; 
c) It would not undermine the spatial strategy of the local plan. 
 
In circumstances where land is released from employment use, the Council 
will give due regard to market signals and give preference to the following in 
sequence: 
 
d) A mix of employment and non-employment uses excluding residential; 
such as schemes that incorporate social infrastructure including 
compatible D1 uses such as education and training facilities, day 
centres, clinics and health centres; 
e) A mix of uses which provide employment opportunities will be preferred 
to single-use residential development. In the lower tier of the settlement 
hierarchy live/work units will be supported; 
f) Proposals for change to single-use residential use will only be 
considered where it can be demonstrated that criteria d) and e) has 
been satisfied, and; 
g) Only on sites within settlements that accord with the spatial strategy 
and are defined in the Settlement Hierarchy ; and  
h) Where applicants have considered the local housing allocation and 
provide robust evidence that there are no suitable alternatives for the 
proposal. 
 
In all cases the proposal must not compromise the character and function of 
the surrounding area, and should be consistent with other relevant Local Plan 
policies. Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
152employment land to meet the areas economic development 
requirements over the plan period.  
 342. Evidence from the Employment Land and Premises Study (2009) and 
the Employment Update (2012) suggests that Allerdale has an excess of employment sites and, while much of the land remains suitable for 
modern business, there are other areas where a more appropriate land 
use may be preferable. It is important to retain employment sites that 
currently make a contribution to local employment, as well as retaining 
important or valuable sites for future employment uses. Consideration 
of the supply of employment sites, including de-allocation will be 
undertaken in a consistent manner in the Site Allocation DPD. 
 343. This policy provides positive guidance as to what would be acceptable 
and what would not, setting out a general presumption against alternative uses on these sites. If there is sufficient evidence that 
justifies the development of employment sites for alternative uses, the 
policy provides a sequential approach for consideration of mixed uses 
which offer greater potential benefits to the community in meeting local 
business and employment needs. Single uses are only considered 
thereafter, if robust evidence demonstrates that mixed uses are not 
possible. And in all cases the proposed use of the site must be 
compatible with neighbouring land uses, including business and 
industrial activity that remains in the vicinity.

153DM4 Expansion and Intensification of Employment Sites 
 
Proposals to expand or intensify existing employment sites will be permitted 
where: 
 
a) The scale of the development will not cause a significant adverse effect 
on; transport, housing, provision of services, neighbouring uses, or the 
conservation of the environment, Natura 2000 sites, or historic assets; 
and 
b) There will not be material harm to the amenity of local residents; and  
c) Effective measures have been agreed to address increased traffic 
movements such as encouraging modal shift; and 
d) The proposal accords with the other relevant Local Plan policies.  
 
Where sites are located in primarily residential areas and proposals would 
cause overriding problems, the Council will seek to assist in identifying 
alternative sustainable locations with a preference for allocated employment 
sites and previously developed land that would be more appropriate for the 
resulting activity.  
 
344. Providing support for existing and future businesses is crucial to 
securing the long-term growth and resilience of the local economy. Supporting the continued growth and success of existing businesses is 
a key aim of the plan. This includes the expansion and intensification of 
activities on, or adjoining existing sites. In supporting such 
development, there is a need to give clear guidance as to how the 
Council will assess such development. 
 345. This Policy supports delivery of S12 and encourages expansion and 
intensification of existing employments sites providing that there are no unacceptable impacts.  It sets out proactive policy framework to ensure 
that businesses are encouraged to grow and are able to adapt to

154DM5 Farm Diversification 
 
Proposals for the diversification of farm and other land-based enterprises will 
be permitted where: 
 
a) The character, scale and nature of the proposal can be satisfactorily 
integrated into the rural landscape; 
b) There is not a significant adverse effect on amenity, biodiversity and 
geodiveristy or Natura 2000 sites; 
c) The development conserves and enhances the historic environment 
and historic assets; 
d) The proposal forms part of a comprehensive diversification scheme 
and is operated as part of a sustainable farm or appropriate land-based 
enterprise and will contribute to making the existing business viable; 
e) The proposal will not undermine viability of services within the 
settlement or retail hierarchy; 
f) The proposal should make use of existing buildings wherever possible 
and where new or replacement buildings are required, the development 
is in scale with the surroundings and well related to any existing 
buildings on the site;  
g) Effective measures have been agreed to address increased traffic 
movements. 
 
Development should be of appropriate design, scale and appearance and 
should not be detrimental to the rural character of the area in terms of visual 
impact, traffic and other activity generated or other impacts. 
 
346. The agricultural sector remains an important part of Allerdale ’s 
economy, in particular, in the rural north of the Plan Area.  The Council seeks to support the ongoing viability of agricultural and other land 
based enterprises because of the benefits to the sustainability of the 
rural area.   
 347. Farm diversification may involve various type of enterprise, including 
the introduction of different methods of agricultural production, the use of new crops, adding value to farm products, tourism, recreation, farm 
shops and leasing land or buildings to non-agricultural businesses. 
 348. By encouraging economic and agricultural diversification, it is important 
that the countryside is not damaged by unrestrained and inappropriate development. Therefore, diversification proposals should be of a scale 
and nature appropriate to the location and be capable of satisfactory 
integration into the rural landscape. Such proposals should seek to re-
use existing buildings wherever possible and have regard to the 
amenity and impacts on neighbouring uses.  
 349. Proposals for diversification must be accompanied by a comprehensive 
farm diversification plan, which indicates how new uses will assist in retaining the viability of the farm and the agricultural enterprise, and Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
155how it complements other short or long term business plans for the 
farm.

156DM6 Equestrian and Agricultural Buildings  
Proposals for stables, equestrian activities and agricultural buildings in the 
countryside will be permitted provided: 
a) New development is, where possible, closely related to existing farm 
buildings or other groups of buildings, and where this is not possible, 
development is designed and sited to minimise impact on the 
landscape setting;  
b) Buildings respect and enhance the rural character of the local area in 
terms of design, scale, siting, external appearance and construction 
materials;  
c) It can be demonstrated that there is not a significant adverse effect 
on:  
i. Local amenity (light, air quality/emissions, noise, odour, water  
pollution); 
ii. Landscape and visual qualities such as the character and 
sensitivity of the surrounding landscape;  
iii. Nature conservation features, biodiversity and geodiversity, such 
as Natura 2000 sites, protected habitats and species, sites of 
international and national nature conservation value, including 
features outside the sites boundaries that may be affected by 
the proposal and the activities that result;  
iv. Historic assets. 
d)  The proposal includes appropriate measures for the disposal of 
manure and waste; and 
e)  Proposals for larger scale private or commercial equestrian enterprises 
or agricultural businesses should; 
 i)  be well related to the primary road network; and 
 ii)  not compromise highway safety or the free flow of traffic; and  
 iii)  provide an adequate level of off road facilities to allow operation of 
the business. 
 
 
350. Equestrian and agricultural developments often require a countryside 
location; however, new buildings can either individually or cumulatively have an adverse impact on the rural character and environmental 
quality of the area. Stable blocks, equine facilities and agricultural buildings on open undeveloped land can appear isolated and intrusive 
and once established can lead to intensification of uses on the site. 
 351. Equestrian activities have the potential to cause damage beyond their 
site boundaries through activities such as trekking and hacking.  Therefore, proposals for equestrian development will be assessed on 
the impact of development and subsequent use on surrounding 
habitats and species, in addition to assessing those within site 
boundaries.  
 352. This policy aims to provide a positive planning framework for 
sustainable development that supports traditional land-based activities Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
157and seeks to maximise opportunities for new leisure and recreational 
activity that can require a countryside location. Where new buildings 
are justified they should be located where they are not damaging to the 
character and appearance of the countryside, and do not form 
prominent elements of the landscape.  Proposals should ensure the 
amenities of local communities are protected and any specific impacts 
of this type of development are minimal.

158DM7 Town Centre Development 
 
Within Town Centres, proposals for large scale retail development must 
ensure adequate provision for a range of small shops to ensure a good mix of 
retail floorspace, to provide opportunities for small independent retailers and 
to avoid the over dominance of national brands at the expense of town centre 
diversity and distinctiveness. 
 
Uses that support the evening economy within town centres will be supported 
where proposals will not have an adverse effect on the amenity of nearby 
uses, and surrounding residential areas. When assessing proposals which 
may have a potentially harmful affect on local amenity (such as restaurants, 
cafes, betting shops, amusement centres, casinos, nightclubs, drinking 
establishments and hot food takeaways) the Council may impose conditions 
to control: 
 
a) The hours of opening; 
b) The effectiveness of measures to mitigate odour, noise and litter 
nuisance from the premises. 
 
Proposals for improvement and replacement of shop fronts will be supported 
where the design is consistent with the materials and form of the existing 
building (s) of which it would form part and takes account of any predominant 
architectural style and materials in the surrounding area.  Any new shop front 
should have an appropriately scaled and detailed framework consisting of 
fascia, projecting columns and stall-riser. Proposals incorporating external 
roller shutters and/or grilles will not be supported.   
 
353. This policy supports Policy S16 and sets out more detailed guidance 
on appropriate development within defined town centres. 
 
354. The Council will support improvements to the town centre environment 
by promoting high quality, well connected and inclusive design for all development, including public and private buildings and areas of public 
realm and open space. New retail developments should be designed to 
ensure that they are integrated well with the surrounding town centre, 
are not inwardly facing or self contained and provide convenient 
linkages for pedestrians to access other areas of the town centre.  
Green infrastructure in the form of trees, parks, and amenity open 
spaces significantly improve the aesthetic and functional attractiveness 
of a town centre, as well as providing valuable habitats and stepping 
stones for wildlife. The Council will seek to enhance and protect the 
green spaces within town centres. 
 355. Well designed shopfronts and buildings not only have a positive impact 
upon the character of a town centre, but also upon safety and perceptions of safety.  Well lit, occupied and overlooked streets provide 
natural surveillance and reduce the fear of crime.  The use of external 
shopfront shutters will be resisted as they have a negative impact upon 
the streetscene, are susceptible to graffiti and do not reflect light as Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
159windows do.  Developers will be encouraged to use internal shutters 
wherever possible as these do not mask the external appearance of 
the frontage, are not vulnerable to vandalism and benefit from 
permitted development. 
 356. The Council will promote not only a broad mix of uses, but also a good 
balance between national retailers and small local traders to offer a diverse shopping experience and avoid an over saturation of similar 
national brands.   The Council will ensure that proposals for medium or 
large scale retail redevelopments within town centres will provide a mix 
of retail floorspace including small units which will be suitable for local 
independent traders.   
 357. Uses which keep the town centre active and vibrant in the evening as 
well as through the day time, such as restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres will be actively encouraged.  A successful evening economy 
not only improves the image of the area to visitors as an attractive 
destination, but improves the quality of life for residents.  Evening uses 
can significantly improve the vitality and viability of the town centre but 
they can also have detrimental impacts upon nearby residents due to 
noise, odour, litter and anti-social behaviour, if not properly managed.  
The Council will seek to ensure an appropriate balance is achieved 
between town centre viability and residential amenity and proposals for 
which unacceptable impacts cannot be appropriately mitigated, either 
through the proposal itself or by conditions, will be resisted in 
accordance with Policy S32.

160DM8 Protecting Town Centre Vitality and Viability 
Sequential Approach 
 
Proposals for main town centre uses will be approved within the town centre 
boundaries as defined within the Proposals Map and Appendix 4. Applications 
for these uses, or extensions of existing uses (extensions over 200sqm) 
outside of the defined centres will be refused where the applicant has not 
demonstrated compliance with the sequential approach to site selection as set 
out in national policy. 
 
Impact Assessments 
 
Further to complying with the sequential approach, an impact assessment 
may be required for certain proposals outside of a defined town centre to 
assess the full extent of potential adverse impacts upon the existing town 
centre.   
 
Proposals for retail, leisure or office development above the thresholds shown 
in the table below will require an impact assessment. 
 
Town  
Threshold 
Workington 500sqm 
Maryport 300sqm 
Cockermouth 300sqm 
Wigton 300sqm 
Maryport 300sqm 
Cockermouth 300sqm 
Aspatria 100sqm 
Silloth 100sqm 
Figure 13 Impact Test Threshold by Settlement  
Proposals for retail, leisure and office development up to and including the 
above thresholds will generally be regarded as being of a scale that would not 
result in significant adverse impacts. 
Where Impact Assessments present evidence of significant adverse impacts 
on an existing town centre, development will be refused. 
 
Out of Centre Exceptions 
Proposals for small scale retail, leisure or office development within rural 
villages or neighbourhood parades will not normally be required to apply the 
sequential approach where they are contributing to the sustainability of a rural 
or small community. Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
161Proposals for specialist forms of retail development may be acceptable in 
circumstances where it can be clearly demonstrated that the nature of the 
business requires an out-of-centre location. Applicants will still be required to 
demonstrate that the proposal uses the most sequentially preferable site 
available.  
Proposals for small scale specialist retail services will be permitted outside of 
town centres only where it can be demonstrated that the proposal is to 
perform a wholly ancillary role to an existing or planned use. The maximum 
size of the unit permitted will not exceed 50sqm. 
Where planning permission is granted for any out-of-centre development, 
conditions may be used to: 
a) Prevent amalgamation of small units to create large out-of-centre units; 
b) Limit internal alterations by specifying the maximum floorspace 
permitted; 
c) Control the type of goods sold. 
 
358. National policy recognises that town centres are at the heart of 
sustainable communities and clearly states that they should be the 
preferred location for retail, leisure and other town centre uses.  The 
vitality and viability of town centres is also a key priority for the Council. 
Development of town centres uses will therefore be expected to be 
located within the boundaries of defined town centres in accordance 
with the approaches set out in this policy. 
 359. This policy supports S16 and provides further details as to the 
measures required to ensure the vitality and viability of town centres. 
 
360. A key Government and Council objective is to promote and protect the 
vitality and viability of town centres and to deliver strong high streets.  To achieve this aim national policy sets out the requirement for a 
sequential approach to town centre uses which are proposed outside of 
existing centres. 
 361. The Council will require that main town centre uses are located in 
existing town centres, then in edge of centre locations.  Only if suitable sites are not available will out-of-centre sites be considered.  When 
considering edge-of-centre and out-of-centre proposals, preference will 
be given to accessible sites that are well connected to the town centre 
and public transport links.  The Council will require applicants to 
demonstrate flexibility in relation to issues such as format and scale. 
 362. Further to the sequential approach for site selection, national policy 
requires that certain proposals for retail, leisure or office developments outside of town centres may also require an impact assessment.  The 
purpose of an impact assessment is to measure and, where possible, 
quantify the potential negative impacts of development on existing town 
centre vitality and viability, such as reduction in footfall, or increased 
vacancies. 
 Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
162363. National policy sets as default threshold of 2,500sqm, however it also 
supports proportionate, locally set thresholds where appropriate.  
Given the largely rural nature of the Plan Area and the small size of its 
centres, it is considered that developments of a much smaller scale 
than the national default could have a detrimental impact upon town 
centre vitality and viability and that locally set thresholds are 
appropriate.  
 364. In order to inform the provision of locally appropriate floorspace 
thresholds, analysis of the typical scale of floorspace and development proposal within each of the centres has been carried out.  The details 
of this analysis, methodology and justification are set out in the Town 
Centre Reviews (2012).   
 365. The requirement for sequential and impact tests does not apply to 
small scale proposals in rural and local communities where the development would contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the 
settlement and provide a service that meets peoples day to day needs. 
The Council will encourage the provision of such proposals in 
accordance with Policy S26.  
 366. The Council also recognises that, by their nature, not all retail 
operations are suited to town centre locations.  Proposals for stores selling bulky goods such as DIY, furniture, carpets and domestic 
appliances may be better located outside of town centres where they 
are less likely to cause traffic problems and where customers will 
realistically expect to use private vehicles to collect goods directly from 
the shop. This is particularly relevant given the rural nature of the Plan 
Area where retailers of agricultural equipment and supplies may 
struggle to locate within an existing town.  Operators will still be 
required to seek the most sequentially preferable sites or locate where 
there are existing clusters of similar types of operation to improve 
sustainability and the likelihood of linked trips. 
 367. Some forms of specialist retailing may also be acceptable where they 
are located purely to provide an ancillary service to an existing or planned use, for example a chandler at a harbour, or a small food 
vendor on a fully established employment site.  The scale of such 
proposals will be limited to 50sqm to ensure that the stores do not 
attract custom away from town centres.

164DM9 Town Centre Frontages 
 
Primary Frontages 
Primary frontages are defined where retail development is concentrated. 
These are designated, where considered appropriate, to manage the different 
town centre uses and protect areas of the centre where the singular or 
cumulative loss of retail may be considered to have a detrimental impact upon 
vitality and viability. Applications for uses not defined as main town centre 
uses on the ground floor will be refused. 
  
Where primary frontages have been defined, applications for change of use 
from retail (A1 Use Class) to a non retail (main town centre uses excluding A1 
Use Class) will be determined on a case by case basis after assessing the 
proposal in relation to existing non-retail uses in the area. Applications which, 
either singularly or cumulatively, result in an over concentration or 
coalescence of non-retail uses on a single street parade will be refused. 
 
Secondary Frontages 
Where Secondary Frontages have been defined, applications for change of 
use will be determined on a case by case basis after assessing the proposal 
in the context of the existing uses in the street parade.  Applications for uses 
not defined as main town centre uses at ground floor level will be refused.   
 
Applications which, either singularly or cumulatively, result in an over 
concentration or coalescence of units within Use Classes A5 or B1 will also be 
refused. 
 
 
For both primary and secondary frontages, in order to guide decisions relating 
to actual numbers that constitute over concentration and/or coalescence and 
the impact resulting from this, the following criteria will be taken into account: 
 
a) The location and prominence of the premises within the frontage; 
b) The floorspace and length of frontage of the premises; 
c) The number, distribution and proximity:- 
d) For primary: to other non-A1 use class premises (or with consent for 
such use) within the frontage in question and throughout the town 
centre; 
e) For secondary: to other main town centre uses within the frontage and 
throughout the town centre. 
f) The character and nature of the use proposed, including the level of 
pedestrian activity associated with it; 
g) The level of vacancies; and 
h) Whether the proposed use would give rise to noise, smell or other 
environmental problems. 
 
368. The designation of primary and secondary frontages within town 
centres allow the Council to protect the core function of certain areas by controlling the uses (including changes) allowed.  Primary and Development Management Policies – Economy  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
165secondary retail frontages are defined on the Proposals Map and can 
be found in Appendix 4. 
 369. Primary frontages have been designated where it is considered that the 
predominance of retail businesses should be protected to ensure a vibrant shopping core within the town centre. National policy states that 
LPAs must define the extent of the primary shopping area in their 
adopted proposals map distinguishing between primary and secondary 
frontages and must set policies that make clear which uses will be 
permitted in the different locations.   
 370. The primary retail and secondary frontage boundaries have been 
based upon up to date evidence and surveys, which suggest the designation of boundaries accordingly.   
 371. Secondary frontages provide greater opportunity for diversity of town 
centre uses by managing the existing uses within the parade, the loss of ground floor uses and an overconcentration of certain uses which 
may have a detrimental impact upon town centre amenity or vitality and 
viability.  
 372. This policy approach provides an open framework to reflect the 
different circumstances between and within each centre, and supports decision making on a case-by-case basis, allowing for flexibility and 
responsiveness to change within the centres.  This approach will allow 
the Council to determine proposals for change of use of businesses 
based upon up-to-date data and surveys taken at time of the 
application.

DM10 Improvements to the Public Realm  
 
The Council will seek to secure ongoing improvements to the visual, 
functional and inclusive quality of the public realm across the Plan Area. 
 
Proposals involving improvements to the public realm will be expected to: 
 
a) Contribute positively and respect the local character and context of the 
site, the area and its wider surroundings. 
b) Demonstrate an integrated and unifying theme through the use of 
complementary surfacing and hard landscaping materials; 
c) Incorporate tree planting and green infrastructure, wherever possible; 
d) Ensure that art installations and street furniture do not clutter or 
obstruct pedestrian thoroughfares or cause a hazard to people with a 
visual and/or mobility impairment; 
e) Take account of safety and security issues and seek to provide  
appropriate levels of visibility and lighting; 
f) Avoid light spillage or glare which would cause a hazard to road traffic 
or a nuisance to neighbours. 
 
In the case of proposals affecting designated or non-designated heritage 
assets the Council will expect, in additional to compliance with above criteria, 
the use of materials and street furniture that preserve and enhance the 
special character of the area and/or building.  
 
373. Public realm is defined as the public spaces between private buildings; 
it plays an integral role in how a community functions and interacts with its surroundings and forms an important part of creating places of high 
quality design which promote local distinction and character.  Good 
public realm promotes inclusiveness, pride in the community, a sense 
of shared ownership and maximises the value of heritage and 
environment assets. 
 374. These spaces will usually be accessible to the public via pavements, 
streets, squares, adopted highways, public rights of way, civic spaces, parks, housing estates, schools etc.  Public realm also includes 
privately owned and managed spaces which are used by the public  
such as shopping courts, large employment amenity spaces, access 
frontages to public transport and car parks, etc. Areas of public realm 
should form part of a unified development scheme considered as a 
whole which improve connections between people and places. It is 
important that public realm responds positively to the distinctive 
qualities of the location and where possible incorporates existing 
features of interest such as trees, becks and streams as set out in 
Policy DM14.  Developments should have regard for good standards Development Management Policies - Built and Historic Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
167guidance such as Buildings of Life 12 (CABE – Design Council) and 
Manual for Streets.  
 
375. The Council may also require developers to enter into planning 
obligations to ensure that public realm features are maintained in the future to ensure continuity of use in accordance with Policy S21.

168DM11 Advertisements 
 
The Council will grant express permission for well designed and appropriately 
located advertisements.  
 
Proposals for advertisements of inappropriate design, size, colour, materials 
or illumination, where they are considered to have a detrimental impact, either 
individually or cumulatively, on amenity, character or public safety will not be 
permitted.  
 
Proposals for internally illuminated signs within protected landscapes, 
Conservation Areas or on Listed Buildings will be strongly resisted. 
 
376. Advertisements are important to commercial areas, being both 
informative and a valuable instrument to attract customers, however in sensitive areas such as conservation areas, the coast, countryside or 
on listed buildings they can have a detrimental impact upon 
architectural integrity, local character or visual amenity.  
 377. Allerdale Local Plan Area has a number of historic settlements where 
poorly designed or placed advertisements may have a detrimental impact upon heritage assets and the Council may therefore consider 
the use of Areas of Special Control Orders where it is felt that an area 
requires specific protection. A Supplementary Planning Document will 
be produced to inform and guide businesses on good design issues 
relating to advertisements.

169DM12 Sustainable Construction 
 
The Council will require all new development to mitigate against the impacts 
of climate change by seeking to achieve the highest levels of sustainability. 
Development proposals will be expected to:  
 
a) Minimise the amount of surface water run off by incorporating 
measures such as Sustainable Urban Drainage systems (SuDS), 
permeable surfacing, water storage systems and green infrastructure; 
b) Minimise the consumption of water by incorporating measures such as 
water efficiency and water harvesting/recycling devices;  
c) Reduce carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption through the 
use of construction materials that maximise energy efficiency and the 
incorporation of low carbon/renewable energy sources and by giving 
consideration to the orientation of buildings; 
d) Consider use of construction products that minimise the impact on the 
environment, such as locally-sourced and recyclable materials; 
e) Promote sustainable waste management through the provision of 
recycling and composting facilities and where practicable, facilities for 
onsite collection; 
f) Minimise the level of environmental pollution and the impact on local 
ecological habitats and networks.  
 
All residential developments will be encouraged to achieve Code for 
Sustainable Homes (CSH) Level 4 (or any successor) and all non-residential 
developments the Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method (BREEAM) assessment rating ‘Very Good ’ standards. 
 
378. This policy supports strategic objectives relating to Climate Change 
and Sustainability.  Buildings and building construction contribute a significant amount to the UK ’s carbon emissions. The Council is 
committed to protecting and enhancing the environment and tackling climate change and as such seeks to ensure that new housing 
development is as sustainable as possible. 
 379. This policy seeks to minimise the environmental damage from the 
construction process and to encourage innovation in the design of new homes so that the housing market encourages people to live more 
sustainable lifestyles. 
 380. The Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) is an environmental 
assessment method for rating and certifying the performance of new homes. The Council will encourage developers to achieve Code for 
Sustainable Homes Level 4.. The Council will require that developers 
achieve at least Level 4 in relation to water conservation. Key agencies 
and the United Utilities Water Resources Management Plan 2009 have 
identified a deficit in the water supply when compared to the level of 
demand in West Cumbria by 2014/15. Although a long term solution is 
being investigated there is a need to manage demand and improve 
water efficiency measures in the short to medium term up to 2020.  Development Management Policies - Built and Historic Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
170 
381. BREEAM sets the standard for best practice in sustainable building 
design, construction and operation.  The Council will encourage the achievement of ‘Very Good ’ for all commercial properties in order to 
promote high building standards and achieve its environmental objectives.

171DM13 Telecommunications Development 
 
Support will be given to network telecommunications development where: 
 
a) It can be demonstrated that there is no alternative and less visually 
harmful means of meeting the network coverage requirements of the 
operator;  
b) The reuse or sharing of existing facilities has been explored and is not 
possible due to technical or operational constraints; 
c) The development is sited, designed, coloured and, where relevant, 
landscaped to minimise the visual impact and effect upon the character 
and amenity of the surrounding area; 
d) There is not a significant adverse effect (either in isolation or 
cumulatively) on nature conservation features, biodiversity and 
geodiversity, Natura 2000 sites (including migration routes of protected 
birds), habitats and species; 
e) The special character and appearance of all heritage assets and their 
settings are preserved or enhanced; 
f) The relevant certificate is submitted confirming the development will 
operate within the International Commission for Non Ionising Radiation 
Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure; 
g) Where the proposal is on or near an education facility, the relevant 
body has been consulted on the proposal. 
 
The Council will consider the use of planning conditions to ensure that 
antenna and aerials are removed as soon as practicable after their use 
ceases. 
 
382. The Strategic Objectives support the improvement of superfast and 
next generation broadband and other communications technology infrastructure in order to promote sustainable economic growth and 
provide better connected communities.   
 383. Telecommunication installations often involve tall vertical structure that 
have the potential to be obtrusive and can lead to adverse impacts on the surrounding area, either on their own or together with other 
development such as wind turbines. Therefore, new development 
which does not currently benefit from deemed planning consent should 
demonstrate that the proposal, where possible, seeks to minimise the 
visual impact of any new structures or antenna and that there is not an 
unacceptably adverse environmental impact, both in isolation and 
cumulatively.  
 384. Proposals will be supported in accordance with national policy and with 
other plan policies to protect landscape, historic and habitats and species.

173DM14 Standards of Good Design 
 
Housing Density 
The Council will consider appropriate housing density on a site by site basis 
with decisions informed by local context of the area in terms of design 
considerations, historic or environmental integration, or identified local need. 
 
Design and Layout of New Development 
The Council will seek to ensure that the design and layout of all new 
development creates neighbourhoods and areas with a sense of place, that 
are well integrated and compatible with existing development. 
 
New development will be required to: 
 
a) Reinforce and respect the existing development pattern with regards to 
plot size, building heights and frontage widths, particularly where they 
contribute to local character. Consideration should be given to the 
impact on existing developments at the boundaries of the site; 
b) Respect and respond positively to the distinctive qualities of the 
location and integrate with the characteristics of the site, ensuring that 
all external materials and boundary treatments are appropriate to the 
design and distinctiveness of the development, site and location.  
c) Development should take advantage of green infrastructure assets, 
topography, landscape and waterscape features, historic or biodiversity 
assets. Developers will be encouraged to retain existing features of 
interest within the site including trees, hedgerows, becks and streams. 
d) Create an attractive environment that provides appropriate levels of 
open and amenity green space, privacy and amenity for the occupants 
of the properties;  
e) Provide appropriate vehicular access, parking and turning 
arrangements and facilities for cyclists and pedestrians. Suitable 
consideration should also be given to providing appropriate access for 
those with disabilities; 
f) Make clear distinctions between public and private spaces, promote 
natural surveillance by ensuring routes and paths are overlooked and 
demonstrate the inclusion of measures to reduce the potential for crime 
and disorder. 
 
Landscaping within Development 
 
Development proposals will be required, where appropriate, to be 
accompanied by landscaping schemes in order to mitigate any visual impact 
and integrate the development into its wider surroundings. 
Where required landscaping schemes should form an integral part of the 
layout of development proposal, contributing positively to the provision of 
green infrastructure in the local area and, where possible, enhancing local 
biodiversity.  
 
Landscaping schemes will be expected to:  
 Development Management Policies - Built and Historic Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
 
174g) Retain existing trees, hedgerows, walls, fences, paving, and other site 
features which contribute to the character and amenity of the area;  
h) Include appropriate soft landscaping (including tree and plant species, 
location, sizes and numbers) which respect the landscape 
characteristics of the site, its setting, and its potential effect on adjacent 
land uses; 
i) Include appropriate hard landscaping including furniture such as 
seating and play equipment together with surface and boundary 
treatments, which respect the landscape characteristics of the site and 
its setting; 
j) Maximise the nature conservation and biodiversity value of the 
development through the incorporation of hard and soft landscaping 
features that facilitate the creation of wildlife habitats. 
k) Conditions will normally be imposed on any planning permission for 
developments proposals including landscaping schemes in order to 
ensure their timely implementation, which will typically be the first 
available planting season. 
l) The Council may also require developers to enter into planning 
obligation in order to ensure that landscaped areas, public open 
spaces, local areas of play or neighbourhood areas of play to be 
provided within new developments are properly replanted, replenished 
and maintained in the future to ensure continuity of use. 
 
385. This policy supports Policy S4 and provides details required to ensure 
appropriate standards of design, layout, safety and amenity are achieved and maintained. These standards apply to all development, 
except where specific residential housing issues are set out. 
 386. While national policy no longer requires a minimum density of housing 
development, a key objective of the Council is to ensure effective and efficient use of land. Therefore the density of development will be 
determined appropriate to its context and nature, on a case by case 
basis and in full discussion with the Council.  
 387. Where a proposed scheme consists of several individual plots for 
residential development, the Council may require a design brief which sets out a unifying set of standards, such as scale, materials and style.  
The terms of design briefs and codes will be negotiated with officers at 
the earliest possible stage of the application, or pre application 
discussions. 
 388. Guidance on appropriate levels of open space and amenity green 
spaces to be provided as part of development will be provided in an SPD and informed by the Open Space, Sports and Recreations 
strategies. 
 389. The Council will expect appropriately detailed Design and Access 
Statements and, where required, developers should demonstrate  how 
the local context has influenced the design and this should be 
discussed in relation to the scheme as a whole.  Development Management Policies - Built and Historic Environment  
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014

390. The Council will expect all development to have regard for standard 
good practice guidance such as Buildings for Life 12, Secure by Design and Manual for Streets.

176DM15 Extensions and Alterations to Existing Buildings and Properties 
 
The Council will seek a high standard of design for proposals that involve the 
alteration and/or extension of existing buildings within the Plan Area.  
 
Planning applications for alterations, extensions to or additional buildings 
within the curtilage of existing properties will be permitted provided that: 
 
a) The scale, design and materials of the development would not 
adversely alter the appearance of the existing building; 
b) The development achieves a satisfactory visual and architectural 
relationship with adjoining development and/or the character of the 
area; 
c) The extension would not become the dominant feature of the building; 
d) The extension will not result in overdevelopment of the curtilage of the 
property; 
e) The extension would not materially harm the amenity of the occupants 
of neighbouring or adjacent properties;  
f) The operational car parking needs of the property would continue to be 
met. 
 
391. Domestic extensions allow home owners to adapt their homes to suit 
their changing lifestyle needs and increase the enjoyment and value of their home. Similarly commercial extensions allow businesses to adapt 
and grow, helping facilitate economic growth. 
 392. Existing permitted development rights allow a generous amount of 
development to take place before planning consent is required.  Larger extensions and alterations will be supported where there is no harm to 
the visual or residential amenity of the property or of nearby properties 
and in alignment with Policy S4. 
 393. Alterations and extensions to listed buildings or properties in 
conservation areas will be assessed in accordance with Policy S27.

177DM16 Sequential Test for Previously Developed Land 
 
In line with regeneration and sustainability objectives, the Council will seek to 
secure the effective reuse of previously developed land and vacant sites 
within the Plan Area. 
 
Applications for windfall development on greenfield sites may be required to 
demonstrate through the undertaking of a sequential test, that there are no 
suitable alternative previously developed sites. 
 
The requirement to undertake a sequential test will be subject to the following 
thresholds: 
 
· In the case of the Principal or Key Service Centres: residential 
development in excess of 7 dwellings or industrial floor space in excess 
of 900 square metres; 
· In the case of Local Service Centres: residential development in 
excess of 4 dwellings or industrial floorspace in excess of 500 square 
metres; 
· In the case of Rural Villages: residential development in excess of 2 
dwellings or industrial floorspace in excess of 225 square metres. 
In circumstances where a proposal exceeds the threshold and the need for a 
sequential test is triggered, developers will be required to extend the search 
for available and suitable previously developed sites of comparable scale and 
nature within the settlement, and subject to the economic viability of the site. 
 
394. Allerdale has a history of previously developed windfall sites which 
have arisen through the closure of major employers or through housing renewal. Such sites can have a detrimental effect on the environmental 
quality and local amenity experienced by communities, especially when 
sites are left vacant for some time. 
 395. This policy ensures that previously developed windfall sites are 
considered first before the development of greenfield windfall sites. The mechanism for achieving this is the application of a light touch 
sequential test outlined in the policy above. The policy sets out varying 
thresholds depending on the nature and location of the site. The 
comparison of sites is contained within the settlement and the viability 
of the site to deliver the proposal would also be taken in to account. To 
ensure the effective delivery of development to meet the housing and 
employment need during the plan period this policy applies to windfall 
sites only and will not used to guide the Site Allocations DPD.

DM17 Trees, Hedgerows and Woodland 
 
Wherever possible, existing trees, hedgerows and woodland that are 
considered important to the local community, contribute positively to the 
character of the area and/or are of nature conservation value will be 
protected. 
 
Proposals that involve felling, removal or are considered likely to cause 
demonstrable harm to existing trees, hedgerows and woodland will normally 
be resisted, unless acceptable mitigation or compensation measures can be 
secured.  
 
Felling and/or removal may be permitted in exceptional circumstances where 
it can be demonstrated that the economic viability of the development is 
prejudiced and there are proposed wider benefits that outweigh the loss 
incurred. However where a development poses significant harm to an 
irreplaceable habitat which cannot be mitigated or compensated for, 
permission will be refused. Replacement planting that maintains local 
amenity, the character of the area and nature conservation interest will be 
required. 
 
A tree or hedgerow survey will be required to accompany a planning 
application when trees or hedgerows are either present on the proposal site or 
are adjacent to it and are likely to influence or be affected by the 
development. Details required by tree and hedgerow surveys will be set out 
by the Council in a Local Validation Checklist.  
 
396. The Council regards the trees and hedgerows across the Plan Area as 
valuable environmental resources which provide a sense of place, contribute towards the green infrastructure network and provide 
valuable wildlife habitats. This policy sets out the Council ’s approach to 
protecting against the unnecessary loss of trees and hedgerows.   
 
397. All trees in Conservation Areas have some degree of protection.  
Elsewhere trees may be protected by Tree Preservation Orders or conditions attached to planning permissions.  Consent to fell trees will 
only be given where it can be shown that public safety is involved or 
where it would result in a significant improvement in the overall 
appearance of the area. 
 398. A tree or hedgerow survey should accompany all applications where 
trees or hedgerows may be affected by proposed development.  This includes tree or hedgerows on adjacent land including the highway 
which are within 15m of the boundary of the site. The details required 
in a tree survey are set out in the Local Validation Checklist.

180399. Where development may lead to the unavoidable loss of a tree or 
hedgerow, appropriate replacement should consider both the habitat 
and amenity value. Trees will be expected to be replaced in a 2:1 ratio.

be sound is must also be deliverable, flexible 
and able to be monitored. 
Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) 
 The Statement of Community Involvement sets 
out the standards that authorities must achieve 
in involving local communities in the preparation 
of Local Development Documents and 
development management decisions. 
Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) 
 A strategic environment assessment is a 
generic term used to describe environmental 
assessment as applied to policies, plans and 
programmes.  The European SEA directive 
(2001/42/EC) requires a formal environmental 
assessment of certain plans and programmes, 
including those in the field of planning and land 
use. 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) Examines the likelihood that rivers and watercourses will flood and the mechanisms 
that can be implemented to reduce flood risk. 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) These are studies of the operation of Housing Market Areas that are used to inform the 
development of planning and housing policy. It 
provides analysis of the characteristics of the 
housing market in Allerdale, how key factors 
work together, and the probable scale of 
change in housing need and demand.  
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
(SHLAA)  
 This is used to identify sites which may be suitable for housing development over the next 
15 year. Each site within the SHLAA has been 
assessed to establish whether it is likely to be 
suitable for housing development and, if so, 
when it might come forward for development.  It 
is important to note that the SHLAA does not 
determine whether housing will be built on any 
particular site, but merely undertakes a 
technical exercise on the availability of land in 
the Borough. 
Strategic Policies Strategic Policies (S1 to S37) articulate the Council ’s vision, strategic objectives and the 
spatial strategy to guide future development and growth in Allerdale.  Neighbourhood plans must 
be in conformity with the strategic policies of the 
development plan

The Local Plan must be able to respond to changing needs and 
circumstances at national, regional and local level. Monitoring will help assess 
the effectiveness of the policies in delivering the vision and objectives of the 
spatial strategy and may indicate when policy changes may be required. 
 
Monitoring will take an objective-led approach to the selection of targets and 
indicators, which will help provide a consistent basis for monitoring the 
performance of the strategy against the overall objectives. Where appropriate, 
the Local Plan will set targets for each policy, and will set out how the policy 
will be implemented and monitored. Specific targets have been included 
where clear outputs may be required. 
 
Each year Allerdale Borough Council will produce an Annual Monitoring 
Report containing information on the progress of the implementation of the 
Local Plan and an assessment of the effectiveness of the policies together 
with any future Local Development Documents. This monitoring will indicate 
progress towards targets and show where policies are not working which will 
inform any changes to the Plan.

Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    208 Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure  
Infrastructure planning plays a key role in the delivery of the Allerdale Local Plan 
by identifying where deficits or surpluses of capacity exist and in predicting future 
capacity issues that will to arise as a result of new development and growth. 
Allerdale Borough Council will ensure that development is supported by sufficient 
physical, social and community infrastructure to meet the needs of local 
residents, both current and future. 
The Council has produced a ‘Strategy for Infrastructure ’, which identifies the 
transport, education, public services, utilities and waste, health, sport and 
recreation, flood prevention and green infrastructure works required to deliver the 
quantity of development envisaged for the Plan Area. The Council has engaged 
with public and private sector organisations and worked in close liaison with 
Cumbria County Council, to identify these requirements. For each item of 
infrastructure the partners in provision are set out, funding sources are identified, 
timing is given and, where possible, cost is estimated. The Strategy identifies the 
importance of each infrastructure element the risk associated with provision and, 
where necessary, identifies mitigation measures to limit risk. 
The types of infrastructure considered within the Strategy include:  
a) Roads and other transport facilities 
b) Flood defences, c) Schools and other educational facilities, d) Health care and medical facilities, e) Sporting and recreational facilities, f) Open spaces g) Affordable housing 
To enable the Strategy to be updated to take account of changing circumstances 
such as project completions, start dates and funding streams it will not be incorporated into the Local Plan but will sit alongside it. Given that the detail of those projects identified later in the plan period will evolve as greater certainty emerges, keeping the ‘Strategy for Infrastructure ’ as a ‘live’ document is a more 
suitable option. 
Based on the responses from public and private sector infrastructure providers 
the levels and location of development identified in the Local Plan will not be compromised by infrastructure shortcomings. Inevitably, the timing and funding for some infrastructure works identified in the Strategy remains uncertain. The Borough Council will continue to work with providers to support the delivery of those projects. Where the delivery of development is dependent upon infrastructure projects, development will be phased to coincide with the release of additional infrastructure capacity.  
 
 
 Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    209 Infrastructure required to deliver the strategic objectives of the plan 
The six strategic objectives represent the key delivery outcomes that the Local 
Plan should achieve.  
SO1: Climate change and sustainability 
This objective aims to reduce the Borough ’s carbon footprint and mitigate the 
effects of climate change by encouraging construction methods that reduce 
energy consumption, advocating the re-use of previously developed land 
wherever possible and promoting renewable and low carbon energy. It also 
seeks to ensure that the majority of new growth is directed to the most 
sustainable locations, the main centres of population, but at the same time 
recognising the need to support rural communities and economies. 
Infrastructure issues; 
· Delivering sustainable development 
This is an overarching strategic objective and the infrastructure issues raised 
are more directly related to the proceeding objectives. Whilst it is a more 
sustainable approach to locate the bulk of growth within the main urban areas 
where the facilities, services and utilities infrastructure are already in-situ, 
capacity is not finite, and as such the strategy selected will give rise to 
infrastructure ‘strain ’. Local Plan Policies S21-26 provide the necessary 
framework to enable identified infrastructure gaps to be addressed. 
· Key identified projects 
· None 
SO2: Housing 
This strategic objective seeks to ensure that Allerdale has a balanced housing 
market that delivers a mix of housing type and tenure to meet the needs of all communities, including affordable housing and accommodation for older people and people with disabilities. This will necessitate a deliverable supply of housing 
land that meets the needs of the community and local economy and the support 
of housing renewal projects and re-use of empty properties. 
Infrastructure issues; 
· Affordable housing 
The affordability of housing is a significant issue with in Allerdale and the 
provision of affordable homes is one of the Council ’s key priorities. Whilst 
house prices in the Borough are not considered high by national standards, they are considered unaffordable when compared to average household incomes. The problem is particularly acute at entry level with many local people, especially younger people, finding themselves priced out of the market. Local Plan Policy S8 will play an important role in securing developer contributions for affordable housing within new residential development Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    210 schemes. The flexible criteria of Local Plan Policy S9 are also aimed at 
stimulating the delivery of affordable dwellings via rural exceptions sites. 
· Extra care Housing 
Allerdale has an older population than the national average and this trend is 
forecast to continue into the future. One of the strategies produced by 
Cumbria County Council to meet the needs of an ageing population is to 
expand the provision of extra care housing. Local Plan Policy S10 seeks to 
support the delivery of extra care housing schemes. The Council will also 
work with social and health care partners to identify sites for extra care 
housing schemes through the Site Allocations Development Plan Document. 
· Renewal schemes 
There are certain areas within the Plan Area that are subject of low 
environmental quality and housing demand. The Council have undertaken a 
number of renewal schemes in recent years that has successfully upgraded 
and refurbished deteriorated stock and reversed housing market failure. Local Plan Policy S7 seeks to support proposals and funding bids for renewal projects. 
· Key identified projects; 
· None 
SO3: Economy 
This strategic objective seeks to maximise the economic opportunities identified 
in the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint in order to diversify the urban and rural 
economic base of the Plan Area and enable a prosperous low carbon economy. 
The strategy also includes the delivery of a wide range of high quality 
employment sites and premises, particularly within the Lillyhall Industrial Estate, 
and supporting the development opportunities at the Ports of Workington. Key to 
this strategy is the need to support the development of further and higher 
education in the Plan Area and improve educational attainment and skill levels. 
By virtue of Allerdale’ s natural/historic assets tourism is a key contributor to the 
local economy and the development of sustainable tourism and the provision of high quality accommodation and attractions is also a key objective. 
Infrastructure issues; 
· Delivery of key projects identified in the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint  
Projects such as the development of the roles of the Port of Workington and 
Lillyhall could be realised without any significant infrastructure upgrades, 
although the delivery of some transport projects would render the sites more 
marketable and attractive to inward investors. These projects are outlined in 
the proceeding transport section. 
· Further and higher education Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    211 The existing Lakes College West Cumbria and ENERGUS campuses provide 
opportunities for further and higher education within Allerdale and provision 
will be further enhanced by facilities such as the Workington technical college. 
Local Plan Policy S15 seeks to support proposals that will raise the skills in 
the Plan Area. The Council will also work with the education delivery partners 
to identify potential sites for new/expanded facilities through the Site 
Allocations Development Plan Document. 
· Digital connections 
Projects to improve Broadband availability and access within the Borough are 
currently being progressed that will maximise the economic opportunities 
identified in the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint. Policy S13 seeks to 
support proposals that contribute towards the improvement of digital 
connections in the Plan Area and Policy S21 enables the Council to seek 
developer contributions for the provision of such infrastructure.  
· Key identified projects 
1. Delivery of Superfast Broadband 
 
SO4: Transport 
This strategic objective seeks to ensure that new development is located in the 
most sustainable locations, that are accessible by all transport modes and that reduce the need to travel. The strategy identifies the need to improve essential road, port and rail infrastructure improvements that will support economic growth and key economic projects, particularly those associated with the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint. The need to improve levels of accessibility to services and facilities across the Plan Area is also a key feature of the Plan. Environmental improvements are also required to mitigate the impacts associated with heavy traffic flows through some settlements located along the principal highways. 
· Road 
No projects are identified as being critical to the delivery of the growth 
strategy set out in the Local Plan, although a number are considered integral 
to the delivery of key projects, such as schemes improving access from the 
main highway networks (A66/A595) to the Port of Workington and the 
adjacent employment areas. Schemes have also been identified that would improve the environment within a number of settlements that lie along the A595/A596 routes by reducing the volume of traffic and improving air quality. The provision of road infrastructure and the safeguarding of the routes of identified future schemes is supported by Policy S23. Policy S21 enables the Council to seek developer contributions for the upgrades to the highway network that are required to serve and mitigate the impacts of new development. 
· Rail Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    212 The Cumbria Coast Line is identified as playing a key role in supporting the 
objectives of the West Cumbria Economic Blueprint, particularly in relation to 
the development of the Port of Workington. Although not identified as critical, 
a number of improvements to the line have been identified as being essential, 
the most significant of which are the provision of interchange facilities and 
improved station environments. Policy S23 supports proposals which involve 
improvements to the Cumbria Coast Line. 
· Port development 
Although no additional transport infrastructure has been identified as being 
critical to the development of the Ports of Workington and Silloth, schemes 
have been identified that would enable them to fully realise their long-term 
ambitions. These involve upgrades to the local highway networks, which in 
turn, link to wider improvement schemes to improve accessibility from 
strategic routes. Policy S23 seeks to enhance access and ensure that future 
transport routes are safeguarded. The Council will also work with Port operators to identify potential sites for expansion through Site Allocations DPD.
 
· Pedestrian and cycle routes 
A key theme running through the plan is to reduce the need to travel and improve accessibility to urban-based services and facilities, as well as the wider countryside. Part of this strategy involves protecting and enhancing Public Rights of Way and designated cycle routes in order to make them more attractive and increase their levels of use. Policy S22 provides the framework that underpins this aim, with priority given to the needs pedestrians and cyclists. Policy S21 enables the Council to seek developer contributions for the upgrades and extensions to the pedestrian and cycle routes that are required to serve and mitigate the impacts of new development. 
· Key identified projects 
1. Workington Southern Link Road 
2. Wigton Bypass 
3. Port of Workington access improvements 
4. Workington, Maryport and Wigton station transport hubs 
SO5: Built and Historic Environment 
This objective seeks to ensure that all new development meets high standards of 
design whilst relating well to existing development and minimising impact on local amenity. The conservation and enhancement of historic assets and their settings 
is also a key priority within this objective. As well protecting and enhancing the 
built environment the need to ensure that the social, community and utility related 
infrastructure is adequate to serve existing and future residents is also identified. 
In light of recent events in the Plan Area the need to minimise the risk from 
flooding to properties and residents is also a key priority. Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    213 · Infrastructure Issues: 
· Education  
The Local Education Authority has identified that the levels and spatial 
distribution of growth set out in the Local Plan may result in capacity issues at some primary and secondary schools within certain areas. These capacity issues are not considered to be critical and can be mitigated through developer contributions. The Council will support the Local Education Authority in delivery of new education, sports and recreation facilities via Policy S25 and the potential allocation of sites 
through the preparation of the Site Allocations Development Plan 
Document. 
· Health 
The NHS Cumbria is in the process of delivering their ‘Closer to Home ’ 
strategy, which includes the upgrading of community hospital facilities 
within the county. New facilities have already been delivered in 
Workington (2005) and Cockermouth (due to open 2013). Plans are 
currently underway to provide new facilities in Maryport and Wigton over 
the next few years. The Council will support NHS Cumbria in delivery of 
these facilities via Policy S26 and the potential allocation of sites through 
the preparation of the Site Allocations Development Plan Document. 
· Utilities 
There are a number of settlements identified within the hierarchy that have 
been identified as having constraints in relation to the disposal/treatment of surface and waste water. These capacity issues are not considered to be critical and can be dealt with either by developer contributions via Policy S21 and/or by phasing sites so that constraints can be relieved in utility company asset management plans. The requirement to phase residential development sites as a result of drainage capacity issues will be addressed in the Site Allocations Development Plan Document. 
 As a result of proposed changes to the abstraction at Ennerdale an 
alternative means of supplying West Cumbria with drinking water will need 
to be developed by United Utilities. The Draft Water Resources 
Management Plan 2013 identifies 3 potential options to achieve this. 
United Utilities will work closely with the Council in developing the 
preferred solution. 
· Open space 
The Allerdale Open Space, Sports and Recreation strategies and community engagement exercises have shown a significant deficiency in leisure and recreational facilities for children and, in particular, teenagers. The Council will seek to address these deficiencies through developer Appendix 8 - Identification and delivery of infrastructure 
Allerdale Local Plan (Part 1) – Adopted July 2014 
    214 contributions, via Policies S21, S25 and S26, and potential designation 
sites through the Site Allocations Development Plan Document. 
· Flooding 
As a result of its location between coast and Lake District fells, a number of settlements within the Plan Area are at risk from tidal and/or fluvial 
flooding. Local Policy S29 seeks to mitigate potential flood risk by having a 
presumption against development on land that has been identified as 
being susceptible to flooding. In settlements identified as priority areas for 
the installation flood management schemes the Council will support those 
partner organisations responsible for the delivery of project. 
· Key identified projects 
1. Upgrade to community hospital facilities at Wigton and Maryport 2. Upgrade wastewater treatment works at Cockermouth with associated 
upgrades to the sewerage network.  
3. United Utilities will develop a project to secure drinking water supplies 
to West Cumbria following changes to the abstraction regime at Ennerdale. 
SO6: Natural Environment 
This objective seeks to protect and enhance the natural landscape, including 
ancient woodland and geological assets, from unnecessary and harmful development. Special protection is to be afforded to the Solway Coast AONB while there are also other areas of undesignated landscape of high quality. Protected sites and species are to be afforded the highest levels of protection to ensure the ability of habitats and species to adapt to climate change. A key issue is the maintenance and where possible, improvement of water and air quality across the Plan Area. An overarching aim is to develop the network of green infrastructure incorporating spaces and other natural features which connect town and country. 
· Infrastructure issues 
· Green infrastructure 
A number of transport and environmental schemes have been indentified that would contribute to and strengthen the network of green infrastructure throughout the Plan Area. Local Policy S24 provides the framework and seeks to support such projects. The Council will also work with local communities and partners to identify potential sites for open space and recreation that will supplement the existing network through the through the Site Allocations DPD.
