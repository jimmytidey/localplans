THE ISLAND PLANNING 
STRATEGY  PROCESS
Gather the evidence
The Isle of Wight Council gathers evidence of the issues the Island 
Planning Strategy needs to address, such as new development 
and infrastructure and utilises work already undertaken.  
Consider the options
The council considers the different ways in which they can 
address the issues identified and then determines the most 
appropriate approach.  
Consult on a draft plan
The council publishes a draft plan with supporting evidence, 
requests stakeholder views and a preferred option is established 
following consideration of the comments received.
Publish for representations
The revised plan and evidence are published, and there is a period 
for public representation.
Submit for examination
The plan, evidence and representations received by the council 
are then submitted to the Government’s Planning Inspectorate, 
for an independent examination in public against national criteria.
Adopt the plan
Provided the plan has been prepared in the right way, 
the council can formally adopt it and use it to determine 
planning applications.

2.1TheIsleofWightcoversanareaof147squaremiles,withacoastline thatrunsfor57miles.The
Islandisseparated fromthemainland ofEngland byastretchofwaterknownastheSolent,but
isconnected totheportsofLymington, Southampton andPortsmouth onthemainland by
passenger andvehicleferries.Although physically separated fromthemainland, theIsland
influences andisinfluenced bythewidersub-regional, regional, nationalandinternational context.
2.2TheIslandfeatures awidevarietyofnatural,ruralandurbanlandscapes. Over50%oftheIsland
isdesignated asanAreaofOutstanding NaturalBeauty(AONB) and28milesofcoastline is
designated asHeritage Coast.Inaddition, theIslandalsoincludes averyhighnumber of
internationally ,nationally andlocallyimportant natureconservation sites.
2.3TheIslandisalsohometoarichvarietyofimportant habitats andspecies, someofwhichare

willplanforastepped approach overtheplanperiod,basedonthefollowing minimum annual
requirements:
540dwellings peryear2020/21 -2022/23 (3years)1620
600dwellings peryear2023/24 -2025/26 (3years)1800
