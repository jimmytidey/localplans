Foreword   
 
The council, no doubt like you, places great importance  on the special character and 
amenities of the borough, as well as wanting to support access to housing, jobs and services, 
all set within safe communities and attractive environments. This was evident in m any of the 
comments received by the council through the Regulation 18 consultations .  
Since then, we have reviewed those comments – and I thank people for taking the time and 
trouble to contribute – and we have undertaken further studies and other work in response to 
them, which has resulted in many refinements.  
The council is committed to enabling Elmbridge to thrive – to have more affordable housing, 
more local jobs and better infrastructure to support the economy and community life, and to 
ensure that w e play our part in tackling and responding positively to climate change. We also 
want to do this in a way that respects the natural and historic environments.  
Climate change and s ustainability is important  to the council and  to our residents . Climate 
chan ge and good design pr inciples  outlined in the Draft Local Plan  will help us live more 
sustainably  through improved walking and cycling infrastructure, increased numbers of electric 
vehicle chargers and improved air quality . The Plan offers Elmbridge the op portunity to embrace 
sustainable  living more than ever.  
It also brings that sustainability  to our high streets, acknowledging that our high streets are 
evolving beyond places to shop. To thrive, they will need to offer retail, entertainment and 
socialising  experience s. More than ever our high streets will provide that community buzz, that 
sense of togetherness and socialisation that makes Elmbridge a place people want to live, work 
and visit.  
The draft Plan not only supports a development future for the bor ough free from green belt 
release, but it also sets out a vision for a connected  Elmbridge; one where we become a hub 
for an agile workforce, offering flexible workspace, fast connections, accessible transport 
options and welcoming hospitality.  
Preparing a  new Local Plan to meet these ambitions for the future of our borough has been 
challenging. I recognise that not all the outcomes will please everyone, but the council feels 
that it has got the overall balance right – to ensure the right sort of development in the right 
places, and with the infrastructure required to support it.

  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Introduction
  
- 6 - Details of the Regulation 19 Representation  
This Regulation 19 representation period is the next step in the plan making process. The 
purpose of the Regulation 19 stage  is to provide an opportunity for representations to be made 
on the draft the local plan before it is examined by a p lanning inspector.  In accordance with 
the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (PCPA), the planning inspector will consider 
all duly made representations  on the plan that are made within the representation period.  
A full questions and answers on the R egulation 19 representation is available on  our website.  
We have had numerous consultations through the last six years, asking about specific sites, 
specific development, green belt use etc, Regulation 19 is different:  
• This is the last stage of public engagement before submitting the Draft Plan to the 
Planning Inspectorate for examination.  
• This is a representation period  on the finalised  proposed Local Plan policies;  earlier 
consultations sought views on different options and issues which had to be considered 
before the council finalised this draft  Local Plan.  
• All responses will be sent to the Planning Inspectorate  
• Only representations  on the soundness and legal compliance of the Plan can be made 
and it must be targeted to a specific policy or paragraph in the Draft Plan.  
 
Your representations will need to focus on the following:  
• Whether or not the plan is legally compliant (including Duty  to Cooperate);  
 
• Whether it has met the tests of soundness:  
 
• Positively prepared - being based on a strategy that aims to meet objectively 
assessed needs for development and infrastructure  
• Justified - being the most appropriate strategy n Effective - being deliverable 
over the plan period based on effective joint working  
• Consistent with national policy - enabling the delivery of sustainable 
development in accordance with the NPPF Representations should be supported 
by evidence if possible, and when maki ng representations, please clearly 
indicate which policy, paragraph or page number you are referring to.  
 
Starting on 17 June and running for 6 weeks until 29  July 2022. Should you wish to make 
representations on the legal compliance or soundness of this document you must do so within 
the six -week period. Please submit your representations using the on -line forms which can be 
found on the Local Plan pages at  
https://consult.elmbridge.g ov.uk/reg19/consultationHome . 
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Introduction
  
- 7 - Following the six week  period any submitted representations will be collated and sent with the 
Proposed Submission Borough Local Plan and supporting evidence to the Planning 
Inspectorate for independent examination. Respondents will not receive individual responses 
from the Cou ncil. 
It is intended to submit the Plan to the Inspectorate in Autumn 2022 . 
 
  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Introduction
  
- 8 - Chapter 1  - Introduction
 
Elmbridge Local Plan 2037  
1.1 The Pre-submission draft Elmbridge Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19)  sets out how the  
communities and places of Elmbridge will develop over the next 15 years. It sets out policies  
and site allocations to guide the development and use of land , as well as defining the areas  of 
the borough  that will b e protected and enhanced . 
1.2 Once adopted, the Local Plan  will be a statutory document  and will form the basis on 
which planning applications in the borough will be determined  repla cing the 2011 Core 
Strategy and 2015 Development Management Plan1.  
 
Structure of the Local Plan  
1.3 The Local Plan  (the Plan)  includes various parts that are to be read as a whole. This 
starts with a vision and principles  setting out what the  Plan is aiming to achieve.  
1.4 The vision and principles were  informed by nation al planning policy, the council ’s 
objectives, residents’ and stakeholder views , as well as the challenges and opportunities for 
the borough  which make up the spatial context for the Plan. These were explored in a series 
of early consultation documents prep ared during the Plan’s preparation. In Chapter 2 and 
Appendix A 3, the Plan sets out in more detail the spatial context for Elmbridge and what 
makes it distinctive , as well as the challenges and opportunities we face.  
1.5 To deliver the vision and principle s, there is a suite of policies  and land designations. 
These are divided into high -level policies called ‘strategic policies ’ and ‘site allocations ’, which 
set the strategy for the Plan and provide the high -level principles that development must 
adhere  to. Specific land designations are detailed on the Policies Map which accompanies the 
Plan. 
1.6 Then there are the detailed policies known as the ‘development management policies . 
These provide the detailed design and technical criteria and standards which, proposed 
development will be assessed against . 
 
1 A schedule setting out which Local Plan policies have replaced those of the Core Strategy and Development 
Management Plan is set out in Appendix A1. Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Introduction

Local Plan policy context  
1.7 The Plan sits alongside national , regional and county planning  policies and guidance 
and other Development Plan documents. This includes the saved Thames Basin Heaths 
Special Protection Area policy of the South East Plan  2009 , the Surrey Minerals & Waste 
Plans, and forthcoming Supplementary Planning Documents  (SPDs) , which will include the 
Elmbridge  Design Code,  which  will set out further guidance on the policies contained within 
the Plan . Where appropriate masterplans or design briefs will be undertaken for key sites.   
1.8 Together, these policies and documents set ou t the framework for how new homes, 
jobs and infrastructure will be delivered in Elmbridge over the next 15 years.

Why is a Local Plan needed?  
1.9 Like the rest of Surrey and the South East , accommodating new growth and 
development is challenging. A Local Plan enables us to carefully plan for and proactively 
manage this to achieve ‘good growth ’, that benefits our existing and future residents and 
builds on the prospe rity of the borough . It provides certainty for communities, businesses and 
developers and ensures that new development and infrastructure comes forward in a 
coordinated way.  
 
What is ‘good growth’?  
1.10 ‘Good growth2’: 
• Is proportionate and sustainable, focusing on the places where people both live and 
work.  
• Supports overall improvements to the health and wellbeing of our residents.  
• Is supported by the necessary infrastructure investment – including green and blue 
infrastructure.  
• Delivers hig h quality design in our buildings and public realm.  
• Increases resilience and flexibility in the local economy.  
• Builds resilience to the impacts of climate change and flooding.  
• Is planned and delivered at a local level while recognising that this will inevi tably extend 
at times across administrative boundaries.  
 
What are our development needs?  
1.11 Local Plans must also be informed by evidence and the council  has prepared a series 
of technical documents on a wide range of topics to help us understand what ne w 
development is needed and how to plan for it.  
1.12 The evidence shows that there is a significant need for new homes in the borough , in 
particular smaller homes  of 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms  and more affordable housing. There is a 
need to reuse and intensify employment and commercial land to keep up with the demands of 
businesses especially for smaller and flexible units and workspaces to foster economic 
growth. There have also been significa nt changes in the retail sector and our shopping habits, 
requiring a greater flexibility of uses in our town and village centres as well as  a need to  
maintain  and enhance  their vital roles as community hubs.

- 11 -  
How are we going to respond to our needs?  
1.13 A ‘brownfield’ approach has been taken seeking to make the best use of previously 
developed (‘brownfield’) land. The council has explored a number of different ways to increase 
the capacity of brownfield land in the borough including, reallocation and dive rsification of 
employment land, mixed use development and ensuring  the potential of sites is optimised . 
1.14 Reusing brownfield land and ensuring the efficient use of it will increase the capacity for 
new development in the borough, whilst balancing this w ith the need to continue  to conserve 
and enhance the qualities and characteristics that make our existing communities attractive 
places to live, work and spend leisure time.  
1.15 The council, whilst recognising that this efficient use of land will help to respond to 
demand , it will not me et all of it . The council  has chosen this approach in response to the need 
to balance growth with protecting and continuing to conserve and enhance  what is important 
to our residents  and helps shape our places and communiti es. This includes the Green Belt 
and our open spaces, as well as safeguarding other areas of recognised importance such as 
ancient woodland, habitat sites and heritage assets of international and national importance 
and avoiding areas unsuitable for new de velopment for example, where they are at high risk 
from flooding.  
 
How will new development be supported?  
1.16 Implementation and resourcing of the Plan will be critical to its success. It will be 
important that the we continue to work collaboratively  with partners across the private, public 
and voluntary sectors to deliver the Plan. Improvements to infrastructure will be required to 
support the development proposed in the Plan and this is set out in an Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan (IDP).  
1.17 Infrastructure will be funded through a combination of existing public funding, 
developer -led provision and through the use of the Community Infrastructure Levy  (CIL)  (or 
future equivalent) . The Plan’s policies and proposals will also enable us to highlight the 
infrastructure needs and bid for additional resource funding opportunities that may arise  from 
Government , regional and county funding initiatives.  
 
 
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Introduction
  
- 12 - How will we know if the Local Plan is successful?  
1.18 We will carefully monitor the progress of the Plan and the performance of each policy. A 
key indicator as to the Plan’s success will be whether development and infrastructure is 
delivered at the rate expected. This will include whether the number of homes bu ilt each year 
and the supply of housing land is keeping up with the targets set in the Plan.  
1.19 Although the Plan is for 15 years, there are some matters such as retail and 
employment where it is difficult to predict trends and needs beyond ten years. Th erefore, all 
policies are written to be flexible to respond to changing markets and  unforeseen  
circumstances . The Plan, in accordance with national planning policy, must be reviewed every 
five years to ensure that it remains up to date and fit for purpose . 
1.20 How we will monitor the Plan is set out in Chapter 10, the Monitoring Framework .

The challenges  
2.1 The Local Plan needs to respond to a number of significant challenges over the plan 
period, including:  
• Tackling climate change and moving towards a low / zero carbon economy ; 
• Protecting and enhancing the natural environment;  
• Delivering more  homes supported by the necessary infrastructure;  
• Delivering more affordable homes;  
• Supporting local recovery from Covid -19; and  
• Supporting our town, local and district centres and employment areas.  
 
2.2 Elmbridge is a highly desirable area due to its location and high -quality environment 
and unique character in part owing to the River Thames forming its northern boundary and its 
extensive green areas. However, as with any borough, Elmbridge is a collection of separate 
and distinctive places and local communities each with its own unique local identity, historic 
assets and attracti ve green and natural environment which are highly valued by  our 
communities.  
2.3 The borough, as a whole, benefits from good accessibility by rail and road to Central 
London and is within easy reach of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, the M25 and the M3. The  
borough regularly features in best places to live and best quality of life polls.  
2.4 However, that success brings consequences . The carbon footprint of the borough is 
high and must be addressed to  help tackle the climate emergency and  improve the borough ’s 
resilience to climate change , as well as improve biodiversity and issues of air quality and road 
congestion.  
2.5 The borough has high -quality green and blue infrastructure that weaves its way through 
the urban areas and provides invaluable open spaces, highly treasured by local residents. Our 
urban open spaces play an important role within our green assets/natural capital  and help to 
shape the character of our communities . However, we must continue to protect and enhance 
these spaces and work to improve accessibility and strengthen connectivity between them as 
movement corridors for the benefit of wildlife, climate change mitigation and adaptation as well 
as for the enjoyment and health and wellbeing of our residents and visitors.

Figure 3: Elmbridge within the local context  
  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Elmbridge 2037
  
- 15 - 2.6 Elmbridge has a rich historic environment that has evolved around historic estates, 
towns and villages and this helps to create the borough’s local character and distinctiveness. 
This extensive historic environment and heritage provides a cultural reference to the past and 
has an important role in place -making and supporting health and wellbeing. These assets 
provide economic benefits as they bring vi sitors and provide jobs. We must support and make 
the most of these valued assets and carefully balance the need to preserve and enhance our 
historic environment with the need to deliver good growth.  
2.7 The borough is one of the most expensive areas in th e country to live, with high land 
values and intense pressure for new development. As a result, too many young people and 
families are moving out of the borough to have a realistic prospect of owning or renting their 
own home. Our older residents are strug gling to affordably downsize in a way that will enable 
them to continue to live independently or with care packages and remain in their local 
community. The cost of housing and reliance on people travelling into the borough is also 
making it difficult for local business es and valued services to attract and retain employees, this 
includes essential key workers, such as teachers and health care providers.  
2.8 The needs of businesses are also changing , as well as how people shop and spend 
their leisure time. Our high streets need support to help them adapt to the changing retail 
market and become distinctive hubs for socialisation, community support, leisure and culture. 
The Plan seeks to positively respond to these issues and changes whilst protecting and 
enhancing the qualities and features that not only make Elmbridge a sought -after place to live, 
work and visit but also sustainable and fit for the future.

The v ision  for Elmbridge 2037  
 
By 2037, Elmbridge will be more res ilient to the impacts of climate change. The 
council accepts its responsibility to make a resilient environment, to reduce 
carbon emissions and to deliver positive outcomes for future generations. The 
council will positively lead on a commitment to ensure every decision is made 
with the achievement of low carbon and net zero in mind, with  delivering 
sustainable growth and the use of renewables as standard.  
The council will renew, enhance and protect green and blue spaces across the 
borough, with better connectivity for the benefit of both people and wildlife. 
Residents  will benefit from  improved air quality, minimised noise, flood risk and 
other polluting impacts, and a reduction in carbon and water demands by 
minimising d etrimental impacts from development.  
Building on the success of our existing communities, the built environment will be 
well designed, beautiful and will offer high quality public realms, contributing to 
the uniqueness of each settlement.  
Excellent design will safeguard the built, historic and natural environment for the 
health and wellbeing of existing residents and future generations.  
Residents, existing and new, will have the choice of a range of housing types 
that meet their needs. Our town, district and local centres will act as social, arts 
and commercial hubs, nurturing communities and businesses and allowing our 
culture and econom y to flourish. There will be  high quality  digital  connectivity 
enabl ing flexibility in the evolving patterns of working.  
Good growth will be supported by the delivery of the right infrastructure in the 
right place , at the right time . Innovative solutions w ill be used to improve 
transport interchanges,  to manage the highway network for all users, and foster 
a shift in travel behaviour towards more people walking and cycling, particularly 
for short journeys.

Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 19 - Chapter 3  - Spatial Strategy and delivery  
 
Spatial strategy for the borough  
3.1 Elmbridge is a highly desirable area due to its location , high-quality environment and 
unique character. The previous plan was adopted in 2011 and it has been successful in 
delivering sustainable development  in the borough . However, since then , the Government’s 
national planning policy requirements have changed , as well as the environment al, soci al and 
the economic needs of the borough .  
3.2 This new plan is essential to ensure that planning decisions, sustainable new 
development and regeneration takes place for the benefit of our borough  and our residents  
and businesses  now and in the future.  
3.3 Going forward new development must respond to  the changes in need and contribute 
towards achieving the vision and the principles of the Plan, set out in Chapter 2 . This will 
mean a change to the type of development that is delivered  in Elmbridge , meeting the needs 
of our co mmunities . 
3.4 The following strategic policies set out the Plan ’s spatial strategy . At its heart is a 
commitment to responding to the climate emergency and to deliver sustainable place -making , 
contributing towards the achievement of sustainable developmen t. The scale and location of 
growth proposed has been informed by careful consideration of the evidence and the 
balancing of the social, economic and environmental positive and negative effects which could 
arise from growth and development  in the borough . The strategy and policies respond to the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) requirement for Local Plans to set out the 
development priorities and the use of land within Elmbridge  through strategic policies  (SS1, 
SS2 and SS3) .   
3.5 We will work with our partners, local communities and developers to ensure the delivery 
of the spatial strategy.  The delivery of the Plan will be monitored carefully through the 
monitoring framework detailed in Chapter 10. 
 
 
 
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 20 - Responding to the climate emerg ency  
SS1 - Responding to the climate emergency  
All development must respond to the climate emergency by:  
1.Minimising carbon emissions:  
a) Directing development towards locations that minimise the need to travel and 
maximis e the ability to make trips by s ustainable modes of transport including cycling, 
walking and public transport.  
b) Delivering an efficient use of land especially on the most accessible sites.  
c) Providing more walkable and cyclable neighbourhoods that reduce demand for t he 
use of private vehicles . 
d) Optimising the layout and design of buildings and landscape to reduce energy 
consumption, minimise waste and increase the re -use and recycling of materials.  
e) Maximising energy efficiency and integrating the use of renewable and low carbon 
energy.  
f) Avoiding demolition by repurposing existing structures . 
g) Promoting the retrofitting of existing buildings, including incorporating measures to 
reduce energy consumption.  
2. Mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change : 
a) Conserving water resources and minimis ing vulnerability to flooding.  
b) Providing shade and green and blue infrastructure to reduce overheating of urban 
areas during warmer summers.  
c) Increasing the extent, connectivity and diversity of wildlife habitats to enable animals 
and plants to adjust.  
d) Reducing air pollution so as to minimise the potential for higher temperatures to 
worsen air quality.  
3. Promoting renewable and low carbon energy schemes : 
a) Identifying and supporting opportunities for the delivery of renewable and low carbon 
energy schemes.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 21 - b) Ensuring the provision of renewable and low carbon energy generation infrastructure 
is located and designed to minimise potential adverse effects, with particular regard to 
protecting the natural, his toric and built environment.  
3.6 The Plan plays a central role in addressing the climate emergency by reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions , supporting the transition to a low carbon future  and delivering 
improvements to flood risk, air quality, recycling and waste management.  
3.7 Our climate is changing as a result of human activity and this will have substantial 
implications for society and our environment if we do not act. The council is committed to 
responding to climate change and declared a climate change  emergency  in July 2019,  
announcing its pledge to make the borough council carbon neutral by 2030, taking into 
account both production and consumption emissions. Working with other Surrey districts and 
boroughs, and Surrey County Council, Surrey’s Greener Futures Climate Change Strategy 
(2020 -2050) and Climate Change Delivery Plan (2021) have been produced. The Plan will 
play a central role in delivering a number of aims set out in both. A central thread of the Plan is 
to plan for a low -carbon future in whi ch carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases are 
reduced and we tackle and adapt to the new climatic norms.    
3.8 The council will take a proactive approach to mitigating the effects of, and adapting to, 
climate change to ensure the future resilience of  both communities and infrastructure. This 
includes locating new development in locations that  enable the use of active modes of travel  
as well as being designed and constructed in a way to achieve low or zero carbon buildings 
and that facilitate s more sus tainable lifestyles including , supporting the ability to work f lexibly . 
3.9 Some of the necessary actions for tackling climate change, such as improving energy 
efficiency and the provision of green and blue infrastructure, could also have direct benefits f or 
biodiversity and residents, businesses and visitors by reducing energy bills and providing a 
higher quality environment.  
3.10 New development will need to positively respond to the climate emergency and deliver 
a comprehensive and integrated approach to  addressing the challenges of climate change as 
set out in  policy SS1 Responding to the climate emergency . 
3.11 In responding to this strategic policy , applicants will need to address each of these  aims  
in their submission documents . Strategic Policy SS1 is supported by more detailed 
development management policies , in particular CC1, CC2, CC3, ENV1, and ENV8 and the 
forthcoming  Climate Change and  Renewables Supplementary Planning Document  (SPD) .

SS2 - Sustainable place -making  
1. The council wilI  apply the presumption in favour of sustainable development, 
balancing the economic, social and environmental objectives.  
2. All development proposals will be assessed  taking into account the following criteria : 
(a) Protecting and enhancing our natural, historic and built environment by:  
i) Respond ing positively to the climate emergency, by mitigating and adapting and 
requir ing the best use of resources and assets and min imise flood risk.  
ii) Conserving and enhancing biodiversity  
iii) Enhanc ing the character and qualities of places and contribute positively to local 
distinctiveness, identi ty and history.  
iv) Creat ing attractive, safe and inviting environments and public spaces that encourage 
healthy lifestyles and that are free from unacceptable  air and noise pollution.  
v) Protect ing the Green Belt as defined on the Policies Map from inappropriate 
development in accordance with national planning policy and the policies set out in the 
Plan. 
(b) Delivering h omes for all by:  
i) Deliver ing the right mix of well-designed  and adaptable homes, including affordable 
and smaller housing to meet local housing needs.  
ii) Incorporat ing a range of amenities and facilities to meet local needs.  
(c) Growing a prosperous economy by:  
i) Provid ing a varied  choice of business accommodation, including for start -ups and 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).  
ii) Deliver ing vibrant and adaptable town , district and local  centres to support the 
evolving needs of residents, businesses and visitors.  
(d) Providing i nfrastructure and connectivity by:  
i) Provid ing integrated and improved access to high quality green and blue 
infrastructure for the wellbeing of residents and visitors as well as contributing to a 
variety of important environmental functions  and attracting inward investment . Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 23 - ii) Mak ing it easy and attractive to walk, cycle and use public transport.  
iii) Offer ing excellent connections  through sustainable transport links to reduce reliance 
on private motor vehicles.  
iv) Providing excellent integrated digital connectivity.  
3.12 At the heart of national planning policy is a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development. This informs bot h plan -making and decision -taking. National policy provides a 
guide to what sustainable development is at a national level, but what does this mean for 
Elmbridge?  
3.13 In applying the presumption in favour of sustainable development required by national 
policy, the Plan seeks  opportunities to meet the development needs of Elmbridge in a positive 
way and builds into the policies sufficient flexibility to adapt and respond to change, whilst 
promoting a sustainable pattern of development.  
3.14 As with any boro ugh, Elmbridge is not a single homogenous place. Rather, it is a 
collection of separate and distinct places or neighbourhoods some of which have grown 
together over time to create larger urban areas. It will be important that new development 
builds on the success of our existing communities and places and responds to their individual 
identities and development needs. The allocation sites identified in Chapter 9 have been 
carefully considered against the individual identities of each area and the contributio n they 
would make towards enhancing them. The Plan sets out in more detail what is distinctive 
about Elmbridge and the challenges and opportunities we face in Chapter 2 and Appendix A 3.  
3.15 The policy  SS2 establishes what is meant by sustainable place -making development in 
Elmbridge and reflects the vision and principles of the Plan, as well as setting out the context 
for the detailed policies that follow. It is expected that all planning decisions will have regard to 
the overall principles of the Plan an d contribute to achieving the vision for Elmbridge 2037.  
3.16 When implementing Strategic Policy SS2, local circumstances will be taken into 
account to respond to different opportunities for achieving sustainable place -making. In 
accordance with national p lanning policies there will be protection of important natural and 
heritage assets, the presumption  in favour of sustainable development  will not apply to sites 
protected under the Habitats Regulations and/or designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest , 
land designated as Green Belt, Local Green Spaces, irreplaceable habitats, designated 
heritage assets and areas at high risk of flooding.  
Quantum and spatial distribution of development  
3.17 At the heart of the spatial strategy is the commitment to respo nd to the climate 
emergency and sustainable place -making. The scale and location of growth  set out in  the Plan  
has been informed by careful consideration of the evidence and the balancing of the social, Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 24 - economic and environmental positive and negative effects which could arise from growth and 
development.  The key principles behind the scale and location of growth in the borough 
include  increasing the number of new and genuinely affordable homes in the borough  and 
seeking out all opportunities to maximise the amount of  development on previously developed 
land within the existing urban areas by proactively optimising  sites. 
3.18 One of the major challenges for the borough is delivering housing and the council will 
need to work in partnership with the development industry, bring forward publicly owned land 
and make effective use of its planning powers to ensure growth can be  positively and  
appropriately delivered , whilst protecting our environment .  
3.19 Elmbridge’s objectively assessed housing need has been based on the Government’s 
standard method of calculating local housing need, as set out in planning practice guid ance. 
Using 2022 as the base year for calculation, the housing need for the borough equates to 647 
dwellings per annum and over the plan period 9,705 homes.  
3.20 The evidence in the Local Housing Need Assessment 2020 sets out the type of homes 
that are ne eded over the plan period. The housing target in the policy is in line with the 
Elmbridge Housing Trajectory set out in Appendix A 5. The  need for Gypsy , Roma  and 
Traveller pitches during the plan period has been informed by the Gypsy and Traveller 
Accommod ation Assessment  2020 . 
3.21 Although the evidence shows that the most pressing need for development in the 
borough is for housing, assessments have also been undertaken in relation to the borough’s 
employment and retail needs. The borough benefits from a s trong local economy, however, 
we cannot be complacent, and we need to continue to plan and invest to maintain our 
competitive edge and realise our growth potential.  
3.22 To assist in sustainable economic recovery following the Covid -19 pandemic and 
support  economic growth, it is important that the Plan makes provision for and maintains a 
portfolio of employment sites that responds to businesses needs including the needs of Small 
and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and business start -ups. This is particularly important in areas 
like Elmbridge where there are  high land values and competing development pressures . 
3.23 National and South East trends for offices show a demand for high quality space that is 
provided either as large space for corporates or as smaller flexible multi -let space for smaller 
businesses. There is an increasing level of demand for smaller, start -up space in the borough  
and there is a series of examples of smaller units, often outside of the designated Strategic 
Employment Land a reas and town , district and local centres. This is not surprising as the 
business base within the borough  is predominately SMEs with round 92% of all companies 
employing under 10 people.   
3.24 Therefore, evidence recommends that an approach to maintain an d intensify the 
existing employment offer is pursued. Protecting key employment locations from Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Spatial Strategy and delivery
 
- 25 - redevelopment is particularly important for industrial and warehousing in the borough as there 
are high levels of utilisation, low vacancy rates and occupiers wo uld have potential difficulties 
in finding alternative locations if existing ones were lost.  
3.25 The ‘traditional’ high street continues to face a number of  challenges stemming from the 
impacts of the recent economic downturn, the tightening of retail spending in recent years,  the 
Covid -19 pandemic and  continued significant changes in consumer shopping behaviour.  
3.26 The evidence supports the  careful repurpo sing of retail floorspace and this is most likely 
to be by converting excess retail space to create mixed -use destination schemes including 
with residential elements. Managing th is change is likely to require temporary and flexible 
meantime/pop -up uses.   
3.27 Forecasts of trends and demand in relation to employment, retail and our high streets 
are difficult to predict. As such, policies should be looking forward 10 years but be flexible to 
respond to changes in the economy. The policies within the Plan wil l be carefully monitored  
(as set out in Chapter 10)  as we continue to support our business community’s recovery 
following the Covid -19 pandemic.  
3.28 The Key Diagram shown at Figure 1 has been produced to indicate the broad extent of  
the key locations, lan dscape and other designations relevant to the Plan. It does not provide 
the definitive identification of the boundaries of designations such as the Green Belt. However, 
a greater level of detail can be found on the Policies Map.

e) Infrastructure to supp ort housing and other development.  
2. A ‘brownfield first’ approach will be taken, using opportunities to develop previously 
developed land within the urban area of the borough  as they offer the most sustainable 
locations.  
3. Development opportunities will  be encouraged within the urban areas  which accord with 
other policies in the Plan and meet the following strategic aims:  
a) Enhancing the vitality and viability of t own and district  centr es.  
b) Repurposing/ redevelopment/diversification of specific sites now vacant  in employment use .  
c) Repurposing/ redevelopment of previously developed sites into mixed uses .

the borough at the following locations and as identified on the Policies Map:  
a) Brooklands College for higher e ducation, further education and vocational training and 
up/skilling  
b) Lower Green for community regeneration  
c) Whiteley Village for specialist care facilities  
6. Comprehensive development that achieves a co -ordinated  approach with adjoining sites will 
be encouraged, especially when it may result in additional benefits such as, for example, 
improved access arrangements, greater efficient use of land, increased provision of affordable 
housing, integration of green and blue infrastructure and biodiversity links through the 
development site.  
3.29 In strategic policy SS3 t he location of development in the borough has been driven by 
the principle of sustainable developme nt as set out in national policy. With this in mind, 
planning for our housing needs builds on the existing pattern of development in the borough, 
taking a ‘brownfield first’ approach. In taking a ‘brownfield first’ approach, the Plan seeks to 
make as much use as possible of existing suitable brownfield sites, including all publicly 
owned assets and land holdings. The urban areas of the borough were assessed, identifying 
the amount of development that could sustainably be accommodated. However, this does not  
meet all of the identified need for market and affordable housing.  
3.30 The council has therefore had to look at other options to meet housing need  and has 
fully examined all reasonable options to responding positively to meeting the borough’s local 
hous ing needs and the unmet need of neighbouring authorities. This has included d iscussions 
and correspondence with neighbouring authorities which extended to all authorities located in 
the South East of England explor ing the potential for meeting the borough’ s local housing Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 29 - needs outside of Elmbridge. However, it is clear that it is highly unlikely there will be any 
significant opportunities during the plan period to accommodate need outside of the borough 
boundary.  
3.31 The council has considered making  chang es to the Green Belt boundary, and has 
followed national planning policy, which requires that Green Belt boundaries are only 
amended in exceptional circumstances and that this must be undertaken as part of the Local 
Plan process.  In making this assessment and informed by the evidence, the council has 
concluded that exceptional circumstances have not been fully evidenced and justified to make 
changes to the Green Belt boundaries in the borough.  
3.32 Details of all the sites which are expected to come forwar d for development during the 
plan period can be found in the latest Land Availability Assessment (LAA) or equivalent land 
supply evidence base document. The LAA and the housing trajectory will be annually 
reviewed and updated as required and the findings r eported and published in the council’s 
Authority Monitoring Report (AMR).

- 30 - Chapter 4 - Tackling climate chang e 
 
4.1 The natural, urban and historic environment in the borough  makes Elmbridge a sought -
after place to live, work and visit. Enhancing and protecting these environments at the same 
time as responding to climate change and creating sustainable places, is fundamental to the 
success of the Plan. Tackling climate change and its consequences is on e of the priorities for 
the council and its Local Plan. The challenge for planning is providing much needed jobs and 
homes in a way that does not have a detrimental impact on our climate and environment.  
4.2 A Special Report was published by the Intergove rnmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) in 2018,  which concluded that global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net  
zero by 2050 in order to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C and minimise damaging 
climate impacts on human and natural systems. In  May 2019, the Committee on Climate 
Change (CCC) recommended a new long -term emissions target for the UK: net  zero 
greenhouse gases by 2050. Following the adoption of the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 
Target Amendment) Order in 2019, the UK has a statutory  requirement to reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050 (based on 1990 levels).  
4.3 In July 2019  the council declared a climate change emergency and made  a pledge to 
make the borough council carbon neutral by 2030, taking into account both the production and 
consumption emissions , in line with the national targets mentioned above .  
4.4 Working with other Surrey districts and boroughs, and Surrey County Council, Surrey’s 
Greener Futures Climate Change Strategy (2020 -2050) and Climate Change Delivery Plan 
(2021) have been produced. The Plan will play a central role in delivering a number o f aims 
set out in both. A central thread of the Plan is to plan for a low -carbon future in which carbon 
emissions and other greenhouse gases are reduced and we tackle and adapt to the new 
climatic norms . 
4.5 Our Local Plan will have a central role in reduc ing carbon dioxide emissions and 
supporting the transition to a low /zero  carbon future , as well as delivering improvements to 
flood risk, air quality, recycling and waste management.  New developments will need to 
prioritise sustainable design and construct ion to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate 
change with energy efficiency, low carbon energy generation and climate resilience on a n 
equal footing with aesthetic appeal  and demonstrate that it will not exacerbate any climate 
change impacts elsewher e.

- 31 - Energy efficiency, renewable and low carbon energy  
CC1 - Energy efficiency, renewable and low carbon energy  
1. To help tackle climate change , developments will be expected to achieve the highest levels 
of energy efficiency to mitigate the effects of climate change.  
2. Development proposals for new housing will be permitted where , as minimum,  carbon 
dioxide emissions are reduced by the Target Emissions Rate  (TER)  set out in Building 
Regulations. This reduction should be achi eved through the provision of on -site renewable 
and low -carbon technologies, or by increasing the energy efficiency of the proposed buildings 
using a ‘Fabric First’ approach.  Where possible development should seek to exceed the TER.  
3. The inclusion of loc alised decentralised energy sources in developments will be supported 
and local opportunities to contribute towards decentralised energy supply from renewable and 
low-carbon technologies will be encouraged.  
4. The development of carbon neutral/zero carbon developments will be encouraged and 
supported where they meet the requirements of other policies  in this Plan .  
5. The highest standards of energy and water efficiency in existing developments will be 
supported through retrofitting.   
4.6 Improving the quality of the built environment and energy performance of new  and 
existing  buildings is a fundamental aim of this Plan. The council  seeks to promote the move 
towards a low carbon economy and remains committed to working towards zero carbon 
standards in all new developments. Future changes to energy efficiency standards will be kept 
under review and policy requirements will be updated with the prevailing standards if required.  
4.7 Policy CC1 seeks to ensure that all new development and refurbishment is as 
sustainable as possible in order to mitigate the impact of development on the environment , 
taking forward the council 's commitment to sustainable construction and design. All new 
buildings should be built to a standard which minimises the consumption of resources during 
construction and occupation , and where suitable the use of recycled or secondary aggregates 
in constru ction is encouraged . 
4.8 The targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions are expressed as a percentage 
improvement over the Target Emission Rate (TER) based on Part L of the 2013 Building 
Regulations  (or any subsequent update) .  
4.9 To achiev e a reductio n in emission s, the energy hierarchy should be followed:  
1. Be lean: use less energy  
2. Be clean: supply energy efficiently  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 32 - 3. Be green: use renewable energy  
 
Figure 6: the energy hierarchy  
 
4.10 The council 's forthcoming Climate Change and Renewables  Supplement ary Planning 
Document (SPD)  will be applied to development which involves the creation of one or more 
residential units, and commercial or other developments  where an increase in floorspace is 
proposed .  
4.11 For all development , applicants  are required to submit an Energy Statement to show 
how the requirements of the policy have been met within the proposed new development. 
Householder applications will be required to submit a Sustainable Design Checklist in line with 
the requirements set o ut in the forthcoming Climate Change and Renewables SPD.  For all 
developments the Council will require a proportionate response.  
Minimis ing waste  and promoting a circular economy  
CC2 - Minimising waste and promoting a circular economy  
1. All development proposals will be required to adopt a circular economy approach to building 
design and construction to reduce waste, to keep materials and products in use for as long as 
possible, and to minimise embodied carbon.  
2. Developments will be expected to :  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 33 - a) Ensure resource efficiency and reduce embodied carbon emissions by sourcing and 
prioritising materials that can easily be maintained, repaired and renewed across the 
development lifetime.  
b) Minimise the environmental impact of materials by specifying sustainably sourced , low 
impact and re -used or recycled materials . This should include identifying opportunities for the 
retention and reuse of existing materials on site (e.g. re -using demolition material on site). 
Materials should be locally sourced  wherever  possible to minimise transport emissions.  
c) Be designed for durability and flexibility as well as easy disassembly and reuse to minimise  
waste during the ‘in -use’ and ‘end of life’ phases of the development. Building shape and form 
should be designed to minimise embodied carbon and limit the need for repair and 
replacement.  
4.12 Policy CC2 supports the principles of a circular economy and promotes a more effective 
resource use, to ensure that resources are kept in use for as long as possible and to minimise 
waste. In minimi sing waste, the waste hierarchy should be followed:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7: the waste hierarchy  
4.13 A circular economy is one that seeks to promote waste minimisation by moving from a 
more traditional linear model of resource use, consumption and disposal, to one that promotes 
long-term sustained use, reuse and recycling. Elmbridge is supportive of the m ove towards a 
more circular economy. As such, circular economy principles should be embedded across all 
facets of the development lifecycle , from concept and design to build -out and occupation/use, 
in order to increase resource efficiency, minimise operati onal and embodied carbon 
emissions, and minimise residual waste, in line with Section R2 of the National Design Codes 
‘Careful selection of materials and construction techniques’.  
4.14 Circular economy opportunities might include using materials with a low er embodied 
carbon (e.g. timber rather than concrete frame – using timber also provides an opportunity to 
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 34 - sequester carbon), using more recycled content in the materials and finding other ways to 
enhance recovery and recyclability (e.g. reinforcement free concrete). Mechanical and 
electrical services will typically need to be replaced every 20 years and should therefore be 
designed to allow easy recovery, reconditioning and reuse whilst also optimising for 
performance and carbon emissions. Encouraging a ‘fa bric first’ approach to building design 
can also minimise mechanical plant and services in favour of natural ventilation . 
4.15 All new build development will be expected to endeavour to minimise embodied carbon 
in line with best practice targets contained within the latest industry guidance.  
Sustainable design standards  
CC3 - Sustainable design standards  
1. All developments must  achieve high standards of sustainable design and construction from 
new development, change of use, conversions and refurbishments to ensure that all 
development makes effective use of resources and materials, minimises water use, and 
assists in meeting carbon redu ction targets .  
This will be achieved by:  
a) All development must  demonstrate that the use of mains water has been minimised by 
incorporating measures such as smart metering, water saving and recycling measures, 
including retrofitting.  
b) All major develo pments and high-water  use developments must  include water saving 
measures such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling to reduce mains water 
consumption.  
c) All residential development must  meet a minimum internal water efficiency standard of 1 10 
litres per person per day, as set out in Building Regulations Part G or equivalent.  
d) All residential development of 10 or more dwellings must  achieve a Home Quality Mark 4 
star as a minimum and aim towards achieving a higher mark where possible , or any eq uivalent 
new standard .   
e) Proposals for conversion and change s of use to residential  for 10 or more dwellings  must  
meet BREEAM  UK Domestic Refurbishment 'Excellent' standard  or any equivalent new 
standard . 
f) All non-residential development must  achieve a minimum of BREEAM ‘Excellent’ UK New 
Construction standard  or equivalent , or any equivalent new standard . This standard should be 
achieved through the provision of on -site renewable and low -carbon technologies, and/or by 
increasing the energy efficiency of the proposed buildings .  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 35 - 4.16 The principles of sustainable design and construction are designed to be holistic and 
are more wide -ranging than energy performance alone. National sustainable design and 
constructi on standards such as BREEAM ensure that a development’s full impact on the 
environment, including water use, transport and land use and ecology, as well as energy use 
and waste are considered and addressed. Using these standards or any subsequently 
adopted  set of national sustainable construction standards, will assist in the delivery of a 
number of the policies covered in the Plan including the Climate Change, Transport, and 
Green and Blue Infrastructure policies.  
4.17 The highest standards of sustainable  design and construction should be applied to 
improve the environmental performance of new development. Development proposals must 
demonstrate that sustainable design standards are integral to the proposal, including its 
construction and operation, and ens ure that they are considered at the beginning of the design 
process.  
4.18 The BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment standard provides a recognised scheme and 
methodology by which conversions and change of use can demonstrate their adherence to 
sustainable design a nd construction methodologies. The council therefore requires all major 
schemes resulting in the creation of 10 or more new dwellings through the conversion or 
change of use of existing buildings to achieve a minimum BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 
rating of  ‘Excellent’ or equivalent. In particular, this scheme will help drive energy efficiency 
improvements across the borough’s existing building stock through its post -refurbishment 
Energy Efficiency Rating requirements , using a ‘Fabric First’ approach.

Sustainable transport  
CC4 - Sustainable transport  
Improved sustainable transport in the borough  will be achieved by:  
1. New development must  contribute to the delivery of an integrated, accessible and safe 
sustainable transport network, and maximise the us e of sustainable transport modes; including 
walking, cycling and public transport.  
2. Development proposals must  take account of the following:  
Cycling and Walking  
a) Promot ing active living environments to include the provision of quality, safe and direc t 
routes for cycling and walking that have priority over other forms of traffic;  
b) Improving existing cycle and walking routes to local facilities and public transport  nodes;  
Public Transport  
c) Provide and improve public and community transport services;  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 37 - Other transport modes  
d) Provide opportunities to establish car clubs or other similar schemes;  and 
e) Provide electric vehicle charging facilities situated in convenient and easy to use locations.  
3. New development will be required to provide and contr ibute towards suitable access, 
transport infrastructure and services that are necessary to make the development acceptable, 
including the mitigation of any adverse material impacts.  
4. New development that will generate significant amounts of movement, suc h as educational 
establishments, large business premises or residential developments of 50 home s or more, 
will be required to prepare and keep up -to-date an on -site Travel Plan associated with the 
development which contains measures to reduce car use and p romote sustainable transport 
modes.  
5. All d evelopment proposals will be required to provide cycle and vehicle parking and 
associated facilities, including electric vehicle charging points in line with the standards set out 
in the Parking Supplementary Pla nning Document  (SPD) .  
6. Car free development will be encouraged in appropriate locations and where supported by 
evidence demonstrating that proposal s would not lead to parking stress.  
4.19 Reducing reliance on private motor vehicles , reducing issues of air quality and 
congestion and supporting a modal shift in the way people live and access local services and 
facilities , is a key principle of the Plan.  
4.20 The council works with the local highway authority, neighbouring  authorities and other 
key transport bodies to develop strategies for the provision of transport infrastructure 
necessary to support sustainable development. This includes planning for development that 
facilitates more sustainable modes of transport, such as walking and cycling and mobility as a 
service.  
4.21 Sustainable transport modes are defined in national planning policy as any efficient, 
safe and accessible means of transport with overall low impact on the environment, including 
walking and cycling, low and ultralow emission vehicles, car sharing and publ ic transport. Car 
sharing includes car clubs, whereby club members (usually residents living in the same 
neighbourhood or development) hire a car for short periods.  
4.22 To make new developments acceptable in transport terms, the development will 
provide, or contribute towards, suitable access and transport infrastructure. In assessing 
whether development proposals will generate significant amounts of movement, the council 
will consider the current land use, the condition of the strategic and local road net work and the 
net number of trips generated by the development.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 38 - 4.23 As the local highway authority, Surrey County Council will be consulted at planning 
application stage on transport matters. Early engagement through the county council’s pre -
application se rvices is strongly encouraged. Surrey County Council will also advise on the 
contents of travel plans and other proposed sustainable transport measures.  
4.24 Implementation of travel plans and other transport measures will be secured through 
the use of pla nning conditions and/or legal agreements, as appropriate.  
4.25 While the primary responsibility for the delivery of transport provision in the borough  lies 
with Surrey County Council as  the local  highway authority, the council has involvement in 
some aspec ts, mainly via the planning system, community transport, and the management 
and enforcement of parking.  
4.26 Relevant design and  parking standards for vehicles and cycling parking within 
development proposals are s et out in the Parking SPD.   
 
Managing floo d risk   
CC5 - Managing flood risk 
To reduce the overall and local risk of flooding and manage water resources:  
1. Development must be located, designed and laid out to ensure that it is safe; the risk from 
flooding is minimised whilst not increasing the r isk of flooding elsewhere; and that residual 
risks are safely managed. Planning permission therefore will only be granted, or land allocated 
for development where it can be demonstrated that:  
a) Through a sequential test it is located in the lowest appropr iate flood risk zone in 
accordance with national policy and the Elmbridge Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  (SFRA);  
b)  It would not constrain the natural function of the flood plain, either by impeding flood flow or 
reducing storage capacity ; and  
c) Where s equential and exception tests have been undertaken, any development that takes 
place where there is a risk of flooding will need to ensure that flood mitigation measures are 
integrated into the design to minimise the risk to property and life should floodi ng occur.  
2. Permitted development rights for development which could result in a loss of flood storage 
capacity or impede flood flow will be removed from new developments in flood zone 3, in order 
to ensure the risk of flooding is not increased through un regulated development.  
3. In the event that development takes place in flood zones 2 or 3, the council  will require flood 
resistance and resilience measures in line with current Environment Agency advice and Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 39 - guidance  included within the Elmbridge SFRA and Flood Risk Supplementary Planning 
Document  (SPD) . 
4. Development proposed must attenuate surface water run -off so that the run -off rate is no 
greater than the run -off prior to development taking place or, if the site is previously 
developed, development ac tively  reduces run -off rates and volumes.  
5. All new development is required to ensure that sustainable drainage systems are used for 
the management of surface wat er. 
4.27 Elmbridge is a borough with a significant flood context, with the River Thames forming 
its northern boundary, and the Rivers Mole, Wey and Rythe  and the Dead River  all running 
through it.  Flooding is one of the most immediate and visible consequences of e xtreme 
weather  conditions  and climate change. Large parts of the borough are at risk from flooding 
and there has been a long history of flood events which have caused significant damage, 
distress and disruption to communities, businesses and the borough’s infrastructure network.  
4.28 As such, a robust policy is required to ensure effective flood risk management through 
the planning system and steer vulnerable development away from areas affected by flooding.  
Consideration in development proposals needs to b e given to  all forms of flooding, including 
fluvial flooding, groundwater, sewer, surface water and reservoir.  Where there is no 
alternative to development being located in an area at risk, Policy INF7 sets specific 
requirements to minimise the risk over the lifetime of the development and to increase 
resilience to flooding events. This includes ensuring occupants are empowered to take 
measures to prevent or minimise damage or threat to life through personal flood plans.  
4.29 The Elmbridge Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) contains detailed information 
on the types of flooding that has or could impact on different parts of the borough. Where there 
is a need for a site-specific  flood risk assessment at the application stage the independent 
scrutiny of t he assessment will be funded by the applicant. Applications should refer to the 
information contained in the SFRA and the Flood Risk SPD during the preparation of a 
planning application and site -specific flood risk assessment.  
 
 
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Tackling Climate Change
 
- 40 -   
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our e nvironment
 
- 41 - Chapter 5 - Principle 2  - Protecting and 
enhancing our environmen t
5.1 The natural, urban and historic environment in the borough makes Elmbridge a sought -
after place to live, work and visit. Enhancing and protecting these environments at the same 
time as responding to climate change and creating sustainable places is fundame ntal to the 
success of the Plan.  
5.2 The following policies cover a range of environmental issues with the common aim of 
ensuring that the environment of Elmbridge continues to be a pleasant place to live, work and 
enjoy leisure time, and that new develop ment contributes to a net environmental gain across 
the borough.  
Green and blue infrastructure  
ENV1 - Green and blue infrastructure  
1. The council will protect, maintain and enhance the network of accessible, multifunctional 
green and blue infrastructure a cross the borough for the biodiversity, recreational, 
connectivity, and health and wellbeing value it provides and for the contribution it makes 
towards combating and mitigating climate change impacts.  
2. The council will support proposals which meet the identified needs of local communities or  
provide new connections between existing green and blue infrastructure assets.  
3. Opportunities to provide public access to existing or new green and blue spaces will be 
supported, where this would not result in a n unacceptable  impact on biodiversity.  
3. Development proposals must be designed with green and/or blue infrastructure as an 
integral component, whether this be by enhancing existing features or providing new assets. 
Planning applications will be refused whe re this is not clearly demonstrated.  
4. Existing green and blue infrastructure will be safeguarded from development and protected 
from harm . Development will not be permitted where it causes harm to existing assets,  unless 
it can be demonstrated that the harm arising from the impact on these assets is clearly 
outweighed by other factors. This will include considering:  
a) Any ecological benefit of the feature;  
b) Whether the Green and Blue Infrastructure asset provid es essential social, community or 
recreational use; and  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 42 - c) The extent to which the asset makes a contribution to the environmental quality and 
distinctive characteristics of the site and wider area.  
In such cases, replacement provision of a n equivalent  or better quality  in a suitable location  
will be required.  
5. Development proposals will be refused unless the council is satisfied that the provision of 
green and/or blue infrastructure cannot be achieved on the site, it will seek to negotiate 
suitable alternative provision.  
6. Landscaping schemes are expected to provide enhancements to green and/or blue 
infrastructure and should utilise disease -resistant native and/or climate change -resilient 
species.  
7. The provision of new green and/or blue infrastructur e features, or the enhancement of 
existing features, must include provision for their long -term maintenance.  
8. There will be a presumption against granting permission for proposals to develop areas of 
existing open space, but such applications will be det ermined in accordance with national 
planning policy and guidance.  
5.3 Elmbridge hosts an extensive well -used, valued and high -quality green and blue 
infrastructure network. The blue infrastructure includes the River Thames, River Mole, River 
Wey, The Rythe, River Ember, Dead River and their corridors, and large reservoirs as  well as 
smaller waterbodies. The green infrastructure inc ludes natural and semi -natural rural and 
urban green spaces, parks and gardens, amenity green space, allotments, orchards and 
farmland, green corridors, nature conservation sites, built structures a nd functional green 
space.  Trees, woodlands and hedgerows also form an important part of the borough’s 
character and the setting of buildings and settlements.  
5.4 This series of green and blue spaces make an important contribution to the borough’s 
natural capital, providing valuable habitats for wildlife.  Green and blue infrastructure also 
contributes to cleaning and cooling the air, preventing flooding, providing habitats and 
networks for wildlife, and for recreational and cultural activity enhancing healt h and wellbeing.  
5.5 Crucial to the continued enjoyment of the benefits provided by green and blue 
infrastructure is a positive approach to provision, maintenance and enhancement, as set out in 
the policy below.  
5.6 Policy ENV1 sets out the council’s expectation that green and blue infrastructure will be 
incorporated into development schemes at the earliest stages of design in order to make the 
most of existing features and ensure the feasibility of new provision. This can include suitable 
landscaping and planting as well as more innovative solutions such as living walls and roofs.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 43 - 5.7 Opportunities to maximise the gains provided by each new feature should be pursued 
where possible, by making them beneficial for both people and wildlife and ad dressing multiple 
issues including environmental quality, biodiversity, amenity and drainage.  
5.8 The Green and Blue Infrastructure Study (2020) sets out both borough -wide and 
settlement -specific opportunities to contribute towards Elmbridge’s network of g reen and blue 
spaces. Development will also need to have regard to the requirements set out in the  
forthcoming Elmbridge Design Code.  
Landscape, trees and woodlands  
ENV2 – Landscape , trees and woodlands  
1. Development proposals must protect and enhance val ued landscapes through reflecting, 
conserving or enhancing existing landscapes and integrating the development into its  
surroundings.   
2. Development must not result in the loss of, or damage to, ancient trees, trees , woodlands  
and hedgerows that make or are capable of making a significant contribution to the character 
or amenities of an area, unless the benefits would clearly outweigh the loss and replacement 
planting is provided.  
3. Proposals will be expected to provide for the protection of existing tre es and their root 
systems prior to, during and after the construction period.  
4. Development should make provision for  new streets to be tree lined and  new trees, which 
should be sited so as to avoid any negative impacts on highway safety or disruption to 
underground utilities.  
5. Provision should be made for the successful implementation, maintenance and 
management of planting schemes.  
5.9 The presence of trees within, or adjacent to, a development site will necessitate the 
submission of supporting arboricultural information prepared by a suitably qualified person. To 
ensure that existing trees are protected for the important contribution th ey make to 
Elmbridge’s verdant environment, the council will use conditions to secure tree retention and 
protective measures. Conditions will also be used to secure full details of tree planting and 
maintenance, where these are not available at the applica tion stage.  
5.10 In accordance with Policy ENV1, where new planting is proposed this should be 
disease -resistant native, or climate -resilient, species. Planting schemes should not rely on the 
use of fast -growing coniferous or evergreen hedges for screening  purposes.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 44 - 5.11 Where a tree has a particularly high amenity value, the council will consider making a 
Tree Preservation Order under Section 198 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  
Local Green Spaces  
ENV3 - Local Green Spaces  
1. Areas designated as  Local Green Space on the Policies Map will be protected  from 
development, other than in very special circumstances, where  the potential harm to the Local 
Green Space and the purposes of including land within it is clearly outweighed by other 
consideration s. 
2.  Limited improvements to access, outdoor recreation and wildlife, or community functions 
associated with the Local Green Space may be allowed where it would maintain or enhance 
the characteristics for which the Local Green Space was designated.  
3. Pr oposals to enhance an existing community facility associated with or within the boundary 
of a Local Green Space will be supported, subject to maintaining or enhancing the 
characteristics for which the Local Green Space was designated and other relevant pla nning 
policies.  
5.12 High quality green space has a positive impact on the urban environment and is a vital 
part of a vibrant  and healthy  community. Green or open space of different types and sizes can 
provide tangible  health and wellbeing  benefits such as promoting healthier lifestyles  through 
recreation uses  and encouraging social interaction within a community. As well as these 
health and wellbeing benefits , green spaces can also improve the visual amenity of a 
particular area, provide o pportunities for biodiversity, and help alleviate and mitigate against 
the impacts of climate change, such as flooding.  
5.13 National policy recognises the importance of particular green areas to local 
communities and allows for their designation through t he preparation of a new Local Plan, 
provided they meet certain criteria.  Through assessment in the Local Green Space Study 
(update 2022 ) 51 areas  have been designated and are identified on the Policies Map and are 
listed in Appendix A4. These spaces are de monstrably special to the local community because 
of the wildlife they are home to, their beauty, their cultural or heritage significance, the 
tranquility they provide or their recreation value.  
5.14 Applications for development which enhance the use or function of the Local Green 
Space may include improvements to access, outdoor recreation facilities and wildlife, or 
community functions associated with the Local Green Space.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment

Protecting Green Belt  
ENV4 - Development in the Green Belt  
1. Land which is designated as Green Belt on the Policies Map will be protected against 
inappropriate development .  
2. Exceptions to inappropriate development in the Green Belt are set out in national planning 
policy. Where development does not fall within one of these exceptions and is therefore 
inappropriate, permission will not be granted unless very special circumstances, which clearly 
outweigh the harm to the Gree n Belt by reason of inappropriateness and any other harm, are 
demonstrated.  
5.15 The council places great importance on protecting the designated Green Belt . Most of 
the open space and countryside in Elmbridge in designated as Green Belt and the designatio n 
covers 5 7% (approximately 5,490ha) of the borough. It functions as a buffer to the outward 
growth of London , preserving the open countryside between the edge of London and the 
settlements in Surrey  as well as between the settlements in the borough themse lves and with 
those in neighbouring authorities .  
5.16 National planning policy advises that  most forms of development in the Green Belt are 
‘inappropriate development’. National policy lists out those developments which are 
considered to be  not in appropriate . For the purposes of interpreting those exceptions which 
result in alteration, extension or replacement of an existing building in the s ame use, the 
‘original building’ refers to the building as it existed on 1 July 1948 or, if constructed after 1 
July 1948, as it was built originally after this date.  In assessing how a proposal relates to the 
original building, a comparative assessment of  footprint and volume will be made. Where a 
proposed basement would be wholly subterranean;  does not exceed the footprint of the 
building and is served only by discreet lightwells ; ventilation systems or means of escape ; its 
footprint and volume will not c ontribute towards this assessment.  
5.17 Applicants are encouraged to take opportunities to improve the openness of , and 
access to, the Green Belt where this is possible. This could involve focusing development in a 
less conspicuous or open part of the site or removing a sprawl of buildings in favour of a single 
mass which leaves the remainder of the site open. The provision of public access to Green 
Belt land is also encouraged.  
5.18 Where weight is to be given to the benefits of a proposal advanced as a c ase for very 
special circumstances, the council will expect that the delivery of these benefits is shown to be 
viable and is secured by a legally enforceable  mechanism.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 47 - Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area  
ENV5 — Thames Basin Heaths Special Protecti on Area  
1. Development proposals which are likely to have a significant effect on the Thames Basin 
Heaths Special Protection Area will be subject to an appropriate assessment.  Applicants will 
be expected to submit sufficient information to enable such an assessment to be undertaken.   
2. Where a development proposal is subject to appropriate assessment, the  Council will only 
grant planning permission if either:  
(a) it is satisfied, having  taken into account  any relevant mitigation or avoidance measures, 
that the proposal will not adversely affect the integrity of the Thames Basin Heaths Special 
Protection Areas; or  
(b) if the proposal will adversely affect the integrity of the Thames Basin Heaths Special 
Protection Area, it  is satisfied that there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest in 
favour of granting permission in accordance with the relevant legal requirements.    
3. The following zones of influence will apply.   
Zone of Influence  Distanc e from the SPA  
A From 0m to 400m straight line distance from the SPA  
B From 400m to 5km straight line distance from the SPA  
C From 5km to 7km straight line distance from the SPA  
These zones of influence are depicted on the policies map.  The distances are measured as 
the crow flies, from  the SPA perimeter to the nearest part of the curtilage of the proposed 
dwelling.   
4. The following principles will be applied when the Council is assessing relevant development 
proposals within these zone s of influence under this policy:  
(a) Within Zone A, there will be a presumption against the grant of planning permission for 
development proposals that will result in a net increase in residential units.  That presumption 
will be rebutted only if it can b e demonstrated through a site-specific  appropriate assessment 
that there will be no adverse impact on the integrity of the Thames Basin Heaths Special 
Protection Area.  
(b) Within Zone B, development  proposals that will result in a net increase in residenti al units 
will be required to deliver suitable mitigation and / or avoidance measures in order to address Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 48 - potential adverse effects arising from increased recreational disturbance.  Such mitigation 
measures will consist of:  
(i) the provision, improvement a nd / or maintenance of Suitable Alternative Natural 
Greenspace (SANG) (or a suitable financial contribution towards the same) and  / or  
(ii) suitable financial contributions towards Strategic Access Management Monitoring ( SAMM)  
delivered and secured in accordance with the latest version of the Thames Basin Heaths 
Special Protection Area Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy and the updated Develop ment 
Contributions SPD.     
 (c) Within Zone C, development  proposals that will result in a net increase of fifty or more 
residential units will be assessed on a case by case basis.   
5.19 The Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (TBH  SPA) was design ated on 9 
March 2005, as part of the Europe -wide Natura 2000 network. Th e heathland lies to the south 
of the borough, in an area located between the M25, the A3 and the borough boundary. It is 
comprised predominantly of lowland heathland and woodland, a ch aracteristic landscape that 
supports distinctive rare and threatened flora and fauna.  
5.20 Its designation as a SPA is required under Habitats Regulations  on the conservation of 
wild birds, owing to the presence of breeding populations of three bird specie s: Dartford 
Warbler, Woodlark and Nightjar. These birds’  nest on or near the ground and as a result are 
vulnerable to predators, as well as to disturbance from informal recreational use. Many parts 
of the SPA are open to the public, enabling dog walking, r ambling and biking, all of which 
could have an adverse impact on reproduction of these endangered bird species.  
5.21 The council is under a legal obligation  to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the 
integrity of the TBH  SPA arising from new developm ent. Policy ENV 5 sets out the council’s 
approach to mitigation over the period of the Plan .  
5.22 Further details are set out within the TBH SPA Delivery Framework  and the council's 
most up -to-date mitigation strategy. Practical application of Policy ENV5 will be set out in the 
future update to the Development Contributions Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).

- 50 - Biodiversity   
ENV6 - Protecting, enhancing and recovering biodiversity  
1. The council will work with the Surrey Nature Partnership, statutory and voluntary bodies and 
specialist advisers to  conserve and enhance the borough’s biodiversity value, contributing 
towards a national network of wildlife -rich habitats and wider ecolog ical networks  to restore 
nature.  
2. Proposals must  ensure the conservation and enhancement of internationally, nationally and 
locally designated  sites will be supported. Proposals with the potential to adversely affect 
these sites will be refused unless clearly justified, in which case a satisfactory mitigation and 
management strategy will be required.  Proposals affecting Special Protection Areas will be 
considered under policy ENV5.  
3. Development proposals must  seek to protect, enhance and conserve  wildlife habitats and 
species by creating new natural areas or restoring and enhancing existing habitats .  
4. Development proposals must:  
a) Lead to a  net gain in biodiversity of a minimum of 10% on all sites , unless an exemption 
applies. The achievement of net gain should be informed  by an  ecological assessment of the 
site’s existing features and development impacts  and demonstrated using a net -gain ca lculator 
and biodiversity gain plan ; 
b) Protect , conserve and enhance  existing  biodiversity  features  and secure their long -term 
management and maintenance;  
c) Demonstrate that the proposals have adopted a strict approach to the mitigation hierarchy 
(i.e. a void, mitigate, compensate) and are able to justify all unavoidable impacts on 
biodiversity.  
5. Where it is not possible to retain existing biodiversity features, mitigation measures should  
be identified and secured on -site. In exceptional circumstances wh ere provision of mitigation 
measures is not possible on -site, compensatory measures involving biodiversity off -setting will 
be considered.  
6. Where development would result in harm to biodiversity, permission will not be granted 
unless it has been demonst rated that the need for , and the public benefits arising from , the 
development clearly outweigh the harm . The need to account for a net gain overall will remain.  
5.23  Biodiversity describes all species of animals, plants and everything else that is alive on 
our planet. Habitats are the places in which species live.  These species and their habitats 
contribute to the ecosystems service which provide substantial benefits to people and the Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 51 - economy.  The UK is amongst the most nature -depleted countries in the world. Decline in 
biodiversity is a concern not just for the loss of species, but also the impact this can have on 
the loss of ecosystem services such as clean air, clean water and soil quality, which a re 
essential for human health and supporting economic activity.  
5.24 The borough has varied natural environments, many of which are identified as of 
international, national and local importance. The Plan has a key role in conserving, restoring 
and enhanci ng sites of biodiversity importance, as well as priority habitats and ecological 
networks.  The council’s development strategy, and the specific sites selected, take account of 
the need to allocate land with the least environmental value. Sites of internati onal, national 
and local importance are identified and designated on the Policies Map . These designations in 
the borough are:  
International/ European –

5.25 Policy ENV 6 expects all new development to contribute to biodiversity net gain within a 
minimum gain of 10% on all sites. Where it is achievable , a higher net gain will be 
encouraged.  
5.26 Biodiversity net gain aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably better state 
than before  development . It seeks a demonstrable increase in habitat value compared to the 
pre-development baseline, prior to an application being submitted.  Where there is evidence 
that deliberate harm has occurred to the site’s pr e-development baseline before an application 
is made, this will be discounted in assessing the site’s underlying value in order to ensure that 
a genuine gain is achieved.  
5.27 By measuring the value of existing habitats, the Net Gain approach encourages 
developments affecting habitats of high biodiversity value to be avoided, given the difficulty 
and cost in compensating for them. It also leads to new developments integrating wildlife 
enhancing features into plans in order to boost their score of biodiversi ty units. Net gain must 
be quantified using an appropriate metric applied by a suitably qualified  professional. The 
biodiversity metric calculation tool produced by Natural England must be used.  
5.28 In addition to providing a measurable net gain, developm ent will be expected to follow 
the mitigation hierarchy set out in national policy.  
5.29 Measures to enhance biodiversity and mitigate any harm should be provided on -site. 
Off-site compensatory measures will be acceptable only in exceptional circumstances.  In such 
cases, the measures will be secured by legal agreement.  
5.30 Some types of development are exempt from the requirement to demonstrate a 10% 
net gain, but the remainder of Policy ENV6 will continue to apply. Exempt development types 
are those set out in the Environment Act and any subsequent regulations made by the 
Secretary of State.  
5.31 The council will use the District Level Licensing Approach and follow Natural England’s 
current guidance to assess planning applications that affect great creste d newts.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 53 - Environmental quality  
ENV7  - Environment al quality   
1. Development  must minimise exposure to, and the emission of, pollutants including noise, 
odour , light,  contamination and water  quality . Proposals must : 
a) Incorporate site zoning of pollution sources and receptors to ensure that existing and future 
occupiers are not subject to unacceptable level of odour pollution, noise , vibration or light 
disturbance, both within buildings and externally ; 
b) Avoid locati ng noise -sensitive uses close to existing sources of pollutants , unless the 
impact can be acceptably mitigated ; and  
c) Avoid any other adverse site -specific or environmental impacts  on humans or wildlife  that 
arise as a consequence of the development.  Wher e these impacts cannot be avoided, 
appropriate mitigation will be required.  
2. Proposals for external lighting will be permitted provided that there would not be an 
unacceptable impact on biodiversity (including the achievement of net gain) or to the local  
amenities of the area. Improvements to existing lighting to reduce its environmental impact or 
to improve energy efficiency will be supported.  
3. The re -use of land suspected to be contaminated will be supported where the land can be 
made safe for the pro posed use. Proposals should:  
a) Investigate the nature of the contamination, taking care to avoid the escape of contaminants 
which could present an environmental risk;  
b) Make provision for remediation measures; and  
c) Take account of ground conditions and  land instability . 
4. Proposals should seek to improve the quality of watercourses, groundwater and drinking 
water supplies, and should ensure that any contaminated run -off is prevented.  Development 
proposals must be designed and/ or located to prevent the  input of pollutants into water bodies 
and groundwater.  
5. Schemes where adverse  impact s cannot be overcome by mitigation will be refused  
permission . 
5.32 The control of pollution is critical to achieving the Plan's principles of promoting healthy 
lifesty les and an enhanced quality of life for residents and visitors to the borough. Pollution 
control through development also plays a significant role in planning for climate change and 
working in harmony with the environment to conserve natural resources and increase Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 54 - biodiversity.  The re -use of land suspected to be contaminated not only makes efficient use of 
the borough’s limited land resource, but also provides the opportunity for remediation to 
ensure that it is suitable for its proposed use, enhancing Elmb ridge’s overall environmental 
quality.  
5.33 The council will seek to ensure that local environmental impacts arising from 
development proposals do not lead to detrimental effects on the health, safety and the amenity 
of existing and future occupiers on the  development sites or the surrounding land. These 
potential impacts include, but are not limited to, noise and vibration, light pollution, odours and 
fumes, solar glare and solar dazzle as well as land contamination.  Development proposal 
should consider th ese impacts from the initial design of the proposal ensuring appropriate 
measures as considered from the outset.  
5.34 Sensitive uses should be located away from existing adverse impacts on the 
environment, amenity or living conditions due to pollution.  However, given the limited 
availability of land for development in the borough, this will not always be possible. 
Development proposals  should  therefore identify and mitigate any adverse impacts resulting 
from light pollution, noise, vibration and odour  to acceptable levels.  
5.35 Development proposals should follow any guidance provided by the council on local 
environmental impacts and pollution . During the construction phase of development, including 
any demolition, it may be necessary to require protecti on of the local environment from 
impacts such as dust, fumes, noise, construction traffic  and hazardous materials. To minimise 
these temporary impacts the council wil l use planning conditions to ensure implementation of 
Construction Management Plans or Con struction Environmental Management Plans where 
appropriate.  Other planning conditions may be used to reduce local environmental impacts to 
an acceptable level and to secure mitigation measures.  
 
Air quality  
ENV8  - Air quality  
1. The design and location of new development must take account of the need to improve air 
quality in accordance with the borough’s latest Air Quality Action Plan, local Air Quality 
Strategies  and Local Transport Plans, as well as national air quality policy and guidance.  
2. Development in areas of existing poor air quality, or proposals that might lead to a 
deterioration in air quality or to an exceedance of the n ational air quality objectives, either by 
itself, or in combination with other development, will require the sub mission of an Air Quality 
Assessment to be carried out in accordance with industry best practice . This should address:  
a) The cumulative effect of further emissions;  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 55 - b) The proposed measures of mitigation , using  good design , technical solutions  and offset ting 
measures that prevent the deterioration of air quality and ensure that National Air Quality 
Objectives  are not exceeded;  and 
c) The i dentif ication of  measures to  secure the safety and satisfactory quality of life  for the 
future occupie rs. Development must not result in an increased exposure to poor air quality, 
including odour, fumes and dust, particularly where developments might be occ upied or used 
by vulnerable people . 
3. All  development proposals should promote a shift to the use of sus tainable low emission 
transport  modes , to minimise the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality. In doing so, they 
should  provide on -site infrastructure to support these types of transport, including vehicle 
charging points and adequate cycle storage in accordance with the requirements set out in the 
update to the Parking Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).  
5.36 Clean air is critical to health, wellbeing and quality of life and is also important to 
support habitats and biodiversity. The nature of the borough with poor inter -connectivity by 
public transport, relative affluence and mobility, high car -ownership and close proximity to 
London and other larger towns, all contribute to high levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulates 
emissions in some locatio ns. 
5.37 Planning is an effective tool to improve air quality. It can be used to locate development 
to reduce emissions overall, or to reduce the direct impacts of new development  through 
policy requirements. Air quality is a  particular problem  in several of the borough ’s centres  and 
Air Quality Management Areas have been established in these locations.  
5.38 As set out in the Strategic Policies  (SS1, SS2 and SS3)  of this Plan, proposed 
development allocations have been located to minimise the need to travel , there by reducing 
emissions from road traffic . Measures  to improve air quality include reducing the need to 
travel, providing electric vehicle charging points and promoting alternative modes of transport 
to private motor vehicles, including cycling, walki ng and public transport. The secondary 
effects of these actions are improvements to general health and wellbeing.  Chapter 8: 
Providing Infrastructure  and Connectivi ty includes policies which seek to achieve this . 
5.39 New vehicle technology, such as hybrid and electric engines, has significant potential to 
improve air quality by reducing the use of traditional fuel vehicles, which are a main source of 
air pollutants within the borough. New technology takes time to establish and the lack of 
electric ch arging points is cited as one of the main deterrents for individuals considering 
switching to such vehicles. Policy INF 6 and the  forthcoming update to the  Parking SPD require 
all new development to incorporate electric vehicle charging points.  
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 56 - Design Qual ity 
ENV9 – Urban design quality  
1. All new buildings and places are  required to be of a high quality, beautiful and sustainable,  
and respond positively and enhances the local context  to create a visually attractive, 
distinctive environment that will endure  over its lifetime.  
2. Development should be consistent  with the design principles set out in the National Design 
Guide and National Model Design Code , on which the forthcoming Elmbridge Design Code will 
be based . Development that is not well designed will be refused  where it fails to reflect 
government guidance on design and local design policies and the code . 
2. The council will pursue a co-ordinated, comprehensive approach to improv ing the borough’s 
existing public realm. Development will need to demonstrate how it will contribute positively to 
the public realm  and natural environment including the provision of trees  in new streets and 
open spaces . 
4. Development must : 
a) Encourage and enable sustainable and healthy lifestyles by incorporating publ ic realm , 
including streets and open spaces,  which facilitate the use of active modes of travel  such as 
walking and cycling ; 
b) Promote community cohesion  and wellbeing by creating sustainable spaces and 
environments that are safe, inclusive and accessible , provide for multi -generational  needs  and 
are well-managed and maintained ; and 
c) Preserve and enhance Elmbridge’s special qualities and distinctive character, townscape 
and landscape  and create a strong sense of place  by applying the design principles se t out in  
the forthcoming  Elmbridge Design Code  and the Conservation Area Character Appraisals  and 
Management Plans.  
4. Within the allocated sites identified by policies in this Plan, development should take into 
account the character of the area, and may i nclude innovative designs provided that it is of 
excellent design quality , raising the standard of design, is visually attractive, promotes high 
levels of sustainability,  and would integrate sensitively into the locality.  
5. In assessing the design qualit y of proposals, particular attention will be paid to the following:  
a) Layout (or masterplan ); 
b) Scale  of buildings ; 
c) Built form and m assing;  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 57 - d) Building h eight;  
e) Character and appearance  
f) Public realm and amenity spaces;  
g) Landscap ing including hard and soft landscaping features  
h) Materials  
I) Detailing;  
i) Accessibility , connectivity and permeability; and  
k) Security and crime prevention measures.  
6. All development proposals will be assessed against the further guidance set out in t he 
forthcoming Elmbridge Design Code  that will reflect local aspirations .  
7. Public and private accessible amenity space must  be distinct, safe, inclusive, secure and 
provide opportunities for social interaction and recreation that contribut es to the heal th and 
wellbeing of communities. Natural surveillance should be provided for public amenity spaces 
where practical should to enhance security . 
8. Development proposals must  include a soft and hard landscaping scheme which effectively 
integrates the built f orm into its surroundings and contributes towards the aims of Policies 
ENV1, ENV2 and ENV6.  
9. Development must demonstrate that it is  fully adaptable and resilient to the impacts of a 
changing climate, including overheating, flooding, water shortages/drou ght and subsidence, 
and must not exacerbate the impacts of climate change elsewhere.  
10. To protect the amenities of existing residents and future occupiers, development proposals 
must  be designed to prevent:  
a) Overlooking, resulting in a loss of privacy;   
b) Lack of outlook or sense of enclosure;  
c) Loss of daylight and sunlight, or overshadowing; and  
d) Disturbance arising from traffic movements.  
5.40 Well-designed places reflect local distinctiveness, promote a strong sense of place and 
community and pr ovide a high -quality environment for living and working.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 58 - 5.41 The purpose of the policy is to maintain, reinforce and enhance the local character and 
features that give the area its distinctive and clear identity. Opportunities should be taken to 
improve the general level of urban design quality of an area.  
5.42 Schemes should be based on a sound understanding of the site and its wider context 
and following the locally specific guidance set out in the forthcoming Elmbridge  Design Code  
in addition to the well -established urban design principles set out in national policy and 
guidance set out in the NPPF, National Design Guide and National Model Design Code . 
5.43 All development affects the public realm: larger developments create new streets and 
public spaces, whilst smaller proposals affect the appearance of existi ng spaces . They should 
do so in a way that achieves a positive impact and reinforces a strong sense of place.  
5.44 The council will use conditions to secure details of materials, screening and boundary 
treatments, as well as the implementation and maintena nce of landscaping schemes.  
Preserving and enhancing our heritage assets  
ENV10 - Heritage assets  
1. The council will give great weight to the conservation of designated heritage assets , assets 
at risk and non -designated heritage assets  and will pursue suitable opportunities for the 
conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment, recognising its role and contribution 
in achieving sustainable development.  
2. Development proposals should be designed to sustain and, where possible, enhance the 
significance of these assets and their settings. They should do this by describing the 
significance of the affected heritage assets and explaining how the proposal has been formed 
to take this into account. Any negative impact on the significance of a desi gnated heritage 
asset (whether arising through harm or total loss) must have a clear and convincing 
justification. The impact of development proposals on the significance of heritage assets and 
their settings will be considered in accordance with case law,  legislation and national planning 
policy and guidance.  
3. Opportunities to remove buildings or structures which detract from the significance of a 
heritage asset will be supported.  
4. Proposals which would result in the partial or total demolition of buil dings or structures 
within a conservation area will be permitted only where the proposed development would 
contribute positively to the character and appearance of the conservation area, taking into 
account any harm which would arise from the loss. In such  cases, the proposals for the re -
development of the site should be appropriately detailed and shown to be viable.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 59 - 5. Development proposals should take into account the potential for heritage assets of 
archaeological importance being present on the site. A desk -based assessment, at a 
minimum, will be required for sites which are located within Areas of High Archaeological 
Potential, and for any site outside of these which is greater in area than 0.4ha.   
5.45 The historic environment in Elmbridge includes sta tutorily and locally listed buildings, 
Conservation Areas, Historic Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments and Sites of 
Archaeological Potential which make an important contribution to the borough’s attractive 
environment as well as its economic and social  vitality.  
5.46 Heritage assets are irreplaceable resources and the planning system plays a key role in 
protecting and enhancing the historic environment as part of achieving sustainable 
development. The Plan’s spatial strategy sets out a brownfield first approach, optimising the 
use of previously develop ed land, and as such development will be located in  the urban area 
which includes many of Elmbridge’s heritage assets. It is therefore imperative that 
development is respectful of the historic environment and that opportunities are taken to 
enhance the significance and enjoyment of heritage assets through a high standard of design.  
5.47 Heritage assets should be conserved in a manner proportionate to their significance. In 
applying policy ENV10, the council will require development proposals which are likely to 
affect heritage assets or their settings to be  accompanied by a statement describing the 
significance of any heritage assets affected. For the purposes of policy ENV10, the definitions 
of ‘heritage asset’ and ‘siginificance’ used in the National Planning Policy Framework will 
apply. In considering the  setting of assets, consideration will extend to the contribution made 
by trees and other soft landscaping features which may be affected by the proposal.  
5.48 In demonstrating that the significance of a heritage asset has been understood and that 
a propos al has been sensitively designed to take account of the asset’s significance, 
applicants will be expected to draw on a range of evidence and supporting documents 
including the Conservation Area Character Appraisals and Management Plans, the Surrey 
Historic  Environment Record, the Local Design Code and the expertise of a suitably -qualified 
heritage professional. Where a desk -based assessment has identified the potential for assets 
of archaeological importance to be present, a field -based evaluation may be ne cessary. 
Planning conditions may be used to secure compliance with a programme of works agreed 
prior to commencement.  
5.49 Though such cases will be exceptional, where the total or partial loss of a heritage 
asset is approved, conditions will be used to se cure the recording of the asset’s 
archaeological, architectural, artistic, cultural or historic significance and this information 
should be made publicly available.  
5.50 Historic fabric and features of special architectural or historic interest should be r etained 
and repaired insitu wherever possible. The Plan encourages high quality development that 
reflects the identity of local surroundings and materials but  supports appropriate innovation. Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Protecting and enhancing our environment
 
- 60 - 5.51 Applicants should engage with the local community and consu lt with local heritage and 
conservation groups, which may be able to offer valuable local insight and knowledge. The 
Local Design Code will provide key design guidelines and should be used in association with 
more specialist heritage advice and information . 
5.52 Environmental improvements and adaptation to climate change will be supported, but 
sensitive design and siting is required to prevent any undue harm to the historic asset.  
Strategic Views  
ENV11 – Strategic views   
1. Development within Strategic Vie ws will be permitted provided that it has been well -
designed to take account of the setting, character and amenity value of the view. Proposals 
must  not obscure or adversely affect these views.  
2. Proposals to create new views, or reinstate obscured views,  will be supported.  
5.53 There are two strategic views indicated on the Policies Map , both of which contribute to 
variety and interest in the landscape . The first of these is Dorking Gap from Oxshott Heath, 
which is a panoramic view due south and south -east of the North Downs. It is bisected by the 
Dorking Gap and includes the spire of Ranmore Church, which is approximately 10 miles 
away within the neighbouring district of Mole Valley. The view in the foreground is of the open 
heathland and woodland of Oxsh ott Heath, with limited visibility of Oxshott’s residential 
properties. The view forms part of the setting of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB) due to the physical and visual relationship . The s etting of AONBs is material 
to their protection , and the designation of this view contributes to the  duty to conserve and 
enhance the AONB  and its scenic beauty . 
5.54 The second strategic view is The River Thames Meadowlands from Hurst Park. The 
view takes in the Arcadian landscape of the Thames from Hurst Park and includes Garrick’s 
Temple to Shakespeare (within the neighbouring London Borough of Richmond -upon -
Thames).  It also extends across open riverside lands including areas of vegetation within 
Hurst Meadows, Garrick’s Ait, the River Thames and Hampton Riverside beyond. The Thames 
Landscape Strategy sets out recommendations in respect of vegetation management.  
  
 
  
 
  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Delivering homes 
 
- 61 - Chapter 6 - Principle 3 - Delivering homes 
 
6.1 At the heart of the Plan is sustainable place -making and responding to the climate 
change emergency. In delivering homes for our residents , the Plan seeks to optimise 
opportunities to increase the supply of new homes in the borough sustainably and with car eful 
consideration of our natural resources.  
6.2 The following policies will deliver a range of housing and support a mixture of housing 
tenures and unit sizes.  
6.3 All new homes will be well -designed and of a high -quality meeting amenity and space 
standa rds and providing choice to existing and future residents by responding to evolving 
lifestyles, meeting their needs over the course of their lifetime and changing circumstances.  
Housing delivery  
HOU1  - Housing delivery  
Opportunities for housing growth in Elmbridge will be optimised to deliver a minimum of  452 
homes per annum  over the plan period.  
To achieve this the council will:  
1. Adopt a requirement in line with the Elmbridge Housing Trajectory.  
2. Deliver  a minimum of  30% affordable homes across the pl an period.  
3. Deliver homes through site allocations as detailed in Chapter 9 and as shown on the 
Policies Map.  
4. Maximise opportunities to increase the supply of additional homes on unallocated suitable 
and available land.  
5. Ensure the efficient use of  land by requiring all new residential and mixed -use development 
to demonstrate that it represents the optimal use of land and density, positively responding to 
the location and the appearance of the surrounding area. This may include the sub -division 
and/or redevelopment of large single homes into apartments or redevelopment of those sites 
to form smaller homes. The council will support infill* housing developments that engage 
innovative approaches and are compliant with other relevant policies of this Pla n. 
6. Ensure that new homes are well designed, address different housing needs and provide a 
variety of housing choices, taking account of the requirements of other policies in th is Plan. 
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 62 - 7. Work with partners to s upport the regeneration and renewal of com munities and their wider 
areas.  
8. Resisting any developments that involve a net loss of housing, unless it can be 
demonstrated that the benefits of the development outweigh the harm.  
*inclusive of development proposals involving the complete or partial redevelopment of 
backland and/or residential garden land.  
6.4 To support the Government’s commitment to significantly boost the delivery of new 
homes, the council is required to determine the minimum number of homes needed locally and 
to set out in  the Local Plan how this will be delivered; ensuring a sufficient supply of land to 
meet the housing target going forward.  
6.5 The scale and location of housing growth has been informed by careful consideration of 
the evidence and the balancing of the soci al, economic and environmental positive and 
negative effects which could arise from development.  
6.6 The Plan seeks to respond positively to the housing needs of the borough over the 
fifteen -year plan period from 2021 - 2037. The local housing need figure i s calculated using the 
standard methodology set out in national planning policy and guidance. It is based on 
demographic trends (population projections) and market signals (affordability of homes). 
However, this is not automatically transposed to be the ho using target for the borough.  
6.7 Rather, t he housing target for the Plan has been informed by the calculation of housing 
need using the standard methodology, our assessment of local housing needs and our 
understanding of the borough’s environmental const raints as set out in national policy.  
6.8 The anticipated number of homes to be delivered by each site allocation is set in the 
Site Allocations policies in Chapter 4.  
6.9 The housing trajectory includes a windfall allowance which will contribute to the de livery 
of new homes in the plan period. Windfall sites are defined in national planning policy as sites 
not specifically identified in the Plan. These are sites which are expected to become available 
during the plan period but are currently unidentified. T hese include sites with the capacity of 
up to five (net) homes and where buildings or land in other uses becomes available for 
development.  
6.10 Whilst they cannot be included in the housing trajectory as windfalls, larger sites (5 net 
homes or more) which  come forward for development unexpectedly across the plan  period, 
will upon the grant of planning permission, be counted towards meeting the council’s housing 
target as set out in Policy HOU1.  
6.11 The expected delivery of housing development over the pla n period is set out in 
appendix A5.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 63 - 6.12 The council is required to ensure a rolling five -year supply of housing land to fulfill the 
housing target and ensure choice in the market. The supply includes homes under 
construction, with planning permission but not started, and allocations  where there is 
confidence that they will be delivered within the five -year timeframe. A windfall allowance is 
also added to the supply figures.  
Optimisation of sites  
HOU2  - Optimisation  of sites  
1. Development must make efficient use of land and optimise sites within the  urban area of the 
borough . 
2. Sites within or on the edge of* town, district and local centres and sites adjacent to train 
stations will deliver  additional homes by:  
a) Provision of higher density housing such as flats and terraced homes rather than semi -
detached and detached homes;  
b) Infill and backland developments to the rear of existing frontage property(ies);  
c) Promoting mixed use development and increased building heights; and  
d) Seeking comprehensive development that leads to more efficient and effective site layouts.   
* edge of centre as defined by national policy.  
3. Within town, district and local centres as defined on the Policies Map and near train stations 
(as identified in 2 above), development shall be predominantly one - and two - bedroom homes . 
6.13 One of the key  aims of the Plan’s growth strategy is to boost the supply of new homes 
by responding to local housing need through a ‘brownfield first’ approach and by  ensuring the 
efficient use of land within the most sustainable locations of the borough.  
6.14 To avoid piecemeal development, proposals for a site adjacent to another site with 
development potential (as identified in the latest LAA or equivalent land supply evidence base 
document) should demonstrate that all reasonable attempts to develop the sites 
comprehe nsively have been exhausted. Development proposals that impede  the potential for 
developing an adjoining site will not be supported.  Developers and landowners of adjoining 
sites will be encouraged to work together with key partners to deliver comprehensive  
development.  
6.15 Further guidance on the optimisation of sites can be found in the forthcoming Elmbridge 
Design Code.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 64 - Delivering the right homes  
HOU3  - Housing mix  
The delivery of the right homes to address local housing need will be achieved by:  
1. All  housing development has to take into account and reflect local housing needs in terms 
of the tenure, size and type of dwellings, as set out in the most recent assessment of local 
housing need.  
2. Emphasis in residential development proposals is placed on the provision of one -, two - and 
three - bedroom homes suitable for occupation by, for example, newly forming households, 
young couples, expanding families and older people looking to move to a smaller property.  
3. Where the internal layout of a one-, two - or three - bedroom home appears designed to 
circumvent Policy HOU3 by facilitating subsequent subdivision of large rooms, planning 
permission may be refused on the grounds that the proposal would be contrary to P olicy 
HOU3.  
4. Proposals for alternative forms of housing (e.g. purpose -built housing of multiple occupation 
(HMOs), live work units or other less conventional housing types), will be considered on their 
merits, taking into account evidence of how they wou ld help to meet local housing needs and 
how they would be managed to safeguard the character and amenities of the area  in 
accordance with other Plan policies.  
5. Where housing appears to be designed to circumvent policy HOU4 and the provision of 
affordable  housing, planning permission may be refused  
6.16 To ensure that a wide choice of high -quality homes can be delivered to provide more 
opportunities for home ownership and to enable the creation of sustainable, inclusive and 
mixed communities, it is necess ary to plan for a mix of housing that is informed by the needs 
of different groups within the community.  
6.17 To provide a balanced housing market and to deliver the right homes addressing our 
local need, Policy HOU3 will be applied to all housing developm ents.  
6.18 Based on the latest evidence in the Local Housing Needs  Assessment (2020)  it is 
important that new housing development focuses on providing smaller dwellings. The 
evidence shows that 90% of new market housing will need to be one - (20%), two - (50%) and 
three - (20%)  bedroom homes, and only 10% of homes will need to be of four or more 
bedrooms.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 65 - 6.19 When the Local Housing Needs Assessment, or equivalent assessment, is updated, 
development proposals will be expected under HOU3 (1) to take into account the most recent 
housing need for the borough.  
6.20 The existing housing stock in E lmbridge and past delivery of new homes has been 
dominated by four -bed plus sized homes. This has restricted housing choice and exacerbated 
affordability issues in the borough. Policy HOU3 seeks to ensure that future housing stock 
reflects local need and p rovides housing choice.  
6.21 Policy HOU3 prioritises the provision of one -, two - and three - bedroom homes as these 
are currently of greatest need. However, the locational delivery of one - bedroom homes will be 
predominately in sustainable locations in town , village and local centres and near train 
stations, as part of higher density developments.  
6.22 Development in these locations is a key part of the strategy to respond to local housing 
need through a ‘brownfield first’ approach and through the requiremen t of making efficient use 
of land in the most sustainable locations in the borough.  
6.23 This approach is consistent with evidence in the Local Housing Needs  Assessment , 
responding to the particular needs of younger and older people seeking suitable proper ties to 
downsize without moving away from their community.  
Delivering affordable homes  
HOU4  - Affordable housing  
1. The council will require proposals to provide affordable homes  on all residential 
developments comprising self -contained units, including but not limited to where housing for 
older people, age -restricted market housing, retirement living/sheltered housing or extra care 
is provided,  as follows:  
a) On brownfield sites of 10 or more new units, on -site provision of 30% affordable housing of 
the gross  number of dwellings ; 
b) On greenfield sites of 10 or more new units, on -site provision of 40% affordable housing of 
the gross  number of dwellings ; and  
c) On sites of 9 or les s units, a financial contribution equivalent to the provision of 20% 
affordable housing of the gross number of dwellings.  
2. The provision of affordable housing will be required on -site. Only in exceptional 
circumstances, and subject to applicants providin g a full justification  for example, where it 
would secure better outcomes in meeting the borough’s affordable housing needs , will an 
alternative to on -site provision be considered . Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 66 - 3. Affordable housing provision will be expected to incorporate a mix of dw elling types, sizes 
and tenure, and should reflect the type of housing required in the most up -to-date evidence of 
housing need for the borough, having regard to the form and type of development appropriate 
for the site. 25% of all affordable housing will be First Homes. The rest (75%) of the affordable 
housing will provide  affordable housing in line with the identified need in the council’s latest 
housing need assessment . All affordable housing should be genuinely affordable, with the cost 
substantially lo wer than 30% below local market prices and rents.  
4. Judgements about the level, tenure and mix of affordable housing will have regard to:  
a) The identified need in the council’s latest housing need assessment and the council’s 
Housing Strategy; and  
b) The overall viability of the scheme and any site -specific abnormal costs.  
5. Where a site has been sub -divided or is not being developed to its full potential, so as to 
circumvent the affordable housing threshold for on -site provision, the council will seek a level 
of affordable housing provision that would have been achieved on the site as a whole had it 
come forward as a single scheme.  
6. The affordable homes should be desi gned to be fully integrated into the open market 
housing on a tenure blind basis and comply with other policies in the Plan.  
7. Self and custom build residential developments are subject to the policy requirements of 
HOU4 in relation to affordable housing contributions. However, on schemes relating to 1 net 
gain, a self -build exemption can be applied for.  
8. Where the council agrees a lower affordable housing provision, it reserves the right through 
a legal agreement to require a review mechanism to reasses s the viability of a site at different 
stages of the development.  
9. Affordable housing is not required where a residential scheme relates wholly to Gypsy, 
Roma, Traveller or Travelling Showpeople  accommodation, mobile home sites, ancillary 
accommodation used incidentally to a main dwelling, staff accommodation used ancillary to 
the main use of the premises, river boat moorings or student  accommodation.  
 
6.24 Housing affordability is a significant issue for Elmbridge and is a key priority for the 
council. The ratio of average wages to average house prices is amongst the highest in 
England, leading to people working in Elmbridge having difficulty in affording a home in the 
same area.  
6.25 As a resul t, too many young people and families are moving out of the borough to have 
a realistic prospect of owning or renting their own home. Our older residents struggle to Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 67 - downsize affordably in a way that enables them to continue to live independently or with c are 
packages, and to remain in their communities.  
6.26 The cost of housing and reliance on people travelling into the borough is also making it 
difficult for local business and valued services to attract and retain employees, including 
essential key worker s, such as teachers and health care providers. In -commuting also places 
added pressure on the road network impacting on congestion and air quality, the causes of 
climate change.  
6.27 The most recent Local Housing Needs Assessment identified 269 affordable homes per 
annum are needed in the borough. The majority of affordable housing will come forward in 
market schemes, and Policy HOU4 seeks to maximise the amount of affordable housing on 
each qualifying site whilst making sure that residential schemes remain  deliverable  and viable . 
6.28 To meet the overall affordable housing target and respond to the acute need for 
genuinely affordable homes all residential developments are required to meet the 
requirements of Policy HOU4.   
6.29 Policy HOU4 will apply to all  types of residential development where self -contained 
units are provided, including for example private retirement homes, sheltered accommodation, 
extra care schemes and other self -contained housing for older people. Self and custom build 
residential deve lopments are also subject to the policy requirements of HOU4 in relation to 
affordable housing contributions. However, to assist residents bringing forward their own 
homes in the borough, a self -build exemption from the affordable housing contribution is 
available subject to occupation conditions. Further information will be found in the updated 
Development Contributions SPD.  
6.30 Many of the new homes in Elmbridge are delivered on small sites and sites of less than 
10 dwellings. With the affordable housing need so acute in the borough, Policy HOU4 expects 
these sites to support the provision of affordable housing in the borough via  a financial 
contribution.  
6.31 On larger sites of 10 or more new homes, provision of affordable housing will be 
required to be made on -site. Only in exceptional circumstances will an alternative to on -site 
provision be considered and only where it would secure better outcomes in meeting the 
borough’s housing needs. Such exceptions could include larger self and custom build 
residential schemes.  
6.32 The forms of housing which fall within the definition of affordable housing are defined in 
the glossary. On development sites owned by the council, affordable housing provision may 
be required to respond to the needs of current local housing nominations.  
6.33 In cases where it appears to the council that a site has been subdivided or will be 
brought forward in p hases, each phase will be expected to contribute proportionally towards Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 68 - the affordable housing requirement of the whole site. The affordable housing is expected to be 
delivered alongside the market housing of any scheme.  
6.34 The affordable housing require ments and thresholds of this policy are achievable. This 
has been confirmed by the viability assessment of the Local Plan. Unless there are particular 
circumstances that have arisen post adoption of the Plan, there should be no need for a 
further viability  assessment at the decision -making stage.  
6.35 Developers and site promoters are expected to take account of costs arising from 
affordable housing and other requirements when negotiating to purchase land for 
development. The price paid for land is not a j ustification for failing to comply with the relevant 
policies in the Plan.  
6.36 Where unique circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment at the 
application stage, it will be up to the applicant to demonstrate how those circumstances differ 
from the viability assessment carried out to inform the Plan, having regard to the specific 
grounds set out in national planning guidance. Viability assessments submitted at the 
application stage should be prepared in line with national planning guidance. Th ey will be 
made publicly available unless exceptionally agreed with the council otherwise.  
6.37 Independent scrutiny of the viability assessment will be funded by the applicant.  
6.38 Vacant building credit, as described in national planning guidance, will  be applied to 
developments where a vacant building is either converted or replaced. The credit does not 
apply when a building has been abandoned.  
6.39 Planning obligations will be used to ensure that the affordable housing remains 
available at an afforda ble price for future eligible households, or for the subsidy to be recycled 
to alternative affordable housing provision.  
6.40 Further details on the practical application of Policy HOU4, including legal agreements 
and early and late review mechanisms, are set out in the Development Contributions 
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).  
Delivering quality homes  
HOU5  - Housing technical standards  
Liveable, functional, adaptable and accessible new homes, including those resulting from 
changes of use and conversions, will be delivered by meeting the following requirements:  
1. All new homes must provide sufficient internal space and ceiling heights to cater for future 
occupants. The gross internal floor area for each new home should meet or exceed the 
Natio nally Described Space Standard, or any subsequent equivalent standard.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 69 - 2. All new homes must have rooms , layouts  and storage areas  which are functional and fit for 
their purpose, meeting the changing needs of occupiers over their lifetimes and supporting 
more sustainable lifestyles including home working . 
3. Proposals will demonstrate how all habitable rooms are provided with an adequ ate level of 
visual and acoustic privacy in relation to neighbouring properties and uses, the street and 
other public spaces.  
4. All new homes should be dual aspect, unless there are exceptional circumstances that 
justify the inclusion of any single -aspect  homes. Single aspect homes that are north facing or 
are exposed to noise levels that would lead to significant adverse impact on health and quality 
of life will not be permitted.  
5. New homes should achieve a minimum average daylight factor (ADF) target o f 1 per cent 
for a bedroom and 1.5 per cent for a living room.  
6. All new homes, including flatted developments, should have access to an element of private 
outdoor amenity space of quality, proportionate to the size of home and which maximises the 
availab ility of sunlight and natural light. Balconies will count towards private amenity space.  
7. A minimum of 10% of new homes will be required to meet Building Regulations standard 
M4 (2) ‘accessible and adaptable dwellings’ on sites of 10 or more new homes. A dditionally , a 
minimum of 5% of new homes will be required to meet Building Regulations standard M4 (3) 
‘wheelchair user dwellings’ to help meet the specific needs of older people and those with 
mobility, accessibility and support needs on  sites of 20 or m ore new homes. The number of 
homes provided to meet the specified standards should be rounded up to the nearest whole 
home.  
6.41 The delivery of quality homes and living environments is one of the key aspirations of 
the Plan. Developments which consider ma tters of inclusive design, accessibility and technical 
requirements at an early stage of and throughout the development process are the most 
successful at achieving quality homes and living environments.  
6.42 National planning policy specifies that local p olicies relating to the sustainability of 
buildings should reflect the optional technical requirements set out by the Government. The 
Plan therefore includes the technical requirements exceeding the minimum standards required 
by Building Regulations in res pect of access and water; as well as the nationally described 
space standards.  
6.43 All new homes are required to be designed to provide high -quality living environments 
and sufficient internal space to cater for a variety of different household needs with  the aim of 
promoting ease of liveability, accessibility and quality of life. Providing a sufficient level of 
internal space can also help facilitate home -working and minimise the need to travel, assisting 
in the council’s aim to tackle climate change.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 70 - 6.44 The provision of external amenity space has a significant positive impact on people’s 
physical and mental health and wellbeing and contributes to providing high -quality living 
environments. In addition, outdoor amenity spaces such as gardens and green ro ofs help to 
adapt to climate change, have biodiversity benefits as well as have an important role in the 
borough’s Green Infrastructure network. Balconies are often of greater value in terms of 
privacy and usability than communal areas and will count towar ds private amenity space.  They 
should be suitably located and alternatives to balconies may need to be considered in areas 
such as Air Quality Management Areas . 
6.45 It is important to ensure that new homes are accessible to all and are adaptable to the 
changing needs of residents throughout their lives. This will become increasingly more 
significant with a projected growth in the number of older people. It will be important to enable 
residents to stay within their own homes wherever possible as their needs  change, rather than 
having to move to more specialist accommodation. Designing new homes to meet the national 
standard for accessible and adaptable dwellings will enable easier future alterations and 
adjustments.  
6.46 The requirement for accessible and ad aptable homes will apply to all new residential 
developments as outlined in Policy HOU5.  
6.47 Elmbridge is located within an area of water -stress and the evidence requires the 
inclusion of the higher Building Regulations water efficiency standard to be ap plied to new 
developments. Water consumption must become as sustainable as possible and resilience 
measures will be required in all new residential developments.  
6.48 Further details and guidance on the practical application of Policy HOU5, as well as the 
private amenity standards, are set out in the forthcoming Climate Change & Renewables  
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  and the forthcoming Elmbridge Design Code.  
 
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 71 - Delivering specialist homes  
HOU6  - Specialist accommodation  
To deliver housing choice in the borough and specialist forms of accommodation that meet 
local needs:  
1. Development for specialist accommodation, including older person’s housing, will only be 
permitted where there is clear and robust evidence that demonstrates a local need  for the new 
accommodation, the type and level of care it offers , and does not result in an over provision of 
that particular type of accommodation and care within the borough.  
2. Developments providing older persons’ accommodation shall deliver the level of affordable 
housing required by Policy HOU4.  
3. All new developments shall achieve the standards of accessibility set out on Policy HOU5 
as a minimum.  
4. The council will support the long -term ambition to expand the almshouses and care 
provision in Whiteley Village. A long -term development aspiration shall be delivered via a 
masterplan  through working in partnership  with the Trust . 
6.49 It is important for  the Plan to deliver suitable specialist forms of accommodation to cater 
for the needs of more vulnerable members of society inclusive of people with disabilities, 
mental health problems and long -term conditions, including those who have devel oped or may 
develop care needs as they become older.  
6.50 By 2037 the number of those aged 65 or over in Elmbridge is projected to be 35,500. 
This represents a 37% increase on 2020 figures, with the expected rate of increase of the 75 
or over and 85 or ove r groups in the population projected to be higher, at 46% and 80% 
respectively. The Plan seeks to ensure that additions to the future housing stock reflect local 
need and provide housing choice. However, it is important that the housing stock is able to 
adapt to meeting the requirements of an ageing population as set out in Policy HOU5.  
6.51 Some older residents may wish to downsize, move closer to family and friends or be 
closer to services and facilities but they may not want to live (purchase or rent) s pecialist older 
person’s accommodation. The Plan recognises the important role that new non -specialist 
developments play in providing suitable and attractive accommodation options for older 
residents to support independent living.  
6.52 Therefore, new devel opment  specifically designed to provide  older pe rsons  
accommodation including specialist retirement accommodation and registered care homes 
both market and affordable will only be supported where they meet an identified local need. 
Careful consideration wi ll be given to the type of accommodation and level of care being Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 72 - provided. Proposals will be required  to include a level of genuinely affordable care, sufficient to 
distinguish that the accommodation offer is care -led.  
6.53 The existing supply and pipeline of specialist accommodation will also be taken into 
account to ensure that there is not an over provision of an accommodation type. The delivery 
of specialist accommo dation is closely monitored in the council’s Authority Monitoring Report 
(AMR).
Gypsy, Roma, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation  
HOU7  - Gypsy, Roma, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation  
1. Proposals for the delivery of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pitches and Travelling 
Showpeople’s plots will be required to meet the following criteria:  
a) The location of the site provides a safe living environment free from the risk of flooding and 
risks to  health through contamination, noise, vibration, odour and pollution ; 
b) The site is in a sustainable location with access to local services and facilitates such as 
shops, public transport, and schools ; 
c) There is easy and safe access to the strategic roa d network and safe and convenient 
vehicle and pedestrian access to the site and, should not lead to an adverse impact on the 
road network or endanger highway safety ; 
d) The site is capable of being provided with on -site services such as water supply, sewag e 
disposal and power supply ; 
e) The layout of the site provides an acceptable living environment for occupants, including 
sufficient space to meet fire safety standards as well as allowing for parking and vehicle 
maneuvering on -site and the provision of pr ivate and communal amenity space ; and  
f) The site is laid out and landscaped in a manner which is compatible with the visual character 
of the area and amenities of neighboring uses.  
2. Existing authorised sites will be safeguarded unless no longer required  to meet identified 
needs.  
6.54 Members of the Gypsy, Roma , Traveller and Travelling Showpeople communities have 
a range of accommodation needs.  Some will choose to live in permanent bricks and mortar 
accommodation and do not participate in a nomadic lifestyle and their housing needs will be 
met through the delivery of market and affordable homes.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliv ering homes for all
  
- 73 - 6.55 Policy HOU7 responds to the needs of those who maintain a nomadic lifestyle and/or 
are members of protected ethnic groups with strong cultural p references for caravan -based 
homes.  
6.56 The Elmbridge Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) 2020 sets 
out the evidence on the current and future accommodation needs of the Gypsy, Roma , 
Traveller and Travelling Showpeople population in Elmbri dge. 
6.57 The assessment looks at the needs of Travellers that meet the planning definition as 
set out in the Government’s Planning Policy for Traveller  Sites 2015. It also assesses those 
that are undetermined in terms of the definition and those that do not meet the definition. 
Currently there are low numbers required across the 15 years for all above groups. 
Additionally, there is no identified need for  sites for  Travelling Showpeople in the borough.  
6.58 The Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Site Assessment Study 202 2 sets out options 
considered for meeting the borough’s needs for Travellers as set out in the GTAA. Taking into 
account the recommendations in the  GTAA  and the provision of a site with 8 -pitches in 2020 , 
the council has not allocated sites for this group but will permit alternatives such as additional 
pitches on existing sites and windfall pitches, provided these meet the criteria set out in the 
policy. 
6.59 There are no sites proposed in this Plan for transit or short -term site provision within the 
borough. Surrey County Council has been working closely with Surrey Police and other district 
and borough councils to identify a transit or short - term s ite and reduce the impact of 
unauthorised encampments across the county. A site has been identified in Tandridge and 
work is progressing on its delivery.  
Self and custom build housing  
HOU8  - Self and custom build housing  
1. The council will support proposa ls for self and custom build housing on residential 
development sites in locations where there is a demonstrable demand for plots and other 
relevant planning policies are satisfied.  
2. Proposals shall deliver the level of afford able housing required by Policy HOU4.
3. All self and cu stom build housing developments shall achieve the technical standards as set 
out in Policy HOU5 as a minimum.  
6.60 The council supports the principle of self -build and custom build development as an 
opportunity to bring choice to the local housing market as well as enabling local people to 
design and build their own home that will meet their bespoke needs, in a more affordable way.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Deliver ing homes for all
  
 
- 74 - 6.61 National planning policy encourages local planning authorities to widen opportunities for 
home ownership by identifying the size, type, tenure and range of housing that is required in 
particular locations, reflecting local demand.  
6.62 The Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 requires local authorities to keep a 
register of those who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in their area for self or 
custom build projects. A Self Build Register has been established to provide evidence of 
demand for plots in Elmbridge.  
6.63 Based on evidence of demand th rough the Self Build Register, the Local Housing Need  
Assessment  and past delivery trends, it is expected that the necessary number of serviced 
plots to satisfy the demand in Elmbridge is minimal compared to the need for market and 
affordable homes, and pr ovision for self -build and custom plots will come forward on small 
sites, single plots on infill sites and other windfall sites. It is anticipated that small windfall sites 
will play a key role in meeting this demand.  
 
 Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 75 - Chapter 7 - Principle 4 - Growing a prosperous 
econom y
 
7.1 The borough has a strong local economy, with over 60,000 jobs and 8,275 businesses 
including Amazon, Glaxo Smith Klein, Samsung, Cargill and Air Products. In recent years the 
borough has seen employment and business growth above the national average, as we ll as a 
significant number of new start -ups. 
7.2 This is not surprising given the borough’s location close to London, with excellent 
access to national and international transport links. However, workspace requirements are 
dependent on the nature and size of a business and demand has changed over time. It is 
important that our workspace offer responds to these changes to prevent valued businesses 
and jobs leaving the borough.  
7.3 The traditional  shopping function of the  high street continues to face a numbe r of 
challenges stemming from the impacts of the recent economic downturn, the tightening of 
retail spending in recent years,  the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic  and continued significant 
shift in consumer behaviour to more online shopping . Our high street s need support to help 
them adapt to the changing retail market and become distinctive hubs for shopping, 
socialisation, community support, leisure and culture.  
7.4 Forecasts of trends and demand in relation to employment, retail and our high streets 
are d ifficult to predict. As such, the policies in this Plan are flexible so that changes to the 
economy can be effectively responded to.   
7.5 The polic ies in this section of the Plan will be carefully monitored as we continue to 
support our business es and comm unity’s recovery following the Covid -19 pandemic . The 
monitoring framework for the Plan can be found in Chapter 10. 
Supporting the economy  
ECO1  - Supporting the economy   
1. Opportunities for economic growth in Elmbridge will be taken by maintaining and optimising 
the use of the borough’s employment floorspace offer. This will be done by protecting 
employment land and encouraging its innovative re -use in ways that better meet the needs of 
the market.  
2. Development proposals for the  provision of smaller and incubator office space , flexible 
workspaces for co -working , and  Small and Medium Enterprises  (SMEs)  will be supported in 
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 76 - the most sustainable locations, in particular in town,  district and local centr es. Development 
proposals will be permitted where they:  
a) Deliver high quality, well -designed flexible and adaptable spaces of different unit sizes and ; 
types for a range of uses and occupants as part of mixed -use development;  and 
b) speculative developme nts for which there is no identified end user will be expected to be  
supported by a marketing strategy for the use and occupation of the employment spaces to be 
delivered.  
3. Outside of Strategic Employment Land (SEL) (as defined on the Policies Map) the l oss of 
floorspace occupied by employment -generating uses will only be permitted where it is 
demonstrated that:  
a) There is no reasonable prospect of the site being retained in employment use ; 
b) The site is no longer suitable for its existing use or other employment uses ; 
c) The existing use creates (or any other employment use would create) significant  amenity 
issues for neighbouring occupiers , best remedied by encouraging a r eplacement with a non-
employment use ; and  
d) The development provides opportuniti es for sustainable co-location with other non -
employment uses . 
4. Proposals on sites  which provide mixed -use opportunities will be expected to optimise the 
use of the land to meet the needs of the economy, to support job creation and business 
growth, and t o meet other development needs which support the community.   
5. Ensuring that the development of up to date vocational training facilites is encouraged to 
enable local people to train to obtain the skills necessary to support employers with premises 
within  the borough.  
7.6 The borough benefits from a strong local economy, but we cannot be complacent,  and 
we need to continue to plan and invest to maintain our competitive edge, support local jobs 
and realise our growth potential.  The Plan proactively promote s sustainable economic 
recovery and growth. Through the Elmbridge Economic Strategy 2019 -2023 , we are already 
seeking to be the premier location to start, invest and grow a knowledge business. We also 
want to enable the most productive u se of space, place and technology to balance enterprise, 
the environment and quality of life.  
7.7 To assist in sustainable economic recovery following the Covid -19 pandemic and to 
support economic growth and local jobs, the Plan seeks to  maintain  a range  employment sites  
in the borough, helping  to respond  to business needs, including the needs of Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and business start -ups. This is particularly important in areas like Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 77 - Elmbridge where there are high land values and competing d evelopment pressures, 
particularly for residential development.  
7.8 National and South East trends for offices show a demand for high quality space that is 
provided either as large space for corporates or as smaller flexible multi -let space for smaller 
businesses. There is an increasing level of demand for smaller, start -up space in the borough. 
This is not surprising as the local business base within the borough is predominately SMEs 
with round 92% of all companies employing under 10 people.  
7.9 The evidence supports a safeguarding policy approach, to maintain the existing 
employment offer in the borough and  allowing space and opportunities for existing companies 
to grow and for new ones to start. Maintaining employment opportunities and sites is  
particularly important for industrial and warehousing in the borough as there are high levels of 
utilisation, low vacancy rates and occupiers would have potential difficulties in finding 
alternative locations if existing ones were lost to other uses.  
7.10 The sub -division and re -configuration of larger units to produce  smaller units and 
shared or co -working space is a n example of creating a more flexible employment floorspace. 
These smaller, more affordable spaces will be able to quickly respond to the cha nging needs 
of the borough’s office market.  
7.11 To ensure that the loss of employment land  and of local jobs  is not a result of short -
term decisions, marketing periods of up to three years will be required when seeking to  
demonstrate that there is no reas onable prospect of the site being retained in employment 
use(s). The re quired  marketing  period  will depend on the location, use and quality of the unit. 
A reasonable marketing period will be no less than 12 months.  
Strategic Employment Land 
ECO2  - Strategi c Employment Land  
1. Strategic Employment Land (SEL - as indicated on the Policies Map)  will be s afeguarded for 
employment uses to support and retain employment opportunities in locations attractive to 
businesses. D evelopment in SEL will be supported if it would be occupied by  the following 
uses:  
a) Office and work spac e 
b) Light industry  
c) General industry  
d) Storage and distribution  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 78 - Ancillary uses to the above , hybrid and flexible uses  that lever in investment and 
improvements to the SEL  will be supported, provided they reinforce  and supplement  the 
function, role and operations of employment uses . 
2. Development in SEL will be supported where : 
a) There would be no net loss in employment floorspace capacity;  
b) It is of high -quality design , modern, fit for purpose  and results in  improvements to the quality 
of buildings and infrastructure ; 
c) There would be efficient use of space , through innovative design which allows for flexible 
floorspace for different types of uses to meet future needs ; and 
d) It does not lead to an unacceptable impact on the surrounding highway network or local 
amenity.  
3. Increases in employment floorspace capacity will be supported where they are achieved 
through the supply  of new multi -storey units, the sub -division of larger units and new smaller 
units . 
4. Residential accommodation in SELs will only be acceptable if it forms part of a larger 
redevelopment proposal and:  
a) It would bring investment to floorspace which has been demonstrated to be redundant for 
employme nt uses;  and 
b) The proposal would comprise a mix of flexible uses.  
7.12 The assessment of existing employment land shows that there is currently a significant 
range of employment areas within the Borough offering a range of floorspace from the highest 
quality office space occupied by multinational corporations through to small industrial units for 
local businesses. However, what is evident is that there are a limited number of employment 
areas that are strategic in scale.  
7.13 A review of the  borough’s current 13 Strategic Employment Land (SEL) designations 
and other non -designated employment sites. All of the sites were assessed by taking into 
account market signals, their suitability and whether the site could provide opportunities for 
future growth.  
7.14 Strategic Employment Land in the borough provides important locations across the 
borough for a mixture of employment uses. Five SELs are allocated on the policies map to 
which policy ECO2 applies:  
• The Heights, Weybridge  
• Hersham  Place Technology Park, Hersham  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 79 - • Brooklands Industrial Estate, Weybridge  
• Hersham Trading Estate, Walton -on-Thames  
• Molesey Industrial Estate, West Molesey  
 
7.15 The NPPF is clear that in achieving sustainable development, the planning system 
needs to help build a  strong and responsive economy. A key part of this is about ensuring 
there is sufficient land of the right types in the right places to deliver this. The Borough’s 
employment sites will make a major contribution towards the growth, strength and diversity 
of the local and wider functional economic area economy. The Borough’s SEL sites form an 
integral part of this and provide a strategic function. The SEL sites provide a mixture of 
Grade A offices, distribution and flexible modern industrial units.  
 
Supporti ng our town, district and local  centres  
ECO3  - Supporting our town, district and local centres  
1. A range of retail, office, residential, community , cultural  and leisure uses in  the borough’s 
town, district and local centres (as identified on the Policies Map) will be supported . 
2. The core activity area s within the town  centres , as defined on the Policies Map , will 
comprise retail, office, community, cultural and leisure uses that maintain an active frontage 
and enhance the resilience and attraction of the centre .  
3. The loss of retail, office, leisure and community uses at ground floor level  to residential in 
the core activity area will be resisted.  
4. Positive considera tion will be given to temporary, flexible meantime and pop -up uses within 
vacant units which can attract footfall to the centre.  
5. Mixed -use development s which contribute to increasing footfall and vibrancy , and proposals 
to bring under -used  upper floors into more effective  use will be supported , subject to the ir 
compliance  with the requirements of Policies HOU2  (where residential use is proposed)  and 
ECO1.  
7. New uses that contribute to the vitality of the evening economy will be supported, unless 
they r esult in a harmful impact on residential amenity  or on the health of our communities.  
7.16 Elmbridge’s t own, district  and local centres serve a wide range of people and purposes  
and will be supported to be  attractive and distinctive places at the heart of their communities. 
The borough’s network of centres , as set out below, is  well-established and their location and 
extent is shown on the Policies Map.  
Town Centre  – Walton -on-Thames, Cobham , Esher and Weybridge . Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 80 - District Centre  - Claygate , East Molesey, East Molesey Bridge Road , Hersham, and 
Thames Ditton . 
Local Centre  - Hinchley Wood, Oatlands, Oxshott, Walton Halfway, Walton Terrace  
Road and Weybridge Queens Road . 
7.17 Policy ECO3 provides  for a flexible and pragmatic approach to support the transition of 
the high street  to service centres and community hubs. With the changing role of our high 
streets and a reduced retail focus, a move away from traditional retail  uses within our centres 
will be required. The introduction of new uses inclu ding leisure,  cultural,  health and wellness 
and community facilities and services will be encouraged  and will deliver  sustainable 
economic recovery following the Covid -19 pandemic.   
7.18 Local evidence indicates that there is no need to plan for an increas e in retail floor 
space in the short to medium term. That said, Policy ECO3 encourages local development 
opportunities for retail and other town centre uses in individual centres where they are able to 
maintain and enhance the overall health , vitality  and offer of a centre.  
7.19 The role of a well -designed and multi -functional public realm is also increasingly 
important , contribut ing to visual interest and  climate change adaptation but also allow ing for 
valuable outdoor event s and meeting  spaces.  Improvemen ts to the existing public realm, and 
the provision of new streets and spaces is addressed within Policy ENV9.

- 81 - Visitor, arts and culture  
ECO4  - Promoting visitor attractions and arts and cultural venues  
1. The loss of visitor attractions or arts and cultural venues will be resisted unless it is 
demonstrated that the facility is no longer needed for its existing purpose. In such cases, first 
consideration should be given to whether the attraction or venue could be used for a leisure, 
social or comm unity purpose.  
2. Support will be given to proposals that demonstrate that the attraction or venue can be re -
provided in a facility of better quality on the same site, or in an alternative location that is 
equally accessible to the community it serves.  
3. New attractions and venues will be supported within the borough in the following ways:  
a) New arts, cultural, entertainment and visitor facilities will be directed to town, district and 
local centre locations and areas accessible by public transport or saf e active travel routes;  
b) The use of outdoor space and the public realm for art, culture, sports and entertainment will 
be encouraged and supported in accessible areas and town, district and local centres; and  
c) Where appropriate, social and community fa cilities will be encouraged to use the space for 
arts and cultural events.  
4. Development proposals for visitor accommodation should be located in sustainable 
locations and be accessible by public transport.  
7.20 Elmbridge has a wealth of well -established  visitor attractions, including  Brooklands 
Museum, Painshill Park , Sandown Racecourse  and Claremont Landscape Garden s. 
7.21 The loss of visitor attractions or arts and cultural venues could occur through their 
physical loss (such as demolition) or through changes of use. Regardless of the method by 
which the loss is proposed, it will be resisted by the council as specified within the policy 
wording.  
7.22 Policy ECO4 supports the continued enhancement of the borough’s visitor, arts and 
cultural facilities an d activities. Growth of the borough’s visitor and cultural economy will 
provide employment, as well as creative and leisure opportunities for local residents 
supporting the community’s health and wellbeing.  
Equestrian -related development  
ECO5  – Equestrian -related development  
1. Equestrian -related development will be permitted providing:  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Growing a prosperous economy
  
- 82 - a) It is of a scale and intensity compatible with the location and satisfactorily relates to existing 
vehicular and field accesses, tracks and bridleways ; 
b) The proposal includes the re -use of existing building (s) wherever practicable and viable ; 
c) The design responds to local identity and distinctiveness , including location and siting, any 
subdivision of field(s) and earthworks ; and  
d) The location of new buildi ngs, stables, yard areas and associated facilities respect the 
amenities of surrounding occupiers.  
2. Where a site is located in the Green Belt, the proposal will be expected to accord with 
Policy ENV4. 
7.23 Equestrian activities are popular in Elmbridge, offering opportunities for  outdoor 
recreation and promoting healthy communities.  As well as licensed riding establishments, 
there are also live ry yards , stables and associated facilities for public, private or domestic  use. 
7.24 Factors influencing the layout of the scheme will include natural surveillance, site 
security and animal welfare, and the applicant should indicate how these have informed the 
proposal. The council’s Environmental Health team is responsible for issuing li censes to riding 
centres and can provide advice on requirements relating to equine welfare standards. This will 
prevent the need to re -apply for a revised proposal if the approved design does not meet the 
standards necessary to acquire a license.
 
  Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 83 - Chapter 8 - Principle 5 - Providing  
infrastructure and connectivity
 
8.1 To support the growth  of the borough,  it is essential that an adequate level of 
appropriate strategic and local infrastructure is delivered to avoid placing undue pressure on 
existing infrastructure  networks  and services . New or enhanced infrastructure should be 
delivered in a timely manner t o ensure the needs of our growing  communities and businesses 
are met.  
8.2 National planning policy requires  the council  to set out how these infrastructure 
requirements will be met, as well as what infrastructure contributions are expected from 
development. The council  is committed to working with infrastructure providers throughout the 
lifetime of the Plan to identify, pl an and ensure that infrastructure is brought forward to meet 
the needs of new development as it is delivered.  
8.3 Where there is spare capacity or opportunities for multiple uses to share facilities, 
existing infrastructure assets will also play a vital r ole in helping to meet development and 
infrastructure demands. Therefore, the council  will seek to safeguard and make best use of 
existing infrastructure assets.  
8.4 The provision of infrastructure includes, but is not limited to:  
▪ Education provision inclu ding primary and secondary school,  SEN/SEND provision, 
pre-schools , and further and higher education.  
▪ Health facilities including GP surgeries, health centres, hospitals, dentists and specialist 
care facilities.  
▪ Transport provision including roads, rail and bus networks, walking and cycling and 
parking facilities.  
▪ Flood risk and water managemen t. 
▪ Community , art and cultural facilities, including community centres , village halls, sports 
facilities and leisure centres, cemeteries, theatres and libraries.  
▪ Utilities, including gas, electric, water and wastewater, waste and minerals and 
telecommunications.  
▪ Green and Blue Infrastructure .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 84 - Infrastructure delivery  
INF1  - Infrastructure delivery 
1. The council  will work in partnership with providers of infrastructure and services to facilitate 
the timely provision of infrastructure necessary to support sustainable development in the 
borough, and in addressing pressures from cross boundary development.  
2. The co uncil will engage proactively with partners and relevant authorities to support 
strategic infrastructure projects to deliver benefits to the borough’s  environment, residents and 
businesses and which assist to achieve the principles  of the Plan.  
3. The coun cil will maintain an up to date Infrastructure Delivery Plan  (IDP)  and will support 
infrastructure development proposals identified in the IDP where they comply with other 
policies in the Plan. 
4. The council  will use the Local Plan, IDP and the Strategic Priority Programme  to bid for 
funding necessary to support development, working in partnership with Surrey County Council, 
the Local Economic Partnership (LEP), the Local Nature Partnership (LNP), and other bodies 
as appropriate.  
5. All new developments mu st contribute towards the provision of infrastructure and services. 
The infrastructure necessary to support new development should either be provided on -site, 
integral to the development, or be secured off -site through other mechanisms. In the case of 
majo r development , phased delivery may  be required,  and later phases may  be dependent on 
the infrastructure provision being in place . 
6.  New development will be expected to demonstrate capacity in existing infrastructure where 
no improvements are proposed as part of the development, either on -site or through a 
financial mechanism.  
8.5 Development in the borough  must be supported by appropriate infrastructure , 
proportionate to the development, which is delivered in a timely manner. Policy INF1 confirms 
the council’s role in proactively working with partners and developers to deliver infrastructure 
improvements for the benefit of the borough and to ensure that regard is had by development 
proposals to the presence of existing infrastructure, as well as considering the need to 
reinforce existing provision or provide new infrastructure to cater for new development . 
8.6 An Infrastructure Delivery Plan  (IDP)  has bee n prepared to support and inform 
development delivery. The IDP identifies the types and scale of infrastructure that is needed to 
help facilitate the delivery of the development needs identified in the Plan. The IDP also 
provides details of existing capaci ty and methods for forecasting any additional need for 
capacity.  Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 85 - 8.7 The delivery of infrastructure will be funded through a combination of existing public 
funding, developer -led provision, and through the use of the Community Infrastructure Levy  
(CIL) . The council ’s Charging Schedule and updated Development Contributions 
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) should also be referred to.  
Social and community infrastructure  
INF2  - Social and community infrastructure  
1. The council will support the provision of new social and community infrastructure particularly 
where they make an efficient use of land and promote the dual use and/or co -location of 
facilities.  
2. New social and community infrastructure must be of a high quality and inclusive design 
providing  access for all, and where practicable is provided in multi -use, flexible and adaptable 
buildings or co -located with other social infrastructure uses which increases public access.  
3. Development proposals that would result in the unnecessary loss of community facilities will 
not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that:  
a) that there is no longer an identified community need for the facilities or they no longer meet 
the needs of users and cannot be adapted; or  
b) they will be replaced by altern ative and well -located facilities that will continue to serve the 
similar needs of the neighbourhood and wider community; and  
c) the potential of re -using or redeveloping the existing site for the same or an alternative 
social infrastructure use for which  there is a local need has been fully assessed.  
 
8.8 Social and community infrastructure plays an important role in providing good quality of 
life, stimulating and supporting social cohesion and interaction, as well as developing strong 
and inclusive communities. They provide opportunities to bring different groups of people 
together, contributing to social integration and the desirability of a place.  These places also 
need to promote social interaction, be safe and accessible and support hea lthy lifestyles.  
8.9 National planning policy promotes healthy and safe communities, and that the social, 
recreational and cultural facilities and services the community needs are provided. Policy INF2 
seeks to ensure that existing social and community in frastructure provision  and services  in the 
borough are protected and only lost in exceptional circumstances. Where the loss of existing 
social and community infrastructure is proposed the  applicant will need to show evidence  that 
opportunities have been  explore d to accommodate an  alternative community use which would  
better meet local needs, in line with  relevant  strategies.  Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 86 - 8.10 The loss of social infrastructure can have a detrimental effect on a community. The 
Council seeks to protect its existing commun ity facilities. Where a development proposal leads 
to the loss of a facility, a replacement that continues to meet the needs of the neighbourhood it 
serves will be required  
8.11 The Council will work collaboratively with service providers, developers  and r elevant 
stakeholders, including the local community, to fully understand existing and future social 
infrastructure needs and plan appropriately for these, including through the Community 
Infrastructure Levy.  
Health and wellbeing of communities  
INF3 – Healt h and wellbeing of communities  
1. Developments must  contribute  to healthy and active lifestyles  through the provision of:  
a) Active design principles which support wellbeing and greater physical movement,  and an  
inclusive development layout and public realm that considers the needs of all,  including the 
older population and people  with disabilities ; 
b) Access to sustainable modes of travel, including safe , well -designed,  and attractive  cycling 
and walking routes and easy access to public transport to reduce car dependency;  
c) Access to  safe and accessible  green infrastructure, including to blue corridors, open spaces 
and leisure, recreation and play facilities to encourage physical activity; and  
d) Access to loca l community facilities, services and shops, which encourage  opportunities for 
social interaction and active living.  
2. The council will require a Health Impact Assessment  (HIA)  setting out the expected effects 
on health, wellbeing and safety, from all majo r development . 
3. All development subject to HIA  (in 2 above)  must demonstrate how the positive health 
impacts it can deliver are maximised, and reduce and/or mitigate negative health impacts, with 
a particular regard to removing health inequalities. Where unavoidable negative impacts on 
health, wellbeing and safety  are identified, mitigation measures must be incorporated into the 
proposal.  
8.12 The health and wellbeing of the communities of Elmbridge is important in delivering 
sustainable development and placemaking. The Health and Social Care Act (2012) gave local 
authorities new duties and responsibilities for health improvement and health protection.  The 
Act requires every local authority to use all the levers at its disposal to improve health and 
wellbeing.  National Policy and Guidance clearly establishes that t he design and use of the built 
and natural  environments, including green  and blue  infrastructure, are key determinants of Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 87 - health and wellbeing, and  that Local Plan s have an important function in the delivery of 
healthy places.  
8.13 The planning process can  help to promote the health and wellbeing of residents, 
workers, and visitors in the Borough through its role in shaping the built and natural 
environment. This can influence people’s ability to follow healthy behaviours and can have 
positive impacts on re ducing inequalities.  
8.14 Public Health England has noted that “Some of the UK’s most pressing health 
challenges - such as obesity, mental health issues, physical activity and the needs of an 
ageing population – can all be influenced by the quality of our  built and natural 
environment…the considerate design of spaces and places can help to promote good health; 
access to goods and services; and alleviate, and in some cases even prevent, poor health and 
thereby have a positive impact on reducing health inequ alities” 3. 
8.15 Planning for health involves thinking about the interrelated factors that affect health, 
including social and psychological elements, such as wellbeing and fulfilment. The wider 
determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age, 
and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. A healthy place is 
one that can contribute to the prevention of ill health and provide the environmental conditions 
to support positive health and  wellbeing.  
8.16 When considering the health impact of individual developments, it is important that its 
surroundings are taken into account as well as its intended purpose. This includes uses 
involving vulnerable communities and sensitive uses, such as r esidential care homes, 
supported housing, schools, hospitals and health centres.  
8.17 There are two aspects in supporting the health and wellbeing of our communities. The 
first is the creation of spaces, places , housing  and environments that encourage healthy 
lifestyles, and secondly the facilities needed to support the health and care system are 
provided. The Plan plays an important role and p lanning policies and decisions should aim to 
achieve healthy, inclusive and sa fe places that promote social interaction, are safe and 
accessible, and enable and support healthy lifestyles. Planning  should also provide the social, 
recreational and  cultural facilities and services the community needs.   
8.18 Policy INF3 requires a Heal th Impact Assessment (HIA) from all major development. An 
HIA is a process that identifies the health and wellbeing impacts (benefits and harms) of any 
plan or development project.  A properly conducted HIA recommends measures to maximise 
positive impacts; minimise negative impacts; and reduce health inequalities .

House of Lords Select Committee on National Policy for the Built Environment Camden Planning Guidance: 
Planning for health and wellbeing  Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 88 - 8.19 The inclusion of a  HIA as part of the application process enables developers to ensure 
the creation of sustainable developments which support communities by:  
▪ Demonstrating that health impacts have been properly considered when 
preparing, evaluating and determining development proposals.  
▪ Ensuring developments contribute to the creation of a strong, healthy and just 
society.  
▪ Helping applicants to demonstrate that they have worked closely with those 
directly affected by their proposals to evolve designs that take account of the 
views of the community.  
▪ Identifying and highlighting any beneficial impacts on health and wellbeing of a 
particular development scheme.  
▪ Identifying and taking action  to minimise any negative impacts on health and 
wellbeing of a particular development scheme.  
 
8.20 Health should not be seen as an isolated topic when assessing planning applications, 
and many measures set out in other parts of the Plan play a part in pro moting health and 
wellbeing and addressing health inequalities and should be addressed, where appropriate, 
including housing quality, access to open space and nature, air quality, noise and amenity, 
accessible and active travel, community safety, social co hesion and climate change and 
minimising the use of resources.  
Play and informal recreation space  
INF4 - Play and informal recreation space  
1. New residential development that is likely to be used by children and young people must 
take account of the need to provide space and/or access to suitable play and informal 
recreation space. The council will seek additional or enhanced play facilities or space by:  
a) Promoting opportunities for informal play within open spaces where it is not possible to 
secure formal play areas.  
b) Requiring external play space and facilities on site as part of new residential developments 
which include 50 or more fami ly units (those with 2 or more bedrooms); and 
c) Protecting existing play areas and facilities and, on redevelopment, requiring the 
replacement of facilities either on -site or nearby to an equivalent or better standard ; 
d) Where the creation of new play fa cilities is not feasible, requiring developers to work with 
the council to deliver enhanced provision nearby . Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 89 - 2. Play and informal recreation space designed in new residential developments should 
incorporate good -quality, accessible play provision for all ages  and physical abilities , that:  
a) Provides a stimulating environment;  
b) Can be accessed safely from the street by children and young people independently;  
c) Forms an integral part of the development and surrounding area;  
d) Is overlook ed to enable passive surveillance; and  
e) Is not segregated by tenure . 
3. Where access to existing space is proposed, new development schemes should incorporate 
accessible routes for children and young people, that enable them to play and move around 
safely  and independently.  
4. Major housing developments  of over 50 units  are expected to make appropriate provision of 
play space. In determining the amount of play space required the council will consider the type 
of development, amount, quality, and use of exi sting accessible provision of play space, as 
well as the anticipated child yield of the development.  
 
8.21 Play and informal recreation space for children and young people within their local area 
is an important part of their mental and physical developmen t. In order to facilitate greater 
physical activity, it is important that children and young people continue to have safe access to 
good quality, well designed, secure and stimulating play and informal recreation provision in 
the borough.  
8.22 Play provisi on must be inclusive and suitable for children and young people of all 
abilities, employing the principles of inclusive play. Increased physical activity contributes to 
healthy growth and development in children and young people,  as well as improved 
psycho logical wellbeing and social interaction.  
8.23 Play space can include communal outdoor space, private outdoor space, and gardens 
suitable for play. Communal gardens and other outdoor spaces suitable for play, including 
communal amenity space, may be consid ered to contribute towards play space provision 
where they have distinct playable elements; however, developments must provide publicly 
accessible play space where possible, rather than provision being entirely from private space.  
8.24 Where formal play s pace is provided it must be free, accessible, and integrated into any 
wider networks of open space. Where possible, minor developments are also required to 
provide informal play space. Such proposals must be accompanied by detailed plans which 
include a de tailed design for play provision. Reference should be made to best practice Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 90 - standards and any relevant guidance or strategies, in particular the Elmbridge Play Strategy . 
Proposals must also include information detailing proposed future management and 
maint enance arrangements for any play space secured. This plan will be conditioned by the 
council as part of any permission.  
8.25 Where improvements to the quality and access of existing play and informal recreation 
space is proposed as part of a development , detailed design proposals of the improvements 
should be submitted and agreement sought with the relevant bodies, such as the highway 
authority. These proposals should also take account of the details in the Elmbridge Play 
Strategy .  
Improving communications  
INF5 - Communications  
1. All new build residential and commercial developments must include full fibre broad band 
connections to each property.  
2. The council  will support the roll o ut of the 5G network across the borough  and the 
enhancemen t of existing connectivity infrastructure . 
3. Telecommunications proposals will be supported where they are accompanied  by evidence 
that there are no alternative suitable infrastructure sites that can be shared  or replaced,  and 
the visual and amenity impac t is minimised by the considered siting and design of the 
development.  
8.26 The role technology now plays in our economic and social lives is changing. The 
availability, reliability and speed of broadband provision is a key consideration for households 
and many view it as essential as the standard utilities. Similarly, it is a key concern for 
businesses.  
8.27 Policy INF 5 supports improvements to essential telecom infrastructure, which is vital to 
the delivery of sustainable development, including the roll o ut of 5G across the borough . It also 
requires full fibre to the premises for new residential and commercial developments. Policy 
INF5 assists in delivering the Plan’s objective to reduce the need to travel and reduce the 
reliance on private motor vehicles, reducing issues of air quality and congestion and 
supporting a modal shift in the way people live, including supporting increased home working.  
8.28 Applicants will need to ensure they undertake early dialogue with telecom providers  to 
ensure they understand the infrastructure specification and requirements,  so they can be 
incorporated into the design of new development at an early stage.  
8.29 Relevant applications must be supported by a Fibre to the Premises (FTTP)  statement, 
detail ing the dialogue with the telecom provider and establishing how FTTP will be provided to Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 91 - serve the development and be operational upon first occupation. Statements supporting 
outline planning applications should be proportionate.  
8.30 Applicants of teleco mmunications proposals are encourage d to undertake meaningful 
community engagement prior to submitting a planning application . 
River s 
INF6 - River s 
1. The special character and setting of the River Thames will be conserved and enhanced, 
and appropriate development proposals associated with river related activities and 
employment will be supported , provided they accord with other policies in this Plan.  
2. The council will support and promote new links across the river which support active and  
sustainable travel and leisure uses of the river.  
3. The council supports proposals for the wider River Thames Scheme and will work 
proactively with partners to deliver improvements.  Land at Desborough Island will be 
safeguarded for the creation of new h abitat.  
4. Opportunities to increase the use of the river for tourism and improving river -based and 
riverside recreation and leisure activities will be supported  where appropriate and they meet 
other policies in the Plan. 
5. Proposals for riverside development and improved facilities will need to demonstrate that 
there will be no unacceptable impact upon navigation, biodiversity, flood risk and the riverbank  
and landscape setting.  
6. Development proposals on the riverside must preserve or enhance the waterside character, 
heritage value and setting, and provide physical and visual links with the surrounding areas 
(including views along the river).  
7. Development proposals that are contain or are adjacent to watercourses should  consider 
the impact that development can have on them  and provide a buffer from the river bank.  
8. New moorings or other floating structure s will be supported if it complies with the following 
criteria:  
a) It does not harm the character, openness and vie ws of the river, by virtue of its design and 
height;  
b) The visitor mooring allows use for a period of less than 24 hours;  
c) There is no interference with the recreational use of the river, riverside and navigation; and  Draft  Elmbridge Local Plan – Providing  infrastructure and connectivity
  
- 92 - d) The proposal is of wider benef it to the community.  
8.31 The River Thames is a strategically important and iconic feature of Elmbridge. It is an 
important natural and cultural asset providing leisure, ecological, environmental, landscape 
and economic benefit s, this role will be protected and promoted.  
8.32 The River Thames between Datchet and Teddington has the largest area of developed 
flood plain in England without flood defenses. Over 15,000 homes and numerous businesses 
are at risk from  flooding. The coun cil is working with the Environment Agency and other 
partners to bring forward the River Thames Scheme. This is a programme of projects and  
investments with the aim of reducing flood risk in communities.  
8.33 The rivers and watercourses in the borough prov ide an important  habitat and natural 
corridor to allow the movement of species between suitable habitats and promote the 
expansion of biodiversity . Through the provision of movement may help wildlife adapt to 
climate change by providing a migration corrido r.  
8.34 Sites th at contain or are adjacent to watercourses should consider the impact that 
development can have on them, negative or positive. A 10 metre minimum undeveloped buffer 
zone, measure from the top of the river bank, protects watercourses from the  impact of 
deve lopment, as well as providing net gains in biodiversity. A buffer zone also produces strong 
and resilient ecosystems, improved water quality and human health benefits through pleasant 
amenity space. River side buffer zones must be free from built developme nt including lighting, 
domestic gardens and formal landscaping.  
  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Site Allocations
  
- 93 - Chapter 9 - Site Allocations  
9.1 The purpose of these site allocations is to allocate land for a range of uses to support 
the vision and principles of the Local Plan. The allocations consider sites within the whole of 
the borough, and allocate land for development including for housing, emplo yment, retail, 
community uses and infrastructure.  
9.2 Each allocation lists the land uses that are acceptable on the identified land, alongside  
any specific requirements and opportunities for future development proposals. Each site is 
identified on the Loc al Plan Policies Map. Detailed information about the infrastructure 
required to support development, including delivery time periods , is listed in the latest 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan  (IDP) , with the Land Availability Assessment (LAA) also providing 
further information about the deliverability of sites and potential timescales.  
9.3 Allocated sites are encouraged to progress development proposals as soon as 
possible, to help provide housing in the earlier stages of the plan period, to help boost housing 
supply. Equally, where allocated sites have been identified as likely to  be deliver ed in the later 
years of the plan period due to constraints, if these are resolved sooner, development 
proposals are encouraged.  
9.4 All site allocations require planning p ermission prior to development. Allocating these 
sites does not grant planning permission for development, however, it does identify the 
principle of development and uses. Pre-application advice prior to the submission of a 
planning application is encourag ed as well as engagement with infrastructure providers at the 
earliest opportunity.  
9.5 Further detailed information about these sites is available in the LAA, which forms part 
of the Local Plan evidence base. The LAA site refe rence number is shown on the site  
allocation  policy, for ease of cross referencing .Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Site Allocations

10.1 The Plan will be monitored to assess its effectiveness and whether it is achieving the 
principles  of the Plan  and the individual policy requirements . This chapter of the Plan sets out 
the indicators that will be used by the council to monitor the performance of the policies in the 
Plan. These indicators are report ed on an annual basis through the A uthority’s  Monitoring 
Report (AMR).  
10.2 The AMR will monitor these indicators, alongside a range of other contextual indicators. 
Monitoring can indicate areas where intervention may be needed to achieve the principles of 
the Plan. Where the AMR indicates that principles and policy requirements  are not being met, 
the council may need to take remedial action which could include a review of the Plan or parts 
of the Plan.

Self-build and Custom -build Housing  - Housing built by an i ndividual, a group of 
individuals, or persons working with or for them, to be occupied by that individual. Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 Such housing can be either market or affordable housing. A legal definition, for the 
purpose of applying the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (as 
amended), is contained in section 1(A1) and (A2) of that Act.  
Shared Ownership - A scheme aimed at providing first time buyers, who cannot 
afford to buy a home suited to their needs outright. The buyer purchases a part of 
the equity, paying rent o n the remainder, which is usually retained by an RSL.  
Sheltered Housing  - Housing specifically for older and/or disabled people. Includes 
a block or group of houses with resident or visiting warden, and individual houses, 
bungalows and flats, which receive  support from a mobile warden or pendant 
(emergency) alarm service.  
Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI)  - Locally important sites for 
nature conservation selected by the Surrey Local Sites Partnership, a sub -group of 
the Surrey Nature Partnership . It is an area that has been designated (non -statutory) 
as being of county or regional wildlife value.  
Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) - A site designated in the UK to be of 
importance for nature conservation due to the presence of a rare or go od example 
of fauna and flora.  
Social Rented Housing  - Affordable housing provided for rent at below market 
levels to eligible groups on housing waiting lists.  
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) - SACs are areas which have been given 
special protection und er the European Union’s Habitats Directive. They provide 
increased protection to a variety of wild animals, plants and habitats and are a vital 
part of global efforts to conserve the world’s biodiversity.  
Special Protection Area (SPA)  - Areas which have been identified as being of 
international importance for the breeding, feeding, wintering or the migration of rare 
and vulnerable species of birds found within European Union countries. They are 
European designated sites, classified under the Birds Di rective.  
Specialist housing  - Suitable specialist forms of accommodation to cater for more 
vulnerable members of society – people with disabilities, mental health problems 
and long term conditions, including people who have developed or may develop 
care ne eds as they become older.  
Strategic Employment Land - Designated as protected land in employment uses in 
the Borough.  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) - An assessment of flood risk for the 
Borough. The objective is to collate all sources of flooding,  to delineate flood zones, 
including the functional floodplain, to help apply the Sequential Test and advise on 
the Exception Test and site specific Flood Risk Assessments.  
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) – An assessment that 
identif ies sites with potential for housing. The assessment is an important evidence 
source to inform plan making but does not in itself determine whether a site should 
be allocated for housing development.  
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) - An assessme nt of the estimated 
demand for market housing and need for affordable housing in a defined 
geographical area, in terms of distribution, house types and sizes and the specific 
requirements of particular groups and which considers future demographic trends.  
Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG)  - An open space designed to 
provide an enjoyable natural environment for recreation as an alternative to a 
Special Protection Area.  
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  - Documents which add further detail 
to the policies in the Local Plan. They can be used to provide further guidance for 
development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. 
Supplementary planning documents are capable of being a material consideration in 
planning decisions b ut are not part of the development plan.  
Sustainable development - The objective of sustainable development can be 
summarised as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs, ensuring a bet ter quality of life for 
everyone now and for generations to come. Achieving sustainable development 
means that the planning system has three overarching objectives, which are 
interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways (so that 
opport unities can be taken to secure net gains across each of the different 
objectives):  
• economic objective – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive 
economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the 
right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved 
productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure  
• social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by 
ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to 
meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well -
designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open 
spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities’ health,  
social and cultural well -being; and  Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 • environmental objective – to contribute to protecting and enhancing our 
natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, 
helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently , minimising 
waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including 
moving to a low carbon economy.  
Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) - Methods of management practices and 
control structures that are designed to drain surface water in a more sustainable 
manner than some conventional techniques.  
Sustainable Transport Modes  - Any efficient, safe and accessible means of 
transport with overall low impact on the environment, including walking and cycling, 
low and ultra -low emission vehicl es, car sharing and public transport.  
Target Emission Rate  - A minimum allowable standard, set out in Building 
Regulations (see above), for the energy performance of a building in terms of its 
carbon dioxide emissions.  
Travelling Showpeople  - Members of a group organised for the purposes of 
holding fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This 
includes such persons who on the grounds of their own or their family’s or 
dependants’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or  health needs or old 
age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as 
defined above.  
Tree Preservation Order (TPO)  - A mechanism for securing the preservation of 
single or groups of trees of acknowledged amenity value. A tree s ubject to a tree 
preservation order may not normally be topped, lopped or felled without the consent 
of the local planning authority.  
Use Class Order  - The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as 
amended) puts uses of land and buildings into  various categories.  
Viability Assessment  – A financial viability assessment that looks at the scale of 
obligations and policy requirements applied to development demonstrating that the 
proposal provides competitive returns to a willing landowner and devel oper to 
enable the development to be deliverable/come forward.  
Windfall site  - A site not specifically identified in the development plan that 
unexpectedly become s available for development.

 A3 Spatial Portrait of the Borough  
Elmbridge is a Surrey borough located in the South East region, approximately 17 
miles south west of Central London. Located almost entirely within the bounds of the 
M25 motorway, the River Thames forms the northern boundary of the borough 
separating Elmbridge from the L ondon Borough of Richmond -upon -Thames. To the 
east is the Royal Borough of Kingston  upon -Thames. The remainder of the 
borough’s boundary is shared with the Surrey boroughs of Guildford, Runnymede, 
Spelthorne and Woking and the district of Mole Valley.

Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 Due to its location and proximity to, Elmbridge benefits from good accessibility to 
Central London via the M25/A3 and the rail and is also situated within easy reach of 
both Heathrow and G atwick airports. The M3 is located to the north west of the 
borough. Coupled with good passenger rail links to central London, the borough’s 
transportation network has proved attractive to a wide variety of individuals and 
businesses. Thus, the local econo my is comparatively strong, and unemployment 
low. Until the Covid -19 pandemic, commuting played a significant part for much of 
the workforce, with both radial and orbital journeys into London and around the 
region.

 Covering just over 9,634 hectares (37.2 square miles), Elmbridge is home to approximately 
130,000 residents living across the vibrant towns of Walton -on-Thames and Weybridge; and 
the suburban settlements of Esher, Hersham, East and West Molesey, Hinchley Wood and the 
Dittons , Cobham, Oxshott, Stoke D’Abernon and Downside , and Claygate.  Elmbridge has only 
one civil parish, Claygate, with the reminder of the area being under two rath er than three tiers 
of local government. Surrey County Council providing public services such as education, 
highways and social services.  
 
Figure 12: Elmbridge Location and Geography  
Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 Elmbridge’s urban areas are surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt c overing 57% of the 
land in the Borough that contributes to the area’s more spacious and less urban character. A 
limited area to the southwest of the Borough is designated as the Thames Basin Heaths 
Special Protection Area (SPA) and the borough is committed  to protect it and to deliver a 
strategic package of measures to mitigate the potential adverse effects of new development 
on the SPA in order to protect its ecological integrity.

Elmbridge Borough offers visitor attractions including Mercedes -Benz World in Brooklands, 
which is nested within the world’s first of its kind purpose built motor racing circuit, Sandown 
Park Racecourse, Claremont an d Painshill Parks.   
The borough is a home to internationally renowned businesses such as Sony, Procter & 
Gamble, Samsung, Toshiba, Amazon, JTI, Cargill, Air Products or GlaxoSmithKline. The 
average median gross weekly pay of Elmbridge residents is higher t han of those who work in 
Elmbridge, indicating that a considerable proportion  of residents commute to highly  paid jobs 
within Greater London. The population of the area is relatively affluent and highly skilled and 
this, alongside the quality of the enviro nment and ease of access to London, has resulted in 
property prices that reflect those of London rather than those of the rest of Surrey. Excluding 
the Greater London region, Elmbridge has the highest average house prices in the country by 
Local Authority and is noted for its very high quality of life.

 A6 Nationally Prescribed Space Standards  
1. This standard deals with internal space within new dwel lings and is suitable for 
application across all tenures. It sets out requirements for the Gross Internal (floor) 
Area of new dwellings at a defined level of occupancy as well as floor areas and 
dimensions for key parts of the home, notably bedrooms, stora ge and floor to ceiling 
height.  
2. The requirements of this standard for bedrooms, storage and internal areas are 
relevant only in determining compliance with this standard in new dwellings and have 
no other statutory meaning or use.  
3. The standard Gross Inte rnal Areas set out in Table 1 are organised by storey height 
to take account of the extra circulation space needed for stairs to upper floors and 
deal separately with one storey dwellings (typically flats) and two and three storey 
dwellings (typically hous es).  
4. Individual dwelling types are expressed with reference to the number of bedrooms 
(denoted as ‘b’) and the number of bedspaces (or people) that can be 
accommodated within these bedrooms (denoted as ‘p’). A three bedroom (3b) home 
with one double bedro om (providing two bed spaces) and two single bedrooms (each 
providing one bed space) is therefore described as 3b4p.  
5. This allows for different combinations of single and double/twin bedrooms to be 
reflected in the minimum Gross Internal Area. The breakdow n of the minimum Gross 
Internal Area therefore allows not only for the different combinations of bedroom 
size, but also for varying amounts of additional living, dining, kitchen and storage 
space; all of which are related to the potential occupancy.  
6. Relat ing internal space to the number of bedspaces is a means of classification for 
assessment purposes only when designing new homes and seeking planning 
approval (if a local authority has adopted the space standard in its Local Plan). It 
does not imply actual  occupancy or define the minimum for any room in a dwelling to 
be used for a specific purpose other than in complying with this standard.  
7. Minimum floor areas and room widths for bedrooms and minimum floor areas for 
storage are also an integral part of the  space standard. They cannot be used in 
isolation from other parts of the design standard or removed from it.   
8. The Gross Internal Area of a dwelling is defined as the total floor space measured 
between the internal faces of perimeter walls5 that enclose t he dwelling. This 
includes partitions, structural elements, cupboards, ducts, flights of stairs and voids 
above stairs. The Gross Internal Area should be measured and denoted in square 
metres (sqm).  
 
5 The internal face of a perimeter wall is the finished surface of the wall. For a detached house, the perimeter walls are the external walls that 
enclose the dwelling, and for other houses or apartments  they are the external walls and party walls.   Draft Elmbridge Local Plan – Appendices
  
 9. The Gross Internal Areas in this standard will not be adequate for wheelchair 
housing (Category 3 homes in Part M of the Building Regulations) where additional 
internal area is required to accommodate increased circulation and functionality to 
meet the needs of wheelchair households.   
10. The standard requires t hat:  
a. the dwelling provides at least the gross internal floor area and built -in storage area 
set out in Table 1 below  
b. a dwelling with two or more bedspaces has at least one double (or twin) bedroom  
c. in order to provide one bedspace, a single bedroom has a  floor area of at least 
7.5sqm and is at least 2.15m wide  
d. in order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor area of 
at least 11.5sqm  
e. one double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide and every other double (or 
twin) bedroom is at least 2.55m wide  
f. any area with a headroom of less than 1.5m is not counted within the Gross 
Internal Area unless used solely for storage (if the area under the stairs is to be 
used for storage, assume a general floor area of 1sqm within the Gross Internal 
Area)  
g. any other area that is used solely for storage and has a headroom of 900 -1500mm 
(such as under eaves) is counted at 50% of its floor area, and any ar ea lower than 
900mm is not counted at all  
h. a built -in wardrobe counts towards the Gross Internal Area and bedroom floor area 
requirements but should not reduce the effective width of the room below the 
minimum widths set out above. The built -in area in exc ess of 0.72sqm in a double 
bedroom and 0.36sqm in a single bedroom counts towards the built -in storage 
requirement  
i. the minimum floor to ceiling height is 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal 
Area

* Notes:  
1. Built-in storage areas are included within the overall GIAs and include an allowance of 
0.5m for fixed services or equipment such as a hot water cylinder, boiler or heat 
exchanger.  
2. GIAs for one storey dwellings include enough space for one bathroom and one 
additional WC (or shower room) in dwellings with 5 or more bedspaces. GIAs for two 
and three storey dwellings include enough space for one bathroom and one additional 
WC (or shower room). Additional sanitary facilities may be included without increasing 
the GIA provided that all aspects of the space standard have been met.  
3. Where a 1b1p has a shower room instead of a bathroom, the floor area may be 
reduced from 39m to 37m , as shown bracketed.  
4. Furnished layouts are not required to demonstrate compliance.
