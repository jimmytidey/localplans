1. Introduction  
1.1 South Lakeland Local Plan Review  
1.1.1.1  This consultation document is the next stage in the review of the South 
Lakeland Local Plan and seeks your views on a range of planning issues and 
proposed options  for the future development of the district to 2040 (outside the 
Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales  National Parks). The Plan w ill set out the 
strategy for the amount, location and design of new development , and at the 
same ti me take the opportunity this provides to drive forward the Council’s 
ambitions and aspirations on matters such as climate change, meeting 
affordable housing needs and promoting biodiversity.  
1.1.1.2  The document is drafted with full awareness of t he profound and ongoing 
impact of C ovid-19 and also of the possible implications of the Government’s 
White Paper: Planning for the Future1, which may radically change the nature 
and proces s of preparing Local Plans in the near future. Going forward the 
review of the Local Plan will seek to continue to respond to these and other 
changing circumstances.  
1.1.1.3  South Lakeland is progressing its local plan in the face of the challenges of 
local govern ment re -organisation and changes to the planning system. A new 
successor authority will be able to adopt this plan. A future District wide local 
plan for a new authority with a bigger area could take many years to prepare. 
The challenges set out in this do cument cannot wait and the early adoption of 
this plan will ensure that our policy framework remains up to date.  
1.1.1.4  There is a serious risk that the alternative, to delay plan making pending re -
organisation and the creation of a new authority , would result i n the Local Plan 
becoming increasingly out of date over time. This would create a policy 
vacuum : the Council and communities would have less influence over planning 
decisions, development would be less sustainable and of lower quality and 
more planning appeals would be lost.  
1.1.1.5  For all of the above reasons, the Council is proceeding with plan preparation. 
This approach is also in line with Government advice which is to continue with 
plan making .

1.2 Issues and Options  
1.2.1.1  In 2020 we asked for y our views on the issues that the Local Plan Review 
should address . A summary of this early engagement is set out in the 
Consultation Statement , and a report of the Stakeholder Event of 6th March 
20202.   
1.2.1.2  For this next stage we have considered your views and suggest a range of key 
issues for the Review, together with policy options or approaches to policy 
development to address these. We are now seekin g your views on these 
‘Issues and Options’.  
1.2.1.3  A key part of the Local Plan Review is review ing the supply of housing and 
employment land. In general, there is a reasonable supply in the short to 
medium term but this will need supplementing to meet needs to 2040. We 
issued a Call for Sites  in summer 2020  which you can view and comment on if 
you wis h at this early stage . However this Issues and Options consultation is 
also a further opportunity to suggest potential development sites for allocation 
in the Plan , as set out in Theme 2 at section  4.2.6  and in the assessment of 
towns and villages in Theme 3 .  
1.2.1.4  Following th e current  consultation we will undertake a  technical assessment of 
all of the suggested sites  - including any other sites  suggested in this 
consultation - in a Strategic Housing and Employment Land Availability 
Assessment (SHELAA) . We will consult  widely on this document later in 2021.  
The SHELAA is a technical assessment and does not itself recommend sites 
for development. When we have taken account of your view s at this stage and 
in response to the SHELAA, we will propose sites for allocation and consult on 
these  in a draft Plan later in 2022.  
1.2.1.5  In summary t herefore , we highlight the following key p oints:   
 No sites  are proposed for development at t his stage  – this will happen 
when a draft Plan is consulted on in 2022 . 
 The Call for Sites  list is long one (and will get longer) but most sites will 
not ultimately be proposed for allocation . 
 You are welcome to comment  on the 2020  Call for Sites, but you will 
also ha ve opportunity to comment on all suggested sites once they have 
been assessed in the SHELAA st udy. We will take your views into 
account before consulting on recommended sites in a draft Local Plan 
later in 2022.

 Structure of the document  (navigating your way around)  
1.2.2.1  The document is split into four chapters : 
 the first sets the context for the Local Plan Review  
 the second  is an introductory chapter about South Lakeland  
 the third  sets out  a propose d vision, set of objectives  and raises the 
question of priorities for the Local Plan   
 the final chapter , comprising most of the document , sets out key issues and 
options for each of 8 main topic theme s.  
1.2.2.2  For each key issue we present either:  
 policy options - these are in a blue box , or  
 policy  approaches -  these are in  a green box .  
1.2.2.3  Each policy option and policy approach is given its own unique reference 
number for example:  
 policy option reference number PO1.2/i. (each policy option is prefixed with 
letters PO)  
 policy approach reference number PA1.3/a (each policy approach is 
prefixed with PA)  
1.2.2.4  A policy option  is a suggestion for a type of policy that could be used  to 
address the key issue.  Policy options generally represent a decision that we 
need to make on the direction of future policy. A policy option may relate to the 
introduction of a new policy requirement, or a change in current policies in 
some way - for example , introducing differe nt criteria that may need to be 
applied. The policy options are generally exclusive to one another but it might 
be that you think a combination or elements of each might be the best way to 
address the issue  and are therefore the preferred option. .  
1.2.2.5  A policy approach  is a direction of travel or intent for how we propose to 
address the key issue. Policy approaches may relate to the general direction of 
the policy content itself, or may be more general or procedural approaches to 
addressing the issue through the review, for example in terms of the evidence 
we will gather, or possible extra guidance that we will produce, or factors we 
will consider in addressing the issue. The policy approaches should all be read 
as a package and do not represent a choice needi ng to be made between 
them.  
1.2.2.6  Each policy option and policy approach is followed by a question or set of 
questions to allow you to respond to the suggestions m ade.

1.3 The Current Local Plan  
1.3.1.1  The current South Lakeland Local Plan (2003 -2025) comprises:  
 The Core Strategy  Development Plan Document (DPD)3 (Oct. 2010) 
sets out strategic planning policies, housing and employment targets , 
and how development should be distributed between towns, villages 
and the countryside .  
 The Land Allocations  DPD4 (Dec . 2013)  allocates land for the 
development needs set out in the Core Strategy and also protects 
sites from development, including open spaces and Green Gaps .  
 The Development Management Policies  DPD5 (March 2019) sets 
detailed  policies on a range of topics , used to inform decisions on

planning applications – for example on design, biodiversity, flood risk 
and setting new standards for accessible and adapta ble homes .  
 The Arnside  and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  
DPD6 (March 2019) includes a development strategy and other 
planning policies for the whole of the AONB that are used to inform 
decisions on plannin g applications.  
1.3.1.2  The Local Plan Review will review and combine the Core Strategy, Land 
Allocations and Development Management Policies D PDs into a single Local 
Plan. The review will include district -wide policies relating to the AONB, but will 
not review the AONB DPD itself.  The review of the AONB Development 
Strategy  and current allocations will take place through a future review of the 
AONB DPD.  
1.3.1.3  Other Local Plan Documents that form part of the South Lakeland Development 
Plan include : 
 ‘Made ’ Neighbourhood Plans  (Heversham and Hincaster and 
Grange -over-Sands) which contain locally -specific policies for 
development within the designated Neighbourhood Plan area s. 
Neighbourhood Plans covering Allithwaite and Cartmel Parish and 
Burneside Parish are a lso under preparation;  
 The Cumbria Minerals and Waste Local Plan  (2015 -2030)7 sets out 
planning polic ies for assessing proposals for minerals extraction and 
waste management in Cumbria outside of the Lake District and 
Yorkshire Dales National Parks. The Plan is prepared by the County 
Council as the minerals and waste planning authority.  
1.3.1.4  There are also support ing documents which are a material planning 
consideration when deciding on planning applications and take the form of 
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD). These include 14 Development 
Briefs8 which provide more guidance on the type and quality of development 
expected in 14 of the larger and more complex development allocation sites. 
Another Supplementary Planning Document i s the Cumbria Wind Energy SPD9. 
The draft North West Marine Plan is in pr eparation and is also a material 
consideration in plan -making, planning decision making  and enforcement.

1.4 Sustainability Appraisal and Habitats Regulation 
Assessment  
1.4.1.1  Sustainability Appraisal (SA) is a legal requirement and its role is to assess and 
improve the economic, social and environmental effects of the Local Plan and 
to monitor its imp acts. The SA helps us assess the relative merits of a range of 
different options and alternatives, and helps us determine the most appropriate 
option s that will deliver the best outcomes for our area. It also helps identify 
measures that will be required t o help reduce any harmful effects from the plan. 
The SA ‘tells the story’ of the plan -making processes – it documents how 
decisions have been made and how they have been informed by environmental 
and sustainability concerns.  
1.4.1.2  The results of the appraisal ar e set out and analysed in an SA Report which sits 
alongside and informs each stage of the Local Plan review process.  We are 
currently working on the SA Report of the Issues and Options report and it will 
be uploaded to our website in due course.  It will be  updated as the Local Plan 
review progresses to record each stage.  
1.4.1.3  ‘Scoping’ is the first stage of a sustainability appraisal and the first exercise is to 
identify the key sustainability issues facing the district that the Local Plan needs 
to take account of. Scoping also looks at the wide range of international, 
national and local plans, strategies, policies and laws that will influence the 
Local Plan, and identifies any targets within them that the Local Plan should 
help achieve, such as the reduction of carbon emissions. Scoping also sets out 
the assessment framework that will be used in the SA and presents a range of 
objectives that the Local Plan’s strategy, sites and policies should seek to 
achieve.  Our first draft SA Scoping report was published as pa rt of our Early 
Engagement and we have made some changes in response to comments we 
received. An updated SA Scoping report  is published alongside this Issues and 
Options report.  
1.4.1.4  It is also required by law10 for us to consider the impacts of the Local Plan on 
European designated sites including Special Areas of Conservation, Special 
Protection Areas and Ramsar sites of which there are a number within or close 
to our area. This process  is called the Habitat Regulation Assessment (HRA).  
1.4.1.5  Both the Sustainability Appraisal and Habitats Regulation Assessment derive 
from European legislation and may be subject to changes in the near future as 
a result of the UK’s departure from the European U nion, as well as the 
government’s proposed planning reforms which suggest the SA process will be 
replaced by a simpler and more basic assessment of sustainability impacts.

1.5 Links with the Council Plan  
1.5.1.1  The Local Plan helps to deliver parts of South Lakeland’ s Council Plan11. The 
Council Plan contains the vision  of making  “South Lakeland the best place to 
live, work and explore”.  It contains four key priorities:  
 Working across boundaries,  delivering sustainable regional growth 
across Morecambe Bay . 
 Delivering a balanced community,  a South Lakeland for all ages . 
 Delivering a  fairer South Lakeland,  a South Lakeland for everyone . 
 Addressing the climate emergency,  a carbon neutral South Lakeland . 
1.5.1.2  Within these priorities the Council Plan sets out a range of activities that the 
Council will undertake under the themes of housing and communities, economy 
and culture and health and the envi ronment. Many of these are directly relevant 
to, and will be influenced by the Local Plan, including:  
 Intervening  and working with partners  to remove barriers and deliver 
major  development  sites and critical infrastructure .  
 Delivering  the right mix of new housing including  affordable homes to 
rent, housing to attract and retain young people and homes suitable 
for the elderly.  
 Ensuring new development is sustainable, energy efficient and flood 
resilient . 
 Unlocking employment development  sites and enabling local 
businesses to grow . 
 Developing town centres that are attractive and accessible for living, 
working, culture and leisure . 
 Conserving and enhancing biodiversity.  
 Promoting environmental technologies and the green economy, and 
working to achieve a carbon neutral South Lakeland.  
 Working with partners to promote and encourage the provision of and 
access to sustainable public transport, and promoting active travel 
including cycling and walking.

1.6 The Climate Emergency  and Carbon Ne utrality  
1.6.1.1  In 2019 SLDC declared a climate emergency , in response to mounting concern 
at the impacts of climate change from global warming from carbon dioxide 
emissions. The Council, with other Cumbrian and National Park authorities also 
adopted the Cumbria  Joint Public Health Strategy, which includes a key aim of 
becoming a "carbon neutral" county and of mitigating the likely impact of 
climate change. South Lakeland District Council (SLDC) aims to become a 
carbon neutral Council by 2030 and a carbon neutral  district by 2037 . 
1.6.1.2  The Council with other s commissioned Smallworld Consulting, of Lancaster 
University, to prepare a study identifying the county’s current carbon footprint12 
and recommending appropriate targets. This report together with views 
gathered at public Climate Conversations, have informed  the Council’s Climate 
Change Action Plan13, adopted in July 2020. ‘Carbon neutrality’ means 
balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount 
absorbed, removed or offset. This would achieve net zero carbon emissions. 
The Counci l believes that becoming carbon -neutral will improve the quality of 
life for residents in South Lakeland  and help to build new green, clean growth 
opportunities for our economy.  
1.6.1.3  The Local Plan plays a key role in mitigating and adapting to the climate 
emer gency. We are also legally required to make sure that development and 
use of land contributes to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. 
The Local Plan Review will therefore have the mitigation of and adaptation to 
the climate emerg ency at its heart, forming a key overarching theme for the 
whole document .  
1.7 The National Policy Context  
1.7.1.1  The Local Plan must also take account of the National Planning Poli cy 
Framework14 (NPPF) (February 2019) and  Planning Practice Guidance15 
(PPG).  
1.7.1.2  The 2019 NPPF sets out that Local Plans include strategic policies  to address 
key strategic issues, as well as policies which help inform decision making on 
planning applications.

14 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -planning -policy -framework --2 
15 https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning -practice -guidance  
   
14 
 
1.7.1.3  The NPPF requires Local Plans to set out an overall strategy for the pattern, 
scale and quality of development, and make sufficient provision for: 
 Housing (including affordable housing), employment, retail, leisure 
and other commercial development;  
 Infrastructure for transport, telecommunications, security, waste 
management, water supply, wastewater, flood risk and coastal 
management, and the pr ovision of materials and energy (including 
heat);  
 Community facilities (such as health, education and cultural 
infrastructure); and  
 Conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic 
environment, including landscapes and green infrastructure, and 
planning measures to address climate change mitigation and 
adaptation.  
1.7.1.4  National policy and guidance have been frequently changed in recent years, 
which makes the process of preparing Local Plans more difficult as it constantly 
changes the ‘goalposts’ a nd affects what Local Plans can or can’t do. In August 
2020 the government announced plans for wholesale radical reforms of the 
planning system through its Planning for the  Future16 White Paper. If 
implemented, these changes will fundamentally change the scope and format 
of Local Plans .  
1.7.1.5  The proposals are at the time of preparing this Issues and Options report 
subject to ongoing debate in government, and would require new leg islation 
and new national policy and guidance to be brought into force. The advice from 
the government in the meantime is for local planning authorities to press on 
with their Local Plan process and not to delay or stall to await further details or 
impleme ntation of national policy changes.  
1.7.1.6  This Issues and Options report has therefore been prepared in the context of 
the current legislation, policy and guidance which still provides the legal basis 
for plan making. In progressing our Local Plan Review we will  carefully follow 
national developments and may well need to adapt and change our 
approaches as the review progresses. All of our proposed options must 
therefore be accompanied by a clear caveat that they are proposed in the 
context of the current situatio n and may need to be significantly amended as 
the Local Plan Review progresses should national planning reforms be brought 
forward.

2. About South Lakeland  
2.1 Introduction  
2.1.1.1  South Lakeland lies in the south ernmost part of Cumbria and has strong links 
with its neighbouring districts of Barrow -in-Furness and Lancaster in terms of 
the housing market and economy, with nearly all employed residents working 
within the Bay area and three quarters of all house moves  taking place within 
the Bay area.  
2.1.1.2  The South Lakeland Local Plan covers the areas of South Lakeland outside the 
Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Park areas, whose authorities 
prepare their own Local Plans. For clarity the South Lakeland Local Pla n does 
not therefore apply to the National  Park areas . In 2021 the Government intends 
to consider proposals for new and extended National Parks and AONBs , 
including a request  for an extension of the southern boundary21 of the Lake 
District into the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas .

2.2 Key Facts and Figures   
2.2.1.1  We set out below a snapshot of some key facts and figures about South 
Lakeland. Much more information can be found in the Sustainability Appraisal 
Scoping Report on our website.  
 2,222 new homes have been built  in South Lakeland 
since the current Local Plan was adopted in 2010. This 
includes 539 affordable homes.  
 Over the past 5 years an average of 279 homes have 
been built each year . 
 On average, homes in South Lakeland cost 9.5 times 
the average local salary . 
 The proportion of privately rented homes has 
increased and the proportion of homeowners with 
mortgages has decreased.  Almost 45% of homes in 
South  Lakeland are owned outright.  
 We have a higher proportion of larger and detached 
homes  than nationally . 
 
 Carbon dioxide emissions are 7 tonnes per person  per 
year in South Lakeland. This compares with 4.3 tonnes per 
person nationally and 6.5 tonnes acros s Cumbria.  
 More than 7,200 homes and about 2,300 businesses 
are at risk of flooding from rivers or  the sea  based on 
Environment Agency flood risk maps , and this will increase 
with the effects of climate change . 
 We have  a wealth of internationally, national ly and locally 
designated nature and conservation sites that are important 
for their biodiversity and geodiversity including six 
European protected  sites, 34 Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI)  and over 100 County Wildlife sites . 
 Our Local Plan area has varied and special landscapes 
including coastal and estuary landscapes, limestone 
landscapes, valleys, drumlins, moorlands, fells and upland 
fringes.   
 We adjoin two National Parks  including the Lake District 
World Heritage site, and  part of our area is designated 
as the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty . 
 
  
19 
 
 
 
 South Lakeland has a significantly older population than 
other regions : 28% of the district’s population is aged over 
65, compared with 18% nationally. 
 Life expectancy  (Male: 81.9, Female: 84.7 ) is higher   
than the England average (Male: 79.6, Female: 83.2). 
 We have a significantly ageing population . Deaths 
exceed birt hs and without people moving to the area our 
population would be in decline. 
 The health of people in South Lakeland is generally better 
than the England average. 
 
 
 There are almost 6,500 businesses in the district , with 
most employing fewer than 10 people. 
 Over the last five years  about 5,700 square metres of 
employment and business floor space have been lost 
to other uses  such as housing.  
 The main sectors that people work in are accommodation 
and food, retail, health  and manufacturing . 
 On average, jobs in South Lakeland are lower paid than 
regionally and nationally. 
 Unemployment levels have historically been low  but our 
economy and key employment sectors have been hit hard 
by Covid- 19. 
 
 The rural nature of the district limits public transport 
opportunities , and reliance on private cars is relatively 
high (39% of households have 2 or more cars) compared 
with regional and national averages, which poses 
challenges in promoting sustainable travel. 
 The majority of people here   travel to work by a private 
vehicle (44.5%) , but a greater proportion of people walk 
or cycle to work than regionally across the North West   
 We have 128 outdoor sports facilities  and 340 public 
open spaces  protected from development in our current 
Local Plan.

3. Vision , Objectives  and Priorities  
3.1 Vision  
3.1.1.1  The following vision sets out what we ’d like to be able to say about South 
Lakeland  in 2040:  
South Lakeland is the best place to live, work and explore  
South Lakeland is at the centre of a Morecambe Bay Economic Region at the 
cutting edge of delivering sustainable economic growth in the North of England 
with homes, high val ue jobs, world class knowledge and exceptional quality of 
life. 
South Lakeland has a balanced community housing a growing working age 
population and providing the best possible quality of life for all age groups  
South Lakeland is a fairer district where e veryone has access to the same 
opportunities, life chances and potential to lead safe, healthy, happy and 
fulfilled lives  
South Lakeland is a more beautiful, quieter and cleaner district leading the way 
to Net Zero with more comfortable, warmer and safer homes, cleaner air and 
water, more wildlife, more trees and more jobs in a thriving sustainable 
economy and an environmental quality and quality of life that is recognised as 
the best  in England.  
Please give us  your views on this vision for South Lakeland 
at 2040.  
3.2 Working Across Boundaries - The Bigger Picture  
3.2.1.1  South Lakeland looks forwards and looks outwards. Our district lies at the heart 
of the Morecambe Bay Economic Region which also includes our two partner 
authorities of Lancaster with its knowledge base and Barrow  with its advanced 
manufacturing expertise. Together, these make up an economic region with a 
population of more than 320,000, more than 13,000 businesses, 18,000 
advanced manufacturing jobs and two universities, aligned with economic, 
environmental, cultural and health geographies.  
3.2.1.2  All three councils are using their combined weight to secure the investment, 
growth and transport infrastructure that will deliver jobs and maintain and 
enhance quality of life across the whole Bay area.  
3.2.1.3  The th ree councils have a joint  ambition for a thriving and diverse sub -regional 
economy with a skilled workforce, a balanced housing market to meet needs, 
great leisure services to encourage healthy lifestyles and a cultural offer that   
21 
 
appeals to residents and visitors alike as well as delivering  excellent regulatory 
services. Co-operation and collaboration across the Bay also creates 
opportunities to develop combined approaches to health, carbon reduction and 
tackling deprivation and inequality.  
3.2.1.4  The Government is consulting on proposals for local government reform in 
Cumbria. All three Councils favour a proposal to combine as a single unitary 
Council . A decision on this is expected later this year . Working across 
boundaries has been an SLDC priority for some yea rs and as a result, there is 
already a high degree of alignment between South Lakeland’s plan and the 
equivalent plans for Lancaster and Barrow. All three Districts are preparing their 
own local plans and , in the event of a new authority becoming a reality , it is 
likely that this plan will proceed as a plan for South Lakeland. Future iterations 
may seek to combine the plans of the three districts into a single plan.  This plan 
is intended to be well placed to evolve and shape strategies and priorities for 
any new Bay authority.  
3.2.1.5  Working across boundaries also means working across other related 
geographies including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks  
which make up more than two thirds  of the land area of the District as well as 
Cumbria County Council, Cumbria Local Economic Partnership and the 
Borderlands programme.  
    
22 
 
3.3 Objectives  
3.3.1.1  We have drafted a set of objectives for the Local Plan which will help us 
achieve the vision. The objectives will form the framework for the plan, and our 
policies and sites should all contribute to achieving them . We are seeking your 
views on these draft objectives at this stage.  
Objective 1  To ensure that new development plays its part in achieving a 
Carbon Neutral Cumbria by 2037 and that environments and 
communities  are adaptable and resilient to climate change  
Objective 2  To ensure that development is  sustainable – in being sited in 
location s where people can  access jobs and services, and in 
delivering  wider social and economic outcomes within the 
district’s enviro nmental limits  
Objective 3  To ensure that our market towns and their centres in particular 
are places for cultural and economic activity where people 
interact and access local services ; and to ensure the viability and 
sustainability of our communities in our villages and countryside, 
in way s which protect  the district’s local built heritage, character 
and identity . 
Objective 4  To ensure new development and open spaces support the health 
and we llbeing of communities and encourage active and healthy 
lifestyles  
Objective 5  To deliver housing  to meet current and future needs , including 
affordable housing, of a quality, type and size which meets a 
range of needs over people’s lifetime  
Objective 6  To support economic growth in ways which are compatible with 
environmental objectives, promote a greener economy, revitalise 
town centres and deliver increased prosperity for the whole 
community, including good quality and better paid jobs.   
Objective 7  To ensure development is supported by essential infrastructure 
and services and promotes safe movement and more sustainable 
modes of travel by enhancing greener travel networks for 
walking, cycling and public transport  
Objective 8  To protect and enhance the district’s varied and high quality 
environment, including through quality design: including its 
natural landscapes, green infrastructure and biodiversity, as well 
as its rich historic built environment and cultural assets.  
Do yo u agree with the se proposed objectives for the Local 
Plan Review? Please let us have additional suggestions you may have.

3.4 Priorities and Development Viability  
3.4.1.1  In setting t he priorities and objectives underpinning the Local Plan we must 
consider the potential impacts these may  have  in terms of the financial costs 
placed on new development. There is a risk  if we set our expectations and 
policy requirem ents too high , that development may not be viable. Our policies 
should be clear so that developers do not pay too much for a piece of land and 
then calculate that they cannot afford to meet our policy requirements.  If the 
value generated by a development is more than the cost of developing it, 
developers will walk away from it. A careful balance needs to be struck in this 
respect to ensure our requirements are at a level that is viable for development 
to go ahead. The Local Plan will therefore be subject to a Viability Appraisal 
which measures the costs of the various policy requirements for planned 
growth  balanced against esse ntial costs and the factors of value of 
development and land as listed/shown below:  
 
Figure 2: Balancing development essential costs/land value against planning policy requirements  
 
Factors affecting viability  Meaning  
Value of Development  Example – how much might be received 
through total sales of housin g taking 
account of market evidence  
Land Value  The sum of the value of the land in its 
existing use, plus a premium value for 
  
24 
 
Factors affecting viability  Meaning  
the landowner that reflects the minimum 
return at which it is considered a 
reasonable landowner would be willing to 
sell their land  
Essential Costs  Build Costs  
Abnormal Costs such as treating 
contaminated land  
Site specific requirements such as 
access service roads, connect ing to 
utilities, sustainable drainage, green 
infrastructure / landscaping  
Financial costs e.g. Loans  
Professional / marketing / sales / legal 
fees etc. 
Contingency – address project risk  
Contributions through the Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  
Policy Requirements  (not 
exhaustive)  Off-site contributions to pay for essential 
infrastructure  to support development , 
e.g. education, transport, health and 
open space/recreation  
Affordable housing  requirements  
Addressing climate change  crisis, zero 
carbo n aims, energy efficiency, future 
homes standard  
High quality design  – materials and 
features  
Accessible and Adaptable Homes  (as 
required in current Policy DM11)  
Supporting nature recovery – net gains 
for biodiversity  
Table 1: Viability factors  
How can we make sure  the priorities in the Plan (see 
examples above ) do not undermine the viability of development? If all   
25 
 
policy requirements taken together would make development unviable, 
which requirements do you think should be given  lower priority?       
26 
 
4. Issues and Options 
4.1 Theme 1: Tackling Climate Change 
Objective 1: To ensure that new development plays its part in 
achieving a Carbon Neutral Cumbria by 2037 and that 
environments and communities are adaptable and resilient to 
climate change.   
 Overview  
4.1.1.1 Climate change presents growing risks, globally and also locally in South 
Lakeland. It is widely accepted that human activity is the main reason for 
increased concentration of greenhouse gases and rising global temperatures. 
Unless steps are taken it will impact not just this but also future generations. 
Locally, the more visible impacts of rising temperatures include more extreme 
weather events including flooding. Longer term impacts are also likely to include 
rising sea levels  and increased coastal flooding. The response to the challenge 
posed by climate affects many aspects of life and society, a number of which 
can be influenced positively by the Local Plan Review.  
4.1.1.2 The Local Plan plays a key role in mitigating and adapting to the climate 
emergency. We are also legally required to make sure that development and 
the use of land contributes to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate 
change. The Local Plan Review will therefore have the mitigation of and 
adaptation to the climate emergency at its heart, forming an overarching theme 
for the whole document, including:   
 tackling climate change by promoting greater energy efficiency, 
encouraging more use of renewable energy, and managing flood risk 
(Theme 1)   
 promoting sustainable development, its  distribution and density, to  
reduce the need to travel (Theme 2)  
 promoting healthy communities, good air quality, open space and green 
infrastructure (Theme 4 )  
 promoting green travel , including public transport, walking and cycling 
and supporting electric vehicle charging points (Theme 7 )  
 promoting greater biodiversity (Theme 8) 
    
27 
 
 Key Issue: Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and achieving 
Carbon Neutrality in new Development  
What is the Is sue?  
4.1.2.1  The Government has set a legally binding target of reducing by 2050 the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions by 100% (net zero) from 1990 levels. Locally, t he 
District Council (SLDC) is aiming for South Lakeland District to be carbon 
neutral by 2037, and for the Council itself to become carbon neutral by 2030. 
The response to our early engagement in 2020 show s good  support from the 
community and stakeholders for strong measures to reduce carbon emissions 
and the impact of climate change. So how can the Loc al Plan Review help 
progress the standards in new development to  move towa rds carbon neutrality?  
4.1.2.2  The current Local Plan (Policy DM2) encourages low carbon building design but 
does not formally require higher standards than those set in building 
regulations . However l ocal planning authorities (LPAs) continue to have powers 
under the Planning and Energy Act 2008 to set energy efficiency standards in 
new homes above those in building regulation s. It is understood this permit ted 
LPAs to require dwellings to pro vide a 19% reduction in CO 2 emissions over 
Building Regulations, equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4.  LPAs 
also have powers to set requirements for on-site energy generation from 
renewable energy sources, such as solar panels ( sometimes known as the 
‘Merton Rule ’).  
4.1.2.3  In October 2019 the Government consulted on introducing a ‘Future Homes 
Standard ’ by 2025 which would reduce carbon emissions by 75 -80% for an 
average home, compared to current requirements . This would be achieved 
through very high fabric standards and low carbon heating systems  such as 
ground or air source heat pumps in place of heating from gas. The report 
suggested that the move towards a de -carbonised electricity grid, would mean 
that homes built to the Future Homes Standard woul d become net zero carbon 
over time , with no need for further adaptations or changes, as they would not 
be reliant on fossil fuels for their heating. The consultation also sought views on 
whether LPAs ’ powers should be restricted so as to be unable t o set h igher 
energy efficiency standards than those set nationally.  
4.1.2.4  In January 2021 t he Government issued its response to the Future Homes 
Standard consultation . It will firstly introduce an interim uplift to Building 
Regulations in 2022, which w ill reduce carbo n emissions from new dwellings by 
31%. The Gov ernment then intend s to consult on a full technical specification 
for the Future Homes Standard in 2023 , and will then introduce the necessary 
legislation in 2024 before implementi ng it in 2025. This will reduc e carbon 
emissions for a  standard home by 75% -80% an d make  new homes ‘zero 
carbon ready ’. In summary  this means they will not be built with fossil fuel    
28 
 
heating; they will be ‘future -proofed’ with low carbon heating and high levels of 
energy efficiency ; and will not require further retro -fitting in order to become 
zero carbon, as the electricity grid continues to de -carbonise. The Government 
confirmed that in the short term local authorities will retain powers to set local 
energy efficiency standards for new homes and that it will wait until the 
introduction of new planning reforms to clarify the longer -term role of planning 
authorities in determining local energy efficiency standards. It is understood 
that LPAs can therefore now require reductions in CO 2 emissions above the 
earlier limit of 19%.  
4.1.2.5  The ‘Merton Rule’ approach  requires a stated proportion of the energy used in 
a development to be from on-site zero and low carbon sources , such as solar 
panels. In contrast the carbon reduction approach requires a reduction in 
overall carbon emissions from the energy used in a development. The carbon 
reduction approach is currently considered the most appropriate approach 
because it avoids the possible situation under the Merton Rule whereby a 
building is wasteful  in energy but still complies with the Rule by simply installing 
more low carbon energy.  
4.1.2.6  In proposing any higher local standards for reduction in C O2, the additional cost 
and impact on the viability of development would need to be taken into account, 
and considered alongside other priorities for contributions and requirements 
from new development , such as affordable housing.  
4.1.2.7  Core Strategy Policy CS8.7 requires n ew commercial buildings of more than 
1000 sq m to meet the BREEAM ‘excellent’ standard . It is proposed that this 
requirement be retained  and the BREEAM ‘very good’ standard be required for 
minor non -residential development.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches ? 
Policy Option s 1.2: Achieving Carbon Reduction from new development.  
Residential D evelopment:  
PO1.2/i:  Await higher energy efficiency standards set nationally by 
Government  (a 30% reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2022 and a 75 -
80% reduction in 2025 ), and not set higher local standard s. 
PO1.2/ii:  Subject to testing the impact on viability, set higher local standards : 
by setting higher energy efficiency levels than those proposed by the 
Government , and/or requiring a minimum percentage of a 
development’s operational energy requirements to be met through 
renewable and low -carbon energy sources.  
Commercial Deve lopment    
29 
 
PO1.2/iii:  Continue  to require new major non–residential  development over 
1000m2 to meet the BREEAM ‘Excellent’ standard  
PO1.2/iv:  Require minor non -residential developments , or conversions to 
residential  use, to meet the most up -to-date BREEAM ‘Very Good’ 
standard as  a minimum .  
Which of these policy options for achieving carbon reduction 
in new development do you support  and why? Please give your reasons , 
noting the reference number, and add any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Sustainable Construction and Design   
What is the Issue?  
4.1.3.1  Option 1 .2 above considers setting new standards for housing and commercial 
development which would increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions. However the Local Plan Review can also consider  how to 
encourage or require wider standards for sustainable design and construction, 
which help in the mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of climate change.  
4.1.3.2  The current Local Plan encourages good practice through the following policies:    
 Core St rategy Policy CS8.7 – Sustainable construction, energy 
efficiency and renewable energy . 
 Devel opment Management Policies DPD Policy DM2 – Achieving 
Sustainable High Quality Design (and list of measures at Appendix 1).   
4.1.3.3  Together these policies encourage sus tainable construction and design 
measures in new development which:  
 reduce the need to travel and provide for sustainable transport – for 
example through footpath and cycle links, and electric vehicle charging 
points.   
 improve building fabric insulation and on site renewable energy 
generation . 
 reduce flood risk through permeable surfaces and other features  
 reduce water consumption and promote recycling .  
 optimise solar gain through site layout and orientation of buildings . 
 increase  opportunities for biodiversity through features such as bat 
boxes, swift bricks, hedgehog highways, green walls and green roofs.  
4.1.3.4  The Government has prepared a National Desig n Guide22 which sets out ‘ten 
characteristics of beautiful and well -designed places’, including that buildings 
                                            
22 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -design -guide    
30 
 
be designed to be resilient and resource efficient. The Government also 
consult ed earlier this year  on a more detailed National Model Design 
Code23.This is intended to set a baseline standard of quality and practice for 
LPAs to take into account in devel oping their own local design codes and 
guides, and when determining planning applications. The topics covered by the 
National Model Design Code which relate to climate change include green 
infrastructure, biodiversity, water and drainage, energy efficiency  and 
sustainable construction. The wider topic of good design is considered in more 
detail in Theme 8.   
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
Policy Approaches  1.3: Sustainable Construction and Design  
 Review and strengthen Core Strategy and Development 
Management DPD policies to where possible require  (rather than 
simply encourage) sustainable design and construction (over and 
above requirements in Building Regulations) which help mitigate and 
adapt to the impact of climate change .  
 Prepare a Local Design Guide as a Supplementary Planning 
Document, in accordance with guidance in the National Model 
Design Code (when finalised) , which provides clear guidance on 
requirements and advice on sustainable constr uction, design, and 
energy efficiency, to help mitigate the impacts of climate change 
arising from new development.  
Which of these policy approaches to sustainable 
construction and design to mitigate climate change impacts , do you 
support and why? Please give your reasons, noting the relevant reference 
number , and add any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Promoting Renewable Energy Infrastructure  
What is the Issue?  
4.1.4.1  The energy sector nationally i s transitioning apace from carbon -based e nergy 
sources , such as oil, coal and gas, to wards low-carbon and renewable sources 
such as wind and solar energy, the costs of which are continu ing to reduce . 
Other sources of low carbon energy include energy from waste (including farm 
waste), hydro power and the use of renewable and low carbon energy in larger 
public buildings.  
                                            
23 https://www.gov .uk/government/consultations/national -planning -policy -framework -and-national -
model -design -code -consultation -proposals  
   
31 
 
4.1.4.2  Planning Practice Guidance emphasises the role of the planning system in the 
delivery of new renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure in locations 
where the local environment al impact is acceptable, and is supportive of 
criteria -based policies that are positively framed. Policy DM21 of the 
Development Management Policies DPD, adopted in March 2019, is positively 
framed and supports renewable and low carbon energy development, subject 
to meeting 10 criteria . These includ e req uirements that proposals minimis e their 
impact on landscape character, historic and nature conservation interests and 
also safeguard residential and local amenity. Our assessment of whether 
planning applications propose suitable locations for renewable energy schemes 
under Policy DM21 is assisted by the following local planning guidance :  
 The Cumbria Landscape Character Guidance and Toolkit  
 The Cumbria Cumulative Imp act of Vertical Infrastructure Study; and  
 The Cumbria Wind Energy Supplementary Planning Document  
4.1.4.3  The Local Plan Review could go further and identify specific areas which may 
be suitable for renewable energy.  However Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) 
states that LPAs should only grant planning permission for on-shore wind 
turbines if the development is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy 
development in their Local Plan, and if, following consultation, it can be 
demonstrated that the planning  impacts identified by affected local communities 
have been fully addressed and the proposal has their backing.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Options 1.4:  Delivering low carbon and renewable energy 
infrastructure  
PO1.4/i:  to retain a criteria -based policy (currently Policy DM21 ) supported by 
existing local planning guidance, to assess planning applications  for 
low carbon a nd rene wable e nergy inf rastructure . 
PO1.4/ii:  to additionally identify suitable areas for development of low carbon 
and renew able energy infrastructure such as solar panels  or wind 
turbines , taking into account technology requirements, impacts on 
the local environment and the views of local communities.

 Key Issue: Resilient Landscapes  
What is the Issue?  
4.1.5.1  The NPPF states that plans should take a proactive approach to mitigating and 
adapting to climate change  when considering the long-term implications for 
matters including landscapes, biodiversity and the risk of overheating from 
rising temperatures. National p lanning policy guidance also advises LPAs , 
when prepar ing Local Plans , to look for measures which support sustainable 
development w hich have multiple benefits for climate change and adaptation 
such as Green Infrastructure24. We consider below several areas relating to 
landscape where the Local Plan Review could encourage or require features  to 
help in mitigating and adapting to climate change.  
4.1.5.2  Natural Flood Management  Measures : Traditionally, flood defences involve 
mainly large -scale, hard engineering but there is increasing interest in how 
complementary management of the wider landscape can also help red uce the 
risk of flooding by slowing the speed of water coming off the hills , temporarily 
storing water  and making river catchments more resilient . There is also 
potential for such approaches to form part of the flood risk management on 
development sites.   
4.1.5.3  Carbon Storage, Capture and Off Setting : The landscape can contribute to 
reducing greenhouse gases through the storage and  capture of carbon dioxide , 
for example by the planting of more trees and restoration of peat bogs . Any 
new policy requirements for carbon reduction in new development are likely to 
include the option that these (while preferred on -site) could be met off -site 
through various carbon  off-setting options, including for example carbon 
capture through tree planting in other locations.   
4.1.5.4  Biodiversity Net Gain : Local Plan Policy DM4 in the Development Management 
Policies DPD adopted in March  2019 already requir es new dev elopment to 
deliver  environm ental n et gai ns for biodiversity . This will often have the added 
benefit of carbon capture where additional trees are planted for example. T he 
Environment Bill will, when enacted, strengthen local policy by introducing a 
national  requirement for a 10% net gain in biodiversity in new development.  
The District Council is working with Natural England, the Cumbria Local Nature 
Partnership and other planning authorities in Cumbria to develop  planning 
                                            
24 Green Infrastructure can reduce urban heat, manage flooding, and help species adapt to climate 
change, as well as contributing to a ple asant environment which encourages walking and cycling. 
How the Local Plan Review can promote Green Infrastructure is considered further in Theme 4.  
   
33 
 
guidance for the consistent application of ‘biodiversi ty net gain’.  This issue is 
considered further in Theme 8.   
4.1.5.5  Local Nature Recovery Strategy : Cumbria is one of five pilot areas announced 
in August 2020 to test the approach to developing a Local Nature Recovery 
Strateg y (LNRS) , arising from the Environmen t Bill. The purpose of a LNRS 
includes:  
 enhancing and restoring nature conservation sites, includ ing habitats 
and corridors which form stepping stones for w ildlife to grow and move  
 improv ing a landscape’s resilience to climate change, providing natural 
solutions to reduc ing carbon and manag ing flood risk  
 reinforcing the cultural and historic character of landscapes  
 enabl ing enjoy ment and connect ion w ith nature , for health and 
wellbeing  
4.1.5.6  The LNRS is likely to help provide a consistent approach to prioritie s for carbon 
off-setting arising from new development. The LNRS proposals sit alongside 
the Government proposals for a new Environmental Land Management 
Scheme in the Agriculture Act 2020, under which farmers and land managers 
will be paid for publi c goods  such as creating habitats for nature recovery, 
supporting the establishment of new woodland and other m easures to help 
reduce flooding and tackle the effects of climate change .  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Approaches  1.5: Promoting Resilient Landscapes  
 A policy approach which encourage s or require s landscape 
resilience measures to assist in the mitigation of and adaptation to 
climate change, including through : 1) natural flood management 
measures; 2) carbon capture, storag e and off -setting; 3) the 
requirement for biodiversity net gain; 4) and the opportunity provided 
by the Local Nature Recovery Strategy pilot for Cumbria . 
Do you support this policy approach to landscape resilience 
for the mitigation of and adaptation to cl imate change ? Please give your 
reasons and add any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
 Key Issue: Managing and Reducing Flood Risk   
What is the Issue?  
4.1.6.1  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, Feb . 2019) requires the 
planning system and Local Plans to support the transition to a low carbon future 
in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change   
34 
 
including minimising vulnerability and improving resilience. Plans should take a  
proactive approach to mitigating and adapting to climate  change , taking into 
account the long term implications for flood risk, coastal change, water supply, 
biodiversity and landscapes. Policies should support measures to ensure the 
future resilience of communities and infrastructure to climate change impacts, 
such as providing space for physical protection measures.  
4.1.6.2  Policy DM6 of the Development Management Policies DPD on Flood Risk 
Management and Sustainable Drainage Systems was adopted in March 2019 . 
Policy DM6 update d Core Strategy Policy CS8.8 on Development and Flood 
Risk and is considered to be substantially u p to date and compliant with the 
NPPF. However the Local Plan Review will need to take account of important 
flood risk management schemes and updated evidence on flood risk  - both 
when assessing potential sites for allocation for development and also in 
reviewing current policy.  These include:  
 The start o f phase 1 of the Kendal Flood Relief Scheme, and the start soon 
on design and consultatio n on phases 2 and 3 for Burneside, Staveley and 
Ings and upstream storage measures - for details see 
www.thefloodhub.co.uk/kendal25  
 an updated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) is expected in 
Summer  2021, which takes full account of all potential sources of flood risk 
including experience of Storm Desmond in 2015 , and likely future increases 
to flood risk arising from longer term climate change.   
 The latest work  on the Cumbria Coastal Strategy (CCS)26 and the North 
West Shoreline Management Plan 2 (SMP2)27  
 Other assessments of flood risk including for south Ulverston.  
4.1.6.3  Could m easure s be required in new homes which make the m more resilient to 
flooding ? As the planning system seeks to ensure new homes are located in 
areas at least risk of flooding, it only requires new homes to be constructed to 
normal building regulation standards. However exceptional flood events can 
occasionally mean that relative ly new homes experience some flood risk. 
Should the Council therefore take a precautionary approach in South Lakeland 
and seek to set higher local standards of construction for new homes w hich 
include additional flood re silience features ?

 To take account of the latest evidence and proposals relating to flood 
risk in the assessment of development sites and revie w of Local Plan

updated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (expected mid 2021) and 
forthcoming work on the Kendal Flood Relief Schem e. 
Do you support th is policy approach to reviewing and 
updating policy on flood risk? Please give your reasons and add any 
other comments or alternative suggestions . 
 Other Issues and Additional Policy Approaches  
4.1.7.1  We propose the below additional policy approaches to help meet our objective 
on tackling climate change.  
Policy Approaches 1.7: Other Policy Approaches relating to Climate 
Change;  
 An overarching strategic policy on climate change , setting a target to 
achieve car bon neutrality in the district by  2037 ; and setting out the 
areas in which the Local Plan will seek to address c limate change , 
including those  listed in paragraph 4.1.1.2 above , and in the 
following areas: minimising carbon emissions; maximising carbon 
sequestration; and mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate 
change .  
 Consider if there are  exceptional circumstances  which would allow 
for carbon off -setting, by which a housing developer may deliver the 
required carbon reduction from a development on off -site locations 
or through  a financial contribution .   
 Promote  the retrofitting of existing buildings, including energy 
efficiency measures  (while recognising that much does not require 
planning permission).  
 Support community de -centralised renewable energy schemes and 
micro -generation.  
 Require  applicants  to submit a  Sustainability Statement  setting out 
how L ocal Plan policy require ments relating to climate change will be 
achieved, taking into consideration the impact of the scheme on 
other planning considerations and viability . This would include an   
36 
 
energy statement setting out how policy requirements for energy 
efficiency or renewable energy requirements would be met.   
 Monitor annual change in carbon dioxi de emissions per person per 
year in South Lakeland compared to regional and national averages 
(carbon dioxide emissions are 7 tonnes per person per year in South 
Lakeland  - this compares with 4.3 tonnes per person nationally and 
6.5 tonnes across Cumbria.)   
 Monitor progress towards the Council target of South Lakeland 
becoming a carbon neutral district by 2037 through the regular 
review of the Council’s Climate Change Action Plan  and joint 
working with the Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership.   
 Require electric  vehicle chargers or the cabling ready for the 
installation of electric vehicle charging , in all new residential parking 
spaces .   
 Consider the need and potential in South Lakeland to set higher 
local standards of construction for new homes for additional flood 
resilience features , either for all homes or those homes on sites 
which have been approved following application of the sequential 
test for flood risk.  
 Which of these policy approaches to adapting to or 
mitigating the impacts of climate change do you  support and why? Please 
give your reasons, noting the relevant reference number s, and add any 
other comments or alternative suggestions .

4.2 Theme  2: Where Should Development Go? 
Objective 2: To ensure that development is  sustainable – in 
being sited in locations where people can  access jobs and 
services, and in delivering  wider social and economic 
outcomes within the district’s environmental limits  
 Overview  
4.2.1.1  Local Plans should contain p olicies that set out an overall  strategy for the 
pattern, scale and quality of development and make sufficient provision for:  
 Housing (including affordable housing), employment, retail, leisure and 
other commercial development ; 
 Infrastructure for transport, telecommunications, security, waste 
management, water supply, wastewater, flood risk and coastal change 
management, and the provision of minerals and energy (including heat) ; 
 Community facilities (such as health, education and cultural infrastructure)  
and 
 Conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and histori c 
environment, including landscapes and green infrastructure, and planning 
measures to address climate change mitigation and adaptation . 
4.2.1.2  This section of the Issues and Options document focuses on the following:  
 The Place Hierarchy – assessing the sustainability of our communities  
 The Distribution of Development – where development should be broadly 
distributed  based on the place hierarchy  
 Development B oundaries – approach to development within or outside of 
development boundaries  
 Green gaps – designation of green gaps (areas of land that protect 
against merging of towns and villages)  
 Identifying suitable housing and employment sites – guiding principles for 
the selection of sites to be allocated for future development . 
 Key Issue: Sustainable Place s - The Place Hierarchy  
What is the Issue?  
4.2.2.1  Successful place -making is about looking at the opportunities and ben efits of 
places and the extent to which these can support the creation of sustainable 
communities. A number of factors (environ mental, social and economic) all 
need to be taken into account  in deciding on how  place s are shaped in the 
future. These  factors influence the strategy for where to locate ne w 
development and at what scale (The Development Strategy) . Development   
38 
 
should be directed to the most sustainable locations, taking account of the se 
factors. We need to therefore ask the question how these factors should 
influence the criteria for where development should be located and at what 
scale.   
Policy Approaches  2.2: Factors to consider in reviewing the place 
hierarchy  
 Existing population size  
 Type and range of facilities (within and in close proximity to a place)  
 Identity and character of the place  
 Sustainable travel connections within the place, and to other places  
 Environmental capacity and resilience of a place taking account of 
matters such as climate change (for example flood risk)  
 Proximity of a place to larger towns and degree of access  to them  
 Economic growth potential – extent to which a place can support 
new job opportunities   
 Infrastructure and services within a place, capacity of  existing 
provision to support new development, and extent to which 
additional provision can be readily delivered  
 Scale of opportunity to create new communities, and to strengthen 
the sense of place /community  
 Housing need and market – extent to which a place can support 
meeting existing and future needs  including affordable housing  
 Regeneration needs and opportunities – extent to which a place can 
support regeneration and prosperity of existing communities and 
make them more resilient in the future  
 Availability of land for development, and extent of constraints  
 Community ambitions and objectives including Neighbourhood Plans  
 Which of these policy approaches to reviewing the place 
hierarchy do you support and why? Please give your reasons, noting the 
relevant reference numbers, and add any other comments or alternative 
suggestions.  
 Taking into consideration the factors listed above, what do 
you think makes for a sustainable successful place? What criteria should 
be used to determine where development should be located?    
39 
 
 
4.2.2.2  The current Local Plan Development Strategy is set out in Policy CS1.2. This 
identifies four settlement tiers using criteria to determine which places fall in 
which tier  (the Settlement /Place  Hierarchy ) as follows:  
Settlement /Place  
Hierarchy  Settlements  Criteria  
Principal Service 
Centres  Kendal and Ulverston  Largest settlements with 
most facilities  
Key Service 
Centre  Grange -over-Sands, Kirkby 
Lonsdale and Milnthorpe  -Good public transport links 
to outlying settlements  
- A primary school, 
secondary school, library, 
doctor’s surgery and a 
town centre function 
providing at least a post 
office and 2,000 sq m of 
retail floorspace  
-A population of more than 
1,500  
Local Service 
Centre  Allithwaite, Arnside, 
Broughton -in-Furness, 
Burneside, Burton -in-
Kendal, Cartmel, Endmoor, 
Flookburgh/Cark,

Holme, Kirkby -in-Furness, 
Levens, Oxenholme, 
Natland, Penny 
Bridge/Greeno dd, 
Sandside/  Storth, 
Swarthmoor  -A local shop (selling items 
to meet every day  needs)  
-A primary school  
-‘Good’ public transport

transport journey of a GP, 
a hospital, a primary 
school, a secondary 
school, areas of 
employment and a major 
retail centre  
Smaller vi llages, 
hamlets and open 
countryside  All other locations  Small villages and hamlet 
comprises a recognised 
settlement of normally 10 
or more dwellings, in 
contiguous clusters and 
without significant open 
areas between buildings,

4.2.2.3  A map showing the three tiers of settlements, and key public transport routes is 
provided below:  
 
Figure 3: Settlements and Transport Routes  
4.2.2.4  The current  criteria are heavily focused on provision and access to services 
and facilities. Levels of provision of services and facilities can change over time 
due to changing circumstances. The Council has undertaken a n audit  of 
services and facilities across the Key and Local Service Centres as evidence d 
in the Settlement Services and Accessibility Assessment document28. The audit 
has been used to identify which Service centres meet the Core Strategy

criteria, and the outcome is included in the document. It shows that a number of 
Local Service C entres do not currently meet the criteria for the local service 
centre  tier they sit within. This may suggest a need to revise the current criteria 
used to define service centres, and/or adopt a more flexible approach if this 
would be more logical, based on the following factors:  
 Proximity of facilities and ser vices in nearby settlements and how 
accessible these are  (less emphasis facilities and services only  within 
the settlement ); 
 A more flexible approach to considering accessibility, review of the 30 
minute public transport  travel time, given some service cen tres are close 
to this threshold  but don’t quite reach this criteria ; 
 The quality and range of services that can be accessed ; 
 Other factors as listed in Policy Approaches 2.2 . 
 Do you have  any comments on the services and facilities 
identified i n the Settlement Services and Accessibility Assessment 
document?)  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.2.2.5  There is an option to continue with the current place hierarchy to help guide the 
strategy for where to locate development  and at what scale . Existing criteria 
used to help determine which settlements falls within which  tier could be 
retained or altered  taking into account changes in ci rcumstances . Alternatively, 
a different settlement hierarchy (different tiers) could be adopted based on new 
criteria.  
Policy Options 2.2 : The Place hierarchy  
PO2.2/i:  Retain the current  place hierarchy  (the four tiers  of Principal, Key  
and Local Service Centre and  smaller villages, hamlets and open 
countryside)  and retain the current criteria used to define which 
places falls within which tier . 
This option may see changes to which places sit within which tier , due to 
changes to services and facilities provision sin ce the current hierarchy was set 
in 2010.  
PO2.2/ii:  Retain the current tiers in the place hierarchy but change  the criteria 
used to define which settlement falls within which tier . 
This option may also see changes to which settlements sit within which tier due 
to changes in services and facilities  provision or changes to the criteria . 
PO2.2/iii:  Adopt a different approach defining a different places hierarchy 
(different tiers) , determined by different criteria .   
42 
 
This option would se e bigger changes to  the current approach , with different 
tiers identified , and criteria changed for example taking account of services 
near as well as in settlements . 
 Which of these policy option s for the place hierarchy do you 
support and why ? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
 Key Issue: Distributing New Development  – Development Strategy  
What is the Issue?  
4.2.3.1  Our current development strategy (as set out in Policy CS1.2 , adopte d in 2010)  
distributes  development in a balanced way focusing  it in the larger, more  
accessible  centres ( Kendal, Ulverston, Grange -over-Sands, Milnthorpe  and 
Kirkby Lonsdale ) while enabling enough development outside of these places  
to meet identified loca l need  and support local services and facilities .  It directs 
over a third of all development to Kendal based on higher levels of need for 
affordable housing in the east of the district and demand for significant increase 
of employment land in Kendal in recognition of its economic role in the wider 
area. The lower target for Ulverston , in comparison to Kenda l, reflects its size 
and population and need for regeneration in Barrow -in-Furness.  
4.2.3.2  Grange -over -Sands, Kirkby Lonsdale and Milnthorpe  are attributed a share 
of development which takes account of the capacity of existing services to 
accommodate development ; thresholds for new service investment ; the size, 
character and environmental capacity of the existing place ; and the need to 
secure regeneration/investor confidence.  In the Local  Service Centres , the 
strategy seeks to ensure that the level of new develop ment support s local 
services and the communit ies’ need for further development including rural 
regeneration and diversification and access to a reasonable choice of housing. 
For the remaining rural areas , a limited amount of development is planned , 
support ing the social and economic viability of the communities living and 
working there, in line with the spatial strategy, whilst minimising the impact on 
the countryside.  
4.2.3.3   Current spatial distribution targets are set out below:  
 Approximately 35% in Kendal  
 Approximately 20% in Ulverston  
 Approximately 13% spread across Grange -over-Sands, Kirkby Lonsdale 
and Milnthorpe  
 Approximately 21% spread across the Local Service Centres  
 Approximately 11% spread within smaller villages and hamlets, rural areas    
43 
 
4.2.3.4  As evidenced in the table below  housing growth from 2003  to 2020 , has largely 
been in line with the current development strategy, though more development 
proportionately has happened in the east of the district (Kendal and 
surrounding areas) compared to th e west (Ulverston and F urness), though it 
should be noted a number of sites have recently commenced  development in 
Ulverston.  
Location / Area / Settlement 
Tier Target %  Delivery 
2003 -20 % Difference  
Kendal  35% 41% +6% 
Ulverston  20% 16% -4% 
Ulverston and Furness  29% 23% -6% 
Cartmel Peninsula  12.75%  12% -1% 
East Area  24% 22% -2% 
Principal Service Centres  55% 58% +3% 
Key Service Centres  13% 14% +1% 
Local Service Centres  21% 15% -6% 
Rural settlements, open 
countryside  11% 13% +2% 
Table 3: Housing Delivery Distribution 2003 -2020  
4.2.3.5  Most housing  development in recent years has taken place on greenfield land 
compared to brownfield land , reflecting the limited supply and additional cost of 
developing brownfield sites29 and the increased supply of allocated greenfield 
sites.  
                                            
29 See Sustainability Appr aisal Scoping Report Figure 34    
44 
 
 
Figure 4: Brownfield and Greenfield Housing Delivery 2016 - 2020  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches?  
4.2.3.6  In Theme 5, later in this document, we discuss  options for the amount of 
housing development required to meet district -wide needs to 2040 . One option 
is a district -wide housing need figure of 290 homes per year based on the 
findings in  our Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2017 , plus an estimated  
10% uplift  to provide for flexibility.  This would result in a district requirement for 
6,380  homes over  the new plan period  2020 -2040.  When we take account of 
current housing land supply ,30 and an allow ance for small windfall sites ( under  
5 units) continuing to come forward (60 homes per year),  we would need to 
identify  land for about an additional  1,120 homes . Further detail is contained in 
the Housing Need  and Supply Topic Paper.  However , it is important to note  
that this provides only a  current indication of outstanding housing need and 
may change as a result of more up -to-date assessments at local or national  
level.   
4.2.3.7  We have put forward a number of potential options for the Development 
Strategy. One option is unlikely to  be selected  in isolation, and these should not 
be taken as an ‘either / or’ set of choice s. It might be that you think a 
combination of these options or elements from each should form the preferred 
option.   
  
                                            
30 Sites with planning permission and Local Plan unimplemented site allocations  
  
45 
 
Policy Options 2.3 : Distributing New Development  – Development 
Strategy  
PO2.3/i:  Current Local Plan Strategy - continue with current Local Plan 
Development Strategy . 
This option would mean the current Local Plan Development strategy is 
retained;  with most development directed to the Principal and Key Service 
Centres, but with sufficient development  in the Local Service Centres  and rural 
areas to support local needs . 
PO2.3/ii:  Urban focus  - increased proportion of new development in Kendal 
and Ulverston, with reduced proportion across the villages and rural 
areas of the district . 
This option would ensure a greater amount of development is located in the two 
largest settlements in the district where there is a higher level of provision of 
facilities and services, opportunities to support economic  growth , with less 
developm ent in the villages and rural parts of the district.  
PO2.3/iii:  Rural focus  - lower proportion of development in Kendal and 
Ulverston, and an increased proportion elsewhere particularly across 
the district’s villages . 
This would lead to a more dispersed distribution  of development across the 
district , and support the sustainability of smaller towns and villages.  
PO2.3/iv:  Economic Growth and Regeneration Focus  – focus on 
development where  it would support employment growth and enable 
regeneration.  
This would see more develop ment focused in Ulverston/Furness area 
supporting the regeneration of the economic prosperity of the Furness area 
including Barrow -in-Furness . 
PO2.3/v:  Sustainable Access  - development located  where there is  good 
levels of sustainable  access (rail and long term bus  services, 
walking ) to services and facilities . 
This would ensure development is located where it can maximise access to 
services and facilities by efficient sustainable modes of transport, including 
walking, reducing reliance on use of the car. Subject to capacity, development  
would be more focused in places  on sustainable  transport corridors .   
PO2.3/vi:  New focussed , major expansion  of existing settlement(s)  
This would see either development being focused in a single or series of larger 
expansions of one or more existing settlement s.    
46 
 
The scale of growth proposed for the district and available potential suitable 
land supply capacity will influence the extent to which this option might be 
considered appropriate .  
 
 Which of these policy options for distributing new 
development do you support  and why , taking account of the 
opportunities and challenges presented in the tables below? Please give 
your reasons, noting the reference number and any other comments or 
alterna tive suggestions .  
Option 1: Current Local Plan Strategy  
Opportunities  Challenges  
 Enables higher levels of housing 
growth in Kendal to meet needs 
in the East of the district where 
housing affordability is more 
acute  
 Strengthen s growth of Kendal as 
the main economic hub in the 
district and wider sub -region  
 Enables growth within the 
district’s towns and main villages  
that is proportionate to their size 
taking account of factors such as 
environmental capacity  
 Maintains a generous p roportion 
of growth within villages and rural

 Key Issue: Settlement Development  Boundaries  
What is the Issue?  
4.2.4.1  The current Local Plan (Policies  CS1.2 and LA1.1) designates settlement 
development boundaries for the Principal, Key and Local Service Centres 
outside of the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
Develo pment boundaries help to create a clear demarcation between the main 
built up areas and the open countryside, defining  where is classed as part of 
the built up area of the settlement and where isn’t. They help  to ensure the 
character and distinctiveness of  our towns and larger villages are retained, 
reducing the risk of built up sprawl . They also protect  the character of the 
surrounding  landscape and  direct new homes and business to the most 
sustainable locations.  Current criteria used to determine which land should be 
included in a development boundary are:  
 Including existing housing, shopping and other urban uses;  
 Including recreational open space (note this does not mean that these 
are suitable for development);  
 Including small infill or rounding off’ s ites; 
 Excluding protected areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
and Historic Parks and Gardens;  
 Including areas with scope to improve an unsatisfactory settlement 
edge;  
 Including land proposed for allocation for housing, employment or other 
urban or village uses . 
4.2.4.2  Within smaller villages and hamlets (outside of the AONB), that currently do not 
have any settlement development boundaries, the current Local Plan allows for 
housing development provided it meets a set of criteria as set out in Policy 
DM13. This supports development in these locations helping to meet local 
needs whilst preserving their characteristics.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.2.4.3  There is the option of retaining the current approach to defining development 
bound aries based on current criteria. An alternative option would be to change 
the approach and include new criteria , or to remove boundaries altogether . 
Policy Options 2.4 : Settlement Development Boundaries  
PO2.4/i:  Retain curre nt approach to defining Settlement Development 
Boundaries . 
This option would see development boundaries retained for the Principal, Key 
and Local Service Centres based on existing criteria , which may result in some 
updates to the current boundaries.     
52 
 
PO2.4/ii:  Change the approach to defining Settlement Development 
Boundaries based on new criteria.  
This option would see new criteria for defining Settlement Development 
Boundaries, likely to result in changes to current boundaries. 
PO2.4/iii:  Remove Settlement Development Boundaries. 
This option would see boundaries removed. It might result in a criteria policy led 
approach to considering development on the edges of built up areas. 
 Which  of these  policy option s for Settlement Development 
Boundaries do you support  and why ? Please give your reasons, noting 
the reference number, and any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .  
 If you feel a change to t he current development boundaries  
is needed in a town or village, please indicate on a map what these 
changes should be. 
 Key Issue: Green Gaps  
What is the Issue? 
4.2.5.1 The diversity, distinctiveness and strong identity of our towns and villages is a 
key characteristic of South Lakeland. Built development if not managed well 
can merge and sprawl at the outer edges of our towns and villages. This can 
erode the identity and distinctiveness of towns and villages, and make it difficult 
to know where one starts and one ends. Where this occurs coalescence can 
take hold (merging together of places). In order to protect against this 
happening, we currently designate a series of green gaps.  
4.2.5.2 Policy LA1.9 defines the location of the green gaps and these are shown on the 
interactive policies mapping in green . Policy CS8.2 sets out circumstances 
where development may be allowed in green gaps.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches? 
4.2.5.3 There is the option to continue to designate green gaps. Existing green gap 
boundaries could therefore be retained or amended as appropriate based on 
current criteria. Alternatively there is the option to no longer designate green 
gaps, and instead apply a policy criteria approach to development in locations 
where there may be a risk of coalescence. In thinking about the role of green 
gaps, you may also wish to consider the potential development opportunities 
that may exist within current green gaps.  
    
53 
 
Policy Options 2.5 : Green Gaps  
PO2.5/i:  Retain the principle of green gaps  and boundaries of current 
designations . 
This would retain the principle of designating green gaps, and maintain the 
current position, seeing no changes to the current defined boundaries or policy 
criteria to determine what development would be supported in such locations . 
PO2.5/ii:  Retain the principle of  green gaps  and amend current boundaries  of 
designations . 
This would retain the principle of designating green gaps, but see changes to 
the current boundaries based on either/both a different set of  policy criteria or 
other factors and circumstances relati ng to the development strategy.  This 
option may open up options for new development in some current green gap 
locations . 
PO2.5/iii:  Remove green gap designations and instead adopt a policy criteria 
approach to considering development in locations where there is a 
risk of coalescence .  
This would see the existing  green gap  designations  removed, and instead a 
policy criteria approach adopted to help determine the types of development 
that may be considered appropriate in locations where there is a risk of 
coalescence . This approach may open up options for new development in 
current green gap locations . 
  Which of these policy option s for  green gaps do you 
support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and any other comments or alternative sugge stions .  
 If you feel changes to the current green gap  boundaries are 
required between two settlements, please indicate on a map what these 
changes should be.  
 Key Issue: Identifying Suitable Housing and Employment Sites – 
principles  and priorities for selection  
What is the Issue?  
4.2.6.1  A key part of the Local Plan Review is reviewing the supply of housing and 
empl oyment land. In general , there is a reasonable supply in the short to 
medium term, but this will need reviewing and supplementing to meet needs to 
2040. We issued a Call for Sites  in the summer of 2020 which you can view 
and comment on if you wish at this early stage. However this consultation is 
also a further ‘Call for Sites’ opportunity to suggest other potential development   
54 
 
sites for allocation in the Plan. We would particularly welcome proposals for 
brownfield land.   
4.2.6.2  Following the current consultation  we will undertake a technical assessment of 
all suggested sites, including any new sites suggested, in a Strategic Housing 
and Employment Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) , for which we 
have published a methodology31. We will consult widely on this document in the 
autumn of 2021.  The SHELAA is a technical assessment and does itself 
recommend sites for development. When we have taken account of your views 
from this current consultation and later in response to the SHELAA, we will 
consult on recommended development sites as part of public consultation on a 
draft Plan in 2022.  
4.2.6.3  In summary therefore, we highlight the following key points:   
 No sites  are proposed for development at this stage  – this will happen 
when a draft Plan is consulted on in 2022  
 The Call for Sites  list is long list (and will get longer) but most sites 
assessed will not  ultimately be proposed for allocation  
 You are welcome to comment  on the 2020  Call for Sites  report , but you 
will also have opportunity to comment on all suggested sites once they 
have been assessed in the SHELAA st udy. We will then take account of 
your views before consulting on recommended sites in a draft Local Plan 
later in 2022 . 
 Do you have any comments on the sites suggested for 
allocation for development in the ‘Call for Sites’ of summer 2020? You 
can view information submitted with these sites here . Please refer to the 
site reference number. ( Please note, these sites have not yet been 
assessed )  
 Do you wish to propose other sites for allocation for 
development in this further ‘Call for Sites’, which forms part of the current 
consultation? Please see here  for more information.  
4.2.6.4  To help inform the site selection for where to locate new development, a set of 
guiding principles  needs to be established. These principles should take 
reference from national planning policy such as the effective use of land 
(including focus on brownfield  sites, support ing higher densities closer to town 
centres and good public transport links as appropriate). They should relate to 
the preferred development strategy for the district. Th ere is a question whether 
the Council should be allocating Strategic Sites based on evidence of needs, 
                                            
31 https://c umbria.citizenspace.com/south -lakeland -district -council/shlaa -pm/user_uploads/shelaa -
methodology -feb-2021.pdf     
55 
 
these sites would be larger scale and could for example support strategic 
economic needs. There may be specific locational requirements associated 
with d ifferent types of uses, for example depending on scale and function, 
employment sites will require access to the strategic road network.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
4.2.6.5  A number of policy approaches have been put forward for considering how best  
to address this issue.  
Policy Approaches 2.6: Principles for selecting sites for development : 
 Prioritise  sites which maximi se use of brownfield land and vacant 
and derelict l and and  buildings in most sustainable locations with a 
strong focus on locations within or close to town centres . 
 Promote sites where there are  opportunities for re -using under -used 
facilities within established uses for example garage blocks . 
 Promote sites for h igher densities of development in locations with 
most sustainable access to services and facilities such as town 
centres and along good public transport corridors , provided the 
character of the area is not compromised . 
 Avoid sites where environmental const raints cannot be overcome for 
example where flood risk cannot be mitigated . 
 Avoid sites where environmental harm cannot be mitigated  for 
example where located within a site of nature conservation value 
such as a Site of Special Scientific Interest . 
 Priorit ise sites in locations that are closely located to services and 
facilities by sustainable transport means . 
 Support use of sites for mix ed uses where this can deliver  
community needs and enable employment development to become 
viable . 
 Allocate  strategic  employment and housing sites to meet strategic 
district -wide needs  where justified . 
 Prioritise sites which have access to existing infrastructure ( example 
utilities, broadband  and electricity ), without need for any significant 
enhancement s, ensuring they are future proofed (taking account of 
future homes standard requirements) . 
 Avoid sites that would result in loss of valued local green /open 
space s.   
56 
 
 Which of  these policy approaches for selecting sites for 
allocation for development  do you support  and why ? Please give your 
reasons, noting the relevant reference numbers, and any other comments 
or alternative suggestions .

4.3 Theme 3: Thriving Market Towns, Villages and Rural 
Areas  
Objective 3: To ensure that our market towns and their centres 
in particular are pla ces for cultural and economic activity 
where people interact and access local services; and to ensure 
the viability and sustainability of our communities in our 
villages and countryside, in ways which protect the district’s 
local built heritage, character and identity . 
 Policies for our places: Kendal  
Introduction  
4.3.1.1  Kendal is the largest settlement in the district with a population of 29,188 . It is  a 
key economic and services hub for South Cumbria/Morecambe Bay area and 
wider hinterland, providing key services and facilities to a large catchment area. 
It is located close to the strategic road network (A591 provides links to A590 
and M6) and has good  rail links with the rest of the NW region via the West 
Coast Main Line at Oxenholme, with strong connectivity to Lancaster. It is 
located in the River Kent valley, and bounded by the Lake District National Park 
to the North West. The villages of Natland, Oxenholme and Burneside are 
located close to the town.  
 Housing in Kendal  
4.3.1.2  There are planned32 sites in Kendal for an estimated 1,990 dwellings, including 
sites with planning permission and site allocations which do not yet have 
permission. The current Local Plan strategy directs 35% of all new housing and 
employment development to Kendal. The town has seen 1575 new homes built 
since 2003 and in terms of share 41% of all housing development in the district 
has happened in Kendal. 337 affordable homes have been  built since 2010. 
Housing development has taken place at Kendal Parks, Oxenholme Road, 
Lumley Road and Natland Mill Beck Farm. Development has commenced on 
the South of Underbarrow Road site, and planning permission has been 
granted subject to Section 106  on land north of Laurel Gardens. A number of 
windfall sites have also come forward for housing, including K Village.  
  
                                            
32 Sites with planning permission as at 31 March 2020 and unimplemented site allocations considered 
deliverable and developable but no permission as yet    
58 
 
Business and Employment Development in Kendal  
4.3.1.3  Employment development has happened largely within existing employment 
sites and other locations through changes in use of existing premises. There is 
employment land available including at Scroggs Wood (11 hectares), East of 
Burton Road (6.5 hectares) and at North of Meadowbank Business Park (5 
hectares). The town has a number of existing e mployment sites including at 
Shap Road, Mintsfeet and Canal Head. The town centre has seen a range of 
new uses (retail, food and drink, leisure, entertainment, hotel and office), 
through changes in use of existing premises rather than large scale new build . 
Canal Head has seen a range of new uses , including advanced manufacturing, 
arts and food and drink.   
 Transport in Kendal and the Kendal Northern Access R oute 
4.3.1.4  Cumbria County Council and South Lakeland District Council share a long 
standing ambition in Ke ndal for the construction of a Kendal Northern Access 
Route which would link the A591 Kendal By -Pass with the A6 at Shap Road. 
This would reduce congestion, offer greater scope for pedestrian, cycle and 
public transport improvements within the town centre,  improve the quality of the 
town centre environment, and improve access for heavy vehicles between the 
Shap Road employment area and the trunk road network . It would also  open up 
the possibility of housing and employment development north of the town, 
increase transport capacity on the town centre transport network overall and 
improve the strategic resilience of the local highway network by providing a 
better diversionary route in the event of disruptions to traffic on the M6.  
4.3.1.5  The Cumbria Infrastructure Pla n 2016 produced by the Cumbria Local 
Economic Partnership in association with Cumbria County Council identified 
scope for a Kendal Northern Access Route. The Kend al Strategic Transport 
Infrastructure Study 201733 looked at a wide range of options for strategic 
transport improvements to the town’s road network and came to the conclusion 
that a Kendal Northern Access Route represented the best option for 
investment in major road infrastructure in the town. A strategic outline business 
case34 was undertaken in 2017 to develop the case for investment in the route 
and basis for more detailed development work on the scheme. The scheme has 
been identified by Transport for the North as a key highway scheme and 
funding is being sought from the Department of Transport to work up a full 
business case.

4.3.1.6  The Kendal Highways and Transport Improvements Study35 includes additional 
technical work on the Northern Access Route and identifies a number of key 
walking, cycling and public realm schemes for Kendal town centre. A Local 
Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan  (LCWIP)36 is being developed for 
Kendal. LCWIPs are set out in the Government’s Cycling and Walking 
Investment Strategy37 and are a strategic approach to identifying cycling and 
walking improvements required at the local level. They enable a long -term 
approach to developing local cycling and walking networks, ideally over a 10 
year period. The end product will comprise network pl ans for cycling and 
walking and include a prioritised programme of infrastructure improvements for 
future investment. It will build on the ideas included in the study, as well as the 
‘Kendal X ’ concept which seeks to improve cycle provision along the key f our 
corridors into the town (Windermere Road to Burton Road and Milnthorpe Road 
to Shap Road), alongside linkages into the canal and riverside  routes.  
 Kendal Town Centre  
4.3.1.7  Our town centres continue to change and evolve (see also section 4.4.6 ); they 
are no longer places just to shop. We need to think about the future role they 
have to play in helping to address the climate crisis, meeting wider economic 
and housing needs, providing necessary services and facilities, and sup porting 
people’s health and wellbeing (sociali sing and recreation). We need to ensure 
the balance of uses in Kendal town centre  complement each other so it stays 
an attractive place for economic investment (creation of jobs, new enterprises 
and economic de velopment, support visitor economy for example hotels and 
other accommodation), supports the needs of residents of Kendal and wider 
area (services and facilities including shops, leisure, entertainment, food and 
drink, community and cultural uses) and prov ides new homes to meet district’s 
housing needs. At the same time we need to ensure its strong identity, its 
historic richness and environmental assets such as the riverside and parks and 
gardens are conserved and enhanced.  
4.3.1.8  The Kendal Town Centre Strategy38 2020 identifies a number of opportunities 
to enhance the town centre and surroundings including Kendal Canal Head. 
These relate to the town’s offer as a plac e to live and work in and access for 
leisure and services purposes. It includes a number of potential transport 
interventions, and identifies areas for future development (‘opportunity areas ’).

These are areas of brownfield land with existing active uses, for example 
Station Gateway and Parkside Road North. It contains a composite  masterplan 
which illustrates a potential holistic approach to redevelopment in the town 
centre and surrounding s with reference to a number of opportunit y areas.  The 
Kendal Vision39 looks at the town as a whole and includes an indicative 
masterplan setting out options for transport improvements and future possible 
growth and development. These documents  will be used to inform future 
options for the growth of Kendal. Current Local Plan Policy DM24 supports 
town centre uses in the town centre, and residential where it would not 
compromise the viability and vitality of the town centre. It also supports a mi x of 
uses that complement the town centre offer within the Kendal Canal Head area.  
What has been happening?  
4.3.1.9  Since adoption of the Core Strategy in 2010, in addition to new housing and 
employment development, the following has happened in the town:  
 Kendal F lood Risk Management Scheme – approved proposals for linear 
flood defences along the River Kent (Phase 1) which ha ve recently 
commenced, which include habitat creation and new pedestrian/cycle links 
in the Mintsfeet area . Phase 2 (defences to the north of the town) and 
Phase 3 (upper catchment flood management) are in the design phase  
 Canal Head regeneration – consolidation of the area as an area for mix ed 
uses (commercial, employment, food and drink uses)  
 Kendal Town Centre Strategy and Ken dal Vision – as described above   
 Kendal Town Centre is also included in the Government's High Streets Task 
Force  Pilot Programme40. The High Streets Task Force was commissioned 
by the Governm ent in 2019 to strengthen local leadership in high streets 
and town centres in England. It describes itself as an alliance of place -
making experts which provides guidance, tools and skills to help 
communities, partnerships and local government transform th eir high stre ets 
 Investment in the local highways network including funded through Local 
Growth Deal including new signals and pedestrian crossing facilities at the 
A6 Milnthorpe Road/Romney Road junction as well as the new Burton Road 
and Shap Road cyclin g routes  
 Options for further improvements identified in the Kendal Highways and 
Transport Improvements Study  including future options for cycling and 
walking improvements , are to be progressed through the Local Cycling and

  A rich distinctive historic character 
including town centre Conservation Area 
and assets such as Kendal Castle  
 A significant amount of identified 
deliverable land in the Local Plan for Weaknesses  
 Congestion and capacity 
on town centre road 
network and associated 
issues for access to north 
of the town and levels of air 
pollution (Air Quality 
Management Area)  
 Walking and cycling access 
into the town centre 
constrained due to main 
road and river crossings, 
levels of traffic, narrow 
footways and gaps in cycle 
links 
 High levels of flood risk in 
parts of the town, notably 
close to the River Kent and 
north east parts of the 
town. Localised surface 
water flood risk throughout 
the town  
 Out of town centre 
commercial/retail 
development taking footfall 
away from town centre  
 Pockets of deprivation 
within  the town

development as identified in the Kendal 
Town Centre Strategy and Vision 
documents (opportunity areas ) to 
maximise use of brownfiel d land  
 Enhancements to existing green spaces 
and public realm throughout the town  
 To attract new employment development 
and investment into the town, possibly 
through cross -subsidising with housing 
development – widen town’s current 
economic base  
 Role of Northern Access Route and how 
it can reduce congestion in the town 
centre and improve experience of Threats  
 Climate change impacts – 
increased levels of flood 
risk 
 Continued increased usage 
of the car, further 
congestion and pollution  
 Changing demands for 
commercial and retail uses, 
and risk of buildings in town 
centre becoming unus ed, 
with reduced footfall  
 Further development on the 
edge of the town, more car 
trips and l oss of greenfield 
land 
 Changing demands and 
permitted  development

through strategic flood schemes  
 Take advantage of town’s proximity to 
the National Park and surrounding 
environmental qualities as a place to visit 
and stay  
 Reduce inequalities through 
regene ration and investment   Development that isn’t 
sensitive to the town’s 
distinctive characteristics, 
resulting in loss of identity  
 Reliance on a  narrow 
economic base including 
tourism  
 Risk that employment 
development may not come 
forward without necessary 
investment

What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
4.3.1.12  The current Local Plan has helped deliver a lot of extra homes (including 
affordable homes) in Kendal in recent years, and provides a good supply of 
land to deliver more in the years ahead on allocated sites. However, we need to 
consider all potential oppo rtunities for further housing and economic growth in 
the town. The allocated sites will be reassessed as part of the Local Plan 
Review , together with  other  sites put forward  through the Call for Sites 
exercise . 
4.3.1.13  We set out below some of the factors we think  are important for good long-term 
planning of Kendal to 2040 , and welcome your views on these and any other 
ideas you may have.  
Policy Approaches 3.1: Principles and Initiatives for good planning in 
Kendal to 2040:  
 Build on the town’s strengths as the mai n centre serving South 
Lakeland and surroundings – supporting and widening the town’s 
offer in terms of community facilities, informal recreation for residents 
and visitors, sports facilities and local services including health care, 
education, shopping, c ultural experiences, food, drink and 
entertainment.  
 Make sure there is land available to support local business and 
employment needs and opportunities that can boost the wider 
local/district economy, considering how the public and private sector 
can work t ogether in delivering schemes.  
 An emphasis on larger scale housing development providing a mix of 
housing including affordable which is sensitively located and 
  
67 
 
designed in a way which protects and enhances the town’s 
environmental assets, distinctive chara cter, identity and landscape.  
 Increase the diversification of housing mix to support diverse needs , 
including  affordable  housing , older people’s housing, and homes for 
smaller households . 
 A greater emphasis on brownfield and other windfall opportunities 
within the existing built up area, including within and on the edge of 
the town centre – including reusing underused sites and supporting 
housing development where it can support the vitalit y and viability of 
the town centre and the realisation of the Kendal Town Centre 
Strategy  and Vision . 
 Strengthen the role of the town centre and its surround ings as a 
place to live as well as to visit, work, shop and use for 
leisure/recreation.  
 Relieve the town centre traffic congestion.  
 Realise  regeneration opportunities, which can help reduce 
inequalities and boost the local and sub -regional economy.  
 Support the development of integrated walking and cycling networks 
including along the River Kent corridor , linking key facilities, green 
spaces and new developments, in order to make the town ‘friendly’ 
for walkers and cyclists.   
 Support for public realm enhancements within the town centre, 
especially in gateway locations.  
 Protect and enhance the heritage qu alities of the town.  
 Assess the merits of the Kendal Northern Access Route in the 
context of supporting the sustainable growth of the town and meeting 
other Local Plan objectives. Safeguard a route if considered 
appropriate, or instead make a general state ment of support  if 
funding becomes available.  
 Which of these policy approaches for the good planning of 
Kendal to 2040 do you support and why? Please give your reasons, 
noting the relevant reference number, and add any other comments or 
alternative suggest ions.   
Kendal Town Centre   
 What do you think the role of the town centre should be and 
how should its role develop in response to trends and challenges such as   
68 
 
on-line retailing? For example, if there are less shops in future, should 
housing and other non-retail uses such as leisure, food and drink be 
encouraged? (See also section 4.6.6 ) 
Open Spaces 
  Have we identified the righ t open spaces that need 
protecting in Kendal on the Policies Map ? Can you suggest others? Do 
some open spaces also merit designation as Local Green Spaces? (See 
section  4.4.5 ) Please show clearly on a map any open spaces or Local 
Green Spaces you propose.  
Green Infrastructure, Cycling and Walking 
 How can we complete any gaps in the green infrastructure 
network and cycling and walking networks in Kendal? (see section 4.4.5 ) 
Please suggest potential links between green spaces and also within 
cycling and walking networks .   
Development Boundary and Green Gaps 
 Should the development boundary  for Kendal on the 
policies map be changed? (see section 4.2.4 ) Please show on a map any 
changes you propose.  
 Should the green gaps  around Kendal as shown on the 
policies map  be changed? (see also section 4.2.5 ) Please show on a map 
any changes you propose.  
Directions of Growth 
4.3.1.14 The Local Plan Review provides opportunity to consider the amount and 
location of housing and employment development that should be provided for 
through the allocation of sites in the Local Plan. We therefore invite your views 
on how much growth is appropriate in Kendal and on possible ‘directions for 
growth’ of the town, as set out in the policy options table 3.1 and accompanying 
map below. 
4.3.1.15 The map below indicates possible indicative ‘directions of growth’ taking 
account of the constraints and opportunities identified in the map above and the 
SWOT analysis, as well as suggested site allocations arising from the Call for 
Sites, and broad locations identified in the current Local Plan.

 Policies for our places: Ulverston  
What are the Issues?  
Introduction  
4.3.2.1  Ulverston is the second largest settlement in the district with a population of 
11,487 . It is  a key economic/services hub within South Cumbria/  Morecambe 
Bay, providing a range of employment opportunities, key services and facilities 
to villages and rural  areas within the Furness Peninsula. It is served by the 
strategic road network (A590), and regional rail network (Furness Line) with 
links to Barrow -in-Furness and Lancaster and to Carlisle via the Cumbria Coast 
Line. The town has close functional linkage s with Dalton -in-Furness and 
Barrow -in-Furness. The village of Swarthmoor is located close to the town 
separated by a Green Gap designation in the Local Plan. It is located close to 
Morecambe Bay, and has a coastal urban fringe landscape characteristic 
situated on low lying flat land.   
Housing in Ulverston  
4.3.2.2  The current Local Plan strategy directs 20% of all new housing and 
employment development to Ulverston. The town has seen 622 new homes 
built since 2003. There are planned sites in Ulverston for an estim ated 1,226 
dwellings, including sites with planning permission and site allocations which do 
not yet have permission, a significant proportion of which is planned for the 
south of the town at Croftlands. 8 affordable houses have been built since 
2010. Hous ing development has commenced on the Stone Cross Mansion site, 
South of Lund Farm site, Gascow Farm and West End Nursery. Outline 
planning permission has been granted on the Nook Farm, Croftlands site, and 
Homes England has secured interest on the remainin g Croftlands site 
(Croftlands East).  
Business and Employment Development in Ulverston  
4.3.2.3  Employment development has taken place on land at Canal Head (Tritech Ltd) 
and at Lightburn Road for retail and business units (Beehive Business Park) 
along with a Blue L ight Hub facility (emergency services), which is still under 
construction. There is little  allocated  employment land in the current Local Plan 
available for development compared to the rest of the district. The town has a 
number of existing employment site s including Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), Low 
Mill Business Park and North Lonsdale Road.  
4.3.2.4  Potential future land supply could include part of the GSK operational site 
(south site) which is surplus to needs following the company’s decision to 
reduce operations on the Ulverston site. The Cumbria Local Industrial   
72 
 
Strategy41 (CLIS , paragraph  9.20) advises that Cumbria has major employment 
locations potentially available for expansion or inward investment and refers to 
‘...the redevelopment of part of the GSK site in Ulverston for new business 
opportunities ...’. SLDC  is working with GSK and part ners to develop a 
masterplan to guide the future development of the site for employment and 
other uses.  
4.3.2.5  In the light of these changing circumstances  at GSK, there is opportunity 
through the Local Plan Review to revisit the scope for regeneration around th e 
Ulverston canal  area.   
Transport in Ulverston  
4.3.2.6  The A590 forms part of the strategic road network, linking Barrow -in-Furness 
with the rest of South Lakeland, and Lancaster via the M6. It cuts through the 
centre of Ulverston and restricts vehicle and pedestrian/cycle access from large 
parts of the town to the town centre. Access to the employment sites on the 
east side of the town is also via the A590. Delays can occur along the A590 
network including its junctions within Ulverston, which is an issue for economic 
growth in the town and wider Furness area. The provision of safe pedestrian 
and cycle access to the town centre from residential areas is compromised by 
having to cross the A590.  
4.3.2.7  Funding has been obtained from a range of sources t owards a new roundabout 
at Cross -a-Moor on the A590 which will open up access to planned housing 
development at Croftlands and Swarthmoor . The Cumbria Infrastructure Plan 
201642 identifies a number of strategic infrastructure projects , includ ing an 
Ulverston by –pass. In considering options for Ulverston there is a question to 
ask about the long term role of such a route in facilitating future development 
and addressing current highways issues in the town.  
What has been happening?  
4.3.2.8  Since adoption of the Core Strategy in 2010, in addition to new housing and 
employment development, the following has happened in the town:  
 Completion of £9.5 million Town Beck Scheme in November 2017, 
protecting  407 properties and 118 businesses against a floo d event with a 
1% chance of occurring in any one year.  
 Investigations into river, surface water and tidal flood risk in South Ulverston 
through complex mapping a nd modelling project. Further appraisal to be 
undertaken through the South Ulverston Flood Risk Management Scheme 
and funding secured (Environment Agency)

42 https://www.thecumbrialep.co.uk/modul es/downloads/download.php?file_name=1724    
73 
 
 Investment in the local highways network including improvements at 
Quebec Street and A590 and access to employment site at Lightburn Road . 
Funding secured for other improvements through Local Growth Funding  
 Funding obtained through a range of sources towards the provision of a 
roundabout at Cross -a-Moor which will open up access to planned housing 
develop ment at Croftlands and Swarthmoor as identified in the current Local 
Plan.  Work is due to commence in September 2021.  
 Communities in and around Ulverston have been included in Cumbria 
County Council’s successful bid to the Department of Transport for fund ing 
as part of the Rural Mobility Fund Initiative. Ulverston will be included in a 
trial pilot scheme to consider rural transport solutions.  
 £3 million allocated from Borderlands Place Programme for investment in 
Ulverston (economic, social and transport i nitiatives).  A ‘Place Plan’ is in 
development for Ulverston. It is being led by Cumbria County Council in 
partnership with the local community and stakeholders through the 
Borderlands initiative.  
 Proposals to improve the leisure offer in the town through e nhancements to 
the existing Leisure Centre at Priory Road.  
Key Issues? Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats 
(SWOT Analysis)  
4.3.2.9  There are a number of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats 
relating to the town to take into account as foll ows:  
Strengths and Opportunities  Weaknesses and Threats  
Strengths  
 A key economic and services centre in 
the wider South Cumbria/Morecambe Bay 
area – strong functional linkage with 
Barrow -in-Furness and wider links to 
Cumbria Energy Coast  
 A strong economic base – a range of 
employment sites and mix of employers, 
for example Low Mill Business Park, 
North Lonsdale Road, strong presence of 
advanced manufacturing business in the 
town (e.g. GSK, Siemens, Marl 
International and Oxley Developments ) 
 Rail access links to Barrow -in-Furness, 
Cumbria coast and Lancaster  
 Close access to Barrow -in-Furness via 
A590  Weaknesses  
 Congestion and capacity on 
A590  
 Travel time to M6  
 Walking and cycling access 
from large parts of the town 
into the town centre 
constrained due to 
severance with the A590  
 High levels of flood risk in 
parts of the town, notab ly 
close to Town Beck and 
Dragley Beck (river), and 
east parts of the town to the 
coast caused by a complex 
mix of sources including 
watercourses, surface   
74 
 
Strengths and Opportunities  Weaknesses and Threats  
 A strong services and facilities offer, 
including a number of independent 
traders, supermarkets, health facilities, 
emergency services, seconda ry and 
primary schools and cultural, leisure and 
sport facilities  
 A significant identified supply of 
deliverable land for housing development 
including Croftlands (allocated sites)

impacts  
 Potential for out of town 
centre commercial/retail 
development taking footfall 
away from town centre  
 Pockets of deprivation 
within the town (Ulverston 
East)  
 Limited identified supply of 
delive rable land (allocated 
sites) in the Local Plan for 
employment development  
 Announced loss of major 
employer (GSK), and 
potential job losses  as a 
consequence  
Opportunities  
 New and enhanced existing walking and 
cycling routes linking existing and new 
development to key services and facilities 
and public transport routes  
 Re-use and redevelopment of existing 
available unused buildings and premises 
for other uses that can boost the vitality of 
the town, create additional footfall into 
town centre, and pro vide more housing  
 Enhancements to existing green spaces 
and public realm throughout the town  
 Opportunities for new development / new 
land uses through regeneration of GSK 
site. Revisit approach to the area  Threats  
 Climate change impacts – 
increased levels of flood 
risk 
 Continued increased usage 
of the car, further 
congestion and pollution  
 Changing demands for 
commercial and retail uses,

What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
4.3.2.11  The current Local Plan provides a good supply of land to deliver more housing 
in the years ahead in the town but there is limited supply for employment. 
These sites will be reassessed as part of the Local Plan Review, together with 
other site options  put forward through the Call for Sites exercise . 
4.3.2.12  We set out below some of the factors we think are important for good long-term 
planning of Ulverston to 2040 , and welcome your views on these and any other 
ideas you may have.  
Policy Approaches 3.2: Principles and Initiatives for good planning in 
Ulverston to 2040:  
 Build on the town’s strengths as the main c entre serving the west of 
the South Lakeland area and surroundings –supporting and 
widening the town’s offer in terms of c ommunity facilities, informal 
recreation for residents and visitors, sports facilities and local 
services including health care, education, shopping, cultural 
experiences, food, drink and entertainment . 
 Make  sure there is land available to support local bu siness and 
employment needs and opportunities that can boost the wider 
local/district economy, considering how the public and private sector 
can work together in delivering schemes . 
 An emphasis on larger scale housing development providing a mix of 
housing  including affordable which is sensitively located and 
designed in a way which protects and enhances the town’s  
environmental assets, distinctive character, identity and landscape.  
  
78 
 
 Increase the diversification of housing mix – including affordable  
housin g, older people’s housing, and homes for smaller households , 
supporting needs of all . 
 A greater emphasis on brownfield and other windfall opportunities 
within the existing built up area, including within and on the edge of 
the town centre – including reusi ng underused sites and supporting 
housing development where it can support the vitality and viability of 
the town centre . 
 Strengthen the role of the town centre and its surrounds as a place 
to live as well as to visit, work, shop and use for leisure/recrea tion. 
 Relieve traffic congestion on the A590 and improve pedestrian and 
cycle access links to the town centre . 
 Realise  regeneration opportunities, including role of GSK site in this 
context which can help reduce inequalities and boost the local and 
sub-regional economy . 
 Support the development of integrated walking and cycling networks 
including along the Canal corridor, linking key facilities, green spaces 
and new developments, in order to make the town ‘friendly’ for 
walkers and cyclists.   
 Support for pu blic realm enhancements within the town centre, 
especially in gateway locations . 
 Protect and enhance the heritage assets and qualities of the town . 
 Consider the merits of an Ulverston by -pass in the longer term, in the 
context of supporting the sustainable  growth of the town and meeting 
other Local Plan objectives. Safeguard a route if considered 
appropriate, or instead make a general statement of support  if 
funding becomes available . 
 Which of these policy approaches for the good planning of 
Ulverston to 20 40 do you support and why? Please give your reasons, 
noting the relevant reference number, and add any other comments or 
alternative suggestions.  
Ulverston Town Centre   
 What do you think the role of the town centre should be and 
how should its role develop in response to trends and challenges such as 
on-line retailing? For example, if there are less shops in future, should   
79 
 
housing and other non-retail uses such as leisure, food and drink be 
encouraged? (See also section 4.6.6 ) 
Open Spaces 
  Have we identified the right open spaces that need 
protecting in Ulverston on the Policies Map ? Can you suggest others? Do 
some open spaces also merit designation as Local Green Spaces? (See 
section 4.4.5 ) Please show clearly on a map any open spaces or Local 
Green Spaces you propose.  
Green Infrastructure, Cycling and Walking 
 How can we complete any gaps in the green infrastructure 
network and cycling and walking networks in Ulverston? (See section 
4.4.5 ) Please suggest potential links between green spaces and also 
within cycling and walking networks .  
Development Boundary and Green Gaps 
 Should the development boundary  for Ulverston as shown 
on the policies map be changed? (S ee section 4.2.4 ) Please show on a 
map any changes you propose.  
 Should the green gap  between Ulverston and Swarthmoor 
as shown on the policies map be changed? (See also section 4.2.5 ) 
Please show on a map any changes you propose. 
Directions of Growth 
4.3.2.13 The Local Plan Review provides opportunity to consider the amount and 
location of housing and employment development that should be provided for

 Policies for our  places: Grange -over-Sands  
What are the Issues? 
4.3.3.1 Grange-over-Sands is a Key Service Centre in the current Local Plan and third 
largest settlement in the district with a population 4,259. It provides key 
services and facilities to villages and rural areas within the Cartmel Peninsula. 
Grange-over-Sands developed as resort town following the opening of Furness 
railway in 1857. Grange has close links with the strategic road network (A590), 
and is served by the regional Furness rail line, with links to Barrow- in-Furness, 
Lancaster and Manchester airport. 
4.3.3.2 There are planned sites in Grange for an estimated 376 dwellings, including 
sites with planning permission and allocated sites in the Local Plan which do 
not yet have permission. Part of the allocated site at Allithwaite Road has 
recently been approved for 87 new dwellings, with outline consent for an 
additional 90 extra care units.  300 new homes have been built in Grange since 
2003, including 93 affordable homes built since 2010. The current Local Plan 
strategy directs 13% of all new housing to the three Key Service Centres, 
including Grange. The supply of land for business development in the town is 
limited.  
4.3.3.3 In 2018 Grange-over-Sands Town Council completed a Neighbourhood Plan 
for Grange, which has the same status in determining planning applications as 
the South Lakeland Local Plan. The aims of the Neighbourhood Plan include 
influencing the design of new developments, helping residents to access low-
cost market homes and protecting the area’s environment and bi odiversity. The 
Plan includes a design guide. The completed Neighbourhood Plan also enables 
the Town Council to access 25% (rather than 15%) of the Community 
Infrastructure Levy to improve local facilities. The Plan allocates a Local Green 
Space at the sou th end of the allocated mixed-use site South of Allithwaite 
Road.  
4.3.3.4 The adjoining parish of Allithwaite and Cartmel Parish Council is also in the 
process of preparing a Neighbourhood Plan.  
4.3.3.5 In 2017 SLDC commissioned a study43 into the economic potential of the 3 Key 
Service Centres in the district, including Grange-over-Sands. Its findings have 
also helped inform the assessment in this section.

What has been happening?  
4.3.3.6  Since adoption of the Core Strategy in 2010, a number of important 
developments have t aken place or are planned in Grange -over-Sands:   
 a new health centre has been built on a former brownfield site at Berners .  
 housing  schemes completed in recent years have included 43 affordable 
homes at Berners, 42 homes at Carter Road and 64 homes at Thornfield 
Road . 
 plans for the regeneration of Grange Lido and promenade continue to  
develop . 
 a new SPAR store and filling station has  been given planning permission .

 Policies for our places: Milnthorpe  
Introduction  
4.3.4.1  The village of Milnthorpe is a Key Service Centre in the current Local Plan and 
has a population of 1,681. The village provides a wide range of local services 
and facilities, serving a large rural catchment. Milnthorpe has medieval origins 
and was granted a Charter for a weekly market in the early 14th century. It is 
located at the junction of the A6 with the B5282 to Arnside, the B6385 to 
Crooklands and M6 and near the B6384 to Holme and Burton, The regular 555 
bus service between Keswick and Lancaster sto ps at Milnthorpe, Holme and 
Burton.  
4.3.4.2  There are currently sites for about 164 dwellings – 9 with permission and for a 
further 155 homes on the allocated site South and East Milnthorpe, for which a 
Development Brief44 was adopted in 2015.  44 new homes have been built in 
the village since 2003, and 10 affordable homes have been built since 2010. A 
good range and type of employment land is available, includ ing at the 
Parkhouse Lakeland Estate and on Local Plan sites at Bridge End Business 
Park (1.8ha) and adjacent to Mainline Business Park (8.07ha). The current 
Local Plan strategy directs 13% of all new housing development to the three 
Key Service Centres, i ncluding Milnthorpe. More recent development has 
included the opening of Booths supermarket, the relocation of the SPAR 
supermarket (together with a new filling station) and Travis Perkins’ relocation 
to the Parkhouse Lakeland Estate.   
4.3.4.3  In 2017 the Distric t Council commissioned the Key Service Centres - Economic 
Potential Stu dy45 for centres including Milnthorpe. Its findings have informed 
the assessment in this section.  
What has been happening?  
4.3.4.4  Since adoption of the Core Strategy in 2010, a number of important 
developments have taken place in Milnthorpe including:   
 Booths  supermarket opened in Milnthorpe in 2012 .  
 The SPAR store moved from the market square to a new location on 
Beetham Road, together with a new filling station.   
 The relocation of Travis Perkins from Sandside .  
 ‘Milnthorpe Matters’: Cumbria County Council is working with Milnthorpe 
Parish Council and SLDC on a ‘Milnthorpe Matters’ initiative. The views of

the local community and stakeholders will be sought to help assess the 
assets of the village, the needs of th e community needs and ideas to make 
the most of Milnthorpe’s unique features. This will inform a village plan to 
help ensure Milnthorpe is in a strong position to take full advantage of 
emerging opportunities in the future.  
Key Issues ? Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats 
(SWOT Analysis)  
4.3.4.5  There are a number of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats 
relating to the village  to take into account as follows:  
Strengths and Opportunities  Weaknesses and Threats  
Strengths  
 attractive,  historic village centre  
 good range and quality of local  
services and facilities (including 
shops, doctors, dentists, 
solicitors, vets, opticians)  
 good secondary and primary 
schools  
 a good supply of housing and 
employment land allocated for 
development i n the Local Plan  
 several larger local employers  
 good economic activity rates  Weaknesses  
 the rate of housing and employment 
development is slower than some other 
key service centres in South Lakeland.  
 The Mainline industrial estate has 
restricted access to the A590 and M6  
 congestion on the A6 (which is severe 
when the M6 is closed on occasion)  
 a number of vacant commercial premises 
in village square including the previous 
location of the SPAR shop  
 has the village square lost its sense of 
place  
 the weekly market is performing less 
strongly  than previously  
 limited recent investment in public realm, 
marketing and signage  
 
Opportunities  
 the ‘Milnthorpe Matters’ project – 
an initiative to promote assets 
and opportunities in the village  
 sites available for housing and 
employment offer potential for 
employment (c 10ha) and  
housing need ( c170 homes) and 
could develop local economy  Threats  
 a risk that the scale of current planned 
development will be insufficient to justify 
the high cost of improved link s to the 
A590 and national road network.  
 a risk of more buildings in village centre 
becoming vacant and current ones 
deteriorating further    
90 
 
Strengths and Opportunities  Weaknesses and Threats  
 potential for a consolidated 
health centre, pharmacy dentist 
etc if a suita ble site can be found  
 potential for investment in public 
realm and marketing  
 redefine the Market Square as a 
multi -functional area   competition from other centres with better 
linkages to road network, such a 
Carnforth  
 potential lack of investment  in social 
infrastructure (health, community 
facilities), and utilities (example 
sewerage)  
 a risk that new development does not 
enhance village ’s distinctive character 
and identity.  
Table 13: SWOT analysis - Milnthorpe  
 Have we identified the relevant strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities and threats for Milnthorpe?  
4.3.4.6  The map below includes a number of key features, constraints, opportunities 
and issues relating to the current and possible future development in 
Milnthorpe. It is a snapshot of Milnthorpe now, and includes sites currently 
allocated for development but not  yet completed.

Figure 14: Milnthorpe Map Key  
  Have we identified the correct features or issues on the 
map? Are there additional features or issues that should be included?  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
4.3.4.7  Housing development from sites allocated in the Local Plan has been more 
limited than in other towns in the district, although there remains potential for 
these to be developed. These sites will be reassessed as part of the Local Plan 
Review, together with othe r site options. In reviewing the supply of sites for 
business and employment, an important issue will be to reassess the viability of 
road access improvements to the A65 or A590 required for the large Mainline 
employment site to be developed.  
4.3.4.8  The Milnthor pe Matters initiative presents an opportunity for the local 
community and key stakeholders to work together and develop a village plan 
with proposal for local improvements which can be developed if funding or 
other opportunities arise. The Local Plan Revie w process will seek to engage 
with the Milnthorpe Matters initiative and consider any proposals which the 
Local Plan could assist with – for example through new or amended planning 
policy, or by identifying sites for development (or protecting sites from 
development).  
4.3.4.9  We set out these and other factors below which we think are important for 
good, long -term planning of Milnthorpe to 2040 and welcome your views on 
these and any other ideas you may have.  
  
  
93 
 
Policy Approaches 3.4: Principles and Initiatives for good planning in  
Milnthorpe to 2040:  
 A review  of housing sites (both those currently allocated and 
potential new sites) to support additional development in Milnthorpe 
to 2040. This will help meet housing (and affordable housing) need 
and build on th e village’s strengths as a key service centre, serving 
the wider rural area. It will potentially also help support and widen 
the village’s offer in terms of community facilities, informal recreation, 
and local services and facilities including health care,  education, 
food and drink.  
 A review of land allocated for business and employment to meet 
needs and for local business and employment needs and 
opportunities.  
 Support for identifying a suitable site for a new medical centre for 
Milnthorpe, with opportuni ty to provide several related services in 
one location.  
 More emphasis on small scale development which is sensitively 
located and designed in a way which protects and enhances the 
town’s distinctive character and landscape setting – including the 
setting of the Arnside and Silverdale AONB.  
 More emphasis on brownfield and ‘windfall’ opportunities for 
development within the built -up area, including within and on the 
edge of the town centre. This also includes the reuse of any 
underused sites and supporting housing development where it can 
support the vitality and viability of the town centre.  
 Support the development of any opportunities for improving walking 
and cycling networks, linking key facilities, green spaces and new 
developments.  
 Support for public r ealm enhancements in the Square and 
Conservation Area.  
 Which of these policy approaches for the good planning of 
Milnthorpe to 2040 do you support and why? Please give your reasons, 
noting the relevant reference number, and add any other comments or 
alter native suggestions.  
    
94 
 
Milnthorpe Village Centre   
 What do you think the role of the village centre should be 
and how should its role develop in response to trends and challenges 
such as on -line retailing? For example, if there are less shops in future, 
should housing and other non -retail uses such as leisure, food and drink 
be encouraged? (See also section 4.6.6 ) 
Open Spaces  
  Have we identified the right open spaces that need 
protecting in Milnthorpe on the Policies Map ? Can you suggest others? 
Do some open spaces also merit designation as Local Green Spa ces? 
(See section 4.4.5 ) Please show clearly on a map any open spaces or 
Local Green Spaces you propose.  
Green Infrastructure, Cycling and Walking  
 How can we complete any gaps in the green infrastructure 
network and cycling and walking networks in Milnthorpe? (See section 
4.4.5 ) Please suggest potential links between green spaces and also 
within cycling and walkin g networks .  
Development Boundary and Green Gaps  
 Should the development boundary  for Milnthor pe as shown 
on the policies map  be changed? (See section 4.2.4 ) Please show on a 
map any changes you propose.  
 Should the green gap  between Milnthorpe and Ackenthwaite 
as shown on the policies map  be changed (See also section 4.2.5 ). Please 
show on a map any changes you propose . 
Settlement Services and Facilities  
 Have we correctly identified the services and facilities in the 
Settlement Services and Accessibility Assessment document? ( See 
Sect ion 4.2.2 )

4.3.4.10  The Local Plan Review provides opportunity to consider the amount and 
location of housing and employment development that should be provided for 
through the allocation of sites in the Local Plan. We therefore invite your views 
on how much growth is appropriate in Milnthorpe and on possible ‘directions for 
growth ’ of the village , as set out in the policy options Table 3.4 and

 Policies for our places: Kirkby Lonsdal e 
Introduction  
4.3.5.1  Kirkby Lonsdale is an historic market town on the north side of the A65, about 
13 miles southeast of Kendal and close to the Yorkshire Dales National Park. 
The town is a Key Service Centre in the current Local Plan with a population of 
abou t 1,603. The town has a strong employment and service role serving a 
wide rural hinterland, which also stretches into parts of Craven District and 
Lancaster City. The town centre is thriving and vibrant, with a growing number 
of small independent shops, ca fes and restaurants, in addition to Booths 
supermarket. Tourists and day visitors remain important to the local economy.

land also allocated at Land North of Kendal Road. The current Local Plan 
strategy directs 13% of all new housing to the three Key Service Centres in the 
district, including Kirkby Lonsdale. The town has had 188 new homes built 
since 2003, reflecting the growing strength of the local housing market. 33 
affordable homes have been completed since 2010.

Table 14: SWOT analysis - Kirkby Lonsdale  
  Have we identified all the relevant strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities an d threats  for Kirkby Lonsdale?  
4.3.5.6  The map below includes a number of key features, constraints, opportunities 
and issues relating to the current and possible future development in Kirkby 
Lonsdale. It is a snapshot of Kirkby Lonsdale now, and includes sites currently 
allocated for developme nt but not yet completed.

Figure 17: Kirkby Lonsdale Map Key  
  Have we identified the correct features or issues on the 
map? Are there additional features or issues that should be included?  
What are the Poli cy Options or Approaches?   
4.3.5.7  The current Local Plan has helped deliver quite a lot of extra homes (and 
affordable homes) in Kirkby Lonsdale in recent years. Indeed it has seen the 
highest proportion of allocated housing sites developed of any town in the 
district, reflecting the strength of the local housing market. The site North of 
Kendal Road provides a good supply in the short term. But with no other sites 
allocated, how much additional housing development should be provided to 
meet needs to 2040? The ma p above illustrates that there are some important 
limits to the town’s expansion, including the extended boundary of the 
Yorkshire Dales National Park, the town’s landscape setting, notably prominent 
drumlin features and potentially the A65 to the south. T he town also has a 
limited supply of land for local business and employment and some additional 
provision may be appropriate.   
4.3.5.8  We set out these and other factors below which we think are important for good 
long-term planning of Kirkby Lonsdale to 2040 , and welcome your views on 
these and any other ideas you may have.  
Policy Approaches 3.5: Principles and Initiatives for good planning in 
Kirkby Lonsdale to 2040:  
 Some additional land for housing will support additional development 
in Kirkby Lonsdale to 2040.  This will help meet housing (and 
affordable housing) need and build on the town’s strengths as a key 
service centre, serving the wider rural area. It will potentially also 
help support and widen the town’s offer in terms of community 
  
102 
 
facilities, informal recreation, and local services and facilities 
including health care, education, and food and drink.  
 A review of land allocated for business and employment to meet 
needs for local businesses to grow and provide more local 
employment opportunities.  
 More emph asis on small scale development which is sensitively 
located and designed in a way which protects and enhances the 
town’s distinctive character and landscape setting.  
 A continuing emphasis on brownfield and ‘windfall’ opportunities for 
development within the built -up area, including within and on the 
edge of the town centre. This also includes the reuse of any 
underused sites and supporting housing development where it can 
support the vitality and viability of the town centre.  
 Support the development of op portunities for improving walking and 
cycling networks, linking key facilities, green spaces and new 
developments.  
 Support for public realm enhancements, particularly within the 
Conservation Area.  
 Which of these policy approaches for the good planning of 
Kirkby Lonsdale to 2040 do you support and why? Please give your 
reasons, noting the relevant reference number, and add any other 
comments or alternative suggestions.  
Kirkby Lonsdale Town Centre   
 What do you think the role of the town centre should be and 
how should its role develop in response to trends and challenges such as 
on-line retailing? For example, if there are less shops in future, should 
housing and other non -retail uses such as leisure , food and drink be 
encouraged? (See also section 4.6.6 ) 
Open Spaces  
  Have we identified the right open spaces that need 
protecting in Kirkby Lonsdale on the Policies Map ? Can you suggest 
others? Do some open spaces also merit designation as Local Green 
Spaces? (See section 4.4.5 ) Please show clearly on a map any open 
spaces or Local Green Spaces you propose.  
Green Infrastructure, Cycling and Walking  
 How can we complete any gaps in the green infrastructure 
network and cycling and walking networks in Kirkby Lonsdale? (See   
103 
 
section   4.4.5 ) Please suggest potential links between green spaces and 
also within cycling and walking networks .  
Development Boundary  
 Should the development boundary  for Kirkby Lonsdale as 
shown on the policies map be changed ? (See section 4.2.4 ) Please show 
on a map any changes you propose.  
Settlement Services and Facilities  
 Have we correctly identified the services and facilities in the 
Settlement Services and Accessibility Assessment document? ( See 
section 4.2.2 )  
Directions of Growth  
4.3.5.9  The Local Plan Review provides opportunity to consider the amount and 
location of housing and employment development that should be provided for 
through the allocation of sites in the Local Plan. We therefore invite your views 
on how much growth is appropriate in Kirkby Lonsdale and on possible 
‘directions for growth ’ of the town,  as set out in the policy options table 3.5 an d 
accompanying map below.  
4.3.5.10  The map below indicates possible indicative ‘directions of growth’ taking 
account of the constraints and opportunities identified in the map above and the 
SWOT analysis, as well as suggested site allocations arising from the Call  for 
Sites.  
Policy Options 3.5: Potential Directions of Growth for Kirkby Lonsdale   
Please consider the following options for the broad location of new 
housing and employment development in and near Kirkby Lonsdale  
PO3.5/i:  North of Kirkby Lonsdale, to the west a nd/or east of the B6584  
PO3.5/ii:  West of Kirkby Lonsdale  
PO3.5/iii:  South of Kirkby Lonsdale, south of the A65    
104

 Which of these policy options for possible directions of 
growth for Kirkby Lonsdale do you support  and why? Please give your 
reasons, noting the reference number, and any other comments or 
alternative suggestions.  
4.3.5.11  So far there have been a number of sites suggested for allocation for 
development in the ‘ Call for Sites’  in summer 2020. As part of this 
consultation, you can comment on sites already submitted and also suggest 
other sites which may be suitable for allocation in the Local Plan f or housing or 
business development. For more information and opportunity  to comment, 
please see section  4.2.6  in Theme 2 and questions 20 and 21.

 Policies for Our Local Service Centres  
What are the issues?  
4.3.6.1  Our current Local Service Centres act as locations which provide a more limited 
but important range of service s (including primary schools, a local shop, and 
public transport provision) serving the needs of the local population and nearby 
rural communities. Current Local Plan policies support some new development 
including housing of an appropriate scale within th ese centres to ensure they 
remain viable and sustainable communities.  
4.3.6.2  Each Local Service Centre has its own unique characteristics and qualities as 
well as issues based on a range of factors including:  
 Physical attributes – locational position, landscape,  topographical 
features  
 Historic and Cultural Environment (for example Conservation Area 
designation)  
 Provision of services and facilities (including shops, community, 
recreational, health, education, public transport, employment and 
open space), includin g proximity to nearby larger service centres  
 Infrastructure provision (including access to roads, walking/cycling 
and sewerage infrastructure)  
 Flood Risk (tidal, river and surface water)  
 Planned Development (sites allocated in current Local Plan and 
permit ted development  not yet developed)  
4.3.6.3  In this section, we provide a brief description of each local service centre 
including an indication of what development has taken place in the last 10 
years or so and current issues affecting each place.  A map is incl uded which 
illustrates a number of features and characteristics of the village, including 
services, facilities, open spaces and planned development. Arnside and 
Sandside/Storth are not included, as policies for these places will be reviewed 
separately as p art of future review of the Arnside and Silverdale AONB DPD.  
4.3.6.4  To help assist you  with responding to the questions below, please refer to the 
sections of the Issues and Options Report as follows :  
 Settlement / Place  Hierarchy  
 Settlement Development Boundaries  
 Green Gaps  
 Identifying Suitable Housing and Employment Sites  
 Green and Blue Infrastructure, Open Space and Recreation

 Allithwaite  
Context  
4.3.7.1  Allithwaite is a village of approximately 1,06448 people  located close to Grange -
over-Sands. It has a range of services and facilities includin g a post office and 
general store, primary school, community centre, public houses, and local 
recreational facilities in the form of playing fields and play area. It is served by 
limited local bus services to Grange -over-Sands, Cartmel and Kendal. The Bay 
Cycleway and Walney to Wear & Whitby cycle routes run through parts of the 
village. 28 homes  have been built in the village in the last 10 years, including 
development on part of the North of Jack Hill housing allocation site. The Land 
South of Green Lane allocation site is currently under construction for 23 
houses, and an application has recently been submitted for 37 dwellings on 
Land to the rear of Barn Hey housing allocation site.  
Current Issues / Future Opportunities  
4.3.7.2  Issues for consideration include the village’s distinctive built form and the 
contribution green space plays in shaping this. The distinctive character and 
identity of the village is aided by the designation of a green gap  between Kents 
Bank and the southern part of the village to prevent merging  of the two 
communities. The local plan allocates sites at the rea r of Almond Bank and at 
Land at the rear of Bankfield for housing development. The latter site is no 
longer available and is not shown on the map below. A Neighbourhood Plan for 
Allithwaite and Cartmel is progressing to  draft plan stage. The Local Plan 
Review must take into account the aspirations set out in the Plan and ensure 
there is no conflict in this respect.

 Have we captured in the map and text above the main issues 
that need to be considered when thinking about the  future of Allithwaite , 
should there be any changes ? 
4.3.7.3   In answering the above, please consider giving your views on the following:  
 Development Boundary  for Allithwaite  (see section  4.2.4  and 
questions 1 6 and 1 7) 
 Green gap  between Allithwaite and Kents Bank  (see section 4.2.5  
and questions 1 8 and 1 9) 
 Open spaces  important to your community  (see section 4.4.5  and 
questions 110 and 111) 
 Facilities  identified in the Settlement Services and Facilities 
document  (see section 4.2.2  and question 1 3) 
 How do you see Allithwaite changing by 2040? Do you think 
there will be a need for new homes in Allithwaite over this period? If so 
what sort of homes are needed and where do you think (broadly) they 
could be built?  
4.3.7.4  So far there have been a number of sites in Allithwaite suggested for allocation 
for development in the ‘Call for Sites’  in summer 2020.  As part of this 
consultation, you can comment on sites already submitted  and also suggest 
other sites which may be suitable for allocation in the Local Plan for housing or 
business development. For more information and opportunit y to comment

 Broughton – in – Furness  
Context  
4.3.8.1  Broughton -in-Furness is a historic village with a population of approximately 
469, set around a village square and conservation ar ea. It is located mostly 
within the Lake District National Park. A small part of the village is within the 
South Lakeland Local Plan area, to the east of the village primarily along 
Foxfield Road and High Kepplewray. Services and facilities include a villa ge 
convenience shop, the Square Café, a post office and newsagent, primary 
school, community centre (Victory Hall), medical practice and three public 
houses.  
4.3.8.2  The village has recreational facilities including a recreation ground, tennis club 
and a school p laying field. There is also an allotment field. A key employer 
based within the village and on sites elsewhere locally is CGP, an educational 
publishing company. Broughton -in-Furness is not served by a public bus 
service and the nearest train station is so me distance away at Foxfield.    
109 
 
4.3.8.3  There has been no new build housing development completions in the South 
Lakeland Local Plan area of the village within the past 10 years.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.8.4  Broadband provision is relatively poor as is in  general terms the mobile phone 
signal. Since 2010 the village has lost the bank and there is also no 24 hour 
cash machine. A key constraint is the loss of the public bus service. The lack of 
public car parking provision has been a relatively longstanding concern within 
the village.  
4.3.8.5  Although most of the area at risk from flooding lies south of the village within 
the Lake District National Park Local Plan area, there is some risk of flooding 
on land to the east of Foxfield Road in -between Occupation Lane an d Foxfield 
Road.  
4.3.8.6  We also need to ensure that development does not adversely impact on the 
setting and landscape quality of the National Park, a World Heritage Site. Part 
of the village is also within a conservation area, designated for its heritage 
value.  Any new development within the South Lakeland Local Plan area should 
not harm its setting.   
4.3.8.7  The South Lakeland Local Plan allocates land located east of Foxfield Road for 
housing and further south along Foxfield Road for local employment uses. 
Neither si te has  been developed for the purposes allocated.

 Burneside  
Context  
4.3.9.1  Burneside is a village of approximately 1,063 people , located about a mile to 
the north west of Kendal, within the River Kent valley. It has a range of services 
and facilities including a village shop, public house, primary school, community 
centre and recreational facilities (cricket, bowling green, football and tennis). It 
is served by local bus services to Kendal town centre, and the Lakes Line 
Railway (Windermere – Oxenholme via Kendal). It lies on The Dales Way long 
distance footpath and National Cycle Route 6.  It includes the district’s largest 
employer James Cropper PLC Paper Mill.  There has been very limited 
development in the village in the last 10 years – just 3 dwellings.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.9.2  Despite being close to the main A591 highway,  road access links into the 
village are via narrow country roads, which is a particular issue for large HGV 
vehicles wishing to access the paper mill. Large parts of the village are at risk   
112 
 
of flooding from the River Kent and there are historic sewerage in frastructure 
issues that we understand are currently being addressed by United Utilities.  
4.3.9.3  The Local Plan allocates land at Hall Park and on the Willink Field for housing 
development, along with a site for recreational facilities to compensate for the 
loss of the existing tennis courts  and football pitch. A Neighbourhood Plan is 
currently being prepared for the Parish, and is at an early stage. The future 
growth of Kendal needs to be considered in context of potential impacts on 
Burneside including the optio ns for a Kendal Northern Access Route. Burneside 
is currently separated from Kendal by a designated green gap to retain 
distinctive identity and prevent both communities merging .

 Burton -in-Kendal  
Contex t  
4.3.10.1  Burton -in-Kendal is a historic village of approximately 1,384 people , located 
between Kendal and Lancaster. It has a range of services and facilities 
including a village store, post office, GP  surgery, public house, primary school 
and recreational facilities (play area and playing fields). It is served by the 555 
bus service providing links to Kendal, Milnthorpe, Carnforth and Lancaster. The 
Clawthorpe Hall Business Centre and Dalton Hall Busin ess Centre are located 
close to the village. The historic village core has a large number of listed 
buildings and is a Conservation Area. 24 dwellings have been built in the village 
in the last 10 years, including development at the East of Hutton Close ho using 
allocation site. Planning permission has recently been granted for 28 affordable 
houses on the East of Boon Town housing allocation site.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.10.2  Key issues for consideration include the need to protect the village’s her itage 
assets. The Conservation Area has been added to Historic England’s ‘heritage   
115 
 
at risk’ register and a Partnership Scheme in Conservation Areas (PSiCA) has 
been designated and funded by Historic England, the District Council, Parish 
Council and others to enhance the public realm in the Square and grant aid the 
repair of listed buildings. The A6070 runs through the centre of the village and 
this has an impact on pedestrian accessibility due to its narrowness and 
restricted pavements. It also introduces n oise and other issues associated with 
the volume of vehicular traffic. Background noise from the nearby M6 is also an 
issue for local amenity.  
4.3.10.3  The Local Plan allocates a mixed use employment / housing site at Green 
Dragon Farm, and a Development Brief has  been adopted for the site. 
Localised drainage issues need to be taken into account in considering future 
development opportunities in the village.

 Cartmel  
Context  
4.3.11.1  Cartmel is a historic village of approximately 840  people . It has a range of 
services and facilities including a post office, GP surgery, convenience store, 
public houses, village hall, primary school  and Cartmel Priory secondary school 
which serves the wider Cartmel peninsula area. There are a range of 
recreational facilities including  a play area, cricket pitch and tennis courts as 
well as the Cartmel Racecourse which is a major visitor attraction. T he village 
has a number of high quality restaurants and speciality food stores which 
increases its draw to tourists and visitors along with the 12th century Cartmel 
Priory.  It is served by limited local bus services to Grange -over-Sands, Cartmel 
and Kenda l. The Walney to Wear & Whitby cycle route run s through the village. 
6 dwellings have been built in the village in the last 10 years. The Land South 
of Haggs Lane allocation site is approved for 39 dwellings subject to the signing 
of a S106 agreement.   
    
118 
 
Current Issues / fu ture opportunities  
4.3.11.2  Key issues for consideration include the need to protect the village’s heritage 
assets, including its many listed buildings . A large part of the village is inside 
the Conservation Area. A large part of the village is e xposed to flood risk from 
the river Eea and is located in a relatively low lying position on flat land. Many 
of the roads in the village centre are narrow with limited opportunity for 
pavements . Traffic associated with the racecourse and accessing other 
facilities can cause locali sed access and parking problems in this respect.  
4.3.11.3  The Local Plan allocates a site at the racecourse for residential development.  
A Neighbourhood Plan for Allithwaite and Cartmel is progressing to  draft plan 
stage . The Local Plan R eview must take into account the aspirations set out in 
the Neighbourhood Plan and ensure there is no conflict in this respect.

 Endmoor  
Context  
4.3.12.1  Endmoor is a village of approximately 636  people , located s outh east of 
Kendal. It is located in rolling countryside on a shelf that falls abruptly to the 
valley of Peasey Beck. It has a bakery, primary school, village hall as well as a 
social club. Recreational facilities include a playing field, play area, tenni s 
courts and bowling green. It is served by the Kendal to Kirkby Lonsdale bus 
service, and has good links with the strategic road network via the A65 being 
about 2 miles from Junction 36 of the M6. Gatebeck and the Summerlands 
Industrial Estate are located  close to the village.  
4.3.12.2  There has been very limited housing development in the village in the last 10 
years (2 dwellings). However, the local plan allocation site North of Sycamore 
Close is currently under construction for 106 houses. Part of the local pla n 
North of Gatebeck Lane employment site has permission for a 2 storey 
industrial building. Land to the east of the site has full and outline permission for 
an employment business park (B2 and B8 uses). Upgrades have been made to 
the local sewerage works.  
   
121 
 
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.12.3  Pedestrian a ccess into and through the village is constrained in places on 
account  of lack of pavements . This is a particular issue for people accessing 
the village from surrounding areas including Gatebeck Lane which  is used by  
HGV vehicles. There are locali sed flood risk issues in parts of the village 
especially close to Peasey Beck. Access to nearby  local facilities by public 
transport is variable (for example there is no direct bus link to facilities in 
Milnthorpe) . The Local Plan allocates land at South of Bowling Green for 
housing development.

 Flookburgh/Cark  
Context  
4.3.13.1  Flookburgh/Cark are grouped villages with a population of approximately 1,304 , 
located in the southern part of the Cartmel Peninsula. Facilities include 
convenience stores, post office, GP surgery, village halls, public house, primary  
school and a range of recreational facilities including playing fields, play areas 
and bowling green. There is a railway station at Cark on the Furness Line 
providing services to Grange -over-Sands, Lancaster, Ulverston and Barrow -in-
Furness. There is a li mited bus service providing links to Cartmel and Kendal. 
The Bay cycleway runs through Cark and Flookburgh. 21 houses have been 
built in the villages since 2010.   
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.13.2  Parts of Cark and the area between Cark and Flookburgh  is affected by flood 
risk from Mill Race, and southern parts of Flookburgh are on the edge of the 
coastal flood plain. The communities are accessed by B classified and minor 
country roads  and access to the main road network is more restricted 
compared to some other Local Service Centres  in the plan area . There is a   
124 
 
need to retain the distinctive character of the two villages, and this is currently 
aided by the designation of a green gap . The Local Plan allocates three sites 
for residential development at East of Winder Lane, East of Manorside and 
North of Allithwaite Road.

 Great / Little Urswick  
Context  
4.3.14.1  Great/Little Urswick ar e grouped villages with a population of approximately 
745, located a few miles south of Ulverston. Great Urswick is focused around 
the tarn within a shallow valley. Birkrigg Common with public access lies to the 
east. There are prehistoric remains north an d west of the villages including a 
fort, settlement and burial chamber.   
4.3.14.2  There is no shop or post office in Great/Little Urswick and currently one 
operating public house. The Low Furness Primary school is located south of the 
grade 1 listed parish church i n between the two settlements as is the recreation 
hall. The school has an outdoor community playing field and sports pitches. A 
play area is located in  between the parish church and the school.  
4.3.14.3  There are no existing employment opportunities or obvious main employers 
within the villages themselves. Employment opportunities in the vicinity include   
127 
 
Stainton Quarry and a small industrial estate located some miles away near to 
Bardsea.  
4.3.14.4  New build hous ing development has been small in terms of numbers. Since 
2010 six housing units in total have been completed in the Great/Little Urswick 
villages.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.14.5  A key issue  is the sustainability of the villages given the loss of s ervices since 
2010. There is no public transport in the form of a bus service and the nearest 
train stations are in Ulverston followed by Dalton -in-Furness.  
4.3.14.6  Mapping shows flooding risk, including surface water, in Great Urswick both 
around the tarn and to  the west in the Kirk Flatt area and south near to Urswick 
Beck. The existing identified Local Plan Urswick Green Gap area, located in  
between the two villages , also includes areas prone to surface water flooding. 
Other constraints include limestone paveme nts and outcrops in the vicinity of 
the villages. It’s understood that there are potential geological Marl deposits 
around Great Urswick Tarn. Given past finds in the locality, there may also be 
potential for archaeolog ical remains .  
4.3.14.7  The existing Local Pla n allocates land for housing at Mid -Town Farm, Little 
Urswick. There has not been a planning application on this site. The Local Plan 
also allocates land for community use to meet open space and recreation 
needs near to the existing recreation hall on Chur ch Road. This allocation has 
not been implemented. The current L ocal Plan identifies a green gap  which 
separates the two villages to retain the villages’ distinctive identit ies and 
prevent them merging .

 Greenodd / Penny Bridge  
Context  
4.3.15.1  Greenodd  and Penny Bridge are grouped villages with a population of 
approximately 468. The villages are close to the Lake Di strict National Park and 
occupy a steep hillside with the lower part adjoining the River Crake. 
Greenodd/Penny Bridge has good transport links and it has a primary school.  It 
is located off the A590 road linking Barrow in Furness and Ulverston with 
Kendal  and the M6 motorway. The A5092 provides road links to the western 
Lake District and towards Coniston. Employment premises and employers in 
Greenodd include Armer’s agricultural engineers and related retail together with 
several business on the Crakeside B usiness Park and the Crakeside Works 
premises.  
4.3.15.2  In terms of services and facilities Greenodd/Penny  Bridge has a convenience 
shop and part time post office. It also benefits from a range of built community 
facilities including the church, village hall and t wo public houses. There is no 
doctor’s surgery. Outdoor community facilities include the Crake Valley Croquet   
130 
 
Club and the Penny Bridge primary school’s sports field. There is no village 
public children’s play area.  
4.3.15.3  Greenodd/Penny Bridge has a relatively good public bus service. It is on three 
bus service routes: Windermere to Barrow -in-Furness – 6; Coniston to 
Ulverston – X12; and Kendal to Barrow -in-Furness – X6. The villages are also 
on the routes of the Walney to Wear and Whitby (W2W) and The Bay 
cycle ways.  
4.3.15.4  There has been no completed new build housing development in the villages 
since 2010.  
Current Issues / future o pportunities  
4.3.15.5  Development will need to avoid the lower lying land around the River Crake 
near to Greenodd/Penny Bridge, which is at risk fr om flooding. Protecting 
landscape quality is a consideration as the villages are relatively close to the 
National Park boundary.  On the valley sides the land in parts is more steeply 
sloping land which acts as a constraint to development.   
4.3.15.6  Land at the Ol d Vicarage is allocated in the current Local Plan for housing. 
There has not been a  planning application submitted on the site  to date .

close to the village. 20 houses have been built in the village in the last 10 years. 
The allocation site at Elmsfield Park just to the north of the village has 
permission for the erection of B2 and B8 employment uses.  
Current Iss ues / future opportunities  
4.3.16.2  Issues for consideration include maintaining road safety through the village, 
enhancing the provision of informal recreation opportunities in the village. The 
Local Plan allocates land at East of Milnthorpe Road for housing devel opment 
as well as additional informal open space. A development brief has been 
adopted for this site. The site West of Burton Road is allocated for residential 
development and Land at Milnthorpe Road for employment development.

 Kirkby -in-Furness  
Context  
4.3.17.1  Kirkby -in-Furness is a village with a population of approximately 921, located 
next to the Duddon estuary and set against the backdrop, to the east, of Kirkby 
Moor. Kirkby -in-Furness has a primary school. There’s also a convenience 
store and post office and a doctor’s surgery. A range of community facilities can 
be accessed, including a village community centre, the Beckside Rooms and 
the listed St. Cuthbert’s Church. There ’s a public house at The Ship Inn, Askew 
Gate Brow. Outdoor community facilities include the Kirkby Bowls Club, the 
Community Centre Recreation Ground and sports pitches. A key employer in 
the vicinity of the village is Burlington Slate Quarry.  
4.3.17.2  The villag e is on a bus route (Kirkby -in-Furness to Barrow/Ulverston - X7), 
although the service is relatively limited in frequency. There’s a train station on 
the Cumbrian Coast line at Sandside which serves the village allowing travel 
between Carlisle and Barrow -in-Furness. This connects with the Furness line at 
Barrow -in-Furness.  
4.3.17.3  The existing Local Plan allocates two sites for housing in the village; one at 
Four Lane Ends and the other site which is adjacent to the Burlington Primary   
135 
 
School. The latter site has planning consent for housing for 46 dwellings. There 
has also been planning permission granted in the past ten years for 3 dwellings 
on unallocated site s. 
4.3.17.4  Since 2010 there have been 3 completed dwellings within the village.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.17.5  The village is located on the main A595 which links the west coast of Cumbria 
with Barrow -in-Furness. Improvements to infrastructure due to be carried out in 
the local area includes Cumbria County Council’s planned A595 road 
improvements betw een Grizebeck and Chapels. Flooding is a risk to 
development along the coastline at Sandside. There is also a risk of flooding 
along the beck between Beckside and Soutergate. A high voltage overhead 
electricity line passes relatively close to the village.

Walney to Wear & Whitby cycle ways  run through the village. 62 dwellings have 
been built in the village in the last 10 years, including development on the East 
of Greengate Crescent site allocation which is now complete.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
Key issues for considera tion is the village’s proximity to the Lake District National 
Park and the need to ensure the Park’s setting is not compromised by new 
development. Careful attention is also required in respect to potential flood risk 
in the village given the village’s loc ation next to the Lyth Valley flood plain. 
Access into the village is via minor country roads particularly to the north. Local   
138 
 
issues of concern to consider further include on -street parking and adequacy of 
foul sewerage and water supply. Plans are being d eveloped for a new village 
hall.

giving access to: Croftlands in Ulverston and to Barrow; to Wi ndermere; and it 
is on the regular bus service from Kendal to Barrow and vice versa. 
Swarthmoor is also on the route of the south to north Ulverston service. There 
is no rail station.    
147 
 
4.3.21.3  The existing Local Plan allocates land at Swarthmoor (Cross -a-Moor) for  
housing. The site is also subject of an adopted development brief. There has 
been only one new dwelling completed since 2010.  
Current Issues / future opportunities  
4.3.21.4  Swarthmoor is currently separated from south west Ulverston by a Local Plan 
green gap  designation which seeks to prevent Swarthmo or merging with 
Ulverston. Swarthmoor Hall is a grade II* listed her itage asset that is located to 
the north of the village within the green gap.  
4.3.21.5  Funding has been obtained through a range of sources towards the provision of 
a roundabout at Cross -a-Moor which will open up access to planned housing 
development at Croftlands  and Swarthmoor as identified in the current Local 
Plan.  
4.3.21.6  There are ‘pockets’ of areas with known surface water flooding in the area 
south of Swarthmoor. Historic mining in the area may be a constraint to 
development .

 Have we captured in the map and text above the main issues 
that need to be considered when thinking about the future of Swarthmoor , 
should there be any changes ? 
4.3.21.7  In answering the above, please consider giving your views on the following:  
 Development Boundary  for Swarthmoor  (see section 4.2.4  and 
questions 1 6 and 1 7) 
 Green gap  between Swarthmoor and Ulverston  (see section 4.2.5  
and questions 1 8 and 1 9) 
 Open spaces  important to your co mmunity  (see section 4.4.5  and 
questions 110 and 111) 
 Facilities  identified in the Settlement Services and Facilities 
document  (see section 4.2.2  and question 1 3) 
How do you see Swarthmoor changing by 2040? Do you 
think there will be a need for new homes in Swarthmoor over this period? 
Is what sorts of homes are needed and where do you think (broadly) they 
could be built?  
4.3.21.8  So far there have been a number of sites in Swarthmoor suggested for 
allocation for development in the ‘Call for Sites’  in summer 2020. As part of 
this consultation, you can comment on sites already  submitted  and also 
suggest other sites which may be suita ble for allocation in the Local Plan for 
housing or business development. For more information and opportunity to 
comment, please see section 4.2.6  and questions 20 and 21 in Theme 2.

 Policies for Our Rural Area s 
Overview  
4.3.22.1  Large parts of South Lakeland comprise locations outside of the service 
centres, including small villages, hamlets, farmsteads and open countryside. 
Our rural areas are living and working environments  and have unique 
environmental qualities , supporting wildlife . They are places for leisure and 
recreation supporting the tourism industry, and they support agricul tural and 
forestry enterprises. In these locations we need to achieve  a careful balance in 
supporting appropriate forms of development th at supports  the economic and 
social sustainability of rural areas , whilst ensuring any consequences do not 
cause harm to the environment (for example impacts on landscape quality and 
character).  
4.3.22.2  Sustainable travel  to facilities and services is more limited in rural areas and 
there is a reliance on us ing the private car. Infrastructure provision may not be 
of a standard or quality to support new forms of development. Our rural areas 
may come under increasing pressur e for specific types of development in 
response to changing circumstances caused by Brexit and changes in the 
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Agricultural and other land -based rural 
businesses such as food production may need to become more economically 
resilient, and this may result in demand for increased diversification. Our ability 
to respond effectively to the climate crisis may result in demands for increased 
renewable energy development, greener economic development, and 
landscape/nature recovery r elated development in rural areas. The 
attractiveness of our rural areas for recreation and tourism  may result in 
increased demand for tourism related development. The move to increased 
homeworking may result in more demand for home -based employment 
develo pment and need for improvements to infrastructure. Our rural 
communities may also require additional social and community development to 
ensure their continued vitality and viability.   
4.3.22.3  Community consultation feedback has suggested more small scale rural 
economic development and sustainable tourism development would be 
beneficial in rural areas. Other feedback has suggested  that the re -use of 
redundant buildings in rural areas for other uses should be supported. 
Concerns have also been raised that the distr ict may come under pressure for 
more caravan and lodge parks development. The following types of 
development were listed as those which require a rural location:  
 Local food manufacturi ng 
 Riding stables  
 Small agricultural businesses  
 Tourist facilities    
151 
 
 Wide range of business units to accommodate local needs 
 Live/work units 
 Agri-forestry and land restoration development 
 Solar and other renewable energy development 
 Sensitive farm diversification development 
4.3.22.4  The Local Plan contains a number of policies of specific relevance to the rural 
areas as follows: 
 Policy DM13 – Housing Development in Small Villages and Hamlets 
outside of the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. This policy allows for 
housing development provided it meets a set of criteria as set out in 
Policy DM13 . This supports development in these locations helping to 
meet local needs whilst preserving their characteristics.  
 Policy CS7.4 Rural economy – covered in this chapter 
 Policy CS7.6 Tourism Development 
 Policy DM14 Rural Exception Sites – covered in this chapter 
 Policy DM16 Conversion of Buildings in Rural Areas – covered in this 
chapter  
 Policy DM18 Tourist Accommodation – caravans, chalets, log cabins, 
camping and new purpose built self-catering accommodation – 
covered in this chapter 
 Rural Economy – (all types of rural economic related development 
including tourist and leisure related)  
What are the issues? 
4.3.23.1  Core Strategy Policy CS7.4 supports in principle development in rural areas 
that helps to meet economic needs of rural communities, subject to several 
criteria. National planning policy supports proposals in rural areas that enable 
the sustainable growth and expansion of all types of business in rural areas 
including through conversion of existing buildings and well-designed new 
buildings. Both current local plan policy and national policy encourage the 
diversification of the agricultural economy; the latter also extends to cover other 
land-based rural businesses. National planning policy specifies planning 
policies and decisions should recogni se that sites to meet local business and 
community needs in rural areas may have to be found adjacent to or beyond 
existing settlements, and in locations not well served by public transport.  
4.3.23.2  National planning policy supports sustainable rural tourism and leisure 
development which respects  the character of the countryside. Local Plan Policy 
CS7.6 supports the creation, enhancement and expansion of tourist attractions 
and tourism infrastructure in accordance with the development s trategy and 
sustainable development principles set out in Core Strategy Policy CS1.1. The   
152 
 
current Local Plan places an emphasis on the need to support high value -
added tourism that improves the quality of existing visitor accommodation , and 
the need to broaden the range of accommodation  provided.  
4.3.23.3  We recogni se there will likely be further demands for tourism related visitor 
accommodation  – including pressure for new caravan  or chalet development , or 
extensions  or intensification of existing sites , to help sustain existing 
businesses or s upport diversification of agricultural and rural businesses. Local 
Plan Policy DM18 restricts new caravan and camping sites to locations within 
or on the edge of the service centres , unless it supports the diversification of 
agricultural or other land -base d rural businesses where other locations may be 
considered appropriate. Proposals for intensification or extension of existing 
caravan or camping sites must meet a range of policy criteria.  
4.3.23.4  The key issue is whether the Council should be more flexible in it s approach to 
considering rural economic related development in all its forms. To what extent 
should we support rural economic related development that does not require a 
rural based location or relate to an existing land -based rural enterprise.   
What are  the Policy Options and Approaches?  
4.3.23.5  We can choose to either  keep the  current policy, or adopt a more flexible 
approach as appropriate in recognition of the need to support the wider rural 
economy in light of changing economic circumstances.   
Policy Options 3.23: Rural Economy  
PO3.23/i:  Retain current policy approach  (policies CS7.4, CS7.6 and DM18)  
for business and tourism development in the countryside  
Retain current policy in relation to the rural economy and tourist related 
accommodation in rural ar eas with non -substantive updates   
PO3.23/ii: Greater flexibility for business and tourism development in rural 
areas  
Adopt a new policy approach which allows for greater flexibility for new rural 
economic related development and tourist related accommodation developm ent 
in rural areas depending on the nature of use  
Which of these policy options for the rural economy do you 
support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Other Issues and Additi onal Policy Approaches  
Conversion of buildings in the open countryside    
153 
 
4.3.24.1  The re -use/conversion of buildings in rural areas is a sustainable approach to 
development and is encouraged in national planning p olicy.  Current Local Plan 
Policy DM16 allows for conv ersion and re -use of traditional buildings in rural 
areas for housing, employment, tourism, recreation and community uses 
subject to meeting a set of policy criteria. Proposals for isolated new homes in 
the countryside should be avoided unless circumstance s set out in national 
planning p olicy (paragraph 79) apply . This includes development that would re -
use redundant or disused buildings and enhance its immediate setting. We are 
proposing to  retain the current policy and amend/update it as appropriate , for 
example to provide a clearer definition of what constitutes a traditional building.  
Rural Exception Sites49 
4.3.24.2  Housing in rural areas should be located where it will enhance or maintain the 
vitality of rural communities. There is a need to be responsive to local 
circumstances and support housing developments that reflect local needs. One 
means to achieve this is to  allow development in locations which would not 
normally be used for housing on account of being contrary to general housing 
development policy. In South Lakeland this means sites in the open countryside 
outside of our service centres, and sites that are n ot within or on the edge of 
our smaller villages and hamlets.  National planning policy allows for rural 
exception sites, which  are small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity . 
A proportion of market homes may be allowed on the se sites at the loca l 
planning authority’s discretion. Current Local Plan Policy DM14 supports the 
provision of rural exception sites subject to meeting a set of policy criteria. This 
criteria includes allowing a small element of open market housing in exceptional 
circumstanc es subject to clear evidence on viability. We are proposing  to retain 
the current policy and amend/update it as appropriate.  
Policy Approaches 3.24: Additional policy approaches for Rural Areas  
 Retain current Policy (DM16) relating to conversion of traditional 
buildings and update/amend as appropriate, including a clear 
definition of ‘traditional’.   
 Retain current Policy (DM14) relating to rural exceptions sites and 
update/amend as appropriate

support  and why ? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
numbers, and any other comments or alternative suggestions .

4.4 Theme  4: Healthy People and Communities  
Objective 4: To ensure that new development and open spaces 
support the health and wellbeing of communities and 
encourage active and healthy lifestyles  
 Key Issue: General Principles of Healthy Places  
What is the Issue?  
4.4.1.1  New development should  support the health and wellbeing of people  by 
enabling healthi er lifestyles. It can do this by creating environments and places 
that address health ine qualities and meet the needs of all enabling people to 
lead healthy lives. Access to quality housing, and outside/  green space  
amongst many other things play a significant role in enabling people to do so.  
4.4.1.2  We have an increasingly ageing population , which poses challenges in terms of 
health and services provision.  2018 population estimates show that 28% of the 
district’s populatio n is aged over 65, compared with 18% nationally. By 2039 
there will be around an extra 10,000 people aged over 65 living in South 
Lakeland (an increase to 37% of the total population). Conversely the working 
age population is projected to significantly dec rease  (by 9,200  in the period 
2016 -2036).  The prevalence of disability and mobility increases with age, and 
POPPI50 projections point to significant rises in the number and proportion of 
South Lakeland’s population that will live with mobility problems and dementia 
in the future.

155 
 
4.4.1.3  In terms of deprivation, the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation ranked South 
Lakeland as  the 250th most deprived local authority area (out of a total of 317), 
and the 2015 IMD ranked it 258th (out of a total of 326). Whilst the area can be 
considered a relatively less deprived area at a national level, there are small 
areas with concentration s of deprivation and some parts of Kendal and 
Ulverston fall within the 40% most deprived areas in the country. Economic 
disadvantage, and poverty along with factors attributed to poor indoor living 
environments (such as large proportion of older housing s tock, lack of central 
heating ) have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of certain sectors 
of the population.  
4.4.1.4  The prevalence of childhood obesity is a National issue; whilst levels in South 
Lakeland are below national benchmarks, 14.3% childr en at Year 6 age were 
classed as obese51. There is a need to ensure our built and natural 
environments enables opportunities for physical activity, and access to 
healthier food choices.  
4.4.1.5  Another key issue is safety on our roads, South Lakeland fares significantly 
worse than average in terms of the number of people killed or seriously injured 
on roads compared to many other localities. Improving road safety, and the 
creation of pedestrian and cyclist friendly environments should be key 
objectives under pinning Local Plan policy.  Theme 7 covers greener travel and 
options around how we can ensure new development continues to support 
travel by pedestrian and cycling.  
4.4.1.6  At a strategic level the Council is committed to supporting the delivery of the 
Cumbria Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2019 -202952 and the  Cumbria 
Joint Public Health Strategy53 . Planning decisions have an important role to 
play in helping to contribute to the delivery of the strategies.  The strategies 
seek  to: 
 Tackle low levels of physical activity  
 Improve access to healthy food  (Cumbria Healthy Weight Declarati on) 
 Improve access to clean air, addressing pollution and provision of 
quality green space  
 Promote active travel and sustainable transport  
 Promote social interaction and safe environments  
 Respond to the effects of the climate crisis  
 Raise standards of liv ing – adapting to people’s needs  
 Create places that support all needs

 Improve access to education and training  
 Address income inequalities  and poverty  
 Provide access to quality health facilities  
 Support access to green space  
4.4.1.7  National Planning Policy Guidan ce specifies a Health Impact A ssessment (HIA) 
is a useful tool to use where planning applications may be expected to have 
significant i mpacts on health and wellbeing. The HIA is used to identify the 
health impacts of a plan or project and to develop recomm endations to 
maximi se the positive impacts and minimi se the negative impacts, while 
maintaining a focus on addressing health inequalities. When used in the 
planning system, HIAs can also identify opportunities to deliver co -benefits 
across a range of policy areas for example more and better active travel 
infrastructure in areas of poor air quality will lead to improved cardiovascular 
health.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.4.1.8  Consultation feedback demonstrates support for an overarch ing health and 
wellbeing policy and there is the option to include in  such a policy the role of 
Health Impact Assessments in the planning decision -making process.  
Policy Approaches 4.1: Promoting Healthy Places  
 Develop a policy that embeds principles of supporting health and 
wellbeing , and  requir es new developments to demo nstrate how 
these are being incorporated.  
 Explore whether it would be appropriate to require Health Impact 
Assessments depending on the scale and type of proposal  
Which of  these policy approaches to promoting healthy 
places do you support  and why ? Please g ive your reasons, noting the 
reference numbers, and any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
What triggers should be applied and set out within policy 
for when a Health Impact Assessment  is required for example the 
threshold of numbers of houses in a  scheme.   
 Key Issue: Air Quality  
What is the Issue?  
4.4.2.1  Clean air is essential for public health, climate change control and nature 
recovery. Air pollution comes from a diverse range of sources, including 
industry, transport, burning of solid fuels in the home , and the use of cleaning   
157 
 
products. The Environment Bill54 will once enacted introduce new air quality 
targets at a national level, d elivering key aspects of the Clean Air Strategy 
published in 2019. It provides important tools to empower local authorities to 
tackle issues specific to their areas. Amendments to the Environment Act 1995 
will be made through the Bill including responsibil ity for tackling local air 
pollution will now be shared with relevant public bodies, all tiers of local 
government and neighbouring authorities.  
4.4.2.2  Current Local P lan P olicy (DM7) requires all new development to be at least air 
quality neutral. Developers are required to submit Air Quality Assessments in 
support of applications dependent on the location, type and scale of the 
proposal. The assessments are used to identify the nature of any required 
mitigation measures in order to ensure an air qu ality neutral scheme is 
achieved. Within South Lakeland there are localised issues in Kendal Town 
Centre ; one site continues to exceed air quality objectives for  nitrogen dioxide , 
but only by a small margin.  As a result the Air Quality Management Area 
cove ring parts of the Town Centre  continues in designation , and an Air Quality 
Action Plan  remains in place to address issues . 
What are the Policy  Options  or Approaches ? 
4.4.2.3  There is the option to retain the current Local Plan policy and amend as 
considered approp riate, possibly introducing specific requirements that would 
need to be included in a proposed scheme to offset any potential impacts for air 
quality. The Council could consider exploring the option of setting its own local 
air pollution targets that are s tricter than the national legal target.  
Policy Approaches 4.2: Air Quality  
 Retain current policy (DM7)  and amend/update as necessary  
 Consider the option of setting local air pollution targets that are 
stricter than the national legal limit

support  and why ? Please give your reasons, noting the relevant reference 
numbers, and any other comments or alternative suggestions .

 Key Issue: Pollution and Contamination  
What is the Issue?  
4.4.3.1  Pollution and contamination from a range of sources can have negative impacts 
for public health, climate, water quality and nature recovery. It can cause noise 
and other nuisances  such as light pollution affecting local amenity.  New 
development needs to be carefully mana ged in this respect so it doesn’t give 
rise to pollution and contamination or expose itself to it. Proposals  may have  to 
consider the extent of exposure to pollution and contamination for example on 
account of previous uses or where located  next to polluti ng uses. Opportunities 
for new development may be constrained in this respect. Some proposed uses 
for example industrial may in themselves expose existing sensitive uses such 
as housing to pollution and contamination.  
We have a current Local Plan Policy (DM7) which seeks to ensure new 
development is locate d where there is no pollution or  where exposure to 
pollution and contamination is adequately remediated or removed to acceptable 
levels. Developers must be able to show as part of their proposal that any 
impacts are at or below acceptable levels, if necessary by use of appropriate 
and proportionate mitigating measures and application of limiting conditions to 
permissions to control impacts. Detailed assessments and preliminary 
investigation reports will be  required to assess the potential impacts and 
measures required , depending on circumstances .  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.4.3.2  There is the option to retain the current policy and amend as considered 
appropriate, possibly introducing specific requirements that would need to be 
included in a scheme to offset any potential impacts for all forms of pollution.  
Policy Approaches 4.3: Pollution and Contamination  
 Retain current Policy (DM7) and update /amend as necessary for 
example introducing specific requirements within schemes to offset 
any potential impacts for all forms of pollution  
 Consider adopting additional local guidance  
Which of these policy approaches to pollution and 
contamination do you support  and why ? Please give your reasons, noting 
the reference numbers, and any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .

 Key Issue: Community and Social Facilities and Services  
What is the Issue?  
4.4.4.1  Facilities such as village halls/community centres, public houses, outdoor 
sports buildings, indoor leisure facilities, schools, health centres, places of 
worship and local shops make an important contribution to the sustainability of 
our towns and villages. Access to such facilities can be constrained due to lack 
of local provision. This can mean the need to travel long distances from rural 
areas to reach such facilities.  Without good access, the sustainability of a 
community can be detrimentally affected.  
4.4.4.2  The viability of such facilities can be affected by changes in customer demands. 
National planning p olicy and associated permitted development rights which for 
example allow for shops to be converted to offices may also make it difficult to 
retain such facilities. There are opportunities to co -locate or mix community 
uses with other uses such as housing and employment in order to meet new 
demands  caused by increased population or people working in an area or to 
ensure valued facilities are safeguarded and stay viable.  
4.4.4.3  We have an existing Local Plan Policy (DM17) that seeks to retain such valued 
facilities, and to re -use existing facilities for som ething else that retains the 
site’s use in the future for other community uses. The policy also supports the 
new development of such uses in appropriate locations to meet needs and 
demands.  Consultation feedback received so far identifies the importance of  
ensuring new development is served by good access to adequate provision of 
community and social facilities, in order to create sustainable communities.  
Do you have thoughts on the general types of community 
facilities that should be protected for communi ty use (for example village 
halls, leisure facilities and schools) ? 
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.4.4.4  There is the option to retain the current policy and amend as considered 
appropriate.  
Policy Approach  4.4: Community and Social Facilities and Services  
 Retain current Policy (DM17)  that safeguard the most valued 
community facilities and supports proposals which do this, and 
update  or amend as necessary  
Do you support this policy approach  to Community and 
Socia l Facilities and Services? Please give your reasons, noting the   
160 
 
relevant reference numbers, and any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Green and Blue Infrastructure, Open Space and 
Recreation  
What is the Issue?  
4.4.5.1  The NPPF defines ‘ green infrastructure’ as a network of multi -functional green 
space, urban and rural, which is capable of delivering a wide range of 
environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities. It can include 
parks, playing fields, areas of open space, woodl and, allotments, private 
gardens, sustainable drainage features, green roofs and walls  and street  trees. 
‘Blue infrastructure’ is defined as streams, ponds, canals, rivers and other water 
bodies.  The NPPF also states that Local Plans should take a strategic 
approach to maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green 
infrastructure; and plan for the enhancement of natural capital at a catchment 
or landscape scale across local authority boundaries.  
4.4.5.2  The PPG describes green infrastructu re as a natural capital asset that provides 
multiple benefits, at a range of scales, also known as ‘ecosystem services’. The 
potential benefits of green infrastructure are many and include:  
 Building a strong, competitive economy, by creating attractive hi gh quality 
environments  
 Achieving well -designed places, through features such as street trees, 
recreational and public open space and enhancing local landscape 
character  
 Promoting healthy and safe communities, with opportunities for recreation, 
exercise, s ocial interaction, experiencing nature, mental and physical health 
benefits and helping reduce air pollution and noise.  
 Mitigating climate change, flooding and coastal change by contributing to 
carbon storage, protecting water quality and forming an integr al part of 
sustainable drainage and natural flood risk management.  
 Conserving and enhancing the natural environment, including ecological 
connectivity, facilitating biodiversity net gain and nature recovery networks  
4.4.5.3  The 25 Year Environment Plan states the  Government’s intention to a develop 
a framework of Green Infrastructure Standards (including benchmarks, new 
mapping and design guidance) that can be easily used by local planners, 
designers and others to deliver more, good quality green infrastructure. A  
launch is intended in 2021.  
4.4.5.4  Consultation feedback has highlighted the importance and value people place 
on our green spaces.  Our open spaces may need to be enhanced in order to 
meet specific needs. Playing pitches may need improving to meet the demands   
161 
 
from sports clubs. Children’s play facilities may need new equipment to 
continue to provide an attractive and exciting place for children to play. New 
development may give rise to the need for additional open space to ensure new 
residents have sufficient ac cess to it  and also to reduce the pressure on 
existing spaces from an increase in the local population . Additionally open 
space might need to be enhanced or created in order to support nature 
recovery for example habitat creation; or be used to address the  climate crisis, 
for example sustainable drainage feature s to manage surface water run -off 
from new development. There may be pressure to develop open spaces for 
other uses such as housing.  
4.4.5.5  The NPPF allows Local Planning authorities to apply tighter restri ctions 
(consistent with those for green belts) on certain areas of open space. 
Designating land as “ Local Green Space ” through the Local Plan allows 
communities to identify and protect green areas of particular importance to 
them. Paragraph 100 of the NPPF  states the following:  
 “The Local Green Space designation should only be used where the green 
space is:  
a) in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves;  
b) demonstrably  special to a local community and holds a particular local 
significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, 
recreational value (including as a playing field), tranquillity or richness of its 
wildlife; and  
c) local in character and is  not an extensive tract of land.”  
4.4.5.6  The NPPF states that Local Green Spaces  should be given the same level of 
protection as Green Belts and such sites would be protected under the NPPF 
regardless of whether the Council could identify a 5 year supply of deliv erable 
housing sites or not, whereas standard protected green spaces are more 
vulnerable . 
4.4.5.7  Core Strategy Policy CS8.1, recognises the wide range of benefits of Green 
Infrastructure and seeks to ensure it forms an integral part of creating 
sustainable commun ities and is incorporated in new developments. Policy DM4 
(DM Policies DPD) requires a ll development to demonstrate environmental net 
gains for biodiversity, green and blue infrastructure and demonstrate how the 
use of multifunctional green and blue infras tructure will deliver wider 
requirements and objectives. The policy also includes promotion of tree 
planting, (including replacement of lost trees at an appropriate ratio) new 
landscaping and provision of open space in new development . Our open

4.4.5.8  Our existing evidence in the 2008 study of open space, outdoor sports and 
recreation needs updating to ensure we have an up to date picture of  current 
and future needs. Policies CS8.3a and CS8.3b set out open accessibility and 
provision standards based on the  2008 study. An audit of the quality, quantity 
and accessibility of existing open space will be undertaken. As part of the audit 
process we  will engage local communities and stakeholders in order to 
determine which open spaces should continue to be protected and which may 
need enhancing as well as where additional provision might be needed. The 
audit will be used to inform the preparation of the Playing Pitch Strategy and 
Green Infrastructure Strategy which will identify actions and recommendations 
for meeting future needs and demands.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Approaches 4.5:  Green and Blue Infrastructure, Open Space a nd 
Recreation    
 Undertake an Open Spaces Study, Playing Pitch Strategy and Green 
Infrastructure Strategy to inform the review of Core Strategy Policy 
CS8.1 and Development Management Policies DPD Policy DM4 and 
to provide evidence to determine clear requir ements as to the 
amount and type of open space and other green infrastructure 
required from new development and  how it should contribute to 
creating a wider green infrastructure network . 
 Consider preparing a Supplementary Planning Document to provide 
more detailed guidance and clarity on implementing planning policy 
for open space and green infrastructure, including requirements for 
ongoing management and maintenance . 
 Designate areas of land as Local Green Space where they meet the 
criteria set out within p aragraph 100 of the NPPF . 
 Update current policy  that sets out the circumstances where loss of 
open space may be allowed .  
 Retain policy that supports and encourages high quality networks of 
green infrastructure to meet existing and future needs taking acco unt 
of other objectives around addressing climate change and enhancing 
biodiversity value .   
 Identify and protect a green infrastructure network comprising a 
range of open spaces, indicating where gaps could be plugged to 
improve connectivity .

4.5 Theme  5: Meeting Housing Needs  
Objective 5: To deliver housing  to meet current and future 
needs , including affordable housing, of a quality, type and size 
which meets a range of needs over people’s lifetime  
 Key Issue: Providing the right number of new homes  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.1.1  A key role of the Local Plan is to set the number of new homes that are needed 
in South Lakeland, and then to find sites and locations that can be developed to  
meet this need. The government requires us to boost  the number of homes 
being  built, and we must positively  plan for new housing, making sure enough 
homes are built locally to meet needs, and that they are built in sustainable 
locations and within our environmental limits.  
4.5.1.2  There is a target in our existing Local Plan (the Core Strategy)  of 400 homes to 
be built per year , but this figure is now out of date as it was set in 2010, and  is 
not based on an up to date understanding  of housing need. The government 
now requires Councils to set their own housing requirements in Local Plans55 
and requires them to review and (if needed)  update their target at least every 
five years . 
4.5.1.3  Most Councils  are required to use the government’s  ‘standard method’ in 
setting their housing target . This  is a formula set out in national planning 
guidance. H owever in S outh Lakeland , under current guidance , we should  
calculate  our housing need using our own local method. This is  because the 
data needed  for the standard method (population projections and housing 
affordability) is only available at a district wide level rather than  our Local Plan 
area (which excludes the national parks).  
4.5.1.4  We undertook our own local assessment of housing need in 2017 through our 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment  (SHMA)56.  This study analysed a range 
of data to calculate an estimate of our housing need over the time period 2016 -
2036 . This included looking at  population trends and forecasts , affordable 
housing need, future employment forecasts and housing  market signals.  
4.5.1.5  This study  estimated a need for somewhere between 145 to 320 new homes 
per year  across the whole district. It concluded that a figure towards the top 
end of th is range might best reflect local housing need in South Lakeland . This 
is becaus e it is based on longer term migration trends and also aligns better 
                                            
55 They used to be set by the regional government offices prior to their abolition  
56 https://www.southlakel and.gov.uk/media/6106/final -shma -october -2017.pdf  
   
165 
 
with jobs forecasts, to ensure that there is no workforce shortage in the future 
(i.e. the number of working age people in the area would need to increase to fill 
the number of jobs predi cted in the area, thus increasing the need for homes).  
This means this figure would help us better address our ageing population and 
shrinking workforce.  
4.5.1.6  The SHMA calculated figures for housing need in the national parks  separately  
and deduct ed these  from the district total . This gave  a housing need figure  just 
for the South Lakeland Local Plan area of up to 288 homes per year , which was 
rounded to 290  homes . This figure is similar to the annual number of homes 
that have on average been built in our L ocal Plan area over the last five years 
(279 per year  between 2015 -20).  
4.5.1.7  A housing need figure of 290 homes per year would mean  an overall need of 
5,800 homes over the new plan period 2020 -2040.  To put this in context we 
already have an identified supply o f 1,849 homes that already have planning 
permission, and a further 2,511 homes on sites that are allocated in our existing 
Local Plan . When these sources are combined  together with small windfall sites  
(sites less than 5 units)  continuing to come forward ( estimated at 60 homes per 
year), the housing supply in our area is healthy and amounts to just over 5,000 
homes. So a housing need figure of 290 homes per year and 5,800 over the 
plan period 2020 -2040 (or 6,380 with a 10% ‘buffer’ for additional flexibilit y) 
would not result in a significant need for new land allocations .  
4.5.1.8  The government has changed its view on how housing need should be 
calculated numerous times in recent years  which has created uncertainty. B ut 
at the time of publishing this report , the g uidance is still that we should calculate 
our own housing need using a locally justified method. We therefore propose to 
update our SHMA study through the course of the Local Plan Review to 
understand whether the level of housing need has changed since 201 7. The 
updated study will be a Strategic Housing and Economic Needs Assessment 
(SHENA) and will be available in late 2021/early 2022.   
4.5.1.9  The government proposed  in its Planning White Paper in summer 2020 that in 
future every local planning authority will be given a binding housing requirement 
figure by the government. Given that we have no further details at this stage , 
this Issues and Options paper proceeds on t he basis of current national policy 
and guidance. We must however be mindful that in progressing the Local Plan 
that this position may change  and we will have to respond as we develop our 
housing requirement . 
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.1.10  The Local Plan must set a new housing requirement target. There are a 
number of options for the requir ement figure as set out below.  
    
166 
 
Policy Options 5.1 : Providing the right number of new homes  
PO5.1/i:  A housing requirement based on a local assessment of housing 
need , currently understood to be up to  290 homes per year based on 
the 2017 SHMA.  
This option would follow the recommendations of our 2017 SHMA and set a 
housing requirement figure of 290 homes per year. This is based on our own 
local assessment of housing nee d taking into account population changes, 
affordable housing need, economic forecasts and housing market signals. This 
option would be in line with current government planning policy and guidance at 
the time of preparing this Issues and Options report. We propose to update our 
local assessment of housing need and if the updated assessment produces a 
different figure we will use that to inform our housing requirement target.  
PO5.1/ii:  A housing requirement based on the government’s ‘standard 
method’ calculation, curre ntly understood to be  around 166 homes 
per year  for the Local Plan area.  
This option would  seek to apply the government’s current standard method for 
calculating housing need and then adjust the district wide figure to take account 
of the need in the natio nal park areas. The current standard  method results in a 
figure of 198 homes  per year for the whole district. Our 2017 SHMA calculated 
an annual housing need of 32 homes per year in the national park areas, so 
one option for adjusting the standard method to fit our Local Plan area would be 
to deduct 32 homes from the district wide  figure. This would result in a figure of 
around 166 homes per year. This figure would still be within the range of 115 to 
290 homes per year calculated in the SHMA. The SHMA recommend ed that  
any housing need  figure from the  range would be reasonable and j ustified , but 
lower figures may not reflect economic forecasts. It should be noted that 
economic forecasts informing the SHMA were ‘pre -Covid’ and ‘pre -Brexit’ 
forecasts.  
Which of these policy options for setting a new housing 
requirement in the Local Plan  do you support  and why? Please give your 
reasons, noting the reference number, and add any other comments or 
alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Providing the right number of affordable homes  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.2.1  Delivering new affordable housing is a key priority in South Lakeland. Lower 
than average salaries and higher than average house prices have led to 
significant affordability problems, with the average home in South Lakeland 
costing 9.5 times the average full time salary. This exceeds the Cumbrian, 
North West and English affordability ratios.  Land Registry data shows that new   
167 
 
build open market homes are even less affordable than the housing stock as a 
whole, with the median price of an open market new build home in South 
Lakeland over the last three years being £345,000, almost 14 times the 
average income in 2019.  
4.5.2.2  A number of respondents to our early engagement in 2020 commented 
specifically about the lack of affordable housing in our area and it is an 
important issue for local communities, with many people unable to buy or 
rent locally on the open market.  
4.5.2.3  The 2017 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) highlighted that 
affordable need remains high and identified a shortfall of 153 affordable homes 
per year.  
4.5.2.4  Our existing Local Plan57 requires 35% o f homes on new developments to be 
affordable over specified site size thresholds. A number of government 
statements and policy and guidance changes have created uncertainty in 
recent years over what size of sites can be required to provide affordable 
housi ng. The Council has produced a guidance note58 to advise how it is 
interpreting national policy in applying its existing Local Plan  policy in this 
respect.  
4.5.2.5  Our existing Local Plan policy  has generally been very successful in delivering 
new affordable homes on development sites with on average 3 5% of homes on 
sites over 10 units permitted since 2010 being affordable (this does include  
some 100% affordable schemes). Since 2010, 539 affordable homes have 
been built in the Local Plan area. The policy has however come under 
increasing pressure in more recent years on viability grounds , with viability 
assessments accompanying planning appli cations stating high abnormal 
development costs on site . This combined  with continued high land values has 
led to viability challenges .  
4.5.2.6  Policy AS03 in the Arnside and Silverdale Local Plan requires 50% of homes 
on sites of two or more dwellings to be affo rdable. This policy will continue to 
apply in the AONB area and will not be affected by the Local Plan Review.  
4.5.2.7  At present most affordable housing delivered through the Local Plan policy is 
delivered on site by developers  through the use of Section 106 lega l 
agreements , and in some circumstances an off -site financial contribution is 
accepted in lieu of affordable housing.  
4.5.2.8  It must be noted that as part of the government’s radical planning reforms it is 
proposed that affordable housing in future would instead  be delivered through a

new ‘infrastructure levy’ . Developers would pay a fixed levy on development 
that would be used by local authorities to fund a range of infrastructure, 
including affordable housing.  It is proposed that developers would be able to 
offset and reduce some of their levy payment by providing some affordable on 
development sites. The details of these proposals are not yet clear but we must 
be mindful that the way affordable housing can be required through Local Plans 
and the way it will be delivered on site could be subject to significant change in 
the near future.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.2.9  In line with current national planning policy and guidance, and given our local 
evidence of a continued need for significant amounts of new affordable 
housing, the updated Local Plan will continue to require developers to provide 
affordable housing on thei r development sites. A viability study will be 
undertaken to consider the effects of various  options for delivering affordable 
housing combined with other policy requirements. A number of policy options 
are set out below.  
Policy Options 5.2 :  Providing the  right number of new affordable homes  
PO5.2/i:  Maintain the current policy approach of 35% affordable housing on 
sites over specified size thresholds  
This option would retain the overarching principles of the current policy position 
of requiring 35% of homes on dev elopment sites to be affordable, which is 
supported by the findings of the 2017 SHMA. Under this option the site size 
thresholds at which affordable housing can be sought would be refreshed and 
clarified in policy in line with government guidance in place at the time, as there 
have been numerous changes to national policy and guidance in recent years 
which have created uncertainty in this respect.  
PO5.2/ii:  Increase the affordable housing requirement above 35%  
This option would seek to increase the affordable housing  required from new 
development by increasing the percentage requirement. It would have to be 
recognised that increasing the requirements would have negative impacts on 
development viability and other areas of policy and standards may have to be 
weakened to  achieve an increase in affordable housing delivery. Competing 
priorities such as affordable housing, providing green spaces and nature 
improvements, contributing to local infrastructure improvements, securing high 
quality design and quality construction a nd increased energy efficiency would 
all have to be carefully balanced and tested through a viability assessment.  
PO5.2/iii:  Reduce the affordable housi ng requirement below 35%  
This option would reduce the amount of affordable housing required  on sites. 
This approach would need to be underpinned by a full assessment of   
169 
 
development viability to understand whether reducing the affordable 
requirement would enable other policy areas to be strengthened for example 
sustainable construction standards or contribu tions to other infrastructure. We 
would need to carefully understand the reasons for some recent developments 
not delivering the 35% affordable requirement before considering lowering the 
requirements, to understand whether these sites had individual circu mstances 
or whether they represent the wider development market as a whole. This 
would include looking carefully at issues such as abnormal development costs 
on sites which make them more expensive to develop, and also the price being 
paid for land, to ens ure that land is not being sold at too higher price if it is 
subject to difficult constraints which should reduce its value in line with national 
planning policy. This option would not support the Council’s key priority of 
increasing affordable housing pro vision and it would need to be robustly 
demonstrated that development is not capable of delivering 35% affordable 
housing before considering reducing the requirement.  
PO5.2/iv:  A more flexible and tailored approach to recognise the different 
characteristics of certa in types of sites and areas  
This option would look at introducing different requirements on different types of 
sites or areas. This could perhaps include setting different  affordable  
requirements in different areas depending on development viability (e.g.  some 
areas of South Lakeland attract higher sales prices so may be able to provide 
more affordable housing). Or it could involve reducing requirements for 
example on previously developed (brownfield) sites where development costs 
are often higher and it i s more difficult to provide affordable housing. This could 
help deliver more development on brownfield sites before greenfield sites. This 
option could also potentially look at setting site specific affordable housing 
requirements on larger site allocation s, by undertaking site specific appraisals 
during the Local Plan process and working with developers and landowners to 
agree what level of affordable housing sites could reasonably deliver.  This 
would require more detailed assessment work at the plan makin g stage but  
should help reduce the need for site specific viability assessments at the 
planning application stage.  
Which of these policy options for requiring affordable 
housing do you support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the 
reference number,  and add any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .

 Key Issue: Providing the right types of affordable homes  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.3.1  In addition to setting out the overall quantity of affordable housing to be 
provided, the Local Plan should also ensure that the most appropriate types of 
affordable housing are provided to help meet local needs.  
4.5.3.2  The NPPF provides a wide ranging definitio n of affordable housing, covering a 
range of housing types including affordable and social rent, starter homes59, 
discounted market sales housing, and other routes to home ownership such as 
shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cost homes for sale and rent 
to buy.  
4.5.3.3  The affordability of these different types of housing can vary significantly and 
some are more ‘affordable’ than others taking into account local incomes and 
market house prices.  
4.5.3.4  South Lakeland’s discounted sale home ownership produc t generally has at 
least a 40 -45% discount from the open market value  to make it affordable for 
local people , and the initial sales prices are calculated and fixed each year and 
published on the Council’s website60. Affordable rent homes provided in South 
Lakeland are generally rented to tenants at a maximum of 80% of local market 
rents or the Local Housing Allowance rate61, whichever is the lowest.  In rec ent 
years we have started to see more shared ownership products being offered by 
developers, where purchasers buy an initial share of a home, and pay rent on 
the remaining share, with the ability to ‘staircase’ and buy an increasing share 
of the home over time. Shared ownership homes are generally more preferable 
in financial terms for developers as they can be sold with a smaller discount 
compared to discounted sale and affordable rental homes . 
4.5.3.5  The Council’s affordable housing guidance62 requires  that of the affordable 
homes provided on a site, 50% should be for affordable home ownership (e.g. 
discounted sale or shared ownership) and 50% for affordable /social  rental. 
Where 10 or more affordable homes are being provided on a site, the guidance 
requires that of the affordable home ownership properties, no more than half 
should be for shared ownership, to ensure at least half are provided as 
discounted sal e. This split is not currently set out within Local Plan policy but 
                                            
59 This was a type of affordable home proposed by the government which would be offered at a 
discount of at least 20% from market price for first time buyers below the age of 40. Starter Homes did 
not become widely adopted in practice and have been replaced by the government’s ‘First Home’ 
proposals which propose a discount of at least 30%.  
60 https://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/housing/affordable -housing/affordabl e-housing -building/  
61 LHA rates are used to work out how much universal credit of housing benefit will be provided for 
tenants renting from a private landlord, and is based on the 30th percentile of local private rental rates.

within guidance that can be updated on an annual basis.  This typically results in 
the following split of affordable homes on a site:  
Tenure  % of overall 
provision  % of affordable 
provision  
Open Market  65% n/a 
Affordable /Social  Rent  17.5%  50% 
Discounted Sale  8.75%  25% 
Shared Ownership  8.75%  25% 
Table 15: Current Affordable Mix  
4.5.3.6  Our current position therefore places equal emphasis on rental and home 
ownership forms of affordable housing. The government however  has strong 
ambitions to increase levels of home ownership and has launched its ‘First 
Homes’ initiative to replace the former  Starter Homes which did not appear to 
be implemented on any scale.  
First Homes  
4.5.3.7  First Homes are to be sold at a discount of at least 30% from the open 
market value, with a maximum price cap of £ 250,000, to first time buyers 
with a maximum household income  of £80,000. The government 
published new guidance for First Homes on 24 May 2021. It states that 
local authorities will be expected to require 25% of all affordable housing 
units secured through developer contributions on a development site to be 
First Ho mes. This could result in the following mix in South Lakeland if the 
overall split between affordable rent and ownership is maintained.  
Tenure  % of overall 
provision  % of affordable 
provision  
Open Market  65% n/a 
Affordable/Social Rent  17.5%  50% 
First Homes  8.75%  25% 
SLDC Discounted Sale  4.375%  12.5%  
Shared Ownership  4.375%  12.5%  
Table 16: Possible Affordable Mix including First Homes  
4.5.3.8  First Homes are similar to South Lakeland’s existing discounted sale model 
which has been successfully in place for many years. Key differences however 
are that First Homes are restricted to first -time buyers only (with a number of 
small exceptions such as  armed forces veterans) whereas South Lakeland’s 
discounted sale homes are available to anyone in local housing need. Also the 
government requires at least a 30% discount from market prices for First 
Homes, which is smaller than the discount required in So uth Lakeland to make 
homes affordable to buy based on local incomes. The government guidance 
does however allow local authorities to set higher discounts of 40% or 50% to   
172 
 
ensure First Homes are affordable locally, and also to reduce the price cap. 
The leve l of discount and price cap for First Homes in South Lakeland will need 
to be considered through the Local Plan review and informed by our updated 
assessment of housing need through the SHENA  study . The 2017 SHMA 
calculated that at least a 41% discount wou ld generally be required on open 
market  housing to make it affordable locally. We will need to carefully consider 
how First Homes can be brought into the mix of affordable homes on sites and 
which other forms of affordable homes currently provided they mig ht displace.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.3.9  The update of the Local Plan provides an opportunity to review what types of 
affordable homes are provided by developers. A number of possible options are 
set out below.  
Policy Options 5.3 : Providing the right types of affordable housing  
PO5.3/i:  Maintain the equal  split between affordable rental and affordable 
home ownership  on development sites  
This option  would continue to require an equal split between affordable rent and 
affordable home ownership where affordable homes are being provided on -site 
by developers of larger schemes.  This option would be supported by the 2017 
SHMA which concluded overall that a 60 %:40% split between rented and low 
cost home ownership is appropriate, and that in recognition tha t a number of 
100% affordable rental schemes are brought forward independently by 
Registered Providers, that on development sites where developers are 
providing a proportion of affordable housing that a 50:50 split is appropriate.  
This option  would allow r ecent  and proposed  government changes that require 
a proportion of affordable home ownership properties to be provided on sites to 
be incorporated , but would require us to consider whether First Homes would 
be an acceptable substitution for the exi sting lo cal discounted sale homes in 
South Lakeland, or whether they should be provided alongside our local 
discounted sale product and be provided instead of shared ownership products. 
Within this option we could consider whether to set out in Local Plan policy t he 
relative proportions of different home ownership products that will be required, 
or we could continue to do this in our annual affordable housing website 
guidance which can be updated more easily than Local Plan policy.  
PO5.3/ii:  Increase the proportion of affordable home ownership properties 
required  within the affordable provision on development sites  
This option would recognise the government’s strong push  to increase levels of 
home ownership but would not support the Council’s strong local priority to 
increase affordable rent provision.  Depending on the proportions it would 
perhaps enable the government’s First Homes to be bought into the affordable   
173 
 
housing mix locally without displacing other forms of home ownership such as 
South Lakeland’s existing disc ounted sale properties or shared ownership.  
PO5.3/iii:  Increase the proportion of affordable rent properties required  within 
the affordable provision on development sites  
This option would increase the proportion of affordable homes that would be 
required to be for a ffordable rent above the current 50%, and resultantly reduce 
the proportion of homes on sites that are made available for affordable home 
ownership. The government is proposing that at least 25% of affordable homes 
on development sites will need to be Firs t Homes so the proportion of 
affordable home ownership properties could not be  set below this. Reducing 
the proportion of affordable home ownership properties whilst incorporating 
First Homes requirements would be at the expense of the other existing home 
ownership properties currently being delivered in South Lakeland – discounted 
sale and shared ownership.  
This option would perhaps better respond to the economic conditions resulting 
from the covid -19 pandemic including rising unemployment , predicted falls  in 
incomes and stricter mortgage lending.  South Lakeland has been particularly 
affected due to the significance of tourism and hospitality in providing local 
employment.  This may suggest an increased need for affordable rent as 
opposed to affordable home ownership homes  for at least the short term future, 
but to a large extent will depend on the speed and scale of economic recovery.  
Which of these policy options for affor dable housing types 
do you support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and add any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Providing the right types and mix of new homes  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.4.1  The NPPF requires local authorities to assess the size, type and tenure of 
housing needed for different groups in the community and to reflect this need in 
their planning policies. Policy CS6.2 of the South Lakeland Core Strategy seeks 
to ensure that new developments offer a rang e of housing sizes and types 
taking account of the housing requirements of different groups.  
4.5.4.2  The 2017 SHMA suggested the following general mix of homes in terms of 
number of bedrooms would be appropriate in South Lakeland  base d on long 
term population tren ds: 
Tenure  1-bed 2-bed 3-bed 4+ bed  
Market  0-5% 35-40% 40-45% 15-20% 
Low-cost home 
ownership  15-20% 45-50% 25-30% 5-10%   
174 
 
Affordable housing 
(rented)  30-35% 40-45% 15-20% 5-10% 
Table 17: SHMA recommendations on b edroom numbers  
4.5.4.3  Based on its analysis the SHMA advised that the above mix should be reflected 
in planning policies and that the focus on market housing should be 2 and 3 
bedroom properties and the focus for affordable rented properties should be on 
1 and 2 bedroom propert ies. 
4.5.4.4  A key issue is that the recommended property mix in the SHMA does not 
appear to be being delivered on the ground. Information on the number of 
bedrooms of each completed new home in the Local Plan area is available for 
approximately 92% of completions  going back to 2010 which provides us with a 
good indication of property sizes that have been completed.  
No. of

5 0.00%  5.03%  3.70%  
Table 18: Size of New Homes 2010 -2020 (Number of Bedrooms)  
4.5.4.5  Almost all affordable homes that have been built from 2010 -2020 have had 1 -3 
bedrooms and almost 60% have had two bedrooms , which generally aligns with 
the SHMA recommendations . Open market homes have generally been larger 
with almost a third  being 4 to 5 bedroom. Approximately 55% of open market 
homes  built have been 2 -3 bedrooms, which is significantly less than the 75% -
85% recommendation in the SHMA.  
4.5.4.6  When just looking at the last five years of data, the proportion of open market 
homes completed with 4+ bedrooms rises to 37% which far exceeds the overall 
SHMA recommendations. It is acknowledged that these large homes have sold 
well and it could be argued  that the market is demanding this type of property, 
and we need to consider factors such as increased working from home trends 
which demand additional space. B ut it should also be acknowledged that 
building larger 4+ open market properties has significant implications for 
affordability, with the previous section noting that the average new build open 
market home over the last three years now stands at almost 14x  the average 
local salary.   
4.5.4.7  In terms of the types of homes needed (flats, houses, bungalows etc) the 2017 
SHMA was not prescriptive in calculating an appropriate mix. It did however 
suggest that the Council should consider the role of bungalows as part of the 
future mix of housing which may be particularly attractive for older owner -  
175 
 
occupiers looking to downsize. But it also recognised that this form of housing 
is relatively land intensive for the amount of floorspace provided. The table 
below shows th e mix of housing types that have been built in South Lakeland in 
the period 2010 -2020. Almost two thirds of homes completed were houses with 
almost a third flats or apartments. Bungalows have comprised a small 
proportion of overall completions, with a higher pr oportion being built in the 
affordable sector.

Grand Total  100.00%  100.00%  100.00%  
Table 19: Types of Homes built 2010 -2020  
4.5.4.8  Feedback from our early engagement in 2020 showed that people feel a wide 
range of housing types should be provided, and reference was made to a 
perceived need for bungalows, lifetime homes, low cost homes, sustainably 
designed and constructed homes, local occupancy homes, extra care/older 
people’s housing, smaller houses for single people households, self -build 
homes, social housing and family housing.  A number of comments were made 
about too many larger detached homes being built that are not affordable for 
local people.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.4.9  The updated Local Plan will need to include guidance on what size and types of 
homes should be provided taking into account local needs, as required by the 
NPPF. Two options are set out below.  
Policy Options 5.4 : Providing the right types and mix of new homes  
PO5.4/i:  Maintain the current flexibility on the  different house types/sizes that 
should be provided  by developers, and encourage the mix to reflect 
local needs  
This option would maintain the current policy position  (Core Strategy CS6.2)  of 
stating that new development should provide a mix of housing to meet needs, 
but not being prescriptive about the proportions of different types and sizes of 
housing that need to b e provided. This would  continue to  enable a large degree 
of flexibility on a site by site ba sis. B ut the reality is that it would be a position 
whereby the market will continue to determine the open market mix of housing 
on sites with the result that we wi ll continue to see high proportions of   
176 
 
4+bedroom houses that are unaffordable to a significant proportion of the local 
population, and use up more land and resources to both construct and live in.  
PO5.4/ii:  Set specific requirements in policy on the types and mix of  homes 
that should be provided  on development site s, to ensure that 
provision more closely matches evidence of need  
This option would involve providing more specific policy wording to set out the 
proportions of different types of housing that should be provided, to make sure 
that it more closely aligns with our evidence of need in the SHMA. This policy 
approach would li kely seek to require a minimum  proportion of 2 and 3 
bedroom  open market homes on large development sites. This would help 
ensure that the open market homes being provided are more affordable  and 
more aligned with demographic evidence on household size . This policy 
approach could also seek to require the provision of certain types of housing on 
development sites such as bungalows. The implications of this policy approach 
on development viability would need to be carefully assessed in a viability 
study.  
Whic h of these policy options for housing mix and types 
do you support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and add any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Self -Build and Custom Build  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.5.1  National planning p olicy requires us to assess the demand for self -build and 
custom build housing in our area and to reflect it in our planning policies. Self -
build and custom build has a broad definition in planning legislation and is not 
limited to the narrow defin ition of people building their own homes themselves. 
It can include for example someone commissioning an architect to design, and 
then a builder to build a home to their own specification, and can also include 
conversions of buildings where there is substa ntial building work.  
4.5.5.2  We have a legal duty to keep a register of people or groups seeking to acquire 
a plot for self -building and to have regard to this when carrying out our Council 
functions. We also have a legal duty to grant enough planning permissions for 
self-build plots to meet local demand in our area. Information on the Council’s 
self-build register and the number of plots being granted permission can be 
found on the Council’s self-build web page63. Our data shows that we are 
meeting our duty in granting enough planning permissions for self -build plots.

building/    
177 
 
4.5.5.3  Our current Local Plan policy is set out in Policy DM12 of the Development 
Management Policies DPD. This policy expresses the Council’s support and 
encouragement for self -build homes in principle. It provides a clear statement 
on where self -build housing will be supported in principle and seeks to 
encourage this form of housing. It supports self -build in existing service centres, 
within or on the edge of small villages and hamlets, and on rural exception sites 
where they are to be provided as affordable homes.  It does not however 
introduce any additio nal locations above those already allowed for other types 
of housing in the Local Plan , and it doesn’t require self -build plots to be 
provided on housing sites.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.5.4  The options for future Local Plan policy relating t o self -build are set out below.  
Policy Options 5.5 : Supporting delivery of self -build homes  
PO5.5/i:  Maintain current policy approach ( Policy DM12 ) which sets out in 
broad terms where self -build homes will be supported.  
This option would mean retaining our current  policy approach as set out in 
Policy DM12 which provides encouragement for self -build and sets out where it 
will be supported in principle.  
PO5.5/ii:  Offer further support for self -build for example by a llocat ing sites 
specifically for self -build housing  or requiring a proportion of plots on 
large sites to be available for self -build ers. 
This option would seek to offer more support for self -builders by trying to 
ensure more land and plots are available to self -builders.  
One option would be to identify sit es in the Local Plan solely for self -build 
housing to help prospective self -builders identify suitable land. This could 
potentially be an option for groups of individuals looking to self -build as the 
Local Plan will only allocate sites capable of deliverin g a number of homes. 
This would require community groups to help identify potential sites of interest 
and for landowners to be willing to make sites available for self -builders, 
potentially at a lower cost than they would achieve on the open market.  
Some C ouncils require developers to provide a proportion of plots on their 
development sites as serviced plots and to make them available to self -
builders. This could  involve specifying a site size threshold at which developers 
would be expected to make serviced  self-build plots available and would likely 
require the production of further planning guidance to explain how the policy 
might work in practice.    
178 
 
Which of these policy options for supporting self -build do 
you support  and why? Please give your reasons, not ing the reference

 Key Issue: Local Occupancy and Second Homes  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.6.1  The prevalence of second homes and holiday lets is a recurrent concern raised 
by local communities in our Local  Plan engagement. Increasing proportions of 
second homes and holiday lets can exacerbate significant housing affordability 
issues and can harm the viability of village communities if properties are empty 
for large periods of time.  
4.5.6.2  At a district wide level the presence of the national parks, in particular the Lake 
District National Park has a significant impact on the level of second homes and 
holiday lets given its popularity as a tourist destination. The issue for the Local 
Plan review is to understand the  scale of the issue in the Local Plan area, and 
how high levels of second homes/holiday lets in the neighbouring national 
parks may be impacting on issues such as affordability and the sustainability of 
communities within the Local Plan area.  
4.5.6.3  There is no one overall  evidence source for understanding the scale of the 
issue of second homes or holiday lets in the South Lakeland Local Plan area, 
but there are a number of sources that can be drawn upon to build up a picture 
of the issue, including the census, Council Tax records and the property 
gazetteer, and this evidence is set out in the Housing Topic Paper . 
4.5.6.4  The map below shows the percentage of homes paying Council Tax that are 
estimated to be second homes. It shows that the percentage of second homes 
is significantly higher in the National Park areas and relatively lower in the Local 
Plan area. The parishes wholly within the Local Plan area that have the highest 
percentages of second home s based on Council Tax records are Osmotherley  
(9.32%) , Arnside (9.07)  and Allithwaite and Cartmel  (8.85%).    
179 
 
 
Figure 35: Second Homes by Parish  
 
4.5.6.5  Overall for South Lakeland, the percentage of Council Tax properties that are 
second homes is understood to be  around 7%, which is significantly higher than 
the national average for predominantly rural authorities which stands at 1.78% 
according to research by the Rural Services Network64. The figure just for 
parishes within the Local Plan area ( 4%) is still significantly above the national 
average of 1.78% suggesting that whilst the issue is less severe than in the 
national park areas, it is still an issue in the Local Plan area.

4.5.6.6  At present no restrictions are applied to new open market housing in the Local 
Plan area to ensure that they are used as main homes for people with a local 
connection. Restrictions are however applied to new affordable homes to 
ensure that they are used as main residences and that they are occupied by  
people with a local connection to the area65.  
4.5.6.7  A number of years ago the Council did seek to restrict the occupancy of  some  
new open market housing through the d evelopment of the Core Strategy , 
however the Planning Inspector examining the Core Strategy did  not accept the 
proposed approach.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.5.6.8  There are two main policy options for responding to this issue as set out below.  
Policy Options 5.6 : Providing homes for local people  
PO5.6/i:  Maintain current policy approach and only ap ply local connection 
and main residence restrictions on new affordable housing . 
This option would continue the current policy approach, whereby only 
affordable homes will continue to be restricted to people with a local connection 
who will live in them as their main homes. As is the case now, local 
communities can still consider introducing policies for their local area through 
Neighbourhood Plans, which can be used to develop very localised planning 
policies to address issues at a local level , such as in S t Ives in Cornwall where 
a neighbourhood plan has been adopted which prevents new homes from 
being second homes . 
PO5.6/ii:  Seek to ensure that a small proportion of new private market homes 
are required to be used as main homes and are available only for 
people with a local connection  
This option would need to  be clearly justified and underpinned by evidence . 
Any form of widespread restriction on the occupancy of general market housing 
would be unlikely to pass the examination given  previous local experience. 
However there may be scope to explore whether a smaller scale targeted 
approach might be appropriate. For example our neighbouring planning area 
Eden District Council has a Local Plan Policy (HS2) that restricts new 
greenfield m arket housing in smaller villages and hamlets to people with a local 
connection. This is intended to help promote self -build opportunities for local 
people. We could consider a similar approach, by revising our current Policy 
DM13 and requiring new homes p ermitted under this policy to be for people 
with a local connection who will use them as their main homes.

do you support  and why? Please give your reasons, noting the reference 
number, and add any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Setting housing requirement figures for Neighbourhood 
Plan areas  
What is the Issue? 
4.5.7.1 National planning policy requires local authorities to set housing requirement 
figures for designated neighbourhood plan areas as part of their strategic 
policies.  This means we will need to decide what proportion of the housing 
requirement for the whole Local Plan area should be met within the 
neighbourhood plan areas. 
4.5.7.2 In the South Lakeland Local Plan Area we have the following designated 
neighbourhood plan areas: 
 Heversham and Hincaster – Adopted Neighbourhood Plan 
 Grange over Sands – Adopted Neighbourhood Plan 
 Allithwaite and Cartmel – Draft Neighbourhood Plan in preparation 
 Burneside – Early stages of research and plan preparation. 
4.5.7.3 The government’s planning guidance explains that there is no set method for 
setting neighbourhood plan area housing figures, but suggests local authorities 
might want to take into consideration: 
 The spatial strategy in the Local Plan, which distributes development 
across the Local Plan area. 
 Evidence on the amount of land available for housing in the area. 
 The characteristics of the neighbourhood plan area including its population 
and role in providing services. 
 Factors that could restrict the scale, type or distribution of development in a 
neighbourhood plan area. 
4.5.7.4 There are a range of factors to consider in determining appropriate housing 
requirement figures for neighbourhood planning areas. In the spirit of localism 
which underpins neighbourhood planning we also consider that in addition to 
the above factors suggested by government, we should consider local 
communities’ aspirations f or the future development of their area and work 
together to agree appropriate requirement figures in the Local Plan. 
4.5.7.5 The Housing Topic Paper sets out information on the factors listed in the 
government’s planning guidance.  
    
182 
 
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Options 5.7 : Setting Neighbourhood Plan Area Housing 
Requirements  
PO5.7/i:  Set housing requirements based on the various factors outlined in 
planning guidance and in consultation with neighbourhood planning 
bodies  
This option would include an assessment of the factors outlined in planning 
guidance, and look at the current and emerging Local Plan spatial strategy 
options  and what they might mean for each neighbourhood plan area , available 
housing land in each area, the  population and  characteris tics of each area, any 
constraints that may restrict the scope for future development, and the 
aspirations of local communities for future development in their area.  
PO5.7/ii:  Set housing requirements based purel y on a population size basis  
This option would set a r equirement based on the size of the population of the 
neighbourhood plan area as a proportion of the Local Plan area. For example, if 
a neighbourhood plan area has 5% of the population of the Local Plan area, 
then the housing requirement would be 5% of the  overall housing requirement 
for the Local Plan area.  
Based on 2019 Mid-Year  Populatio n estimates, this would result in the 
neighbourhood plan areas having the following proportion s of the overall Local 
Plan housing requirement as their neighbourhood requi rement:  
- Grange -over-Sands: 5.5%  
- Allithwaite and Cartmel: 2.4%  
- Heversham and Hincaster: 1.2%  
- Burneside: 1.9%  
Which of these policy options for neighbourhood plan 
housing requirements do you support  and why? Please give your 
reasons, noting the reference num ber, and add any other comments or 
alternative suggestions .  
 Issue: Older People’s Housing  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.8.1  South Lakeland has a significantly older population than regionally and 
nationally, and looking to the future our population will continue to age at a 
faster rate. It is important that suitable housing is provided to meet the needs of 
older people . This could be  general market housing such as bungalows or 
housing that is accessible and easily adaptable, or specialist forms of housing,   
183 
 
ranging from r etirement apartments, to extra care housing, to residential care 
homes. Our 2017 SHMA estimated a need for an additional 57 units of 
specialist housing for older people each year in the Local Plan area.  
4.5.8.2  A number of specialist housing schemes are being planned including an extra 
care scheme of 104 homes that is being built in Oxenholme, and there are two 
planning applications in progress for retirement housing close to Kendal Town 
Centre. Permission has also recently been granted for an extra care scheme  in 
Kents Bank, Grange -over-Sands.  
4.5.8.3  There are a number of ways that the Local Plan can help ensure suitable 
housing is provided for older people. One important factor is ensuring that all 
new homes that are built are accessible and can easily be adapted as people’s 
needs and mobility change over their lifetime . This  helps people stay in their 
own home as they age if that is their preference. Our Local Plan (Policy DM11)  
already requires all new homes to be built to higher Building Regulations in this 
respect  and we do not think  that this approach should be changed through the 
Local Plan Review. Another possible option would be to identify sites 
specifically for specialist housing for older people such as extra care schemes. 
We could also consider requiring ce rtain types of housing to be provided on 
development sites as part of the mix, such as bungalows.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
Policy Approaches 5. 8: Older People’s Housing  
 Continue to require all new build homes to meet the optional building  
regulations on accessibility and adaptability (as set out in current 
Policy DM11) to ensure all new homes are more accessible and are 
more easily adaptable as people’s needs change throughout their 
lifetimes.   
 Consider whether to allocate sites specifica lly for specialist housing 
for older people, or whether to require them as part of the housing 
mix on large sites.   
Which of these policy approaches to older people’s 
housing do you support and why? Please give your reasons, noting the 
relevant reference numbers, and add any other comments or alternative 
suggestions .

 Issue : Gypsy and Traveller Housing Needs  
What is the Issue?  
4.5.9.1  The Government’s planning policies and requirements for Gypsy and Traveller 
sites are set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller sites66. This  must be taken 
into consideration in preparing local plans and taking planning decisions. It 
encourages local authorities to formulate their own evidence base for Gypsy 
and Traveller needs and to provide their own targets relating to pitches 
required.  
4.5.9.2  The most recent assessment of need in South Lakeland is contained in the 
2013 Cumbria wide Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) . 
This concluded that in South Lakeland there was no need for permanent 
residential pitches or travelling showpeople p lots, but a need for eight transit 
pitches . This was  based on unauthorised encampment activity in the Bardsea 
and Birkrigg Common areas, south of Ulverston.  
4.5.9.3  More recent evidence of unauthorised encampment activity collected by the 
Council (see the Housing  Topic Paper)  suggests that the scale of activity has 
reduced in recent years both in terms of the number of events and the number 
of caravans reported. Our current understanding is therefore that temporary 
stopover provision would possibly  be more appropr iate in meeting needs than 
formal transit pitches which are designed for longer stays.  
4.5.9.4  An update to the Cumbria GTAA was commissioned in 2020 and will provide an 
updated assessment of need which will be taken into account in the Local Plan 
Review. This wi ll inform the setting of a pitch requirement if required, along with 
identifying any sites, if a need for these is highlighted through the study.  
4.5.9.5  Current Local Plan policy for gypsy and traveller  sites is contained within Policy 
DM26 of the Development Man agement Policies DPD. This sets out a criteria 
based policy for assessing any proposals for traveller  sites that may come 
forward. This policy will be reviewed subject to the outcom e of the updated 
Cumbria GTAA.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?

4.6 Theme  6: Supporting a Sustainable Economy  
Objective 6: To support economic growth in ways which are 
compatible with environmental obj ectives, promote a greener 
economy, revitalise town centres and delive r increased 
prosperity for the whole community, including good quality 
and better paid jobs.  
 Key Issue: Developing an Economic Vision and Strategy  
4.6.1.1  South Lakeland district lies at the he art of the Morecambe Bay Economic 
Region which also includes our two partner authorities of Lancaster with its 
knowledge base, and Barrow with its advanced manufacturing expertise.  
Together, these make up an economic region with a population of more than 
320,000, more than 13,000 businesses, 18,000 advanced manufacturing jobs 
and two universities, aligned with economic, environmental, cultural and health 
geographies. All three councils are using their combined weight to secure the 
investment, growth and tr ansport infrastructure that will deliver jobs and 
maintain and enhance quality of life across th e whole Bay67 area.  
4.6.1.2  The three councils have a joint ambition for a thriving and diverse sub -regional 
economy with a skilled workforce, a balanced housing market to meet needs, 
great leisure services to encourage healthy lifestyles and a cultural offer that 
appeal s to residents and visitors alike as well as delivering excellent regulatory 
services. Co -operation and collaboration across the Bay also creates 
opportunities to develop combined approaches to health, carbon reduction and 
tackling deprivation and inequali ty. 
4.6.1.3  The NPPF requires LPAs to set out ‘a clear economic vision and strategy which 
positively and proactively encourages sustainable economic growth, having 
regard to local industrial strategies and other local policies for economic 
development and regenera tion’. The review of the South Lakeland Local Plan 
provides a key opportunity to develop an economic vision and strategy and 
ensure we have the right planning policies and land supply in place to help 
deliver it. In this the NPPF is clear that the role of the Local Plan extends to 
tackling constraints such as infrastructure and housing supply, as well as 
ensuring flexibility to respond to changing needs.  
4.6.1.4  Later in theme 6 we consider if and how planning policies should change to 
help meet the challenges fac ing our town centres.  Earlier in this document,

theme 3 considers local economic and regeneration issues and proposals for 
Kendal, Ulverston , Grange -over-Sands , Milnthorpe and Kirkby Lonsdale and 
also policies which support the rural economy.  
Local Econo my 
4.6.1.5  South Lakeland ’s economy’s strengths include a range of advanced 
manufacturing businesses, in and near Kendal and Ulverston, and also a strong 
tourism sector based on the district’s outstanding landscapes which includes 
parts of the Lake District Nation al Park and World Heritage site  and Yorkshire 
Dales National Park . South Lakeland also benefits from good links to Lancaster 
University and University of Cumbria, and has fast road and rail links to 
London, Manchester airport and Scotland. South Lakeland h as the best 
qualified population in Cumbria and the highest rate of business start -ups. The 
district also has a high concentration of creative and arts –related businesses 
and a developing green economy to help meet the challenges of climate 
change - both o f which offer  potential for future growth.  
Challenges  
4.6.1.6  Looking ahead to plan for the needs of the local economy presents 
unprecedented levels of uncertainty, including Brexit and of course the 
continuing Covid 19 pandemic - the full impacts of which are likely to remain 
unclear for some time. The district hist orically has very low levels of 
unemployment but at one stage in the pandemic  it had the highest rates 
nationally of those on furlough  due to the significance of the hospitality sector 
for local employment . The pandemic has exacerbated the impact of on -line 
shopping trends on our town centres . It has also highlighted the challenge of 
meeting the needs of an aging population and provi ding job opportunities to 
encourage young people to stay and others to return.  Perhaps contrary to 
expectations the housing m arket has strengthe ned locally and nationally.  While 
this is bringing benefits in terms of continued employment and delivery of 
affordable housing, higher house prices add to the long standing challenge of 
affordability for those on low average wages. The re are growing hopes for 
some  economic recovery in the second half of 2021, but there remains the 
likelihood of longer term challenges in meeting the ongoing social, economic  
and health needs of many.  
Steps to Developing an Economic Vision and Strategy  
4.6.1.7  There are several matters that are impo rtant to take into account in setting an 
economic vision and strategy for the Local Plan Review, which are discussed

4.6.1.8  Working in Partnership :  South Lakeland District is working with Lancaster City 
and Barrow i n support of a proposal for a single unitary Council for the 
Morecambe Bay economic region and to develop a Morecambe Bay growth   
188 
 
bid.  The Bay Prosperity and Resilience Strategy  was published in 2020. With a 
combined population of over 320,000, 18,000 adva nced manufacturing jobs 
and two universities, we can use our combined weight to secure the 
investment, growth and transport infrastructure that will deliver jobs and 
maintain and enhance quality of life across the whole Bay area. Working across 
boundaries also means working across other related geographies including the 
Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks, Cumbria County Council and 
Local Economic Partnership and the Borderlands programme.  
4.6.1.9  National and Local Policy : Relevant national policies include the Government’s 
2017 UK Industrial Strategy. Its more recent  policy paper Ten Point Plan for a 
Green Industrial Revolution68 refers to ‘building back better, supporting green 
jobs and accelerating our path to net zero carbon emissions’. It gives examples 
for extra employment in sectors which have potential benefits in South 
Lakeland, including renewable energy, greener building and a lso protection of 
the natural environment and increasing biodiversity. Locally relevant policies 
and strategies include:  
 SLDC’s Council Plan69, a priority of which is ‘working across boundaries to 
deliver economic growth’. SLDC has also approved a Kendal Town Centre 
Management Plan and is developing a forthcomin g Economic Development 
Strategy;  and  
 Kendal Futures published its  Kendal Vision70 document in March 2020. It 
was prepared following extensive local engagement. It focuses on the town’s 
assets (river, historic centre and cultural scene), develops a  range of 
emerging ideas (e.g. for traffic and movement) and then sets out ideas for 
improving a number of opportunity areas in the form of an indicative 
masterplan.  
 Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership’s (LEP) Cumbria’s Local Industrial 
Strategy71 (March 2019) and related documents,  a key ambition of which is 
to ensure inclusive economic growth.   
4.6.1.10  Changes to the Planning System:  In August 2020, the Government consulted 
on a White Paper, Planning for the Future , which may have major implications

for the future of Local Plans. But until the final proposals are known, LPAs are 
urged to press on with updating their Local Plans under the current system.  
4.6.1.11  Recent changes to the Use Classes system will however have a more 
immediate effect on the Local Plan, with implications for planning policies for 
employment and town centres.  The Use Classes Order72 sets out classes of 
land use, within  which changes of use can take place without the need for 
planning permission. Prior to September 202 0, there was a separate use -class 
B1 – Business, including 3 sub -classes for offices, research and development 
and industrial processes suitable in residen tial areas.  From September 202 0 
all of class B1 is now part of a new Use Class E, which means changes 
between these and the following uses ( each previously in separate use 
classes ) can take place without permission:  
 shops  
 financial and professional serv ices,  
 cafes/restaurants  
 indoor sports/fitness,  medical health facilities and   crèche/nurseries   
4.6.1.12  Furthermore earlier in 2021, controversial proposals were consulted on which  
the Government has now confirmed will take effect from September 2021. 
These will allow a change of use to housing on all uses in class E, without a full 
planning application. We look in more detail at the implications of these 
changes later in this theme , which include questions such as:  
 Should we continue allocating new sites (or parts of sites) for B1 uses - or 
protecting existing employment sites which include B1 uses - if we can no 
longer stop these changing to shops, cafes or gyms (and possibly to h ousing 
if current proposals are confirmed)?  
 Should we continue to have policies which protect parts of town centres for 
mainly shopping uses, if we can no longer stop these changing to other uses 
in class E such as gyms , offices  and now housing?   
4.6.1.13  Gatheri ng Relevant Information: To inform the review of policies for 
employment, business and town centre s we are undertaking the following 
studies in 2021:  
 A Strategic Housing and Employment Needs Assessment (SHENA) to 
advise on the  amount, type and location o f employment land required to 
2040  
                                            
72 A range of changes to the Use Class Order came into force on 1st September 2020 through the 
Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020    
190 
 
 A parallel Strategic Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment 
(SHELAA)  to assess which sites are suitable for allocation for employment  
 Updated Town Centre Health checks 
4.6.1.14 An Infrastructure Delivery Plan will be prepared later to assess and cost the 
additional infrastructure and services needed to deliver the employment and 
regeneration proposals in the forthcoming draft Plan.  In view of the changes to 
the Use Classes Order, we do not currently intend to prepare a traditional Retail 
Impact Study, but may consider seeking advice on how the Local Plan could 
help respond to the pressures currently facing town centres. 
 What are the Policy Options or Approaches? 
Policy Approaches 6.1: Developing an Economic Vision and Strategy –  
The proposed approaches to developing an economic vision and strategy 
to ensure we have the right planning policies and land supply in place to 
help deliver it are: 
 Work in partnership  with neighbouring counc ils, including around the 
Bay, Cumbria County Council and Local Enterprise Partnership, 
businesses and infrastructure stakeholders and representatives and 
local communities.  
 Take  account of National and Local policies and strategies , including 
the Bay Resilience and Prosperity Strategy; the strategies of the 
Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership’s (LEP); SLDC’s Council Plan, 
Kendal Town Centre Management Plan and forthcoming Economic 
Development Strategy; and other strategies by local  organisations 
such as Kendal Future’s Kendal Vision.   
 Take account of ch anges to the planning system  including recent 
change to the Use Classes Order  
 Gather relevant Information and evidence

 Key Issue: Scale  and Location of Employment Development   
 What is the Issue?  
4.6.2.1  We want to help current businesses expand and grow the number of higher -
value jobs to retain and attract a skilled workforce, particularly the young. We 
also want to attract new businesses to our area. It is important that Local Plan 
policy is responsive to existing and future economic demands.  
4.6.2.2  In supporting sustainable economic growth and productivity  in South Lakeland, 
a key role of the Local Plan is to determine how much land is needed to meet 
business needs to 2040 and then to ensure a sufficient supp ly of deliverable 
and suitably -located sites. To help with this we are currently undertaking a 
Strategic Housing and Economic Needs Assessment. The Council’s Annual 
Monitoring Report s provide more detail on the current supply of employment 
land and recent rates of development, discussed in the remainder of this 
section.  
Land Supply and Demand  
4.6.2.3  The Core Strategy’s target in 2010 was to provide enough land for about 4 
hectares a year, or 60 hectares, to 2025. Although the later Employment Land 
and Premises Rev iew study in 2012 indicated a need for about 36 hectares, in 
fact the Land Allocations DPD in 2013 allocated over 6073 hectares to allow for 
flexibility and choice.  
4.6.2.4  In the 1 1 years to 2020 , just over 11 hectares of land has been developed 
across the district, an average of about 1.1ha per year. As a result there 
remains about 55ha74 of land, mostly on allocated greenfield sites in Kendal, 
Milnthorpe and the east of the district. This contrasts sharply with Ulverston 
where the  remaining supply of employment land is limited (just over 3ha) as this 
is where most recent employment development has taken place including at  
Siemens at Low Mills, Tritech at Canal Head and the Blue Light hub and other 
commercial and retail development at the Beehive Business Park on Lightburn 
Road .  
4.6.2.5  There has been modest employment development in Kirkby Lonsdale and 
Milnthorpe. As regards supply of land in the Key Service Centres: 4.4ha is 
available in Milnthorpe, in addition to 8ha allocated next to Ma inline Business 
Park; and 1.3 ha has outline consent at Kirkby Lonsdale.  
4.6.2.6  What should our response be to the relatively small take up of new land for 
employment and the relative oversupply of allocated land in the east of the 
district? In contrast it is cl ear that additional employment land is need ed to meet 
                                            
73 The total of 60.95 hectares (gross) includes the employment elemen t of five mixed use land 
allocations.  
74 As at 31 March 2020    
192 
 
a shortfall in the Ulverston area. As noted previously, we will undertake a study 
to investigate the amount and type of employment land needed to 2040, and 
assess if the existing sites are the right siz e, type and location to meet the 
evidence of need. From our early engagement in 2020, we noted that some 
respondents felt the Local Plan should only address genuine local employment 
needs, while others felt that higher levels are needed to support economic  
growth, widen the district’s economic base and support diversification.   
 What are the Policy Options or Approaches  
Policy Approach es 6.2 : Review of Demand and Supply of Employment 
Land  
 A strategic joint review of both employment and housing needs for 
the plan period to 2040, taking account of past rates of development 
and evidence of future demand .  
 A parallel strategic review of sites potentially available to meet 
employment needs, including a review of the continued suitability of 
those allocated emp loyment sites which remain undeveloped.75 
Which of these policy approaches to providing the right 
amount and location of land for employment do you support and why? 
Please give your reasons, noting the relevant reference number, and add 
any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
What scale of economic growth should we be providing for 
and sh ould we plan  only to meet local need or also to attract inward 
investment ? Should we provide for some level of over supply to allow for 
choice and flexibility?  
 Key I ssue: Making Better Use of Greenfield Employment Sites   
4.6.3.1  In the context of what may be seen as an oversupply of employment land, we 
need to reassess the land supply, and in particular several larger greenfield 
sites in the east of the district that have no t yet been developed - although 
some have been subject of development interest. These will be the subject of 
later specific studies, but your views are also welcome at this stage. Questions 
include whether they are still needed to meet market demand, and i f they 
remain suitable in terms of location, constraints and availability? If they are no 
longer needed or suitable, should the sites be considered for de -allocation?  
                                            
75 Please see Theme 2, Section 4.2.6 for more information on the Strategic Housing and Employment 
Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA), including those site suggested in the Call for Sites and th e 
opportunity to assess other sites for consideration, as part of this consultation.    
193 
 
4.6.3.2  If the viability of employment development is the main issue, should higher 
value uses, such as housing or retailing, be accepted on parts of the sites to 
cross -subsidise the less viable employment development? Experience of 
several mixed use allocations in the Local Plan suggest s this is not always the 
solution. If allocating parts of sites for residential use, it would be important to 
consider if the industrial uses are suitable in or near the residential areas. In 
Ulverston at the Beehive Business Park, retail development cross -subsidised 
employment uses, after accepting viability evidence that employment 
development (B1 – office) was unviable on its own. Some business units in the 
planning consent have still to be delivered.  
4.6.3.3  The NPPF advises that policies need to reflect changes in the demand for land. 
It states that where LPAs consider th ere to be no reasonable prospect of an 
application coming forward for the use allocated in a plan,  they should, as part 
of plan review, reallocate the land for a more deliverable use that can help to 
address identified needs or, if appropriate, deallocate  a site which is 
undeveloped.  
4.6.3.4  While individual sites are the subject of more detailed study and later stages of 
public consultation, we would welcome your views on the following broad 
options for the review of undeveloped greenfield sites allocated in the  current 
Local Plan:  
 What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
Policy Option s 6.3 : Employment Land Supply - Making better use of 
allocated greenfield employment sites  
PO6.3/i:  Seek to retain existing allocated employment sites for longer term 
employment developme nt (and also consider active public 
intervention to help bring sites forward for development)  
PO6.3/ii:  Consider de -allocating some larger allocated employment sites 
where there is e vidence of oversupply (and also consider if the y may 
be suitable to allocate for ot her uses)  
PO6.3/iii:  Allocate part of the sites for higher value uses with the purpose of 
cross -subsidising and facilitating less -viable employment 
development   
Which of these policy options for reviewing larger 
greenfield employment allocat ed sites do you support  and why? Please 
give your reasons, noting the reference number, and add any other 
comments or alternative suggestions . 
Can you think of other ways to help facilitate the 
development of larger allocated greenfield sites? If parts of sites were   
194 
 
allocated fo r higher value uses to cross -subsidise employment uses, how 
can we guarantee that the employment uses are delivered?  
 Key Issue: Types of Employment Development  
 What is the Issue?  
4.6.4.1  In planning for an adequate supply of deliverable employment land, we need t o 
review the need not just for the total amount but also for different types and 
market sectors of employment needs, and in different parts of the district. This 
will form an important part of the planned studies.  
4.6.4.2  The current Local Plan se ts out targets a nd allocates sites by market sector:  
 strategic employment ( Scroggs Wood, Kendal & Canal Head, Ulverston )   
 business and science parks  (Burton Road, Kendal and Lightburn Road, 
Ulverston )  
 local employment sites ( 12 other sites across the district )  
It also allocates sites for the following specific use classes, and in locations 
which reflect the overall policy on distribution of development.  
 B1 Business: (business and science parks )  
 B2 General Industrial  
 B8 Storage and Distribution ( e.g. Adjacent to Mainline, Milnthorpe)  
4.6.4.3  In practice the types of employment that have taken place have not always 
corresponded to the categories for which sites were allocated , for example , the 
Lightburn Road allocation site in Ulverston  which is being develop ed for mixed 
use including retail as well as employment use.  Nor has the allocation of sites 
for particular purposes ( e.g. as business and science parks) ensured or 
encouraged these types of development to come forward.   
4.6.4.4  The continued relevance of these c ategories and whether they reflect current 
and future demands for employment related development are key questions for 
the Local Plan Review. For example. to what extent will they have altered as a 
result of the covid -19 pandemic, in the light of greatly i ncreased home working? 
As part of the Plan review we will need to engage with local businesses, 
representative groups, commercial employment land developers and the 
Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership for their experience and views on current 
and future n eeds for different types and sectors of employment land needs 
across the district.  Other matters which will impact on how we plan and provide 
for different types of employment are discussed below:  
National Policy and Changes to the Use Classes Order   
4.6.4.5  The NPPF advises that planning policies need to reflect changes in the demand 
for land, be flexible to adapt to rapid change and either set criteria or identify   
195 
 
strategic sites, for local and inward investment. It also advises that policies 
should address the  locational requirements for different sectors, including 
provision for clusters of knowledge and data driven, creative or high technology 
industries and for storage and also distribution operations at various scales and 
accessible locations.  
4.6.4.6  As noted ear lier in the section, the Government has significantly changed the 
way in which we categorise land uses for planning purposes in the Use Classes 
order. This means that B1 -Business land use class and its sub -use classes: 
B1(a), B1(b) and B(c) are now include d within a new single Use Class E – 
‘Commercial, business and services’ along with other uses. General Industrial 
(B2 use) and Storage and distribution (B8) are not included in the new class E  
4.6.4.7  It is therefore no longer clear if it remains possible to restr ict employment sites 
allocated for B1 (a), (b) or (c) use classes, as these are now within the ‘new’ 
use class E and could be changed , without the need for planning permission , to 
other uses  in Class E such as shops, offices, cafes , gyms  and (now) housing . 
Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)   
4.6.4.8  The Cumbria LEP’s emerging Cumbria Employment Sites and Premises study 
(CESP) considers Cumbria’s employment land needs to 2033 and identifies 
priority sites of which can be supported by the LEP and its partners. The study 
includes five employment sites allocated in the South Lakeland Local Plan, 
which it categorises as ‘local priority sites’ or other ‘local sites’. The study also 
refers to ‘growth drivers’ linked to existing strengths. These include logistics, 
the M6 motorway and opportunities to develop a  network of ‘final mile’ sites 
aligned to growth in on -line retailing. Other potential growth sectors (pre -Covid 
19) included a greater need for flexible workspace, smaller workspace (even 
with increased home working) and growth in the food and drink secto r. 
4.6.4.9  The emerging CESP study also identifies the need for an ‘opportunity site’ in 
south -east South Lakeland to attract inward investment into Cumbria,  which it 
categorises as a strategic ‘regional site’. The study does not identify a specific 
location, and advises that  ‘… the identification of a site would require further 
consideration through the Local Plan review process, taking into account 
factors such as the economic benefits of such a development, infrastructure 
provision, accessibility, deliverability , commercial  interest and sustainability’ . 
Regeneration and Opportunity Areas  
4.6.4.10  The current Local Plan identifies a mixed use ‘Regeneration Opportunity Area’ 
at Canal Head, Ulverston (Policy LA5.4). Policy DM24 also sets a policy 
framework for the developme nt and regeneration of the Canal Head Area in 
Kendal. The Local Plan Review provides a chance for other regeneration 
opportunity areas to be identified. Kendal Future’s Kendal Vision  document, for 
example, sets out ideas for improving a number of opportunity areas in Kendal   
196 
 
the form of an indicative masterplan.  Those which have commercial and 
business elements include areas at and near the Railway Station, Westmorland 
Shopping Centre and town centre, Canal Head and Brewery Arts Centre, 
Highgate and Waterside.  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
4.6.4.11  The updated evidence base on needs will recommend types of employment 
uses and existing and potential future employment gr owth sectors having 
regard to NPPF policy and market signals. We ask questions after the following 
policy options about future growth sectors and how policy can be responsive 
and adaptive to change.  
Policy Approaches  6.4: Providing the right types of emplo yment sites  
 In response to changes to the Use Classes Order, consider whether 
to allocate employment sites only for B2 (general industry) and B8 
(storage and distribution) uses; or whether also to explore ways of 
also allocating former B1 (offices etc.) uses, in ways which would 
prevent their change to other uses such as shops, cafes and gyms.   
 Consider allocating employment sites only where there is a potential 
end user and introducing a criteria -based policy for employment 
proposals which arise after  the adoption of the plan.  
 Review whether the three employment land market sector types in 
the current Local Plan remain appropriate : strategic employment 
sites; business and science parks; and sites for local employment.  
 Consider the principle of allocati ng a regional scale employment site 
in the south east of the District in proximity to the M6 motorway.  
 Consider identifying Regeneration Opportunity Areas where this 
designation and appropriate policies could promote and guide their 
mixed -use redevelopmen t and regeneration.  
 Consider policies and site designations which would promote 
particular growth sectors such as the green economy or food and 
drink based business es for example.  
Which of these policy approaches to providing the right 
types of employment  sites do you support and why? Please give your 
reasons, noting the relevant reference numbers, and add any other 
comments or alternative suggestions .

 Key Issue: Existing Employment Areas   
 What is the Issue?  
4.6.5.1  Significant economic changes are likely to occ ur over the Plan period up to 
2040. We are all aware of the current impacts from Covid -19 and Brexit and 
greatly increased home working. But other longer term trends relate to 
technological advances, the growing digital economy and changes to working 
trend s relating to growth in automation and artificial intelligence.  The Local 
Plan policy approach to business employment needs to adapt to these changes 
and be suitably flexible.  
4.6.5.2  In that  context, Local Pl an Policy LA1.5 currently seeks to retain in employme nt 
use, 54 developed employment sites in the district, including long -established 
industrial estates and business parks. We refer to these as Existing 
Employment Areas . The sites range in size from large industrial estates and 
individual business premises such as Croppers at Burneside and Oxley’s in 
Ulverston, to smaller business premises, including a number in rural areas. 
Taken together these sites make an important con tribution to the area’s 
continuously changing need (or ‘churn’) for employment floorspace. Policy 
LA1.5 indicates the acceptable use classes for each site but does not preclude 
ancillary or subsidiary uses, nor override existing use rights.  
4.6.5.3  Our evidence fr om monitoring shows that in a number of employment sites 
(such as Shap Road, Kendal) there’s been some loss of floorspace to non -
employment uses such as gyms and to premises with an element of retailing. 
Some sites already contain differing uses, including  sui generis76 uses such as 
car show rooms. A key issue for the Local Plan Review is therefore whether we 
should continue to protect these existing employment sites for mainly 
employment uses?  
4.6.5.4  Recent changes at a national level promote greater flexibility i n uses within 
employment sites. As noted earlier, the amended Use Classes Order means it 
is harder to prevent some business uses (including offices, research and 
development and light industrial units) in existing employment areas changing 
to other uses su ch as shops, cafes and gyms. Other permitted development 
rights for example also allow B1 uses to change to residential, and the 
Government has very recently approved its proposals which will allow the 
various commercial uses in the new Class E to change t o residential, subject to 
prior approval on certain matters by the LPA.  
4.6.5.5  In terms of national planning policy, the latest advice in the NPPF states that 
“… LPAs should also take  a positive approach to applications for alternative 
                                            
76 Sui generis –'Sui generis ' is a Latin term that, in this context, means  'in a class of its own'. Certain 
uses  are specifically defined  and excluded from classification b y legislation, and therefore become ' sui 
generis '   
198 
 
uses of land which is curr ently developed but not allocated for a specific 
purpose in plans, where this would help to meet identified development needs. 
In particular they should support proposals to use retail and employment land 
for homes in areas of high housing demand, provided  this would not undermine 
key economic sectors or sites or the viability or vitality of town centres and 
would be compatible with other policies in the NPPF …”  
4.6.5.6  If we do not take forward a policy to retain employment areas in mainly 
employment uses, some po ssible implications are set out below:  
Opportunities  Threats  
 More flexibility to respond to 
changing needs.  
 Increased homeworking, for 
example, may require less 
B1 office accommodation, so 
flexibility to change this to 
other uses could be positive 
as part of a response to 
over-supply.   
 Parts of some existing 
employment sites may be 
suitable for non -employment 
and other uses .  Higher -value Class E uses (such as 
gyms, crèches, retail, food and drink, 
dwellings) may displace B1 business 
uses (offices, light industry, research 
and development) and make it harder 
for these to obtain affordable 
accommodation and sites.    
 This threat is to ‘traditional’ industrial 
estates, business parks and estates 
with small units for small and medium 
sized enterprises ( e.g. Beezon Road  
Estate and Fell View Trading Park, 
Kendal) - particularly if premises are on 
shorter term leases ra ther than 
freehold.   
Table 21: Opportunities and threats – Employment space  
What are the Policy Options or Approaches?  
Policy Options 6.5 : Existing Employment Areas  
PO6.5/i:  Review the existing employment sites in the Local Plan and in future  
protect  only the larger sites and premises (including large single 
employers ), which comprise mainly B2 (general industry) and B8 
(storage and distribution) uses  
This approach limit s protection to B2 and B8 uses where effective planning 
control re mains. It would no longer seek to retain B1 uses (offices, light 
industry, research and development) as planning controls to prevent their 
changes to other uses are now severely restricted.  
PO6.5/ii:  To no longer seek to identify and protect any existing employment 
areas in the reviewed Local Plan.     
199 
 
This approach would allow more flexibility in response to changing economic 
needs within employment sites, but by accepting more non -employment uses , 
would reduce the supply of developed employment land and premises curr ently 
available to various light industrial uses.  
Which of these policy options for reviewing existing 
development employment sites do you support  and why? Please give 
your reasons, noting the reference number s, and add ing any other 
comments or alternative  suggestions .   
Can you suggest other ways to protect land and premises 
for light industrial uses  or to increase the supply by other means?  If we 
can’t protect all light industrial uses by t he current ‘blanket approach’, 
which light industrial sites or  uses should we seek to protect?  
 Key Issue: Town Centre Viability  – Defining Boundaries and 
appropriate uses   
What is the Issue?  
Changes in Town Centres  
4.6.6.1  Our town centres are at the heart of our local communities.  They are places 
where we experience social interaction, access key services and facilities, as 
well as work, live and visit. They provide opportunities for new commercial and 
other enterprises an d contribute significantly to the identity and character of our 
towns as a whole.  How we use town centres and the way we do our shopping 
is changing. National trends for increased online shopping, together with 
potentially more leisure and food and drink uses, and possibly residential use, 
are likely to change significantly the nature and function of our town centres. 
We need to consider how our town centres can continue to evolve in a way that 
supports wider needs such as access to quality jobs, housing, services and 
facilities, entertainment and leisure. We therefore need to ask what the vision 
for our town centres should be, and how  they will function as places. In doing 
so we need to question whether our town centres should see a different mix of 
uses t o help deliver these vision s. 
4.6.6.2  We are already seeing some changes. We are seeing some town centre uses 
being approved in out of town locations, such as leisure  and gyms on industrial 
estates. Main town centre uses are defined in the National Planning Policy  
Framework (NPPF)77. We are also seeing more upper floors in  the larger town 
                                            
77 National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), 2019, Definition of ‘Main town centre uses’: Retail 
development (including warehouse clubs  and factory outlet centres); leisure; entertainment and more 
intensiv e sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive -through restaurants, bars 
and pubs, nightclubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres and bingo halls);   
200 
 
centres  being converted from ancillary retail storage to residential use . In town 
centres generally over the past few years, it is noticeable that there have been 
increases in some  sectors and declines in others. There have been increases 
in food and drink businesses and in service and experience -based businesses 
such as : beauty; hair dressers and nail bars.  
4.6.6.3  In some town centres, such as Grange -over-Sands, financial services  have 
been closing.  We have also lost the Beales department store in Kendal. 
Evidence from the Council’s annual vacant shops survey shows that vacancy 
rates vary significantly in the district, with Kirkby Lonsdale having relatively low 
vacancy rates and Milnthorpe having the highest vacancy rates compared to 
the other town centres. Since December 2019 Kendal and Ulverston have seen 
rates increasing. This could be due to the economic impact of the Covid -19 
Pandemic or other economic impacts such as  competition  from increased 
online or out of town shopping.

4.6.6.4  Given the national context of changes to retailing and high streets , there is a 
need for more flexibility and promotion of mixed uses within t own centre s, so 
that towns can re -purpose and diversify . Recent Government c hanges to the 
Use Clas ses order , including the new u se class E , alre ady introduces increased 
flexibility , allowing changes between some use classes  without the need for full 
planning permission . Following recent consultation, this includes changes of 
                                            
offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including t heatres, museums, galleries and 
concert halls, hotels and conference facilities).

use to residential from use class E without full planning permission. These 
reductions  in planning controls will inevitably result in the loss of town centre 
retail floorspace to ot her uses within Class E and also to residential use.   
National Planning Po licy 
4.6.6.5  The 2019 National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  defines ‘town centres’. It 
also advises that planning policies should:  
 take a positive approach to town centres  growth, adaptation and 
management;  
 define a network and hierarchy of town centres and pr omote their long 
term vitality and viability, by allowing them to grow and diversify in a 
way that can grow and respond to rapid changes in th e retail and 
leisure industries;  
 allow a suitable mix of uses (including housing) and reflect their 
distinctive ch aracters;  
 make clea r the range of uses permitted in town cen tres and primary 
shopping areas; and  
 recognise  that residential development often plays an important role in 
ensuring the vitality of centres and encourage residential development 
on appropriate sites.  
4.6.6.6   The 2019 NPPF advises that planning policy should:  
 define t he extent of town centres and primary shopping areas and 
make clear the range of uses permitted..; and   
 town centre boundaries should be kept under review where 
necessary.   
4.6.6.7  The NPPF does not explicitly refer to primary and secondary shopping or retail 
frontages. Nation al Planning Practice Guidance ( PPG, 2019) advises that local 
authorities, may, where appropriate, define primary and secondary retail 
frontages where the ir use can be justified in supporting the vitality and viability 
of particular centres.  
Current Local Plan policy  
4.6.6.8  Core Strategy Policy CS7.5 identifies a hierarchy of centres and the nature and 
type of services and facilities each should provide. It includes a retail and town 
centre strategy for the five defined town centres of Kendal, Ulve rston, Grange -
over-Sands, Kirkby Lonsdale and Milnthorpe. The policy specifically refers to 
retail, business, cultural and leisure services. Under current national planning 
policy, proposals for main town centre uses outside of town centres are subject 
to the sequential test. This test requires applicants to demonstrate they have 
considered suitable sites within town centres first, if none available, then next   
202 
 
consider edge of centre and again if nothing available only then consider out of 
centre sites.  
4.6.6.9  Town centre boundaries for Kendal, Ulverston, Milnthorpe, Grange -over-Sands 
and Kirkby Lonsdale are defined in our current Local Plan. The purpose of 
these boundaries is to seek to maintain and enhance the vitality, viability and 
sustainability of the distric t’s town centres. The town centre boundaries defined 
on the Local Plan Policies Map are the preferred location for leisure, 
entertainment, food and drink, arts, tourism and office uses. Primary Shopping 
areas are also defined on the policies map, and are t he preferred location for 
shopping development. Policy DM24 allows for residential development in the 
Kendal Primary Shopping Areas at first floor level or above provided it does not 
undermine the viability and vitality of its predominant retail function.  
4.6.6.10  Primary and secondary retail frontages are also defined on the policies map for 
each of the five centres. On primary frontages retail uses should predominate, 
within secondary frontages a greater mix of town centre uses will be permitted.  
4.6.6.11  Town centre and Primary shopping area boundaries will be reviewed as part of 
the Local plan review having regard to appropriate evidence including a Town 
Centre Health Check Assessment for each of the five centres.  
What are the Policy Options  and Approaches ? 
4.6.6.12  The policy approaches relating to defining town centres and setting out the 
range of uses  in town centres , are set out below. Please also refer to Theme 3 
which includes commentary about the district’s five town centres (Kendal, 
Ulverston, Milnthorpe, Grange -over-Sands and Kirkby Lonsdale), asking 
questions about the future role of each town centre.  
Policy Approaches 6.6:  Town Centre Viability - Defining boundaries and 
appropriate uses  
 Review and amend the existing five town centre boundaries  and 
primary shoppi ng areas , reflecting on updated evidence and any 
changing national policy and guidance , as well as opportunities for 
new development  identified in strategies and studies . 
 Support wider town centre visions and strategies , and specify where 
residential devel opment may be appropriate taking account of latest 
national policy and changes in permitted development rights .

4.7 Theme  7: Greener Travel, Transport and 
Infrastructure Delivery  
Objective 7: To ensure that development is supported by 
essential infrastructure and services and promotes safe 
movement and more sustainable modes of travel by enhancing 
greener travel networks for walking, cycling and public 
transport  
 Key Issue: Greener Travel Networks  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.1.1  Having access to and promoting the use of good quality walking, cycling and 
public transport enables people to travel by sustainable means thereby 
reducing levels of pollution and carbon emissions.  Walking and cycling are 
active ways to travel and therefore  a healthier option than using motorized 
vehicles.  Public transport enables people to travel who do not have access  to 
the private car , helping to address inequalities  in accessibility . 
4.7.1.2  Existing greener travel links which include rights of way, cycle routes, 
pavements, rail and bus routes are movement corridors linking our  housing and 
employment areas with our town centres, services and facilities, employment 
areas, open spaces, and open countryside. The district’s rural nature  and 
factors relating to physical constraints  including  narrow roads, topography, 
historic pattern s of development, and natural features including  rivers can act 
as barriers to enhancing levels of provision. Many rural parts of our district have 
limited access to public transport service provision78 meaning there is little 
choice other than to access se rvices a nd facilities by private motoris ed means. 
Our towns and villages  have varied  levels of access to public transport service 
provision . Frequency of level of service is an issue, limited to mainly daytime, 
and often at hourly intervals . Links between the west and the east of the region 
for example Ulverston and Kendal  are not conducive for making short trips by 
rail or bus  between the two towns.  
4.7.1.3  There is support as evidenced through the consultation feedback to improve 
and provide more green travel lin ks, with priority given over to pedestrians and 
cyclists above the private car. Many people feel public transport pro vision 
needs enhancing, and there should be more and  better linked walking and 
cycling routes. Existing greener travel  links and levels of provision should 
therefore be safeguarded and opportunities to plug gaps and enhance them be 
acted on. New developments should be served by existing links as far as

possible, and enhancements to them or provision of new links provided where 
necessary  as set out in current Local Plan Policy DM5 (walking and cycling) . 
Policy CS10.1 sets out the Council’s commitment to improve bus routes.  
4.7.1.4  A Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan  (LCWIP ) is being developed 
for Kendal . LCWIPs set out in the Government’s Cycling and Walking 
Investment Strategy, are a strate gic approach to identifying cycling and walking 
improvements required at the local level. They enable a long -term approach to 
developing local cycling and walking networks, ideally over a 10 year period. 
The end product  will comprise network plans  for cycling and walking and 
include a prioriti sed programme of infrastructure improvements for future 
investment.  The Cumbria Cycling Strategy 2017 - 2279 provides a framework in 
which to enhance and provide new cycling infrastructure across the district.  
4.7.1.5  Site specific policies for proposed site allocations will identify how existing 
walking and cycling  links should be protected and enhanced where these  may 
be affected by new development and include requirements setting out how new 
links should be created.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.7.1.6  There is an option to continue with current Policy (DM5)  which protects existing 
greener travel networks, and requires new development  where necessary to 
enhance them, and/or provide new links in order to connect into them , 
amending / updating  as necessary.  
Policy Approach 7.1: Greener Travel Networks  
 Continue with current Policy (DM5) which protects existing greener 
travel networks, and requires new development where necessary to 
enhance them and/or provide new links to connect into the network 
and amend/update policy  as necessary . 
Do you  support this policy approach to greener travel 
networks? Please give your reasons, noting the relevant reference 
number, and any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
Are there places where walking and cycling is difficult? Are 
there gaps in the network? Please i ndicate on a map where. How can we 
improve things?

 Key Issue: Achieving Safe access and addressing transport impacts  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.2.1  Development proposals must be supported by safe means of access for all 
modes of transport (people on foot, bicycle, or  using private and public 
transport). Consultation feedback has highlighted concerns that future growth 
and development may result in  more trips made by the car and  further 
congestion and may locally cause safety concerns. The safety and 
considerations of pedestrians and cyclists and those with limited forms of 
mobility must therefore be given priority above  motorised  vehicle users.  
 
Figure 3 7: Consideration of safe access  
4.7.2.2  Existing road networks must have sufficient capacity to accommodate new 
development to ensure it doesn’t generate unacceptable levels of traffic that 
might cause safety risks or delays. Current Local Plan Policy CS10.2 specifies 
Transport Statements, asses sments and travel plans may be required to 
accompany development proposals in order to determine likely implications for 
achieving safe access and acceptable levels of traffic generation.  Current 
national policy specifies development should only be prevent ed or refused on 
highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, 
or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.  Local 
Plan Policies  DM1 and CS10.2 specify that proposals must provide for safe and 
conven ient access of pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles and that the 
proposal is capable of being served by safe access to the highway network.  
  
207 
 
4.7.2.3  In deciding on where best to locate new development we need to consider both 
the individual and cumulative impac ts it may result in for our road networks and 
the extent to which safe access can be achieved. Parts of our existing road 
networks particularly within Kendal Town Centre and along the A590 in 
Ulverston can be affected by traffic flow time delays at key jun ctions. District -
wide west -east connections do not necessarily support economic growth on 
account of lengthy journey times. We need to therefore measure the potential 
impacts of growth options for our road networks in this respect. Development 
consequentia lly may give rise to the need for  mitigation and/or  enhancements  
to existing transport infrastructure in order to achieve safe means of access , 
and/or ensure there is no additional traffic congestion .  
4.7.2.4  We need to also ensure new development protects transp ort routes offering 
opportunities for future infrastructure improvements, for example the Lancaster 
Canal, and disused railway lines as well as any road, rail or cycle schemes 
under formal consideration  for example the Kendal Northern Access Route . 
The exi sting Local Plan Policy DM 10 seeks to ensure this is the case.  
What are the Policy Options  and Approaches ? 
4.7.2.5  There is the option to update current policy relating to addressing transport 
impacts, and achieving safe access in light of new evidence and guidelines , 
taking account of  needs and impacts arising from potential growth options and 
site allocations. Site specific requirements will be identified in site specific 
allocation policies.  There is the option to also identify and safeguard future 
transp ort routes including aspirations for new roads, cycle and pedestrian 
routes in order to ensure new development does not compromise these being 
delivered.  
Policy Approaches 7.2: Achieving Safe Access and addressing transport 
impacts  
 Update current Policy (CS10.2) relating to addressing transport 
impacts and achieving safe access in light of new evidence and 
guidelines.  Ensure movement on foot and cycle is prioritised above 
those using vehicles  
 Retain current Policy (DM10)  for safeguarding routes for transpo rt 
improvements including aspirations for new roads, cycle and 
pedestrian routes , and safeguard these in order to ensure new 
development does not compromise them being delivered, and 
update/amend policy  as necessary . 
 Retain current policy that ensures tran sport infrastructure can 
support the needs generated by new development , and is improved 
where necessary, and that development  does not cause   
208 
 
unacceptable traffic generation, and update/amend this policy  as 
necessary . 
 Identify transport requirements within  site specific policies for 
proposed site allocations clarifying access points and arrangements, 
safe pedestrian and cycle access to the site  
Which of  these policy approaches to achieving safe access 
and addressing transport impacts do you support  and why ? Please give 
your reasons, noting the relevant reference numbers, and any other 
comments or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Parking Provision  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.3.1  New development can give rise to the need for additional parking provision. Not 
enough pa rking provision can cause highways safety concerns and local 
amenity conflicts. The current Local Plan Policy DM9 sets out how we 
determine appropriate levels of car parking provision to serve needs of 
developments. The Council relies on Cumbria County Cou ncil guidelines to 
inform levels of appropriate provision an d uses their  advice to inform decisions 
in respect to ensuring new development is provided by adequate provision.  
What are the Options?  
4.7.3.2  There is the option to continue with Policy DM9 and amend a s appropriate, 
taking account of any changes in national planning policy regarding use of local 
parking standards and guidelines.  
Policy Approach 7.3: Parking Provision  
 Retain current policy (DM9)  and amend/update as necessary  to take 
account of any new s tandards and guidelines, and changing 
demands , including in response to climate change crisis (example 
emphasis on electric and other greener powered vehicles)  
Do you support this policy approach  to Parking Provision ? 
Please give your reasons, noting the relevant reference numbers, and any 
other comments or alternative suggestions .    
209 
 
 Key Issue: Infrastructure Delivery and Developer Contributions  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.4.1  Under current Local Plan Policy (DM1) development is con sidered acceptable 
provided it ensures the provision of necessary infrastructure needs it may 
generate in a sustainable and viable manner. Such infrastructure will most likely 
include major services such as electricity and water supply, digital services, a nd 
may include others such as roads, school and health facilities. The extent to 
which an area is currently and can be served well by infrastructure is an 
important consideration in determining where to locate development, how much 
and the type of suitable  uses in any location. Consultation feedback cites 
current levels and quality of infrastructure ( including roads, public transport, 
utilities and access to community, health, education and leisure facilities) as 
constraints to new development.   
4.7.4.2  Plans shoul d set out the types of infrastructure provision needed to support the 
delivery of the Local Plan. Infrastructure needs arising from current Local Plan 
planned growth are identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan80 (IDP).  The 
Council must work closely with infrastructure providers in order to determine 
needs and how these can best be de livered, ensuring these are accounted for 
in investment programmes and plans. Further evidence base gathering will be 
undertaken to ascertain likely impacts of growth options and site specific 
impacts for infrastructure, and existing strategies and studies  will be used as 
baseline evidence. Cumulative as well as site -specific impacts must be 
considered and addressed.  The IDP will be updated once further information is 
gained around likely needs arising from future planned growth in the next Local 
Plan.  
4.7.4.3  The Cumbria Infrastructure Plan 2016 sets out strategic infrastructure identifie d 
in a prioriti sed schedule of projects which include the following:  
 Priority Transport Infrastructure schemes identified in Cumbria Local 
Industrial Strategy -A590 Improvements  including a Ulverston by -pass  
 Kendal Northern Access Route  
 Lakes Line – electrification and capacity improvements  
 Furness Line – line speed and capacity improvements and 
electrification  
 Cumbrian Coast Line – capacity and line speed improvements  
 West Coast  Main Line – increased capacity  
4.7.4.4  Plans should also contain policies informed by evidence of infrastructure, 
setting out the contribut ions expected from development. Such p olicies should 
                                            
80 https://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/media/4287/ infrastructure -delivery -plan-august -2017.pdf  
   
210 
 
not undermine the deliverability of the plan , and therefore costs assoc iated with 
contributions should be identified and need to be part of the viability appraisal 
of the Plan . Policies should ensure infrastructure strategies are in place for 
sites as a whole; to make sure development that comes forward in phases is 
coordinated and integrated.  
4.7.4.5  Planning Obligations also known as Developer contributions (Section 106 
agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy  CIL) are currently used to 
help secure delivery of infrastructure and affordable housing that is required t o 
support demands and policy asks  in order to make a development acceptable 
in planning terms . Planning obligations must only be sought where they meet 
all of the following tests81: 
 Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;  
 Directly re lated to the development; and  
 Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development  
4.7.4.6  Current Local Plan Policy CS9.2 in conjunction with the CIL regulations is the 
policy mechanism used to require  planning obligations.  Other sources of 
funding  are also used to help fund and deliver infrastructure. Examples of 
where developer contributions are currently used to help fund and deliver 
infrastructure include improvements of play areas and green space, highways 
measures, and provision of school plac es. New development can therefore 
provide opportunities to enhance existing levels of infrastructure, or result in 
investment. Section 106 agreements are currently used to secure affordable 
housing. The Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS)82 sets out how  much CIL 
and S106 agreements have been collected and spent in 2019 -2020. It includes 
an Infrastructure List which is kept under review  specifying the infrastructure 
items which the Council will fund wholly or in part through CIL.  
4.7.4.7  A key issue for the next Local Plan is how we secure contributions  from new 
development  to fund infrastructure that is needed  to enable its delivery.  The 
government is currently consulting on potential changes to how local p lanning 
authorities s ecure development contributions, rem oving the Community 
Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 agreements and introducing a single 
obligation in the form of an Infrastructure Levy. How the Plan will therefore 
addresses this issue will be informed by any future  national policy  changes in 
this respect.

What are the Policy  Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Approaches 7.4: Infrastructure Delivery and Developer 
Contributions  
 Update current policy in line with latest government policy and 
guidance  to provide clarity on the role of de veloper contributions in 
facilitating  infrastructure delivery . 
 Include a requirement for infrastructure strategies setting out how 
infrastructure will be delivered across  whole site allocations to 
ensure phased development  on such sites is coordinated and 
integrated . 
 Ensure infrastructure requirements are identified for proposed site 
allocations and set out in site specific policies , and costs are factored 
into the viability appraisal of the plan.  
 Retain and amend/update current policy as necessary that req uires 
new development to be supported by the provision of all necessary 
infrastructure needs it may generate for example the major services 
(including energy, digital technology, surface and foul water disposal, 
health and education provision)  
 Undertake n ecessary assessments of infrastructure capacity, and 
identify current constraints to inform choices over development 
strategy growth options and proposed site allocations . 
Which of  these policy approaches to Infrastructure Delivery 
and Developer Contributions do you support  and why ? Please give your 
reasons, noting the relevant reference numbers, and any other comments 
or alternative suggestions .  
 Key Issue: Broadband and Digital Infrastructure  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.5.1  Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential 
for economic growth and social well -being. National planning policy specifies 
policies should set out how high quality digital infrastructure, providing access 
to services from a range of providers, is expected to be delivered and upgraded 
over time, and should prioritise full fibre connections to new developments. 
New build development too frequently suffers from delays in the installation of 
internet infrastructure, and poor, unreliable or low speed connectivity. It is 
recognised that parts of the district do not yet benefit from universal high speed 
broadband coverage and that in some cases new build developments may be   
212 
 
located in areas without  high speed coverage. Whilst coverage continues to 
improve, o ngoing initiatives including the Connecting Cumbria Project aim to 
deliver improvements to fibre connectivity and mobile connectivity across the 
County. The recent Government Project Gigabit (a £5 billion scheme that aims 
to boost full fibre broadband coverage to “hard to reach” locations which 
includes Cumbria), may assist in improving access to broadband in areas of 
South Lakeland.  
4.7.5.2  Current Local Plan Policy DM8 requires new residential developme nt sites of 2 
or more dwellings and commercial development to demonstrate how future 
occupi ers will be provided with sufficient broadband connectivity. However, this 
policy was adopted under provisions of previous national policy.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
4.7.5.3  There is the option to retain current policy DM8 and amend/update as 
necessary.  
Policy Approach 7.5: Broadband and Digital Infrastructure  
 Retain current Policy (DM8) that requires new residential 
development of 2 more dwellings and c ommercial development to 
demonstrate how future occupiers will be provided with sufficient 
broadband connectivity  and amend/update policy as necessary . 
Do you  support this policy approach  to Broadband and 
Digital Infrastructure ? Please give your reasons, n oting the relevant 
reference numbers, and any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
 Key Issue: Development Viability  
What is the Issue?  
4.7.6.1  Through the plan -making process, the Local Authority must undertake a 
proportionate assessment of viability that ta kes into account all relevant 
policies, and local and national standards including the cost implications of the 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and section 106. Viability assessment 
should not compromise sustainable development but should be used to en sure 
that policies are realistic, and that the total cumulative cost of all relevant 
policies will not undermine deliverability of the plan.  Policy requirements should 
be clear so that they can be accurately accounted for in the price paid for the 
land. Policy requirements, particularly for affordable housing, should be set at a 
level that takes account of affordable housing and infrastructure  needs and 
allows for the planned types of sites and development to be deliverable, without 
the need for further viability assessment at the decision making stage.    
213 
 
4.7.6.2  Where up -to-date policies have set out the contributions expected from 
development, plannin g applications that comply with them should be assumed 
to be viable. It is up to the applicant to demonstrate whether particular 
circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment at the application 
stage. Once a new Local Plan is adopted, no site -specific viability assessment 
should be required and developers should factor into their land buying 
decisions the cost of planning obligations (including affordable housing). Other 
costs associated with net -biodiversity gain, accessible homes, future homes  
standards and zero carbon should also be factored into account.  The price paid 
for land is not a relevant justification for failing to accord with relevant policies in 
the plan. Landowners and site purchasers should consider this when agreeing 
land transa ctions.  
4.7.6.3  There may be cases where a need for a viability assessment at the application 
stage is necessary. This could include for example where development is 
proposed on unallocated sites of a wholly different type to those used in viability 
assessment tha t informed the plan; where further information on infrastructure 
or sites costs is required; where particular types of development are proposed 
which may significantly vary from standard models of development or sale 
(example housing for older people), or where economic changes have occurred 
since the plan was brought into force. Viability assessments should be informed 
by the principles set out in current National Planning Guidance including key 
elements (standard inputs) of gross development value, costs,  land value, 
landowner premium, and developer return. The types of costs to be included in 
a viability assessment include build costs, abnormal costs (for example those 
associated with treatment for contaminated sites), site -specific infrastructure 
costs f or example sustainable drainage systems, total cost of all relevant policy 
requirements, general finance costs, professional/project management, sales, 
marketing and legal costs as well as contingency costs. Under current Local 
Plan policy, developers may challenge policy requirements if they feel by 
adhering to them it may make a scheme too costly to build. Where this might be 
the case, a viability assessment may be submitted with a planning application 
in order to provide reasoning and justification for n ot applying a policy 
requirement, for example a reduction in affordable housing provision.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Approaches 7.6: Development Viability  
 Undertake a full viability appraisal of the plan that considers the total 
costs of all relevant policy requirements including contributions 
expected from development towards affordable housing and 
infrastructure  and Community Infrastructure Levy charges .   
214 
 
 Consider including a policy that sets out circumstances where a 
need for a vi ability assessment at the application stage is necessary . 
Which of  these policy approaches to Development Viability 
do you support  and why ? Please give your reasons, noting the relevant 
reference numbers, and any other comments or alternative suggestions .  
In what circumstances might a need for a viability 
assessment at the application stage be necessary? What types of 
developments might it be considered justified for a viability assessment  
to be submitted at the application stage?  
Which type of proposed si te allocations might justify the 
need for a detailed viability assessment rather than reliance on 
assessment of samples of sites through the Plan -making process?

4.8 Theme  8: Enhancing the Natural and Built 
Environment  
Objective 8: To protect and enhance the district’s  varied and 
high quality environment, including through quality design: 
key elements include its natural landscapes, biodiversity, 
settlement character, and rich historic -built environment and 
cultural assets  
 Key Issue:  Protection and Enhancement of Designated Landscapes  
What is the Issue?  
4.8.1.1  South Lakeland has a rich, high quality natural and built heritage, which is  
greatly valued by both residents and visitors  to the district . In terms of 
designated landscapes, the South  Lakeland Local Plan area is adjacent to, and 
within the setting of, the Lake District National Park (now a designated World 
Heritage Site), and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It also contains part of 
the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natu ral Beauty  (AONB) . This 
review of the South Lakeland Local Plan includes district -wide policies relating 
to the AONB, but will not review the AONB Development Plan Document (DPD) 
itself, which was prepared recently with Lancaster City Council and adopted i n 
March 2019.   
4.8.1.2  The NPPF requires Local Plans to contain strategic policies on the 
conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic environment, 
including landscapes and green infrastructure. National policy states that great 
weight should be  given to conserving and enhancing the landscape , scenic 
beauty and wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks and AONBs . A 
Government  consultation83 earlie r this year  (Feb. 2021) proposed adding that 
any development within the settings  of National Parks and AONBs  ‘should be 
sensitively located and designed so as to avoid adverse impacts on the se 
designated landscapes ’.   
4.8.1.3  Current Local Plan policies are considered to be very largely i n accordance with 
the NPPF in requiring new development to demonstrate in their location and 
design that they protect, conserve and enhance the special qualities of the 
National Parks  and the AONB, including their settings. T hese comprise Core

 Key Issue: Protecting and Enhancing Nature  Conservation Assets  
and Delivering Biodiversity Net Gain  
What is the Issue?  
4.8.2.1  The Local Plan has a key role to play in protecting and enhancing important 
areas of biodiversity and geodiversity and encouraging the provision of new 
habitats. The Council adopted a corporate biodiversity policy in December 
2019 , which recognises the ser ious challenges for local and global biodiversity 
and the interrelationship with climate change, and commits the authority to 
taking action to protect and enhance biodiversity in all that it does. The overa ll 
aim for the Local Plan i s to review policies in  order to help deliver a significant 
net gain in the district’s o verall biodiversity value, and to enhance the ability of 
ecological networks to adapt to climate change    
217 
 
4.8.2.2  The district already has a wealth of internationally, nationally and locally 
designated  sites that are important for their biodiversity and geodiversity , 
including six European protected sites, 34 Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSI) and over 100 County Wildlife sites.  The internationally protected sites 
include  
 The Morecambe Bay and Duddon Estuary Special Protection Area  
(SPA)  
 River Kent and tributaries S pecial Area of Conse rvation (SAC)  
4.8.2.3  The district also has four National Nature Reserves: Duddon Mosses, Roudsea 
Wood and Mosses, Hutton Roof and Clawthorpe Fell. The Council obtains 
information from the Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre provides the Council 
with annually updated local records on habitats and species, which help in 
assessing the ecological impact of development proposals.  Published  
information on the district’s international and national nature conservation 
assets can be viewed on line here.  
4.8.2.4  The NPPF requires Local Plans to promote the conservation and enhancement 
of priority habitats  and ecological networks ; the protection and recovery of 
priority species; and to secur e measurable net gains for biodiversity.  The NPPF 
and PPG also set out a ‘mitigation hierarchy’ of avoidance, mitigation and 
compensation, to manage the adverse impacts from development on 
biodiversity.   Avoidance is the preferred option, but if this is not possible, then 
mitigation of the effects can be co nsidered. If avoidance or mitigation do not 
address all the adverse effects, then compensation or offsetting measures may 
be appropriate.  
4.8.2.5  The Government’s 25 year Environment Plan84 sets out an action plan for 
improving the state of the environment , including the principle of ‘environmental 
net gain’, and the development of a Nature Recovery Network to protect and 
restore wildlife, and provide opportunities to re -introduce species that have 
been lost. The Environment Bill  - expected to be enacted in autumn 2021 – 
introduce s a range of measures which will lay the foundations for  the Nature 
Recovery Network, including mandating 10% net gain for biodiversity for new 
development in England. The Bill sets out requirements for the preparation of 
local nature recovery strategies , which will need to state biodiversity priorities 
for the  strategy area and include a local habitat map.

218 
 
4.8.2.6  Cumbria is 1 of 5 pilot areas announced in August 2020 to test the approach to 
developing a Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) arising from the 
Environment Bill.  The purpose s of the LNRS include:  
 enhancin g and restoring nature conservation sites, including habitats and 
corridors which form stepping stones for wildlife to grow and move  
 improving a landscape’s resilience to climate change, providing natural 
solutions to reducing carbon and managing flood ris k 
 reinforcing the cultural and historic character of landscapes  
4.8.2.7  As partnership work is progressed locally on a nature recovery strategy and 
nature recovery network it will provide additional baseline information for the 
Local Plan Review and it will be imp ortant that the Local Plan policies 
contribute to the achievement of the measures in the strategy where they can 
be influenced by new development.  
4.8.2.8  Biodiversity Net Gain is an approach to development that leaves biodiversity in 
a better state than before. H owever Biodiversity Net Gain continues to rely on 
the application of the mitigation hierarchy to avoid, mitigate or compensate for 
biodiversity losses – and therefore is additional to rather than a replacement of 
these approaches. Defra is developing a ‘Bi odiversity Metric’ designed to 
provide ecologists, developers and planners with a means of assessing 
changes in biodiversity value (losses or gains) brought about by development .  
4.8.2.9  Current Local Plan policies on nature conservation comprise mainly 
Development Management Policies DPD Policies DM1 and DM4, adopted in 
March 2019. These updat e and complement Core Strategy P olicy CS8.4 on 
Biodiversity and Geodiversity. Policy DM4 requires environmental net gain in all 
development for biodiversity and gre en infrastructure. While the policies are 
considered to be fundamentally in accordance with the NPPF and PPG, there is 
potential to review and improve them  to take account of the impending national 
requirement for 10% net gain in biodiversity and to suppor t the emerging Local 
Nature Recovery Strategy for Cumbria, including consideration of the need for 
supporting supplementary planning guidance.  
What are the Policy Options  or Approaches ? 
Policy Approaches 8.2 : Protecting and Enhancing Nature Conservation 
Assets and Delivering Biodiversity Net Gain  
 Review and update existing Local Plan policies to take full account of 
national planning policy and guidance, and the Environmen t Bill, 
including a clear statement of the mitigation hierarchy ; the 
requirement for  10% net gain in biodiversity; and support for the 
emerging Local Nature Recovery Strategy for Cumbria as it rel ates 
to requirements from new development .   
219 
 
 Consider preparation of a Supplem entary Planning Document, 
ideally with other neighbouring planning a uthorities, to provide 
detailed guidance on the implementation of nature conservation 
policies, in particular the  requirement for 10% biodiversity net gain , 
the implementation of t he DEFRA Metric  and how to take account of 
the Local Nature Recovery Strategy in implementing planning  policy. 
Which of these policy approaches to enhancing nature conservation 
and delivering biodiversity net gain do you support and why? Please 
give your reasons, noting the relevant  reference number, and add 
any other comments or alternative suggestions . 
Should the Council seek a higher percentage than 10% of 
net gain in biodiversity? Are you aware of any sites or land that may be 
available for habitat creation/restoration to support  the implementation of 
this requirement?  
 Key Issue: Coastal Development and Protection  
What is the Issue?  
4.8.3.1  The coast of South Lakeland, including Morecambe Bay and the Duddon 
Estuary , make s a unique contribution to the character of the district and is 
impor tant for commercial, tourism and recreational purposes, as well as for its 
environmental  importance . While the coast is not a Marine Conservation Zone 
the two estuaries have an international  nature conservation designation as 
Special Protection Areas. The defence of the coast against erosion and 
flooding by the sea has been an important issue for communities for many 
years.  
4.8.3.2  The NPPF notes that strategic planning policies should includ e coastal change 
management and flood risk . It also requires an Integrated  Coastal Zone 
Management approach across local authority and land/sea boundaries, to 
ensure effective alignment of terrestrial and marine planning regimes.   
4.8.3.3  Core Strategy Policy CS8.5 sets out a strategic policy including: conservation 
and enhancement of the wildlife, landscape, and cultural heritage of the coast; 
protection of the undeveloped coast; and the effective  assessment of drainage 
impact and flood risk. Later additional policies in the DM DPD seek to protect 
the coastal settings of the AONB and N ational Parks ( Policy DM1) and enhance 
policy on flood risk management including coastal flooding ( Policy DM6). An 
updated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) will take account of flooding 
from all sources, including the coast.    
220 
 
4.8.3.4  The review of Local Plan  policy and allocation of sites for development will 
need to consider the following plans and strategies:  
 the draft North West Marine Plan85 provides s trategic policy for planning  the 
inshore and offshore waters between the Solway Firth and North Wales, to 
inform decision -making by marine users and regulators , including SLDC as 
a local planning authority. The draft Marine Plan is now a material 
consideration in terms of Loc al Plan policy making and planning application 
decision making. Until the adoption of the North West Maritime Plan later in 
2021 the UK Marine Policy Statement86 should also be applied.  
 the North West Shoreline Management Plan87 (NW SMP 2, August 2016 ) is 
a non -statutory, high level policy document for coastal flood and erosion risk 
management . It helps reduce these risks by identifying the most sustainable 
policies for managing flood and coastal erosion in the short, medium and 
long-term. It forms part of the Defra’s strategy for managing risks due to 
flooding and coastal erosion. The Environment A gency is currently leading 
on a refresh of the SMP.  
 the Cumbr ia Coas tal Strategy88 (CCS) is a plan to evaluate and manage 
long term risks for coastal flooding and erosion on the Cumbrian coast . 
Building on proposals in the SMP, i t assesses the condition of land and 
flood defences to identify  potential future interventions. The Strategy is 
important to obtain approval and national funding for future flood and 
coastal risk management schemes .   
 The Government is committed to funding a 2800 mile England Coastal 
Path89, around the full coastline of England. It is being opened in sections 
but none are yet comple te in South Lakeland.  
 
4.8.3.5  The NPPF states that Local Plans should identify as a Coastal Change 
Management Area (CCMA) , any area which  is likely to be affected by physical 
change to the shoreline through erosion, coastal landslip, permanent 
inundation or coastal accretion. The NPPF indicates that development in a 
CCMA will only be appropriate where the character of the coast is not 
compr omised  and development : 
 will be safe over its planned lifetime and not have an unacceptable impact 
on coastal change : 
 provides wider sustainability benefits

 Key Issue: Historic and Cultural Environment  
What is the Issue?  
4.8.4.1  South Lakeland has a rich and diverse built  and cultural heritage  - designated 
and non -designated  - which contributes much to the quality of life of residents, 
the enjoyment of many visitor s to the area and hence to the local economy. Its 
designated heritage assets include 1,064 listed buildings, 5 9 Scheduled 
Monuments , 10 Conservation Areas and 4 Registered Parks and Gardens. On 
the 9 July 2017 the Lake District, which borders South Lakeland’s planning 
area and is partly within South Lakeland was designated a World Heritage Site 
by UNESCO, recognis ing its world class cultural landscape.    
222 
 
4.8.4.2  Insensitive development can pose a risk to the area’s heritage and character 
and in some areas it has been eroded over time with small incremental 
changes. There are 16 heritage assets identified as being ‘at risk’ o n Historic 
England’s national register in South Lakeland, including 2 listed buildings, 13 
scheduled monuments and the Burton -in-Kendal conservation area - which 
benefits from  a Partnership Scheme in Conservation Area (PSiCA) which aims 
to reverse this de signation.  
4.8.4.3  The NPPF requires plans to set out a positive strategy for the conservation and 
enjoyment of the historic environment, including heritage assets most at risk 
through neglect, decay or other threats. It recognises heritage assets as an 
irreplacea ble resource and requires them to be conserved in a manner 
appropriate to their significance.  Conservation Area appraisals have been 
prepared for the 10 Conservation Areas, which require updating and 
subsequent development of Management Plans. Draft Conser vation Area 
Management Plans have been prepared for Burton in Kendal and Cartmel.  
4.8.4.4  Current Local Plan policies are considered to be in broadly in accordance with 
the NPPF and comprise Core Strategy Policy CS8.6, which has been 
substantially upda ted and complemented by DM DPD Policy DM3 and also 
AONB DPD P olicy AS07 in regard to the AONB (both adopted March 2019). 
Issues for the Local Pan review include:  
 A need to refresh and update local policy further in line with the NPPF 
including a strategic policy for the conservation and enhancement of the  
built and historic environment . 
 An updating of the historic environment evidence base including 
conservation area management plans and appraisals, and identified 
assets of local historic importance.  
 Consideratio n of the wider use of Article 4 Directions (which can be used 
to remove some development rights) to help control the erosion of an 
area’s heritage and character.

 Key Issue: Achieving Quality Design   
What is the Issue?  
4.8.5.1  The quality of design is probably the main measure by which the success or 
otherwise of the planning system is judged. Good design is not just about 
individual building s but about places and their layout, and elem ents such as 
settlement character, open space, highways , ‘active travel’, landscaping, and 
even sustainable drainage. While these are some areas typically addressed in 
design policy, d esign more widely also relates to other Local Plan policy areas 
including built  heritage, accessible homes and energy efficiency standards . 
4.8.5.2  The current NPPF notes that ‘good design is a key aspect of sustainable 
development ’ and the PPG advise s that Local Plans s et clear design outcomes 
in the ir vision, objectives, strategic and local policies and potentially in 
supplementary  planning documents  - which could includ e:   
 Design guides : which set  general design principles and standards that 
should be follow ed in an ar ea;  
 Masterplans : which focus  on sit e-specific scale and layout , mix of 
uses, transport, open space and public realm - with an 
implementation plan  
 Design codes : which set illustrated design requirements, with specific, 
detailed parameters , informed by the 10 characteristics of good 
places in  the new National Design Guide90 published in October 2019 .  
4.8.5.3  Good design is high on the Government’s agenda for reforming the planning 
system , as set out in the White paper, Planning for the Future91 (Aug. 2020) . To 
turn the principles in the National Design Guide into more specifi c standards , a 
                                            
90 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -design -guide  
91 https://www.gov.uk/gov ernment/consultations/planning -for-the-future/planning -for-the-future    
224 
 
National Model Design Code92 which was p ublished for consultation  until 27 
March  2021 , together with proposed changes to the NPPF , and an invitation 
for expressions of interest to take part in a National Model Design testing 
programme93. A revised and consolidated Manual for Streets94 in also planned.  
4.8.5.4  In the proposed changes to the NPPF, t he Government proposes that: 
 all planning authorities  prepare design guides or codes , consistent 
with principles in the National Design Guide and National Model 
Design Code  
 all guides and codes be based on effective community engagement 
and reflect local aspirations.  
 the National Design Guide and National Model Design Code be used 
to guide decisions on applications in the absence of local  guides or 
codes.  
4.8.5.5  It also notes that Neighbourhood Plans planning groups can play an important 
role both through preparing their own pla ns and also engaging in the design 
guidance and codes being prepared by local planning authorities .  
4.8.5.6  In terms of current policy, Core Strategy Policy CS8.10  (Design)  has been 
complemented recently by DM DPD Policy DM2, ‘Achieving Sustainable High 
Quality D esign’ (March 2019). It’s important to remember that a dopted 
Neighbourhood Plans hav e the same w eight in determining planning 
applications as the Local Plan. The adopted Heversham and Hincaster95, and 
Grange over Sands Neighbourhood Plan s96 have policies on design, with the 
latter having a strong emphasi s on design, and supported by a Design Guide. 
Cumb ria County Council’s Cumbria Development Design Guide97 provides 
advice on highways and drainage matters  and is a material consideration in 
planning decisions.  
4.8.5.7  Early engagement stimulated a significant response on views on design issues 
from communities and stakeholders. Some expressed concern about the 
quality of recent design, for example citing:  
 ‘not in k eeping with character of towns and villages’

 ‘inappropriate materials and design ’ 
 ‘does not consider heritage’  
 ‘poor quality shopping and industrial development’  
4.8.5.8  However others cited quite a few examples of design considered to have merit 
in most of the larger  settlements across the district. Other recommendations 
urged consideration of:  
 homes designed with climate mitigation and adaptation measures , 
and sustainable materials  
 adoption of ‘Secured by Design – Homes ’ (March 2019)  
 well-designed open space  
 promoting the 10 principles of ‘active design’ ( e.g. high quality streets 
and spaces and walkable communities)   
 a revision of the Shop Front s Design Guide

5. Appendix 1 - Glossary  of Terms  
This Glossar y provides terms and references that are relevant whilst reading this 
document. The terms included within this Glossary supplement the definitions that 
are found within Annex 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the 
Framework) and other relevant Na tional Planning Documents. The Glossary below 
does not seek to repeat or contradict terms described within the Framework and 
therefore this Glossary should be read in conjunction with the Framework and other 
relevant National Guidance.  
Term  Description  
Adoption   The point at which the final version of a Plan document is 
formally agreed and comes into use by the Council for 
planning purposes.  At that point the Plan document 
becomes part of the statutory development plan for the 
local planning authority area .  
Affordable Housing  Housing that is made available to households who cannot 
afford to access housing (either for rent shared ownership 
or immediate sale) on the open market. Currently defined 
by Annex 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 
Housing is made available at a cost considered affordable 
in relation to incomes that are average or below average, 
or in r elation to the price of general market housing.  
Allocated Land  Land identified in a development plan as appropriate for a 
specific land use.  
Annual Monitoring 
Report (AMR)  Is a document produced on an annual basis to report on 
the progress in the prepa ration of Local Plan Documents 
and how successful the implementation of policies has 
been.  
Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty 
(AONB)  Areas that have been designated and protected because 
of their national landscape importance and environmental 
importance . Part of the Arnside & Silverdale AONB is 
within the South Lakeland local planning authority area 
and part is within Lancaster City Council’s area.  
Biodiversity  The whole variety of life on earth. It includes all species of 
plants and animals and the ecos ystems and habitats they 
are part of.     
227 
 
Term  Description  
Brownfield Land 
(previously 
developed land)  Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, 
including the curtilage of the developed land (although it 
should not be assumed that the whole curtilage should be  
developed) and any associated fixed surface 
infrastructure. This excludes: land that is or was last 
occupied by agriculture or forestry buildings; land that has 
been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal 
by landfill, where provision for rest oration has been made 
through development management procedures; land in 
built-up areas such as residential gardens, parks, 
recreation grounds and allotments; and land that was 
previously developed but where the remains of the 
permanent structure or fixed surface structure have 
blended into the landscape.  
Carbon Footprint  A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse 
gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are 
generated by our actions.  
Carbon Neutral  Carbon neutrality refers to achieving  net-zero carbon 
dioxide emissions. This can be done by balancing 
omissions of carbon dioxide with its removal (often 
through carbon offsetting) or by eliminating emissions 
from society.  South Lakeland District C ouncil has a target 
of becoming a carbon neu tral Council by 2030 and a 
carbon neutral district by 2037 . 
Carbon Offsetting  A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon 
dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to 
compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are 
measured in tonnes  of carbon dioxide -equivalent  
Climate Emergency  A climate emergency declaration is an action taken by 
governments, including local government  such as South 
Lakeland District Council, to acknowledge and commit to 
action. South Lakeland District Council has  declared a 
climate emergency and has an  approved Climate Change

conditions for economic growth in an area. Local 
Enterprise Partnerships produce Local Industrial 
Strategies for their areas.  
Design Code  A set of illustrated design requirements that provide 
specific, detailed parameters for the physical development 
of a site or area. The graphic and written components of 
the code should build upon a design vision, such as a 
masterplan or other design and development framework 
for a site or area.  
Development Plan  Is defined in Section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory 
Purchase Act 2004, and includes adopted local plans, 
neighbourhood plans that have been made , and 
published spatial development strategies, together with 
any regional strategy policies that remain in force. 
Neighbourhood plans that have been approved at 
referendum are also part of the development plan, unless 
the local planning authority decides that the 
neighbourhood plan should not be made.  
Development Plan 
Documents (DPD)  These are key planning documents prepared by the 
Council. They are subject to public consultation and public 
examination. The Land Allocations, Development 
Management Policies and the Arnside & Silverdale AONB 
Development Plan Document are all development plan 
documents.  
Developable  To be considered developable, sites should be in  a 
suitable location for housing development with a   
229 
 
Term  Description  
reasonable prospect that they will be available and could 
be viably developed at the point envisaged.  
Green Gaps  Existing green gaps are  areas  identified on the current 
adopted Local Plan Policies Map. Green gap planning 
policy seeks to maintain the separate identities of 
communities in the South Lakeland local planning 
authority area , by maintaining visual and functional 
separation.  It seeks to  prevent the coalescence of 
settlements.  
Green Infrastructure  A network of multi -functional green space, urban and 
rural, which is capable of delivering a wide range of 
environmental and quality of life benefits for local 
communities.  
Greenfield Land  Land that has not been previously developed, 
characterised by urban and suburban green spaces, open 
countryside and agricultural land.  
Habitat s Regulation 
Assessment (HRA)  Assesses the impact of plans or projects on Natura 2000 
sites (these are Special Areas  of Conservation (SAC) and 
Special Protection Areas (SPA)). National guidance 
recommends that Ramsar sites and candidate SPAs and 
SACs are also afforded the same protection through the 
Habitats Regulation Assessment process.  
Local Green Space 
(LGS)  The designation of land as Local Green Space  (LGS)  
through local and neighbourhood plans allows 
communities to protect and identify green areas of 
particular importance to them. See the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) February 2019 . Paragraphs 99 
to 101 refer. 
Local Plan  A document used to plan for the future development of a 
local area, drawn up by the local planning authority in 
consultation with the community. A Local Plan can consist 
of either strategic or non -strategic policies, or a 
combination  of the two. South Lakeland District Council is 
the planning authority for the areas of the District outside 
the two National Parks. South Lakeland Local Plan 
documents include the Core Strategy, Land Allocations, 
Development Management Policies and the Ar nside and 
Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty   
230 
 
Term  Description  
Development Plan Documents. The Local Plan also 
includes the adopted neighbourhood development plans 
for Heversham and Hincaster and Grange -over-Sands 
Parishes. Accompanying the Local Plan written 
documents is an adopted policies map  (Also see ‘Policies 
Map’) . All Local Plan documents must be subject to 
rigorous procedures of community involvement, 
consultation and independent examination and adopted 
after receipt of the Inspector’s report. Once adopte d, 
development management decisions on planning 
applications must be made in accordance with them 
unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
Local Planning 
Authority (LPA)    The local authority or Council that is empowered by law to 
exercise plan ning functions, usually the local borough or 
district Council. National Parks and the Broads Authority 
are also considered to be local planning authorities, but 
they can also be unitary authorities. County Councils are 
the authority for waste and minerals matters.  
Local Service 
Centres  Settlements listed in the current Local Plan’s Core 
Strategy Policy CS1.2 which sets out the settlement 
/place hierarchy.  
National Planning 
Policy Framework 
(NPPF)  A document that has been prepared b y Central 
Government and which sets out the Government’s 
planning policies for England and how these should be 
applied. It provided a framework within which locally 
prepared plans for housing and other development can be 
produced. The NPPF must be taken into account in 
prepari ng the development plan (Local Plan) and is a 
material consideration in planning decisions on planning 
applications.  
National Planning 
Practice Guidance 
(NPPG)  A document prepared and published by Central 
Government that provides guidance to supplement t he 
content of the National Planning Policy Framework.  
Neighbourhood 
Development 
Plan /Neighbourhood 
Planning  In light of the Localism agenda, neighbourhood 
development plans can be prepared by local 
communities, in particular parish councils, which can 
promote developments and have a greater say on where 
development should be located in their communities. In   
231 
 
Term  Description  
law this is described as a neighbourhood development 
plan in the Planning and Compulsory Planning Act 2004.  
Non- Strategic 
Policies  Policies contained in a neighbourhood plan, or those 
policies in a local plan that are not strategic policies. See 
also ‘Strategic Policies’.  
Objective  A statement of what is intended, specifying the desired 
direction of change in trends.  
Policies Map ( Local 
Plan)  Accompanying the Local Plan written documents is an 
adopted policies map. This illustrates the extent of the 
area on the ground that the various policies cover. The 
policies map must be prepared and maintained to 
accompany all Local Plans.  
Ramsar Sites  Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance 
that have been designated under the 1971 Ramsar 
Convention on Wetlands for containing representative 
rare or unique wetland  types or for their importance in 
conserving biological diversity.  
Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest 
(SSSI)  These are sites that have been recognised for the 
importance of either their biological, geological or 
landscape value. A site identified under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside  
and Rights of Way Act 2000).  
Strategic Housing 
Market Assessment 
(SHMA)  A study intended to review the existing housing market in 
the area, consider the nature of future need for market 
and affordable housing and to inform the development of 
planning policy. The last SHMA for South Lakeland district 
was published  in 2017. The Council proposes to update 
its SHMA through the course of the South Lakeland Local 
Plan review to understand the level of housing need since 
2017.   
Special Area of 
Conservation (SAC)  Areas designated under the European Habitat Directive. 
They provide increased protection for a variety of wild 
animals, plants and animals and are a vital pa rt of the 
global effort to conserve world biodiversity.  
Special 
Consultation These are bodies that must be consulted on Local Plans 
and planning applications.    
232 
 
Term  Description  
Bodies/Statutory 
Bodies  
Special Protection 
Area (SPA)  An area containing an assemblage of bree ding 
populations of rare birds at a level of European 
significance, designated under EC Directive 79/409.  
Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA)  An assessment that sets out the risks from flooding within 
the district  on a water catchment  wide basis , whether from 
rivers , the coast or from other water sources . The 
assessment will be used to ensure that development 
proposals are fully aware of flood risk issues in a locality.  
The Council expects an updated SFRA to be published in 
summer  2021.  
Strategi c Housing 
and Economic Land 
Availability 
Assessment 
(SHELAA)  Previously known as a Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment (SHLAA), the assessment was last carried 
out for the Local Plan and published in 2009. The 
assessment now incorporates employm ent land and has 
been renamed the Strategic Housing and Economic Land 
Availability Assessment (SHELAA). This provides an audit 
of land that is potentially suitable, available and 
achievable for housing and employment over the Local 
Plan period.  
Strategic Policies  Policies and site allocations which address strategic 
priorities in line with the requirements of Section 19 (1B -
E) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. 
The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Feb. 
2019, Paragraph 20, advi ses th at strategic planning 
policies  make sufficient provision for : housing (including 
affordable housing), employment, retail, leisure and other 
commercial development. Infrastructure for transport, 
telecommunications, security, waste management, water 
supply, wastewater, flood risk and coastal change 
management and the provision of minerals  (a County 
Council Planning matter) and energy (including heat), 
community facilities (such as health, education and 
cultural infrastructure) and conservation and 
enhancement  of the natural, built and historic 
environment, including landscapes and green   
233

change mitigation and adaptation.  
Supplementary 
Planning 
Documents (SPD)  A document that may cover a range of issues, thematic or 
site specific and provide further detail about policies and 
proposals in a ‘parent’ Local Plan. Supplementary 
planning documents are capable of being a material 
consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the 
development plan.  
Sust ainability 
Appraisal  (SA) The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 
requires Local Development Documents to be prepared 
with a view to contributing to the achievement of 
sustainable development. Sustainability Appraisal is a 
systematic appraisal proces s used to access the social, 
environmental and economic effects of strategies and 
policies from the outset of the preparation process. The 
SA process ensures that decisions are made in 
accordance with the principles of sustainable 
development.   
Sustainabl e 
Development  In broad terms this means development that meets the 
needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs. The 
Government have set five guiding principles for 
sustainable development in its stra tegy ‘Securing the 
Future – UK Government Strategy for Sustainable 
Development’. The five guiding principles include: living 
within sustainable limits; ensuring a strong, healthy and 
just society; achieving a sustainable economy; promoting 
good governance;  and using sound science responsibly.  
Sustainable 
Drainage Systems 
(SuDs)  Drainage systems that are designed to reduce the 
potential impact of new and existing developments with 
respect to surface water drainage discharges. A SuD s is 
dependent on site sp ecific constraints and applies to a 
broad range of drainage solutions that seek to manage 
rainfall close to where it falls. SuDs can be designed to 
transport, attenuate, infiltrate, evaporate and cleanse 
water.  
Sustainable Growth  This refers to strategic growth that can either be 
accommodated  within the capacity of existing
