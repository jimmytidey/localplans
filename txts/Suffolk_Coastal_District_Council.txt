  Section 1  
Introduction  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Introduction  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  2 1  Intro duction 
1.1 The former Suffolk Coastal  part of East Suffolk  is a uniquely attractive place to live and work, combining a 
strong economy with a natural , built and historic enviro nment second to none.  Those advantages however 
present the Council with the challenge of balancing the delivery of development that contin ues to 
stimulate and support the economy and provides attractive and affordable homes for current and future 
generatio ns, with the need to preserve and enhance the precious, but sometimes vulnerable environment. 
This Local Plan seeks to be ambitious in gro wing the District’s economy, in particular recognising the 
opportunities presented by the Port of Felixstowe, the ener gy sector and key transportation routes, 
boosting the delivery of homes to contribute to addressing the national housing shortage and resp onding 
to needs for a greater mix of homes and increasing the delivery of affordable housing, whilst improving 
infrast ructure provision  and conserving our natural, built and historic environment . 
1.2 The Council has prepared a new Local Plan which provides a v ision for the communities of the former 
Suffolk Coastal  area  up to 2036 and recognises the diversity of the area.   
Introduction  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020  
3 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Suffolk Coastal Plan Area Context  
1.3 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  is a large former District some 89 2 sq km/344 sq  miles in area , much of 
which is rural in character  with 48.8km of open coastline.  In 2016 the mid year po pulation was estimated 
at 127,836  residents with the majority of people living in the urban areas to the east of Ipswich such as 
Kesgrave, Martlesham and Rushmere St Andrew, the coastal resort town of Felixstowe and the market 
towns of Aldeburgh, Framlingham, Leiston, Saxmundham and Woodbri dge.  The area is a popular 
destination for visitors and tourists from the UK and abroad with exceptional natural, h istoric and built 
environments.  There are over 100 parishes which range in population size from a handful of people to 
several thousand peopl e. 
Social context  
1.4 People are at the heart of East Suffolk and the Local Plan  covering the former Suffolk Coastal ar ea seeks to 
provide vibrant and healthy communities to meet the needs of all residents.   
1.5 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  has one of  the oldes t populations of any district in the country and this 
characteristic places additional requirements on the Local Pl an, service providers and infrastructure 
provision.  In 2015, 70,800 persons (approximately 57% of the population) were of working age (16 -64 
years of age).  Over the plan period, it is anticipated that the percentage of the population who are working 
age wi ll decline.  An ageing population creates specific requirements for residential dwellings and care 
provision, although there is often a desire  to remain in the existing home rather than to relocate.  
Adaptation and improvement to the existing housing stock may provide a solution but will not always be 
possible. The provision of new accommodation suitable for older people will potentially free up larger  
family housing which will be important alongside n ew dwellings.  Alongside this,  the affordability of housing 
is an issue, with house prices being on average 8.95 times the average earnings1. This presents issues in 
particular for young people  who wi sh to remain in or move to the District. This includes p eople growing up 
in the area  who leave for a period of time for further education and other opportunities.  
1.6 Over the plan period, the Local Plan will deliver an ambitious level of housing to meet the needs of the 
current population through increased provis ion of units targeted at meeting specific needs (including 
those of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople ), the provision of affordable housing and deliver 
the housing needed in a timely manne r through a plan led approach.   
1.7 The 2011 Census showed t hat across the plan area  there were 58,227 dwellings which increased to 61,157 
as at the end of March 2018.  Housing delivery across the plan area  has always been positive and rates of 
construction hav e, in recent years , returned to the levels experience d before the economic downturn that 
started in 2008.  At that time , like other parts of the country, residential completions dropped to a low level 
which reflected the economic conditions faced by all par ts of the country.  Despite the drop in delivery and 
subs equent upturn of completions the Council is well placed to continue  to deliver significant housing 
1 Ratio of Median House Price to Median Workplace Earnings 2017 (Office for National Statistics, 2018) . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Introduction  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  4 opportunities for all  over the plan period.  In recent years the Council has taken a positive approach  to the 
delivery of housing and , through site allocation s, planning permissions already granted and a good rate of 
delivery , the Local Plan will deliver the dwellings required to meet the needs of the local community.  
1.8 Despite the good rate of housing deliv ery across the plan area , property prices continue to be  above the 
national and regional averages as outlined by information from the Land Registry.  In 201 7, the median 
property price in the former Suffolk Coastal  area  was £2 74,995  compared to the median o f £230,0002 for 
England.  
1.9 The District  also faces challenges in respect of residential accommodation being taken up as second homes 
or units for tourism accommodation.  In 2015 there were over 2,500 dwellings registered as second homes 
within the plan area . East Suffolk is a popular tourist des tination and this demand in some areas can deny 
local people the opportunity to buy or rent properties as demand raises prices to levels which are often 
outside of the budget of local residents.  Seasonal and holiday let  demand can also affect the availabil ity of 
properties for longer term private rent.   
1.10 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  is a relatively affluent  area  with some areas demonstrating high levels of 
affluence but some part s are amongst the most deprived in the c ountry.  Within Felixstowe there are 
pockets of deprivation, as well as rural areas in the north of the plan area . These locations need further 
attention over the plan period to ensure that issues relating to communities in deprived areas are 
supported and enhanced.  
Environmental Context  
1.11 The f ormer Suffolk Coastal  area  is heavily influenced and characterised by the natural, built and historic 
landscapes.  High quality and international  designations covering large areas of land are found across the 
plan area  which is interspersed by settlements a nd countryside.  The coastline has also played a significant 
role in developing the area and will continue to do so in the future.  
1.12 The plan area  contains over 48km of open coastline as well as over 139km of estuaries.  The estuaries of 
the Alde and Ore, Blyt h, Deben and Orwell Rivers help shape the plan area  and the communities which 
surround them . Estuary Plans have been prepared for the Deben Estuary and the Alde and Ore Estuary in 
recent years.  Approximately a third of the plan area  based around the coast and its hinterland is 
designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and 11,200 hectares of the plan area  is designated as 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest.  In addition, Natura 2000 is a network of protected si tes that represent 
European and Inter national designations.  
1.13 The plan area ’s landscape is diverse, including large areas of farmland, which support a rich biodiversity 
and contain features of geodiversity.  In terms of  the historic  environment, there are 36 Conservation Areas 
with around 2,300  Listed Buildings ,  117 Scheduled Monuments, 8 registered historic parks and gardens, 
2 Office for National Statistics . Introduction  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020  
5 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 17 locally identified historic parks and gardens and 1 protected wreck, alongside a military history , all of 
which combine to form  the historic landscape.  
1.14 The exceptional quality of the natural, built and historic environment makes the plan area  a very special 
place to live and work and a popular destination for visitors and tourists.  This resulting high quality of life 
brings with it t he responsibility of preserving this heritage as  a key  priority, for its own intrinsic value as 
well as for the health, prosperity and well -being of the residents.  
1.15 East Anglia is recognised by the Environment Agency  as an area of ‘ serious  water stress’. As  one of the 
driest parts of the country, water resources need to be carefully managed through partnership with water 
companies, the Environment Agency, landowners and Suffolk County Council as Lead Flood Authority.  
1.16 Two Air Quality Management Areas have been  declared in the former Suffolk Coastal  area , one in 
Woodbridge and one in Stratford St Andrew.  Both of these areas are monitored by the Council as they 
exceed annual mean Air Quality Objectives for nitrogen dioxid e. Outside of these areas the air quality is 
generally very good and levels of air pollutants are below national limits.  
1.17 The plan area  has a significant network of public rights of way, including nationally promoted walking trails 
such as the Stour and Orwell Walk, and the Sandlings Walk. Public r ights of way not only act as walking and 
cycling links between communities, education sites and workplaces, but also contribute to the economic 
prosperity of the District through the tourist trade that they attract.  
Economic context  
1.18 The East of England is one of the fastest growing regions and East Suffolk is a key contributor to this 
growth.  The former Suffolk Coastal District  is home to a number of key economic drivers such as the Port 
of Felixstowe, Sizewell Nuclear Power Station, offshore wind energy de velopments and BT operations at 
Adastral Park.  These large scale employers have a local pres ence but contribute significantly to the 
national and international economies and the Local Plan seeks to support this contribution.  
1.19 The East Suffolk Business Plan  identifies these major employers and sectors as being of huge benefit to the 
District . The Local Plan will seek to ensure that the appropriate provision of land, associated infrastructure 
and supply chain networks are promoted over the plan period to main tain the contribution made by these 
key economic drivers.  
1.20 The plan area’s  economy is suppor ted by a high proportion of small and medium sized businesses which 
are vital to the local economy  and rural communities . Economic evidence highlights the importanc e of 
these businesses across a range  of sectors which provide  a variety of employment opport unities.  The 
former Suffolk Coastal  area  has a higher number of businesses than compared to neighbouring authorities 
which shows that enterprises in the plan area  sustain activity and  generate economic prosperity . 
1.21 Official Labour Market Statistics show tha t within the former Suffolk Coastal  area  80% of the population 
were economically active in 2016, which mirrors the position for the East of England and is slightly higher 
than the national figures.  Average earnings are also generally higher than the regional and national 
averages although there still remains a gender pay gap within the District . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Introduction  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  6 1.22 Many young  people leave  the area for further education and other economi c and social opportunities  
which i mpacts on both the local community and business  sectors in the plan area . The emergence of The 
University of Suffolk and expansion of other education providers such as Otley College  present important 
opportunities for  the area  over the plan period.  Improvi ng the education and economic opportunities for 
young people will  be beneficial and reduce the growing numbers of people commuting into the area to 
fulfil jobs.  
1.23 East Suffolk  has a strong and  effective relationship with the  New Anglia Local Enterprise Partn ership (LEP). 
The LEP is a partnership between local authorities and businesses to help determine local economic 
priorities and lead economic growth and job creation. The New Anglia LEP seeks to maximise the 
opportunities currently being supported as well as those areas, such as the Market Towns, where 
economic activity could be boosted through appropriate intervention.  
1.24 The town centres across the plan area  perform a valuable retail function and provide services and facili ties 
for the ir communit ies and sur rounding rural areas . The individual identity of each town centre is a key 
feature and this makes them attractive as destinations for visitors to the area.  Town centres are 
increasingly a focus for leisure, business and so cial interaction  as well as shoppi ng 
1.25 The tourism industry is a key contributor to the local economy.  In 201 7, £325million was spent as a result 
of tourism.  The Economic Impact of Tourism Report published in 201 7 estimated that across the former 
Suffolk Coa stal District  6,163  jobs were gene rated as a result of tourism spend , which equated to 1 2% of 
total employment in the  plan area . 
1.26 People living in, working in, or visiting East Suffolk rely upon the transport networks.  The transport 
networks made up of road s, railways and cycle ways  are vital to the creation of healthy communities and 
serve rural and urban areas of the plan area . The Council will continue to work in partnership with 
Highways England, Network Rail and Suf folk County Council to ensure appropri ate transport infrastructure 
is delivered over the plan period.  
1.27 Travel to work data from the 2011 Census shows the importance of travel by private motor vehicles in the 
former Suffolk Coastal District . Public transport  services are varied across the Distri ct with most use being 
seen in the southern parts of the plan area  on routes connecting Ipswich to Felixstowe, Ipswich to 
Woodbridge and other market towns.  
1.28 Railway Lines  in the former Suffolk Coastal District  connect Felixstowe , Saxmundham , Woodbridge and 
some  rural areas with Ipswich and Lowestoft as well as on to London, Norwich and Cambridge . Rail 
capacity is limited and it  is a challenge to reconcile demand  for passenger and freight services over the 
plan period.  Strategic improvements to the rail line s have taken place in recent years and others are 
anticipated to come forward in the future.  
1.29 The only trunk road in the former Suffolk Coastal District  is the A14 that connects  Felixstowe with Ipswich , 
Cambridge  and the Midlands . The A14 is an important fr eight route and is fundamental to the success of 
the Port of Felixstowe and communities  surrounding Ipswich.  At times the A14  can become  blocked which Introduction  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020  
7 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n creates major impacts for residents, visitors and businesses in the  area as there is no suitable alternat ive 
route.  Over the plan period managing the capacity of the A14 will be necessary.   
1.30 The A12 provides the main route north and  south through the plan area  and is important to many 
communities . It is a mixture of dual carriageway and single carriageway and serves a number of 
settlements . Improvements to sections of the road are proposed at various locations, most notably around 
the villages of Farnham, Littl e Glemham, Marlesford and Stratford St Andrew.  
1.31 Besides these A roads , various  B and C class roads serv e the rest of the plan area . Many of these local 
roads are single track with passing places which reflects the rural nature of the area  but poses challeng es 
in respect of the accessibility of some settlements.  
Key Issues  
1.32 The table below identifies a series  of key issues which the Local Plan  covering the former Suffolk Coastal 
area  will seek to address.  These issues have been identified through the Sustainab ility Appraisal Scoping

Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Introduction  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  10 What is the Local  Plan?  
1.33 The Local Plan sets out the level of growth which needs to be planned for in the former Suffolk Coastal  
area  and identifies where this should be located and how it should be delivered.  The Plan sets out the 
strategic and non -strategic  planning policies which the Council will use to determine planning applications 
across Suffolk Coastal , along  with policies in made Neighbourhood Plans . This Local Plan will cover the 
period 201 8-2036.  
1.34 This Local Plan will replace the Core Strategy and Development Management Policies (2013), the Site 
Allocations and Area Specific Policies DPD (2017), the Felixsto we Peninsula Area Action Plan (2017) and the 
remaining ‘saved’ policies in the 2001 Local Plan. It will not replace the policies in ‘made’ Neighbourhood 
Plans, but some Neighbourhood Plans or parts of them may need to be reviewed to be in general 
conformit y with this Local Plan.  
1.35 Suffolk Coastal District Council has been working in partnership with Waveney District Council since 2008 
and most of the services a re shared across the two Councils.  To build on this decade of cooperation, give 
greater value for mo ney and at the same time improve service delivery, including driving and investing in 
growth and infrastructure projects, the two Councils agreed to create one Council.  In February 2018 the 
Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government a greed the shared proposals to create 
a new single East Suffolk Council.  In May 2018, Parliament made the Orders required to create East Suffolk 
Council whic h came into existence on 1st April 2019 and the two existing councils formally dissolved .  
1.36 This Loca l Plan will continue to provide the vision, strategic priorities, policies and proposals against which 
planning applications will be determined, for the geo graphic area covered by the former Suffolk Coastal 
area  until such time as the new East Suffolk Coun cil decide to review the Local Plan.  
Consultation  
1.37 In August 2017, the Council published a Local Plan Issues and Options document for consultation.  The 
Issues and Options consultation document (prepared and consulted upon in conjunction with Ipswich 
Borough  Council) highlighted a variety of issues facing the communities of  the former  Suffolk Coastal  area . 
The responses received from the Issues and Options consultation informed th e First Draft Plan.  
1.38 The First Draft Plan was  published for public consultation in July 2018 . It took the form of the final Local 
Plan and was informed by comments received and the evidence base which has been prep ared to justify 
the proposals and policies.  
1.39 The Final Draft Plan has been informed by the responses to the earlier consulta tion periods and revised 
evidence base.  The document was published in January 2019 to invite representations in relation to 
soundness . Comments received on the Final Draft Plan were considered by the Planning Inspectorate after 
the document was submitted f or Examination by Suffolk Coastal District Council in March 2019.  Introduction  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020  
11 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Duty to Co-operate  
1.40 The Duty  to Co-operate  is a legal duty on all local planning authorities, county councils and public bodies to 
engage constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis to m aximise the effectiveness of Local Plan 
preparation in the context of strategic cross boundary matters.  
1.41 The former Suffolk Coastal  District Council  engaged constructively with all partners during the preparation 
of this Local Plan and in the preparation of  neighbouring authorities’ Local Plans at the relevant times.  The 
main  strategic relationships for the plan  area are with Babergh District Council, Ipswich Borough Council  
and Mid Suffolk District Council along with Suffolk County Council and the former Waveney District 
Council .  
1.42 The Council has worked with the neighbouring authorities of Babergh, Ipswich and M id Suffolk to identify 
the boundaries of the housing market area and the functional economic areas.  Collectively it is considered 
that the housing an d economic needs of the authorities can be met within the existing administrative 
boundaries  and the plan a rea. 
1.43 In respect of infrastructure, the Council has worked positively with infrastructure providers such as the 
local Clinical Commissioning Group, th e NHS,  Suffolk Constabulary,  UK Power Networks, Essex & Suffolk 
Water, Anglian Water and Suffolk County Cou ncil. This engagement will be ongoing during the 
implementation of the Local Plan.  
Neighbourhood Plans  
1.44 Neighbourhood Plans are optional plans prepare d by the local community which set out the detailed 
planning policies and proposals for their specific area . Once ‘made ,’ they form part of the Development 
Plan against which planning applications are determined.  Across the former Suffolk Coastal  area , a number 
of communities have committed to undertaking Neighbourhood Plans to guide the future of their 
communi ties. In January 2015, the Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan was the first to be  ‘made’ in Suffolk . 
Since then other communities have also ‘made ’ their p lan. 
 Framlingham – made March 2017;  
 Great Bealings – made March 2017;  
 Leiston – made March 2017;  
 Martlesham – made July 2018;  
 Melton – made January 2018;  
 Wenhaston with Mells Hamlet – made July 2018.  
1.45 Over the plan period, it is expected that further Neighb ourhood Plans will be ‘made ’ and these will need to 
be in conformity with the policies within the  Local Plan.  
1.46 Many of  the policies in the Local Plan are ‘strategic policies ’ (as set out in Appendix M) . This means that 
policies and proposals within future Neighbourhood Plans should be in general conformity with these 
policies. Policies in the Plan  do provide flexibility for Neighbourhood Plans to develop their own locally 
specific policies and in a number of policies there is specific reference to the types  of policies that Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Introduction  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  12 Neighbourhood Plans may choose to  include. However, Neighbourhood Plans may cov er other topics and 
provide local detail in relation to other policy areas where appropriate.  
Marine Plans  
1.47 The marine environment (up to the high water mark) i n the plan area  is covered by the East Inshore and 
East Offshore Marine Plans.  These plans need t o be considered alongside this Local Plan for developments 
which are within the marine plan areas and for developments which could impact upon the marine plan 
areas.  The Marine Plans contain policies relating to a range of marine related issues including economy, 
tourism and recreation and culture. The Marine Plans have been taken into account in the preparation of 
this Local Plan, where relevant.  
1.48 To ensure that  Marine Plans and L ocal Plans are compl ementary, the Council will work in partnership with 
the Marine Management Organisation.  Partnership working will enable the right activities to take place in 
the right place and in the right way, thus placing sustaina ble development at the centre of all decisions.   
Sustainability Appraisal  
1.49 Sustainability Appraisal is an iterative process which must be carried out during the preparation of a Local 
Plan.  Its purpose is to promote sustainable development by assessing the extent to which the  emerging 
Local Plan, when considered against alternatives, will help to achieve relevant environmental, economic 
and social objectives.  A Sustainability Appraisal has been undertaken on all the different policy and site 
options consider ed during each stag e of Local Plan  preparation.  The Sustainability Appraisal also considers 
the cumulative effect of the Local Plan on sustainability objectives.  
Habitats Regulations Assessment  
1.50 An assessment is required under the EU Habitats Directive4 to ensure that the Local P lan will not result in 
harm to the integrity of European protected sites. A Screening A ssessment was undertaken  to inform the 
First Draft Local Plan  which identifie d those policies in the plan for which an Appropriate Assessment  
wou ld be required as the plan moves forward.  
1.51 To support  the Final Draft Plan, the Council have undertaken a Habitats Regulation Assessment to inform 
the policies and site allocations within it.  The assessment ensures that the legal and regulatory 
requirements  outlined under the EU Habitats Directive are adhered to as part of the plan making process.   
East Suffolk Business Plan  
1.52 In partnership with Waveney District Council, Suffolk Coastal has adopted the East Suffolk Business Plan.  
The Business Plan , adopted in  2015 , sets out an up to date vision and priorities for the East Suffolk area.  
The vision for East Suffolk is to ‘Maintain and sustainably improve the quality of life for everyone growing 
up in, living in, working in and visiting East Suffolk. ’ The Busines s Plan priorities are set out under themes of 
 
4 Directive 92/43/EEC . Introduction  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020  
13 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n enabling communities, economic growth and financial self -sufficiency alongside a number of specific 
planned actions.  
1.53 The vision, objectives and strategic priorities of this Local Plan reflect the vi sion and pri orities of the East 
Suffolk Business Plan.  
1.54 On 1st April 2019, East Suffolk Council was created and the former  Councils of Suffolk Coastal District and 
Waveney District were  dissolved.  The East Suffolk Business Plan will provide the corporate v ision for th e 
new Council until it is updated.  
Monitoring and Delivery  
1.55 Central to the plan making system is the issue of deliverability.  In order to be effective Local Plans must be 
deliverable.  The success of the Local Plan will be dependent on the contin ual engageme nt and partnership 
working between the Council, developers, infrastructure providers and other interested stakeholders, 
including the public as well as Town and Parish Councils.  Communities undertaking Neighbourhood Plans 
will also have a cruci al role in e xpanding upon and adding to the Local Plan policies and proposals to 
address detailed local circumstances.  
1.56 The policies and proposals of the Local Plan will be delivered primarily through planning applications over 
the plan period.  Neighbourhood Plans also  have a key role to play in the delivery of the Local Plan policies.   
1.57 Sustainability Appraisal, incorporating Strategic Environmental Assessment, has been carried out as part of 
the production of the Local Plan.  A requirement of Sus tainability Appraisal is  to monitor the likely 
significant effects of the plan. A monitoring framework with  indicators has been developed through the  
Sustainability Appraisal as a basis for monitoring the significant effects . 
1.58 The Council reports on monitor ing and delivery annuall y in its Authority Monitoring Report. In some 
instances it may be appropriate to alter the indicators being reported, either due to a change in 
information available or to reflect specific issues that emerge.  
1.59 The Policy Delivery  Framework in Appendix A and the Monitoring  Framework in Appendix C sets out the  
targets and indicators that are proposed to  be used to track the progress of the plan and the policies 
within it.

2.1 Through this Local Plan, the ambition for  the area  is to significantly boost economic growth , housing 
delivery and to attract investment, whilst delivering at least 542 homes a year.  
2.2 The area covered by the Local Plan is part of a wider area within  which there are strong functional 
economic and h ousing market relationships. This wider area includes Ipswich Borough and Mid Suffolk and 
Babergh Districts which also border Ipswich. E vidence produced as part of the production of the Local Plan 
demonstrates that the area as a whole  form s the Ipswich Hou sing Market Area and the Ipswich Functional 
Economic Area. The area has strong connections in terms of travel to work patterns and housi ng and 
commercial markets.  
2.3 The four local planning authorities  covering this area , along with Suffolk County Council, ha ve a history of 
working together on strategic planning issues through the former Ipswich Policy Area Board (now the 
Ipswich Strategic Planning Area Board). The Board provides a mechanism for the five authorities to 
develop, promote and deliver a vision for  the Ipswich Strategic Planning Area (ISPA) and to co -operate on 
the preparation and monitoring of Local Plans and to share relevant evidence. This joint working is a 
fundamental part of planning in the area, and as s uch is reflected in the East Suffolk Bu siness Plan which 
sets an action to develop even closer working relationships with other Suffolk Councils on strategic 
plan ning and reviewing Local Plans.  
2.4 The Councils have worked together on evidence relating to hou sing and employment needs of all 
author ities. The former Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich Borough Council also undertook 
combined evidence relating to Retail and Commercial Leisu re needs , Landscape Sensitivity  and water 
resources . 
2.5 Under the 201 1 Localism Act local planning authoriti es are required to co -operate on strategic planning 
matters. The strategic planning matters within the Ipswich Strategic Planning Area cover a range of issues 
including housing need and distribution, provision of land  to support economic growth and deliver ing 
green infrastructure. In recognition of these interdependencies, the authorities have closely aligned their 
timetables for the production of Local Plans. The policies in this Section  are based upon the recognised 
common strategic matters, and establish  the Council’s  commitment to joint working. The five ISPA 
authorities, in reflectio n of the  National Planning Policy Framework, are working together on the 
production of a Statement of Common Ground to document the jo int working and agreements in relation 
to strategic matters, which will evolve over the course of production of  the Local Plans .

Ipswich Strategic Planning Area (ISPA)  
Scale and L ocation of Growth  
2.6 The authorities in the ISPA jointly commissioned the production of a Strategic Housing Market  Assessment 
(SHMA) in 2016 to identify the objectively assessed housing need (OAN) for the area and to identify the 
mix and type of housing needed. The SHMA concluded that the area covered by Ipswich Borough , the 
former Suffolk Coastal  District,  and Baberg h and Mid Suffolk Districts, represents one Housing Market Area 
(the Ipswich Housing Market Area) (IHMA) based upon the functional relationships between the areas such 
as being relatively self -contained in terms of travel to work areas.  
2.7 The National Plann ing Policy Framework sets out the  standard approach for determining  local housing 
need , with the accompanying Planning  Practice Guidance setting out the meth odology for calculating this . 
This involves using the latest published household projections and ap plying an uplift based upon published 
ratios of median house prices to median workplace earnings. The 2014 -based  household projections were 
published in July  2016 and the latest affordability ratios published in March 2019 .  
2.8 The housing need figures for th e authorities in the ISPA are shown in Table 2.1. The starting point for each 
authority will be to meet their own  housing  needs within their own boundary.  Reflecting the agreed 
outcomes in the ISPA Statement of Common Ground (March 2019), where through the  plan making 
process and adoption of a local plan, an authority is unable to meet its own housing need, following a 
comprehensive re -assessment of deliverabi lity the ISPA Board will provide the forum  to collectively 
Wider Strategic Planning Area  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
17 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n consider how need can be met within the  ISPA. Where this would necessitate considering spatial and 
policy options to plan for further growth above that planned for within this Local Plan, a review  of the 
Local Plan would be necessary.  Policy SCLP2.1 refers to immediately commencing a review of the Local 
Plan or the strategic policies. In the context of the production of a Local Plan, the actions related to 
immediately commencing a review are likely  to initially entail a review of the Local Development 
Scheme, consideration of strategic cross bou ndary issues and the production and consideration of an 
updated evidence base.

19 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP2.1: Growth in the Ipswich Strategic Planning Area  
The local plan area  will continue to play a key role in the economic growth of t he Ipswich Strategic 
Plann ing Area, whilst enhancing quality of life and protecting the high quality environments. Over the 
period 201 8-2036, the Suffolk Coastal Local Plan will contribute to:  
a) The creation of at least 30,320  jobs through the provision of a t least 49.8ha of employme nt land 
across the Ipswich Functional Economic Area;  
b) The collective delivery of at least 35,334  dwellings across the Ipswich Housing Market Area; and  
c) Supporting the continued role of Ipswich as County Town.  
The Council will work actively with the other local planning authorities in the ISPA and with Suffolk County 
Council to co -ordinate the delivery of development and in monitoring and reviewing evidence as 
necessary. Should it be determined through the plan making process that an other authority within the 
ISPA is unable to meet its minimum housing need, the Council will, under the duty to cooperate, work 
collaboratively to determine whether housing development needs that cannot be met wholly within a 
particul ar plan area, could be  met elsewhere. An agreement to seek to accommodate unmet housing need 
would trigger an immediate review of the strategic policies of this Plan.  
 
Infrastructure  
2.14 Within the Ipswich Strategic Planning Area there are aspirations towards  the delivery of a num ber of key 
infrastructure projects, and in addition, there will be cross -boundary  infrastructure that is required as a 
result of growth planned within Local  Plans.  
2.15 The provision of new and improved infrastructure is essential to ensure that the growth pla nned across 
the area is sustainable.  Planning for infrastructure across the area will include schools, sustainable 
transport measures, improvements to the A12 and A14, improvements to other parts of the road networks 
and the railways. In addition to infras tructure requirements directly linked to planned growth, there are 
other cross -boundary projects that would help to grow and improve the economy and quality of life for 
the area. Development in the Ipswich Strategic P lanning Area is predicted to collective ly add to significant 
strain on the transport network in and around Ipswich. Additional highway capacity will not on its own 
address these issues and the ISPA authorities agree that robust steps must be taken to prior itise healthy 
and sustainable travel. A  package of transport mitigation measures has been identified to reduce vehicle 
movements. Suffolk County Council as the Highway Authority has developed a strategy which contains a 
package of mitigation measures to de liver modal shift and mitigate impacts on the wider Ipswich highways 
network. These include:  
 Transport infrastructure to encourage and support sustainable modes of transport  
 A Bus Quality Partnership  
 A Smarter Choices programme  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Wider Strategic Planning Area  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  20  Review of car parking and pricing strategies  
 Review of park and ri de strategy  
 Junction improvements  
 
The strategy which has been developed by Suffolk County Council identifies the costs of delivering these 
measures and apportionments based on impacts related to planned growth within each local planning 
authority area. Ea st Suffolk Council is committed to working with the other authorities across the ISPA to 
ensure that there is a co -ordinated approach to funding the mitigation through the delivery of the Local 
Plan.  
2.16 Over the plan period, the Council will continue to 
work  with neighbouring authorities, service 
providers and statutory bodies to ensure that 
strategic infrastructure as detailed in Policy 
SCLP2.2 is delivered in a timely and effective 
manner through appropria te funding and delivery 
mechanisms. Providing a rang e of infrastructure 
such as education, health and leisure provision 
will meet the needs of local communities and 
businesses and further promote sustainable 
communities across the plan area . The provision 
of green infrastructure would also be expected to 
contribute to the delivery of net gains for 
biodiversity .

The Council will work with partners such as the other local planning authorities in the ISPA, Suffolk County 
Council,  Clinical Commissioning Groups,  Suffolk Constabulary, utilities companies , Highways England and 
Network Rail in supporting and enabling the delivery of key strategic infrastructure, and in particular the 
timely delivery of:  
 
a) A12 improvements;  
b) A14 improvements;  
c) Sustainable transport meas ures in Ipswich;  
d) Improved walking and cycle routes;  
e) Increased capacity on railway lines for freight and passenger traffic;  
f) Appropriate education provision to meet needs resulting from growth ; 
g) Appropriate health and leisure provision to meet needs resulting  from growth;  
h) Appropriate police, community safety and cohesion provision to meet needs resulting from 
growth;  
i) Provision of green infrastructure and Suitable Alternatives Natural Greenspace;  
j) Improvements to water supply, foul sewerage and sewage treatment capacity; and  
k) Provision of appropriate digital telecommunications to provide mobile, broadband and radio 
signal for residents and businesses.  
The Council will work with Suffolk County Council and with  the other Local Planning Authorities in the 
Ipswich Str ategic Planning Area to support, through a package of funding sources, a range of new and 
enhanced sustainable transport measures in and around Ipswich.

2.17 Suffolk contains extensive areas of nationally and internationally p rotected landscapes and habitats. A 
particular issue is the need to ensure that new development does not result in harm to the integrity of 
internationally designated Special Protection Ar eas, Special Areas of Conservation and Ramsar sites. 
Strategic proje cts may require joint working by public bodies to ensure the requirements of the Habitats 
Directive are met.  
2.18 Local authorities in the ISPA have been working collectively on the Recreation al Avoidance and Mitigation 
Strategy (RAMS) to mitigate the pressure  caused by new developments on these designated sites.  The 
partnership work, supported by Natural England has established a strategy to mitigate the impacts and is 
due to be supported by a  Supplementary Planning Document that will provide further details i n respect of 
cost implications and subsequent implementation.  
2.19 Many of the European designated sites cross administrative boundaries and experience visitor pressure 
from residents and visit ors. The collaborative approach is therefore required to ensure that  green 
infrastructure requirements are considered across the wider area in a consistent manner . 
 
Policy SCLP2.3: Cross -boundary mitigation of effects on Protected Habitats  
The Council will continue to work with other authorities to address the requirements  of the Recreational 
Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy and implementation of mitigation measures for the benefit of the 
European protected sites across the Ipswich Strategi c Planning Area.  
The Council will continue to work with other authorities over the plan period to ensure that the strategy 
and mitigation measures are kept under review in partnership with Natural England and other 
stakeholders.

Vision for Suffolk Coastal  
3.1 The future growth of the plan area  will contribute to and enhance a range of sustainable settlements made 
up of appropriate economic opportunities, new homes, retail and leisure provision and supported by 
upgrad ed infrastructure.  The Local Plan vision for the District  in 2036 is based on the  vision contained in 
the East Suffolk Business Plan which looks to ‘Maintain and sustainably improve the quality of life for 
everyone growing up in, living in, working in and visiting East Suffolk ’. 
3.2 The plan area is central to the future economic growth of  the country – with major economic 
opportunities to be realised in relation to the Port of Felixstowe, BT and Sizewell.  The plan area  is also 
home to a variety of small and me dium sized businesses in manufacturing, industrial, tourism, creative and 
other s ectors that support a vibrant economy.  
 
In 2036 a high quality of life for those growing up in, living in, working in and visiting  the 
Suffolk  Coastal Local Plan area will have been nurtured through a healthy economy, healthy 
population and healthy envir onment supported by suitable infrastructur e. Significant levels of 
growth which maintain the distinctive character and role of settlements,  while conserving and 
enhancing the built, historic and  natural environment s will have been planned for and 
delivered . 
 
The plan area  will have a diverse, stro ng and prosperous economy which supports key sectors 
and embraced new opportunities that emerge over the plan period. The stronger and more 
diverse economy will provide more and better paid  local earnings and job o pportunities, 
ensuring that people can sta y within their communities.  
 
Supporting the job growth, there will be sufficient homes provided of the right types and 
tenures to meet the needs of the local population. The need for properties targeted at 
younger people and to meet the needs of older peop le will have been addressed, as well as 
the provision of homes to support people moving into the area . 
 
Communities will be healthy and active with access to a diverse landscape of rural 
communities, suburban areas  and market towns. The area  continues to  have an abundance of 
opportunities for physical activity on the doorstep of many residents’ homes and bus inesses. 
Supporting healthy and active communities will have a positive impact on the health, 
wellbeing and ha ppiness of all communities.  
 
The high quality built , historic  and natural environment will have been protected, maintained 
and enhanced through de velopment which is sensitive to the designated and protected areas  Vision for Suffolk Coastal 201 8-2036  
 Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
25 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n across the plan area , including the Suffolk  Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty, Special Protection Areas, River Valleys and Coastline. The natural environment will be 
suppl emented through provision of accessible green infrastructure and other public open 
spaces.  
 
Climate change is a key factor for the plan area , but the Local Plan will address issues relating 
to flood risk, coastal erosion and wider coastal management and ad aptation, as well as 
ensuring that human impact is reduced and mitigated accordingly.  
 
All communities will ha ve fulfilled their potential by 2036 and significantly improved the 
economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the area, whilst safeguard ing the prospects 
of current and future generations.

Presumption in  Favour of Sustainable Development  
3.4 Through this Local Plan the Cou ncil is positively supporting growth and the benefits that will bring to 
communities across the former Suffolk Coastal area . The purpose of planning is to help achieve sustainable 
developmen t as outlined in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Local Plan plays a n 
active role in guiding development towards sustainable solutions, but in doing so takes into accou nt local 
circumstances and reflects the character, needs and opport unities across the Local Plan area . 
3.5 The NPPF , taken as a whole, constitute s the Government’s view of what sustainable development in 
England means in practice for the planning system  and in  paragraph 11 provides the presumption in favour 
of sustainable dev elopment . 
3.6 This Local Plan provides a positive and ambitious vision for the future of the former Suffolk Coastal area 
and provides a framework for addressing the housing needs and other economic, social and environmental 
priorities on which to enable local communities to shape their surroundings.  The Local Plan is in 
accordance with the Government’s presumption in favour of sustainable development and is the starting 
point for decision ma king. Where the Local Plan is absent, silent or relevant policies are o ut-of-date, 
permission should be granted unless the adverse impacts of doing so would outweigh the benefits when 
assessed against the policies in the NPPF  or specific policies in the NPPF suggest that development should 
be restricted.  
3.7 Footnote 6 of the NP PF provides examples of such policies as being  those policies relating to sites 
protected under the Birds and Habitats Directives and/or designated as Sites of Special Scientific Intere st; 
land designated as Green Belt, Local Green Space, Areas of Outstand ing Natural Beauty, Heritage Coast, 
designated heritage assets and locations at risk of flooding or coastal erosion.   
Spatial Strategy for Growth 
3.8 National planning policy seeks to significantly boost the supply of homes through a sufficient amount and 
variety of land that will come forward where it is needed, to meet the needs of groups with specific Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  30 housing requirements6. The Council shares the Government’s ambition  and is seeking  to deliver 
sustainable communities across the Local Plan area . Identifying a sufficient supply and mix of sites, which 
takes into account availability, suitability and viability, reflects the Council’s ambition in regards to meeting 
the need for new homes.   
3.9 New development across the plan area  will promote and retain existing ser vices and facilities.  However , 
when considering how development is distributed, it is also necessary to consider the effects on existing 
infrastructure and the environment.  
3.10 The distribution of growth across the plan area  aims to deliver  the vision for the Local Plan  alongside the 
requi rements of the National Planning Policy Framework.  The Local Plan seeks to be ambitious in respect 
of housing delivery led by increased economic growth and infrastructure requirements across the plan 
area . Increased economic g rowth across the plan area  will provide more jobs and opportunities for better 
paid jobs , which will enhance local prosperity and help to address housing affordability.  The need for 
further infrastructure has been identified by service providers and commun ity consultation responses and  
increased residential development will help facilitate infrastructure delivery across the plan area  and the 
Housing Market Area.  
3.11 Across the  former Suffolk Coastal  District  many rural communities are thriving , but consultation  responses 
have identified tha t in some locations, existing services and facilities are struggling to survive and remain 
viable.  The Local Plan seeks to ensure that opportunities for development exist in these rural communities  
in order to sustain the vari ety of thriving rural communit ies over the plan period and for future 
generations.

6 NPPF paragraph 5 9. Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
31 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 3.12 The former Suffolk Coastal area has a very diverse local economy, with both outstanding economic assets 
and potential.  The plan area  hosts assets and opportunities that are amongst the most significant 
anywhere in the  UK. These matter for both current and future generations in East Suffolk and for the UK 
economy as a whole7. Across the plan area , the rural areas provide a variety of employment opportunities 
alongside the lar ger settlements and market towns.  
3.13 The Port of  Felixstowe, BT Campus at Adastral Park, offshore and renewable energy and Sizewell Nuclear 
Power Station perform key economic activities and provide significant opportunities that are also 
supported by a pletho ra of micro and small businesses and self emp loyed persons.  Numerous  micro and 
small businesses, together with those people who are self employed, make a significant contribution to the 
local economy and the Local Plan seeks to reflect the growth ambition and potential of all businesses 
operating in the plan area . 
3.14 To support the outstanding economic assets and variety of businesses operating in the plan area , the 
Council and other organisations (such as New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership) are seeking t o raise the 
level of education, skills, and t raining opportunities and apprentice schemes that are available.   
3.15 Alongside the need to increase skills and opportunities, the Local Plan seeks to provide the land to meet 
the needs of the main economic activiti es across the plan area . In order to maintain  the significant 
contribution of operations like the Port of Felixstowe and Sizewell Nuclear Power Station, the Local Plan 
will take a positive approach to land allocations which are required to meet the demands  of these sectors 
over the plan period  which are well related to the A12 and the A14 corridors .  
3.16 The former Suffolk Coastal District ’s population is ageing and by 2036, the number of working age people 
will have declined significantly unless new initiative s are developed to retain the talented younge r people 
and attract the required skills into the area.  The retention of talent and skills as well as the opportunities to 
attract new talent into the area is a fundamental part of the Norfolk and Suffolk Econom ic Strategy .  
3.17 The East of England Forecasting  Model (August 2016) forecasts the  growth in jobs by sector and reflects 
trends based upon projections at the regional level and how the individual sectors have faired relative to 
historic growth in the region.  Over the plan period (201 8 – 2036) the number  of jobs in the former Suffolk 
Coastal area is forecast to grow by 6,500 , to 68,450, predominately in the service, tourism, business and 
professional services sectors.  It is acknowledged that there is insufficie nt existing provision for small 
businesses an d limited grow on space with many land owners reluctant to build employment sites 
speculatively. This will in part limit potential economic opportunities.  
3.18 The retail sector is characterised by rapid change and c hanging consumer demands related to new 
techn ologies. There are limited identified development opportunities in and around the town centres in 
the former Suffolk Coastal  area . The plan area’s town centres and out of town retailing at Martlesham 
function wi thin a wider retail network including the cou nty town of Ipswich. Retail floorspace growth for 
goods purchased infrequently (comparison retail) is forecast to be most significant at Woodbridge and in 
7 East Suffolk Economic Growth Plan . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  32 areas East of Ipswich for regular food and other conveni ence shopping. Modest floorspace growth 
forec asts can be addressed across centres either in the area between Woodbridge, Felixstowe and Ipswich 
or between the other market towns. The Council’s approach is to support and monitor retail and town 
centre devel opment and present a clear and comprehensible  range of policies to support a balance of 
retail and services including commercial leisure in distinctive town centres.  
Boosting the Supply of Housing  
 542 new homes per year ( 9,756 over the lifetime of the plan - 2018-2036)  
 Increasing choice in the hou sing available  
 Meeting the housing needs of all sectors of the population                              
including  the growing elderly population  
Delivering more affordable housing  
3.19 It is the role of the Local Plan to set the housing re quirement for the Local Plan area . The National Planning 
Policy Framework sets out the Government’s objective to boost significantly the supply of housing . From 
the outset of the production of the Local Plan the Council has sought to set out an ambitious a nd positive 
strategy to promote the delivery of housing in the plan area , and increase the mix of housing available.  The 
East Suffolk Business Plan sets o ut the Council’s long term ambitions for East Suffolk by capitalising on the 
strengths of the area and  enabling the Council to address more significant local challenges such as the 
need for new homes that are affordable and local to our communities.  
3.20 The Na tional Planning Policy Framework states that to determine the minimum number of homes needed 
strategic  policies should be informed by a local housing need assessment conducted using the standard 
method set out in the National Planning Practice Guidance. Th e calculation of local housing need is based 
upon the 2014 -based household projections8 and is also in formed by an uplift based upon the ratio of 
earnings to house prices9. Using the standard method, the local housing need for  the former  Suffolk 
Coastal District is 542 dwellings per year. In accordance with Planning Practice Guidance the baseline for 
housi ng need will be 2018, and it is applied to the period to 2036.  
3.21 A housing requirement of 542 dwellings per annum is considered to represent an ambitious  approach to 
housing delivery, which will assist in  meet ing the needs of local communities, as well as s ignificantly 
boosting the supply of housing, consistent with  the Council’s corporate objectives.   
3.22 The Council has a  commitment to delivering new housing , including affordable housing,  across the plan 
area  to meet its own objectives,  and to deliver the hous ing needed for the area . A large amount of this 
housing is already accounted for through dwellings that are being built , those already allocated through 
8 2014 -based household projections as published by the Office for National Statistics in July 2016.  
9 Ratio of median workplace earnings to median house pric es as published by the Office for National Statistics in March 2019.  Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
33 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n previous Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans  and those with planning permission. The role of this Plan is 
to review and roll forward existing allocations and to identify further opportunities for new housing 
development to come forward to meet the identified requirement.  
3.23 In addition to the number of houses needed, there is also a need to address housing af fordability and to 
increase the mix of housing, in particular addressing demographic changes which are seeing the 
population of the elderly in th e Local Plan area continue to rise.  
Provision of Infrastructure  
3.24 The term infrastructure covers a wide variety of facilities and services, including roads, railways, schools, 
health services, police facilities, waste facilities, green infrastructure and di gital and communications 
infrastructure. Across the former Suffolk Coastal District, it is acknowledged that th ere are existing issues 
in relation to infrastructure provision and capacity, such as schools that are at or reaching capacity, 
locations where r oads and junctions are approaching capacity and broadband provision can be insufficient 
in some rural parts of the plan area .  
3.25 Enhancements to existing infrastructure, and the provision of new infrastructure, are a central part of the 
strategy for growth o ver the Local Plan period. The Council has shared ambitions along with other Councils 
and organisations, includ ing infrastructure providers, for the delivery of strategic infrastructure 
improvements as outlined in Section 2. These include improvements to t he A12 and A14, improvements to 
rail capacity, sustainable transport and enhanced digital infrastructure . Such infrastructure improvements 
will help to support economic growth in the District and to improve the quality of life for residents.  
3.26 In addition t o strategic scale infrastructure, to support development in the plan area  improvements to 
infrastructure will b e delivered. The Local Plan has sought to identify growth in locations where there may 
be opportunities for infrastructure improvements alongside  development  such as increased provision for 
education and leisure facilities . Specific improvements for infras tructure alongside development  are 
identified throughout the Plan  and detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework , Appendix B . The 
Council has worked closely with a number of infrastructure providers throughout the production of the 
Plan  to inform po licies and infrastructure requirements .  
Distribution of Growth  
Garden Neighbourhoods  
3.27 The Local Plan proposes two garden neighbourh oods at Felixstowe10 and Saxmundham11. The principles of 
Garden Cities are well established on a larger scale and many examples  of best practice are found around 
the country.  Opportunity exists through land allocations to follow the principles of Garden Cities as Garden 
Neighbourhoods for the plan area  which provide generous provision of green spaces, range of local 
10 Part of the Felixstowe Garden Neig hbourhood is also within the parish of Trimley St Mary.  
11 Part of the Saxmundham Garden Neighbourhood is also within the parish of Benhall and Sternfie ld. Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  34 facilities inc luding schools, shops, meeting places and other community spaces alongside opportunities for 
recreation, walking and cycling.  The variety of green spaces and community facilities are to be supported 
by employment opportunities and a wide choice of new hous ing to meet a range of needs , designed in a 
way which acknowledges and protects the historic environment whilst providing environmental benefit 
and enhancements and are  supported by the most up to date digital infrastructure.  
Felixstowe  
3.28 Large scale develop ment through a Garden Neighbourhood is proposed for Felixstowe to enable the 
delivery of modern leisure facilities , education provision, residential units  and other facilities  to meet the 
needs of the town as well as the District  and beyond.  The current le isure provision  at the  Leisure Centre 
and Bracke nbury Sports Centre, have reached the end of their useful life and need to be modernised.  
Felixstowe is the largest town in the plan area  and has significant opportunities for future economic 
growth supported  by the Port of Felixstowe, associated industrie s and tourism.  Felixstowe is well served in 
respect of services and facilities but directing growth to this area will support the focus on the continued 
regeneration of the town as well as minimising the need  to travel to access employment opportunities an d 
essential services and facilities.  The Local Plan seeks to address these issues through a comprehensive 
strategic garden neighbourhood masterplan for land north of Felixstowe , well connected to the existing  
town,  which will deliver leisure provision, residential units , employment opportunities,  education 
provision,  community facilities , open spaces, green infrastructure  and other supporting infrastructure.  
3.29 Previous Local Plans, through the 
Felixstowe Penins ula Area Action Plan 
identified a variety of allocations and 
area specific policies for communities 
neighbouring Felixstowe.  The villages of 
Trimley St Martin and Trimley St Mary 
were identified for growth which is 
being delivered.  The Area Action Plan 
identified a need for additional Primary 
School provision, including an early 
years setting in this part of the plan 
area . This Local Plan seeks to identify a 
site to meet this identified requirement,  
through engagement with Suffolk 
County Council , to aid the  overall provision in the communities neighbo uring Felixstowe.  
Saxmundham and the A12  
3.30 The A12 is a well used road which provides connections to many communities  with the East Suffolk branch 
line also serving these communities . Directing development to loca tions well related to the A12 will enable 
opportunities to make more use of the road and rail connections between Ipswich and Lowestoft.  
Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
35 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Increasing the level of development in these locations will help to sustain the existing communities and 
enhance the le vel of services and facilities found in this part of the plan area . 
3.31 A large proportion of development is focused on the Saxmundham Garden Neighbourhood to enable the 
delivery of required education infrastructure, utilise the connections provided by the rai lway station and 
support the improvements to the A12 proposed as part of the Suffolk Energy Gateway Four Villages 
bypass.  Saxmundham is geographically well placed to provide employment opportunities for the 
communities in the north of the plan area  and imp rove the connections between Ipswich and Lowe stoft.  
The emergence of Sizewell C Nuclear Power Station will also further support the strategic growth of 
Saxmundham as a Market Town with a variety of services and facilities.   
3.32 Consultation responses have high lighted the need for further education provision, improvements to the 
capacity of the medical practice and congestion issues in relation to the B1119 and B1121 crossroads and 
access to the supermarkets on Church Street.  This Local Plan seeks to address the se issues through a 
comprehen sive garden neighbourhood masterplan for Saxmundham which will provide employment 
opportunities, primary school, residential units  and other supporting infrastructure.  
Rural Areas  
3.33 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  has a large num ber of communities in the rur al areas and public 
consultation responses highlighted there is a need for appropriate development to be encouraged in some 
of these settlements.  The strategy reflects the need to support the numerous villages across the plan a rea 
by recognising the possib ility of higher levels of growth in some communities . Through  allocati on of  
appropriate sites some settlements will welcome higher levels of growth  than has been experienced in 
previous Local Plans.  Increasing the amount of dev elopment in rural areas refle cts the need to provide 
more housing opportunities for people with a local connection to live in rural areas  and to deliver more 
affordable housing to meet local needs . New housing should also help support existing services and  
facilities in the rural area s such as schools, employment opportunities, public houses, shops as well as 
supporting the extension of broadband and mobile provision into these areas , and also help to deliver 
infrastructure enhancements .  
Communities Neighb ouring Ipswich  
3.34 The communitie s neighbouring Ipswich have in the past seen large proportions of growth directed towards 
them which has resulted in the established communities of Rushmere St Andrew, Kesgrave and 
Martlesham.  These locations provide a comprehe nsive range of services and f acilities which meet the 
needs of the local community and those of surrounding settlements.  In April 2018, the Council granted 
outline planning permission  (DC/17/1435/OUT)  for the delivery of 2,000 homes at Brightwell Lakes12 as set 
out in the 2013 Core St rategy.  The Brightwell Lakes site is significant in terms of infrastructure provision 
and housing delivery and therefore it is not currently considered appropriate to focus the strategy of the 
12 Previously known as Adastral Park. References in this document to Adastral Park relate to the adjoi ning area of employment uses 
occupied principally by BT.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  36 Plan on  development in this part of  the plan area . However oppo rtunities are taken to plan positively for 
specific sites, including redevelopment of the Martlesham Police Headquarters and development of land at 
Humber Doucy Lane to support the delivery of housing in Ipswich Borough.  
3.35 Over t he plan period, there are opportunities for development associated with Neighbourhood Plans that 
will be reviewed to accommodate the  relatively  limited level of development expected in these locations.  
Public consultation responses highlighted the rapid ex pansion of some locations (such as Framlingham and 
Leiston) as well as the planning permission associated with Brightwell Lakes.  Taking these into account and 
the objectives for growth in other parts of the District , the Local Plan Review does not focus on  growth of 
these towns.  
Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
37 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP3. 1: Strategy for Growth  
The Council will deliver an ambitious plan for growth over the period 2018 – 2036 in the plan area  by: 
a) Supporting and facilitating economic growth through the supply of more than the baseline 
requirement of 11.7ha of land for employment uses to deliver at least 6,500 jobs and to enable  
the key economic activities  to maintain and enhance their role within th e UK economy;  
b) Sustain and support growth in retail, commercial leisure and town centres in cluding facilitating 
provision towards plan period forecasts of between 4,100 - 5,000  sqm of convenience retail 
floorspace and between 7,700 – 13,100 sqm of compariso n retail floorspace ;  
c) Significantly boosting the supply of housing, the mix of housing ava ilable and the provision of 
affordable housing, through the delivery of at least 542 new dwellings per annum (at least 9,756  
over the period 2018 - 2036);  
d) Ensuring th e provision of infrastructure needed to support growth;  
e) Protecting and enhancing the quali ty of the historic, built and natural environment across the 
District.  
The strategy for growth will seek to provide opportunities for economic growth and create and enhance 
sustainable and inclusive communities through:  
f) The delivery of new Garden Neighbou rhoods at North Felixstowe and South Saxmundham;  
g) Utilising opportunities provided by road and rail corridors, including a focus on growth in the A12 
and the A14  corri dors;  
h) New employment allocations based around key transport corridors;  
i) Strategies for mark et towns which seek to reflect and strengthen their roles and economies;  
j) Appropriate growth in rural areas that will help to support and sustain existing communities .

39 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Spatial distribution of residual housing requirement  
3.37 Whilst the total requirement is 9,756 dwellings over the period 201 8 - 2036, a large proportion of this is 
already accounted for in outstanding planning permissions, dwel lings where there is a resolution to grant 
planning permission subject to completion o f a Section 106 agreement and existing allocations  review and 
carried forward from adopted Local Plans and those contained in ‘made’ Neighbourhood Plans’ . The Local 
Plan also provides  a contingency to allow for flexibility in the delivery of sites. Table 3.2 below explains the 
residual housing figure that this Local Plan will need to provide for.  
Table 3.2 – Residual housing need calculation 
Number of dwellings  
Outstand ing planning permissions (31.3.18)  3,609  
Dwellings with resolution to grant planning

Allocations in current Local Plan or Neighbourhood 
Plans ( without  permission or resolution to grant 
subject to S106) (31.3.1 8) 976 
Total commitments (31.3.18)  6,998  
Housing requirement (2018 – 2036): ( 542 x 18)  9,756  (542 dwellings per annum)  
Residual need (requirement minus commitments)  9,756  – 6,998  = 2,758  residual need . 
This is the minimum to be planned for in the 
Local  Plan, however a contingency will also be 
incorporated. 
3.38 Table 3.3 below details the distribution of the residual figure (including the contingency) for new housing 
across the plan area  up to 2036 , through proposed allocations and requirements for Neighb ourhood Plans . 
This reflects the strategy of the Plan to di rect more significant levels of the plan area’s growth to 
Felixstowe and Saxmundham through the creation of two new Garden Neighbourhoods, to focus growth 
on the A12 and A14 corridor s and to suppor t rural communities. The strategy also reflects opportuniti es to 
set out a positive approach to future uses on brownfield sites and to enabling adjoining authorities to 
deliver their housing requirement. The figures include indicative minimum housing numbe rs provided for 
settlements with designated Neighbourhood P lan areas, as the expectation is that those Neighbourhood 
Plans will allocate sites to meet their requirement  consistent with the Local Plan strategy and the 
Settlement Hierarchy . The figures do no t include any assumptions around windfall development which  it is 
expected will come forward at a rate of at least 50 dwellings per year from 2020/21 onwards, and would 
therefore provide at least an additional 800 dwellings over the plan period.  
13 2,000 dwellings relate to the Brightwell Lakes development . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  40 3.39 Allocation s for housing in this Local Plan exceed the total dwelling requirement for the period 201 8 – 2036 
by approximately 16.5%  (approximately 1,610  dwellings) , before an allowance for windfall is factored in . 
This over -allocation provides confidence that the ove rall housing requirement will be met even if some 
allocated  sites fail to come forward.  In addition there is likely to be further development which comes 
forward on sites not identified in the plan.  These sites will either be within the Settlement Boundari es or 
through the exceptions and countryside policies or on  additional sites identified in Neighbourhood Plans.

17 Whilst Trimley St Martin and Trimley St Mary are identified as Large Villages in the settlement  hierarchy , in terms of plan area  wide 
spatial distribution it is appropriate to identify these villages alon gside Felixstowe owing to the strong functional relationship between them.  Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
41 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Settlement Hierarchy  
3.40 This Local Plan provides the opportunity to redefine the Settlement Hierarchy across the plan area . 
Whatever the size and location of a community, too much development, too soon, or of the wrong type 
can damage the environment and local distinctiveness and thereby impact on the quality of life.  The 
identification of a Settlement Hierarchy is a useful policy tool for identifying the sp atial distribution of 
development across the plan area , taking into account the role of each settlement.  
3.41 The National Planning Policy Framework encourages housing delivery where it will enhance or maintain 
the vitality of rural communities.  The Local Plan  seeks to encourage development in locations where 
people can access services and facilities and where the re is a choice of transport modes including walking, 
cycling and public transport, recognising that in some of the more rural parts of the plan area 
opportunities for sustainable transport may be more limited but that some development may, 
nevertheless, he lp to sustain communities.   
3.42 The overall objective of the Settlement Hierarchy is to deliver development that reflects the character of 
the area and co ntributes towards sustainable development, thereby supporting the needs of individual 
communities and enab ling them to prosper in the long term. Generally the larger settlements have better 
provision of day to day facilities and are able to accommodate hig her levels of growth without adversely 
impacting the character of the settlement.  
3.43 Each category within th e Settlement Hierarchy will contribute towards future growth across the plan area , 
with the largest levels of growth appropriate to  the Major Centres and Market Towns and more limited 
development coming forward in the rural settlements.  To facilitate this development and encourage 
communities to prosper, Settlement Boundaries  are defined to guide the location of new  development.  
New allocations for deve lopment are identified in some of the settlements in the hierarchy to provide 
certainty in respect of the location of future growth  and to reflect the spatial strategy . 
3.44 The Settlement Hierarchy has been defined through a scoring mechanism related to the pr esence of 
certain services and facilities. The list of services and facilities considered included:  
Conve nience stores,  
Primary schools,  
Village halls / community centres,  
Play areas,  
Employment opportunities,  
Medical facilities,  
Public transport an d,  
For villages, proximity to a major centre or town. 
3.45 In order to  be identified as a Large Village, settlements need to have a primary school, village hall / 
community centre and a convenience store, as part of the mix of services and facilities present.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  42 Policy SCLP3. 2: Settlement Hierarchy  
The Settlement Hierarchy en ables the Council to achieve its vision for the plan area , meeting the scale of 
development required and enhancing the quality of the built, natural, historic, social and cultural 
environme nts whilst sustaining the vitality of communities. 
The development  requirements for Major Centres, Market Towns, Large Villages and Small Villages will be 
delivered through site allocations in the Local Plan or in Neighbourhood Plans, plus through windfal l 
development in accordance with other policies in this Local Plan.  
The development requirements in the Countryside will come forward through Neighbourhood Plans and 
windfall sites in accordance with other policies in this Local Plan.

3.47 The Settlement Hierarchy has informed the identification of land for allocation for housing in the Local 
Plan. Strategies for Major Centres and Market Towns are based upon the circumstances and opportunities 
relevant to each, as detailed in Section  12 of t his Plan.  The starting point is that Large Villages and Small 
Villages are, in principle, suitable places to accommodate new housing. Consideration has been given to 
other factors in determining whether a set tlement is a suitable location for additional ho using growth, 
including infrastructure capacity, the existence of suitable sites and consultation responses.  
3.48 Table 3.5 below shows the anticipated level of housing delivery in each Town and Parish (for settl ements in 
the Settlement Hierarchy). Note  these figures do not include an allowance for windfall which it is 
anticipated will come forward across the plan area  at a rate of 50 dwellings per year , and will enable 
housing to come forward in those settlements  where allocations are not proposed . It is antic ipated that, 
with the greater development opportunities provided by the ‘Housing in Clusters in the Countryside’ policy 
(Policy  SCLP5.4), windfall development in the countryside will increase above previous l evels. Therefore 
the 1.5% indicative level of gr owth for countryside locations based on completions and commitments is 
presented as a minimum. A Housing Trajectory which indicates delivery on a timescale over the lifetime of 
the Local Plan is contained in Appendix D. 
3.49 As Table 3.5 shows, a significant el ement of the supply of housing is contained within existing permissions 
and those permitted on sites of five or more dwellings are shown on the Policies Maps. Alternative uses Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  46 that would prejudice the quantum  of residential use permitted being developed on  these sites will be 
resisted.

Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  50 Settl ement Boundaries  
3.50 Settlement Boundaries  are a policy line on a map which is used to define the built up area(s) of a 
settlement.  The Settlement Boundaries , subject to other policies of this Local Plan, indicate where 
development for housing, employment and town centre development would be suitable.  Inside the 
Settlement Boundaries , there is a policy presumption that development is acceptable in pr inciple.  Outside 
of these boundaries, opportunities for housing development are considerably more limited as coun tryside 
policies of restraint will apply.  Settlement Boundaries are drawn to include any allocations for 
development that adjoin the previous b oundary.  
3.51 These boundaries allow for flexibility in the Local Plan by potentially allocating more development tha n is 
planned for by the allocation of specific sites, at the same time as avoiding the loss of further undeveloped 
land in the countryside and controlling the sprawl of existing settlements.  
Policy SCLP3. 3: Settlement Boundaries  
Settlement Boundaries are d efined on the Policies Map and apply to Major Centres, Market Towns, Large 
Villages and Small Villages. Land which is outside of Settlement Bou ndaries  and which isn’t allocated for 
development  in the Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plans is defined as Country side.  
New development within defined settlement boundaries will be acceptable in principle, subject to 
consideration of other relevant policies  of the development plan.  
New residential, employment and town centre development will not be permitted in the Co untryside 
except where specific policies in this Local Plan or Neighbourhood Plans indicate otherwise.  
Proposals for new residential developmen t outside of the Settlement Boundaries and outside of land 
which is allocated for development will be carefully m anaged  in accordance with national planning policy 
guidance and the strategy for the Countryside.  
Neighbourhood Plans can make minor adjustment s to Settlement Boundaries and allocate additional land 
for residential, employment and town centre development p roviding that the adjustments and allocations 
do not undermine the overall strategy and distribution as set out in this Local Plan.  Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
51 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Major Energy Infrastructure  
3.52 The Suffolk Coast is at the forefront of electricity energy generation across the country bo th in respect of 
onshore and offshore energy.  It is essential that major energy infrastructure projects are delivered in a 
planned way w hich takes into account the potential impact of constructing , operating and 
decommissioning  large and nationally signifi cant infrastructure in East Suffolk . The Council is committed to 
working in a collaborative partnership approach with the scheme promote rs, local communities, 
Government, New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, service providers and public bodies to ensur e the 
best outcomes of major energy infrastructure projects can be achieved.  
3.53 The Government, through the Department for Business, Energy  and Industrial Strategy is committed to the 
increased delivery of Nuclear Energy Provision across the country.  A new nu clear power station at Sizewell 
is a nominated site in the National Policy Statement for Nuclear Power Generation EN6 as part of this 
national package.  Nuclear Energy has been generated at Sizewell since the 1960’s and the operation of the 
site will contin ue beyond the plan period as a result of the separate operations that take place such as the 
decommissioning programme at Sizewell A and  the continued production at Sizewell B and at a new 
station.   
3.54 The decisions in respect of the new power station will be  taken at a national level as a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) with various regulators assessing safety, security and other issues 
through the necessary design and construction.  Decisions on any other energy related projects identifie d 
as NSIPs will also be taken at a national level, taking into consideration relevant National Policy 
Statements.  The Council would be a  statutory consultee in this process. However it is considered that one 
of the biggest development and construction prog rammes faced by the Council and its communities in 
generations should be developed alongside the overall policy framework for East Suffo lk to enable the 
impacts and benefits to be managed, including addressing the issues of cumulative impact and outcomes 
of other large scale projects.  
3.55 The role of the Local Plan will be to consider the suitability of any specific proposal and the mitigation  of 
local impacts (both positive and negative) on the communities across the plan area  and to realise the 
economic benef its during the construction, operation and decommissioning stages . The current Sizewell 
site is a  rural location in close proximity to t he town of Leiston and other nearby settlements such as 
Aldringham cum Thorpe and Eastbridge. In addition the wider high way and rail network to this location is 
challenging. As well as the social impacts affecting the communities nearby, the environmental impacts of 
a site on the coast, within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and close to protected landscapes such 
as Sizewell Marshes and Minsmere  Nature Reserve, and the impact on the Suffolk Seascape will need to be 
assessed both during construction and beyond.  Impacts on the historic environment should be avoided, 
and if not possible, minimised. Opportunities to co -locate infrastructure may reduc e impacts, and there 
may be opportunities to enhance the setting of assets through restoration after construction, operation 
and decommissioning.  Focus should be on prevention of impact on the natural and historic environments 
as opposed to compensation fo r the effect.  Where a project involves multiple consents, developers will be 
expected to work collaboratively with authorities to prepare a project wide Habitats Regulations 
Assessment.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  52 3.56 Although the provision of nuclear energy  is currently prominent, the Suffolk Coast is increasingly coming 
under pressure to support developments associated with the off shore energy sector and linking this into 
the national grid, as well as inter -continental connections to enable the exchange of  electricity with other 
count ries. Investment in a variety of major energy infrastructure projects needs to be supported by 
infrastructure and facilities on shore and these sectors are expected to require land to enable activities 
over the plan period . Whe re new major energy projects are proposed, potential alternative sites, located 
outside of designated areas should be considered at an early stage. Where possible companies and 
developers will be encouraged to work collaboratively and share infrastructure and facilities that serve 
other requirements to reduce any potential impacts  during the construction, operation and 
decommissioning stages of projects . 
3.57 The cumulative impact of hosting a variety of major energy infrastructure facilities in the area is like ly to 
have an impact on exist ing and future generations.  To balance this impact a variety of local economic, 
environmental and community mitigation and enhancement measures  may be required to ensure 
proposed Major Energy Infrastructure Projects are accepta ble in planning terms.  Commun ity mitigation 
and enhancement could take many different forms over the plan period, but in land use terms these could 
be in the form of but not limited to examples such as sports facilities, meeting places, woodland planting 
schemes or habitat creation. A ny measures proposed would need to be in accordance with the tests for 
planning obligations and planning conditions set out in the National Planning Policy Framework.  
3.58 The timing of the Major Energy Infrastructure Projects acros s East Suffolk  is not yet con firmed and the 
planning, construction, operation and decommissioning of existing and future projects are likely to be 
beyond the Local Plan period  but are required to have regard to the policies in the Local Plan .  It is not 
possible to fully identify all the issues that may arise as a result of individual or cumulative projects for local 
communities and operators. As such, this will need to be kept under consideration alongside future 
reviews of the Local Plan.   
3.59 A variety of lo cal issues have been identified by the Council, as local planning authority, which need to be 
addressed in relation to Major Energy Infrastructure Projects. The Council will work with the local 
community, other local authorities, Government agencies, servi ce providers and operators to ensure the 
most successful outcomes are achieved. Although Table 3.6  identifies a variety of issues that may not be 
relevant to every Major Energy infrastructure Project, it  is intended to inform pre -application  and early 
enga gement discussions and provides an early view on potential constraints and opportunities across the  
plan area .

In its role either as determining authority for development under the Town and Country Planning Act, or as 
consultee on National ly Significant Infrastructure Projects, the Council will take into consideration the 
nature, s cale, extent and potential impact of proposals for Major Energy Infrastructure Projects, including 
cumulative impacts throughout their lifetime, including decommi ssioning  of existing plant and facilities . 
The Council will work in partnership with the sche me promoter, local communities, National Grid, 
Government, New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, service providers, public bodies and relevant local 
authoritie s to ensure significant local community benefits and an ongoing legacy of the development is 
achieved as part of any Major Infrastructure Projects as outlined in Table 3.6.  
Proposals for Major Energy  Infrastructure Projects across the plan area  and the need to mitigate the 
impacts arising from these will have regard to  the following poli cy requirem ents:  
a) Relevant Neighbourhood Plan policies, strategies and visions;
b) Appropriate packages of local communit y benefit to mitigate the impacts of  disturbance
experienced by the local community for hosting major infrastructure projects;
c) Community safety and co hesion impacts;
d) Requirement for a robust Environmental Impact Assessment
e) Requirement for a robust Habitats Regulations Assessment;
f) Requirement for a robust Heritage Impact Assessment;
g) Requirement for robust assessment of the potential impacts on the Suffo lk Coast and Heaths Area
of Outstanding Natural Beauty;
h) Appropriate flood and erosion defences, inc luding the effects of climate change are incorporated
into the project to protect the site during the construction, operational and decommissioning
stages;
i) Appropriate road and highway measures are introduced (including diversion routes) for
construction, operational and commercial traffic to reduce the pressure on the local communities;
j) The development and associated infrastructure proposals will seek to deli ver positive outcomes

3.60 The provisi on of new and improved infrastructure is essential to ensure the growth planned in the plan 
area  is sustainable. Infrastructure includes a wide range of facilities and services including schools, medical 
facilities, police facilities, community facilities,  open space, public rights of way, roads, railways, cycle paths 
and flood defences.  
3.61 The Council has undertaken evidence to support the Local Plan, including:  
Economic Area Needs Assessment (2017) - identifies forecasted economic growth across t he 
plan are a and any ancillary infrastructure that may be required to facilitate such growth.  
Economic Area Sector Needs Assessment (2017) – identifies the specific needs of economic 
sectors across the plan area . 
Retail & Leisure Study (2017) - assesses th e retail an d leisure need across the former Suffolk 
Coastal District, identifying projected retail and leisure infrastructure requirements going 
forward.  
Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2018) - indicates areas of the  former Suffolk Coastal  
Distri ct where fl ood defence infrastructure may be required based on allocated development.  
Leisure Strategy – the Council’s Leisure Strategy (2014) and supporting assessments identify the 
needs for open space and built leisure facilities across the plan area . 
Transport mo delling – analyses the effects of proposed growth on the transport network and 
identifies areas of the network where transport mitigation measures may be needed to 
accommodate growth.  
Whole Plan Viability – assesses the policies and proposals wi thin the Lo cal Plan to ensure that 
the plan is deliverable over the plan period.  
Water Cycle Study – considers the capacity of the water supply and treatment network in 
relation to potential growth.  
Habitats Regulation Assessment – assesses the impacts of the plan in  relation to potential harm 
to the integrity of European protected sites, under the Europ ean Habitats Directive , and 
identifies the needs for Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace where necessary . 
3.62 The Council has worked closely with Suffolk County Counci l and other infrastructure providers to ascertain 
infrastructure requirements related to growth planned in the Local Plan. This engagement will continue 
throughout the implementation  of the Plan.  Over the plan period, the Council will continue to update it s 
evidence base and where necessary engage with service providers, funding partners and the Government 
to ensure that infrastructure projects are delivered in a timely manner to the benefit of the  District , the 
county of Suffolk and the rest of the country . 
3.63 Appendix B  of this Plan provides a summary of the infrastructure needed in the former Suffolk Coastal 
District  and how and when it is expected to be delivered to support growth.  
3.64 All n ew develop ment has a responsibility to contribute towards the cost of new infrastructure. 
Infrastructure is often funded by developers either through section 106 planning obligations or the Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
57 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Community Infrastructure Levy. Section 106 planning obligations are bespoke agreements made between 
the Council and the developer where the developer either delivers new infrastructure or contributes 
money to fund infrastructure to meet the need that development generates. The Community 
Infrastructure Levy is a standard per sqm ch arge currently on housing and convenience retail development  
which the Council pools together to deliver necessary infrastructure.  
3.65 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  has had a Community Infrastructure Levy in place since July 2015, and this 
is currently the m ain way in which the Council collects funds from development . The rates of the Levy are 
set out in the Council’s Charging Schedule  which can be found on the Council’s website . The Council 
intends to retain the Levy for most infrastructure funding. The Coun cil will however, need to review the 
Levy, particularly with  respect to the larger sites allocated in the Local Plan. This is because these sites will 
have on -site infrastructure which may be more effectively secured through section 106 planning 
obligation s. 
3.66 Policy SCLP3. 5 sets out the strategic approach to infrast ructure delivery  in the plan area . The policy seeks 
to ensure that  all new  developments will be well supported by new and improved infrastructure.  
3.67 Most needs generated by new development wil l necessitate improvements to existing infrastructure 
rather  than completely new provision. Therefore, most infrastructure provision will take place outside of 
development sites. This infrastructure will be funded by the Community Infrastructure Levy and o ther 
sources of funding such as the Clinical Commissioning G roup  
3.68 The Habitats Regulation Assessment of this Local Plan recommends that clarity is provided in the Local Plan 
regarding the timely delivery of required infrastructure and treatment capabi lities for phosphate, 
ammonia and nitrogen in order to ensur e that there are no significant effects on European sites. The Cross 
Boundary Water Cycle Study identifies water recycling centres where treatment measures are expected to 
be needed to ensure that  the objectives of the Water Framework Directive and the Hab itats Regulation 
Directive are not compromised. This may also include improvements to the wider wastewater network. 
Anglian Water, in their role as a water company, and the Environment Agency, in their environmental 
oversight capacity, advise that phasing of development should be provided for in this respect. However, 
this should only be required where the size and type of development allows for phasing and where 
improvement works are identified. T he cumulative impact of development should also be considere d 
when determining the need for phasing.  
3.69 Opportunities may arise for the provision of open space on site as part of new housing sites. This will be 
assessed on a case by case basis. The pro vision of new open space on site increases the opportunities  and 
accessibility for play, physical activity and recreation which contributes significantly towards the health and 
well-being of the population. This will be secured through planning conditions and/or section 106 planning 
obligations. Provision of open s pace can also help to mitigate impacts of recreational pressure on 
protected environments. The necessary infrastructure requirements should form part of the Habitats 
Regulations Assessment where o ne is required, and information will be required to be submi tted to 
demonstrate that the infrastructure provision will not impact upon European protected sites.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  58  3.70  Other on -site infrastructure is only likely to be necessary as part of much larger deve lopments where a 
new primary school or community centre for example may be needed. However, there are specific local 
needs where smaller developments can enable the delivery of infrastructure that satisfies local needs on 
site. On -site infrastructure will generally be secured through section 106 planning obligation s. The 
development of a new leisure centre for Felixstowe is central to the Local Plan strategy for the town, and 
will be delivered as part of the North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood.  
 3.71  Effective telecommunications, including broadband and mobile p hone signals are essential for economic 
development and to support communities. However, coverage remains poor in some areas, particularly 
outside of the towns. Policy SCLP8.4 is supportive of its  facilitation where necessary and appropriately 
designed.  Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strategy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
59 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP3.5 : Infrastructure Provision 
The Council will work with partners including, Suffolk County Council, Parish and Town Councils, Suffolk 
Constabulary, Highways England, Environment Agency, Anglian Water, Essex and Suffolk Water, UK Power 
Networks an d the Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group to ensure that the growth over 
the plan period  is supported by necessary infrastructure in a timely manner. 
Developers must consider th e infrastructure requirements needed to support and service the proposed 
development. All development will be expected to contribute as necessary  towards infrastructure 
provision to meet the needs generated. 
Off-site infrastructure will generally be funded by the Community Infrastructure Levy. On -site 
infrastructu re will generally be secured and funded through section 106 planning obligations. 
Development will be expected to contribute t o the delivery and enh ancement of infrastructure which 
encourages active lifestyles and healthy communities, through on site prov ision where appropriate to the 
scale and nature of development and through CIL contributions.  Open space should be provided on new 
residential develo pment sites to contribute to the provision of open space and recreational facilities to 
meet identified nee ds, in accordance with Policy SCLP8.2.  
In locations where there is inadequate capacity within local catchment schools development should 
contribute to the expansion or other measures to increase places available at the school. Where new 
primary schools ar e provided these should be in locations which are well located in relation to the 
catchments they will serve, and which maximise opportunities for wa lking and cycling to school. 
Development adjacent to existing schools should not compromise the ability of schools to expand to an 
appropriate size in the future. 
Development will be expected to follow the principles of Holistic Water Management as set ou t in Policy 
SCLP9.7 and  will not be permitted where it would have a significant effect on the capacity of e xisting water 
infrastructure. Specifically, developers should provide evidence to ensure there is capacity in the water 
recycling centre and the wast ewater network in time to serve the development. Where there is 
insufficient  capacity in the water recycli ng centre, Anglian Water will review the requirements for 
investment  and development will need to be phased , where necessary,  in order to allow time for 
improvement works to take place , if required . The improvements shall ensure there is no breach of 
envir onmental legislations particularly in relation to the Water Framework Directive and Habitats 
Regulations Directive or subsequent replacements.  
Devel opment should not be permitted where the electricity supply network cannot accommodate it. 
Particular regar d should be had to large scale employment sites, which are regarded as particularly energy 
intensive development. The Council will work with UK Power  Networks to ensure that development 
proposed in this Local Plan does not conflict with the electricity sup ply network. 
The Council will work with the digital infrastructure industry to maximise access to super -fast broadband, 
wireless hotspots and improv ed mobile signals for all residents and businesses. All new developments Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Suffolk Coastal Spatial Strat egy 
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  60 must provide the most viable high -speed broadband connection. Infrastructure relating to new 
developments should be designed so as not to impede or obstruct connection to antennae or masts in the 
local vicinity. Early engagement with the relevant digital infrastructure provider should be u ndertaken to 
avoid such a scenario.  
To support the provision of waste management infrastructure,  where the size of the development allows 
for it ‘bring sites ’ should be included in the design and layout of development s to encourage recycling 
measures and t o reduce the demand on Household Waste Recycling Centres .  
 
Enabling Development  
 3.72  The concept of enabling development, whereby an exception to planning policy is permitted in order to 
allow for development that will provide sufficient public benefit , is one supported by the Council where 
appropriate. Across the plan area , a number of su ccessful examples have been delivered through 
partnerships between landowners, service providers, local communities and the Council.  
 3.73  The Council consider that e nabling development could be required in a number of circumstances such in 
the conservati on of a heritage asset, enhancement of sports facilities, coastal defence and flood 
adaptation measures where necessary. The exceptional individual circumstances where  enabling 
development may be supported by the Council in exceptional circumstances needs to be justified, 
transparent and deliverable as a comprehensive package, with clear community benefits.  
 3.74  Over the plan period the public benefits associated with  enabling development are expected to change 
and the Council will keep this under review through regular monitoring. If considered necessary, the 
Council may introduce a Supplementary Planning Document to provide further detail and justification in 
respect  of enabling development.

4.1 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  makes a significant contribution to regional, national and international 
economies. This includes the presence of the Port of Felixstowe, Sizewell Nuclear Power Station and  BT 
Adastral Park. The Local Plan supports these major economic drivers.  It also supports complementary and 
broader business growth and enterprise across the  area  including the changing rural, agricultural and 
logistics economies.  
4.2 The Government’s 2017  Industrial Strategy places empha sis on supporting businesses to create better, 
higher paid employment and self -employment throughout the United Kingdom with investment in the 
skills, industries and infrastructure of the future. The Industrial Strategy seeks t o ensure that every part of 
the country realises its full potential. The New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership has an ambitious desire 
to drive business growth and productivity and build the skills to enable the economies of Norfolk and 
Suffolk to prospe r, with a high performing, pr oductive economy. The Local Plan has a key role in the 
implementation of the economic visions to enable  the Suffolk Coastal  Local Plan area  to realise its 
potential.  
4.3 The East Suffolk Economic Growth Plan 2018 -23 sets out a visi on to ‘ focus on building busi ness confidence 
and with it, both the capacity and ambition of our businesses to invest and grow. ’ The Local Plan is a key 
contributor to this vision through the identification of appropriate land, premises  and opportunities fo r 
economic growth.  
4.4 Evidence prepared identifies that between 2001 and 2016, employment grew by 13.4% in the former 
Suffolk Coastal  area  and is expected to see an increase in the number of jobs over the Local Plan period to 
203639. The Council  has economic a mbitions and the Local Plan sets out how the main economic drivers 
can be supported, as well as providing the opportunities and conditions for small enterprises to start and 
flourish in the area  and create better, higher paid employme nt. 
4.5 Creating opportuni ties for businesses to invest and grow over the plan period can facilitate and develop 
training opportunities  such as apprenticeship schemes and enhance skills prospects for the local 
community. Through the creation of further trainin g and development oppo rtunities, the  plan area  can 
experience economic growth by increasing skills, productivity and better paid employment prospects as 
well as jobs growth.  
4.6 The former Suffolk Coastal District is well placed to embrace economic changes and  opportunities over th e 
plan period by providing a range of employment areas in suitably accessible locations.  
4.7 The former Suffolk Coastal District is home to a number of large scale strategic businesses such as the Port 
of Felixstowe, Sizewell Nuclear Powe r Station and BT Campu s at Adastral Park and it is important that the 
 
39 Ipswich Economic Area Sector Needs Assessment, September 2017 (Lichfields) . Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
63 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Local Plan responds to their needs.  Not only are these businesses large employers but they also have a 
positive impact on the supply chains and related commercial activities in both  East Suffolk and the 
neigh bouring authorities of Babergh, Ipswich  and Mid Suffolk as well the national and international 
economies.  
4.8 The local economy is also diverse, made up of many small and medium enterprises that collectively 
provide a variety of economic opportunities, jobs an d services. Planning policies reflect that over the Local 
Plan period new businesses and business sectors will emerge, as experienced in recent years, with the 
emergence of creative businesses and film technologies at locations like R endlesham which has bo osted 
the number of enterprises in East Suffolk.  
4.9 The mixture of large scale strategic businesses alongside small and medium enterprises reflects the 
economic potential across the plan area . The Local Plan needs to ensure that the eco nomy is able to 
prospe r and grow with a combination of suitable sites for serviced employment land and supporting 
infrastructure.  
Existing Employment Areas  
4.10 To support the local  economy and realise the economic ambitions for the area as outlined in the Econ omic 
Strategy for Norf olk and Suffolk and the East Suffolk Economic Growth Plan, the Local Plan needs to 
identify and preserve a range of employment sites to achieve these ambitions. Previous Local Plans made a 
distinction between strategic and general emp loyment areas. In real ity this has made little difference to 
the development taking place so this Local Plan , based on consultation responses , simplifies the approach 
and uses the term Employment Areas for all sites. This approach should continue to create the conditions 
to fac ilitate business opportunities for investment, expansion and adaptation on a variety of sites across 
the plan area  to de liver the economic vision for the area .  
4.11 To ensure this happens over the plan period, it is therefore essential that the Local Plan ensu res a flexible 
supply of land for a variety of employment sectors, targeted at the needs of businesses operating across 
the plan area  including the delivery of start up units. For example, Port related operations in locations well 
related to the Port of Fe lixstowe or film and creative industries emerging at Rendlesham.  
4.12 Area specific policies for existing Employment Areas a re outlined in Neighbourhood Plans and Chapter 12 
of the Local Plan and these secure employment development on a range of established si tes and premises. 
Employment Area  policies are found at:  
 Policy SCLP12.7: Port of Felixstowe  
 Policy SCLP12.8: Land at Bridge Road, Felixstowe  
 Policy SCLP12.9: Land at Carr Road/Langer Road, Felixstowe

 Policy  SCLP12.4 1: Riverside Industrial Estate, Border Cot Lane, Wickham Market  
 
4.13 A variety of employment areas are identified  in the Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plans  to cater for the 
needs of all sectors in the plan area . Some of these are established sites with buildings and infrastructure 
already in place and covered by existing planning permissions or established lawful uses. The Local Plan 
allocates a new employment area  at the Seven Hills junction of the A12 and A14,  as well as expecting some 
employment development to come forward alongside the development of the garden neighbourhoods at 
Saxmundham and Felixstowe. In other locations, the policies support new employme nt development 
within Settlement Boundaries, along w ith appropriate development in the countryside, such as through 
conversions and farm diversification schemes.  
4.14 Economic growth related to the logistics sector and the Port of Felixstowe can provide opport unities for 
employment development.  It is vitally im portant that the Local Plan can appropriately meet the current 
needs of the logistics sector and have the flexibility to meet future needs.  In recent years the changing 
nature of customer demands such as online shopping and next day delivery expectations r equires new 
technologies and patterns of distribution to meet the needs of these sectors operating across the plan 
area .  
4.15 Policy SCLP4.1 also allows for quasi -retail uses such as car showrooms, tyre and e xhaust centres and 
builders merchants on the main ro ad frontages of Employment Areas.  These uses are often not suitable in 
town centre locations due to their size and characteristics.  If located within existing Employment Areas, 
conflicts between industria l traffic and general traffic can occur.  Therefore a  more appropriate location is 
on the main road frontages of these areas.  These uses can sometimes improve the appearance of 
industrial areas, and by allowing them on existing employment areas, it provides  a suitable developed 
location for these uses which are difficult to accommodate in town centres.  
 
 
Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
65 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP4.1: Existing Employment Areas  
Existing Employment Areas are identified in Area Specific Strategy Policies in Section 12 of the Local Plan 
and o n the Policies Map  or Neighbourhood Plans . 
New development for employment uses which takes place during the plan period (including sites currently 
with consent for employment use) will be treated as existing Employment Areas for the purposes of this 
Policy  and Policies SCLP 4.2, SCLP4.3 and SCLP4.4.  
Within existing Employment Areas, premises currently in B1, B2 and B8 use will be protected from change 
of use and redevelopment to other uses.  Exceptionally, quasi -retail uses (not falling within use class A1) 
may be permitted on  the main road frontages of Employment Areas which have good access to a range of 
transport options. Such development should not be detrimental to the efficient and effective use of the 
remainder of the Employment Area.  
Outside of the existing Employment A reas, the redevelopment or change of use of existing employment 
premises will be considered under Policy SCLP4.4  
Neighbourhood Plans may identify additional premises or clusters of premises outside of existing 
Employment Areas within use classes B1, B2 and  B8 for protection from redevelopment or change of use if 
local evidence supports it.  
 
New Employment Development  
4.16 Across the plan area  a number of established Employment Areas provide land and buildings for a variety of 
economic opportun ities as detailed in Policy SCLP4.1.  
4.17 Through the allocation of new land for employment development, the Local Plan can provide opportunities 
for new local and inward investment to come forward over the plan period which will improve economic 
vibrancy and e nterprise across t he plan area . The creation of well situated  sites for new employment 
development will broaden the range of sites available and offer flexibility to potential occupiers and users 
which is welcomed by the Council.  In appropriate locations o pportunities to utilise the main road frontage 
of sites ensur es that a high quality design is brought forward which is in keeping with the surrounding area 
and raises the economic potential across the area.  
4.18 Ensuring a range of appropriate sites to facilita te business start ups and incubator units as well as sites fo r 
established businesses to grow into, enables commercial activity across the plan area  to be free from 
barriers to business and supports productivity and prosperity across East Suffolk . Making p rovision for new 
employment develop ment can encourage new tec hnologies to be introduced and for industries to cluster 
by sectors which emerge over the plan period.   
4.19 New employment development will also provide opportunities to be realised for all sectors a s and when 
the economic conditions are right. Another key ben efit to the provision of new employment areas is that it Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Economy  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  66 will provide opportunities to renew the existing stock of business premises which in some parts of the plan 
area  are not fit for purpose o r are coming to the end of their useable life. Without the al location of new 
land, there is very limited flexibility to renew and regenerate the existing sites.  
4.20 Where businesses within existing Employment Areas wish to expand onto adjacent land outside of the 
existing Employment Area , Policy SCLP4. 3 allows for this.  For new employment development Policy 
SCLP4.2  requires it to be demonstrated that there is an additional need for t he employment development 
over and above the needs identified in the Local Plan , or alternatively there is no suitable land within 
existing Employment Areas, existing employment allocations or within Settlement Boundaries.  
4.21 In demonstrating an additional need, evidence submitted with the planning application should provide 
informatio n on latest economic forecasts or bespoke forecasts for the r elevant sector.  The evidence of 
need should also justify the locational requirements for the development and also  review the land and 
premises available together with the specific locational requ irements of the proposed development.  The 
review of land and premises availability should assess whether the alternative land or premises are 
suitable (with regard to spec ific locational requirements), available (the landowner is willing to sell at 
market value) and achievable (whether the alternative land is vi able to develop).  
4.22 Section 12 of the Local Plan identifies a number of sites for new employment development. Each of these 
have site specific policies and are outlined in:  
 Policy SCLP12.3 North Felixs towe Garden Neighbourhood (as part of the masterplanned 
approach),  
 Policy SCLP12. 20 Land at Felixstowe Road,  
 Policy SCLP12.2 9 South Saxmundham Garden Neighbourhood (as part of the masterplanned 
approach) . 
 Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
67 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP4.2: New Em ployment Development  
The Cou ncil will support the delivery of new employment development to provide greater choice and 
economic opportunities in suitably located areas across the plan area . Other uses which are functionally 
related to the economic activity  on the site and the local a rea will also be supported.  
Proposals for new employment development falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 outside of existing 
Employment Areas but within Settlement Boundaries will be supported where these do not have an  
unacceptable  adverse impact on the surrounding land use , living conditions of local residents  and local 
highway network.   
Proposals for new employment development falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 on land outside of 
Settlement Boundaries will be per mitted where a need for additio nal employment development has been 
demonstrated or it can be demonstrated that there is no sequentially preferable land available  adjacent to 
existing Employment Areas, within  existing Employment Areas o r within Settlement B oundaries and:  
 
a) It would not ha ve an unacceptable  adverse impact on surrounding land use;  and 
b) It avoids, or adequately mitigates, any  adverse impact on the character of the surrou nding area 
and landscape, the AO NB and its setting or the natural or historic environment . 
In addition to th e above, proposals for B1a office premises outside of town centres  other than for small 
scale rural offices in accordance with Policies SCLP4.5, SCLP4.6 and SCLP4.7  on sites not allocated for 
employment use, should also be subject to a sequential test whic h demonstrates that there are no suitable 
and available sites with in firstly town centres and then edge of centre sites to accommodate the proposal . 
 
Expansion and Intensification of Employment Sites  
4.23 The Council ac knowledges that over the plan period, it may be necessary for some existing employment 
premises to require expansion and or intensification of their operations.  Across the plan area  there may be 
circumstances where  it is not suitable and practical to support economic growth aspirations and this p olicy 
provides the criteria against which proposals to expand, alter or make productivity enhancements to 
existing employment premises will be supported.  
4.24 The East Suffolk Economic Growth Strategy seeks to support all businesses across the plan area  to ensu re a 
successful and prosperous economy.  The successful delivery of this strategy will be assisted by a positive 
policy which encourages sustainable economic growth and allows for the expansion, intensification or 
adaptation of existing premises.  Opportunit ies for sustainable growth and productivity may also be  
realised by the co -location of business activities to realise synergies that may further boost local 
prosperity.  In the plan area  this could include opportunities that may come forward in relation to high

include expansio n of the current site or relocation to another.  These e nterprises may be either on 
allocated Employment Areas o r on individual sites within an existing and lawful employment use.   
4.26 Some employment sites by their nature have a greater impact on their local e nvironment and the 
economic operations anticipated to t ake place on a site is an important consideration in respect of 
expansion and intensification of premises. Applicants will be required to demonstrate that their proposals 
for expansion or intensificati on of employment premises do not have a material harm o n the environment 
and that any adverse impacts can be successfully mitigated.  In respect of B1 activities which are main town 
centres uses, applicants will need to demonstrate that there is no sequenti ally preferable land available.  
4.27 Where employment premis es are located close to residential areas and proposals would have a 
detrimental impact on residential amenity by virtue of noise, odour or dust for example, the Council will 
seek to assist in identify ing alternative suitable location(s) within the plan ar ea for continued economic 
activity.  
Policy SCLP4.3: Expansion and Intensification of Employment Sites  
Proposals to expand, alter or make productivity enhancements to existing employment premises will b e 
permitted unless:  
 
a) The scale of development would cause a severe impact on the highway network; or  
b) There will be an unacceptable  adverse effect on  the environmental sustainability of the area; or  
c) The proposed use is not compatible with the surrounding em ployment uses in terms of car 
parking, access, noise, odour and other amenity concerns; or  
d) There is an unacceptable  adverse effect on the living conditions of local residents and businesses 
relating  to matters of noise, vibration, dust and light; and  
e) Poten tial adverse impacts can not be successfully mitigated.  
Where ex pansion or intensification of existing premises falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 cannot 
reasonably take place within existing Employment Areas, development will be permitted on adjacen t land 
outside of Settlement  Boundaries providing it does not have an unacceptable  impact  on surrounding land 
uses.  
 
Protection of Employment Premises  
4.28 Over the plan period, it is anticipated that in exceptional circumstances employment premises will be lo st, 
despite the strong and prosperous local economy. However, it is important to retain these premises to 
support the economic prosperity of the plan ar ea. Employment premises provide a contribution to the 
local economy and the majority of existing operati ons remain suitable and should be protected for 
economic development and regeneration.  Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
69 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 4.29 When employment uses cease to operate from a site, the land and b uildings often come under pressure 
for redevelopment. The Local Plan acknowledges the importance of a vi brant and successful local economy 
and therefore takes a positive approach to the protection of employment premises.  
4.30 In April 2016 the Council published  the Commercial Property Marketing Best Practice Guide. The 
document focuses on the information that the  Council would expect in support of planning applications for 
the change of use of commercial premises and sites. The principles of this guide have  been  included within 
Appendix E. 
Policy SCLP4.4: Protection of Employment Premises  
Employment premises acros s the plan area  will be protected for their established B class uses unless:  
 
a) Marketing evidence is provided which demonstrates that the premises have b een marketed for a 
sustained period of 12 months in accordance with the re quirements set out in Appendix  E; 
b) There would be substantial planning benefit in permitting alternative  uses; and  
c) The proposed use is compatible with the surrounding uses in terms of  car parking, access, noise, 
odour and other amenity concerns.  
Proposals for loss of employment premises  to be used for residential use will only be permitted in 
exceptional circumstances where there is no current or long term need for the premises  and the site is 
within the defined Settlement Boundary.  
 
Economic Development in Rural Areas  
4.31 Economic activity  also takes place outside of the towns and the identified Employment Areas in rural 
locations.  It is important that the Local Plan continues to maximise the potential of these activities to 
support the rural economy and provide a valuable source of jobs lo cally.  
4.32 National planning policy seeks to support a prosperous rural economy through the sustainable growth and 
expansion of businesses in the ru ral areas.  Agriculture is particularly important to the plan area’s  economy 
and there is a need to enable the se ctor to erect new buildings, structures and infrastructure that it 
requires to grow, modernise and function efficiently. The Local Plan acknowle dges that these buildings 
may need to be located in countryside locations . Across the plan area  there are a larg e number of farms 
and rural diversification schemes on isolated sites which provide employment opportunities or which 
through investment, could provide new economic opportunities in the form of traditional B class 
industries, cultural or tourism activities . Rural Estates in the plan area  present particular opportunities 
related to their long term management and diverse economic functions.  
4.33 Public consultation responses have highlighted the need to improve digital services such as mobile and 
broadband signal  to support business activity in the rural areas.  The Local Plan supports this need and Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Economy  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  70 encourages the increased provision of infrastructure to ensure greater coverage and reliability of this type 
of utility  as outlined in Policy SCLP8.4.  
4.34 It is acknowledge d that employment opportunities in the rural areas are generally only accessible via 
motor vehicle and public transport opportunities are limite d. In such locations any development needs to 
be sensitive to the surrounding landscape and not have an unaccept able impact (such as high volumes of 
HGV traffic) on the local road network including routes to the main road network.  However the benefit of 
retaining these types of sites for economic activity and the local employment opportunities they provide in 
the ma jority of cases is considered to outweigh the negatives that arise from location and access 
arrangements.  
4.35 Within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AO NB, the Council will still support economic development in rural 
areas, but will strive to ensure that higher le vels of design and appropriate screening are delivered to 
reflect their location within the protected landscape.  
Policy SCLP4.5: Economic Develo pment in Rural Areas  
Proposals that grow and diversify the rural economy, particularly where this will secure em ployment 
locally, enable agricultural growth and  diversification and other land based rural businesses, will be 
supported.  
Proposals will be su pported where:  
a) They accord with the vision of any relevant Neighbourhood Plan in the area;  
b) The scale of the ent erprises accord s with the Settlement Hierarchy;  
c) The design and construction avoids, or adequately mitigates, any  adverse impact on the character 
of the surrounding area and landscape, the AONB and its setting or the natural or historic 
environment;  
d) Small scale agricultural diversification schemes make good use of previously developed land; and 
e) The proposed use is co mpatible with the surrounding employment uses in terms of car parking, 
access, noise, odour and other amenity concerns . 
Proposals will be expec ted to provide additional community, cultural or tourism benefits where 
opportunities exist.  
The delivery of new buildings, structures and infrastructure that the agricultural industry requires to grow, 
modernise and function efficiently will be supported.    
 
Conversion and Replacement of Rural Buildings for Employment Use  
4.36 National planning policy  supports  a prosperous rural economy , sustainable rural tourism and retention and 
development of accessible local services . This includes  the sustainable growth a nd expansion of all t ypes of 
business  through conversion of existing buildings a nd well -designed new buildings  including for the  Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
71 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n development and diversification of agricultural and ot her land -based rural businesses.  The Local Plan seeks 
to support and enha nce the rural areas through enabling farm, forestry and other land -based busines ses 
to build the new and replacement buildings and infrastructure they need to function efficiently . The 
identification of a variety of opportunities for employment development  throughout the plan area  ensures 
that the needs of local communities and their ability to realise economic potential comes forward over the 
plan period.  
4.37 When buildings in the countryside are no longer required for their original purpose or become under -used, 
their re -use and conversion to appropriate uses for employment can represent a sustainable form of 
development.  Buildings in the rural areas can provide opportunities to enhance local prosperity and 
support the move from lower paid to better paid empl oyment.  
4.38 The former Suffolk Coastal District has a number of large tradit ional rural estates which, through co -
ordinated land management, can have an impact on the landscape of the plan area . Over time, these 
estates have had a major impact on the variety o f economic opportunities across the plan area  and tend to 
have numerous rural buildings on their land.  The management of these rural estates has an influence on 
the nature of the economic opportunities within the rural areas and, the conversion and replace ment of 
the estate buildings needs to be carefully considered, to ensure  appropriate uses are retained and 
facilitated over the plan period.  
4.39 Rural buildings in the countryside are often also heritage assets which are important to retain and bring 
back into  use. Relevant proposals will also need to be considered carefully again st the historic environment 
policies of the Local Plan as well as national planning policy on the conservation of heritage assets.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Economy

a) The business use is of a scale and character that is appropriate to its location in accordance with 
the Settlement Hierarchy;  
b) The proposal does not ha ve an unacceptable  impact on highway safety, local roads  or the living

k) The proposal enables farm, forestry and other land -based businesses to build the buildings and 
infrastructure they need to function efficiently . 
 
Farm Diversification  
4.40 Agriculture and farming are an important par t of the  plan area’s  economy.  Traditionally farming provided 
significant employment opportunities but over recent years the numbers employed has reduced due to 
increased costs and technological advances as well as the agglomeration of farmsteads.  However, farming 
remains a key economic sector  in the  plan area  and the Local Plan seeks to ensure that appropriate farm 
diversification schemes can help sustain agricultural operations for  the wider benefit.  
4.41 Examples of farm diversification include the introductio n of farm shops, post offices, tourism activities and 
education centres which all provide a valuable contribution to the original farm as well as the wider 
economy and community.  In exceptional circumstances farm diversification can include conversion of 
buildings to permanent residential use.  However the Local Plan has a role to ensure that farm Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
73 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n diversification does not have an adverse impact on nearby villages or the local road ne twork through 
traffic generation and parking arrangements in rural area s. 
4.42 As a popular tourist area, many farms have converted buildings to provide tourist accommodation.  This is 
an issue which the Local Plan needs to address to continue to ensure that onl y appropriate farm 
diversification schemes involve conversion to tourism acc ommodation.  
4.43 It is anticipated that more diversification proposals will come forward over the plan period and it is 
essential that these are carefully considered to sustain the exis ting farm activities and do not have a 
detrimental impact on the wider commu nity.  Applicants will be expected to provide information to 
demonstrate how the diversification will support the vitality of the existing farm.  Information required will 
need to cl early justify the additional benefits that will be brought about through the  diversification 
proposals.

Proposals for farm diversification schemes to support the continued viability of the farm will be supported 
where : 
a) Farming activities remain the predominate use on the site;  
b) The proposal is  of a use and scale that relates well to the setting of the existing farm;  
c) The proposal does not compromise highway safety to the local road network or free flow of traffic 
and the re is adequate off road parking;  
d) The proposal  avoids, or adequately mitigate s, any  adverse impact on the character of the 
surrounding area and landscape, the AONB and its setting or the natural or historic environment;  
e) The diversification is supported by d etailed information and justification that demonstrates that 
the proposals w ill contribute to the viability of the farm as a whole and its continued operation;  
f) The diversification retains or provides additional employment for the local community;  
g) The propo sal supports the retention or creation of jobs associated with the farm;  
h) The conversion of existing farm buildings is undertaken sympathetically to the traditional 
character of the farm; and  
i) The proposal does not involve permanent residential uses.  
Support will be given to farm shops which provide continued employment opportuniti es and sell a range of 
produce associated with the farm and the local area. Proposals should be of a scale which is not 
detrimental to the existing shopping facilities provid ed in nearby towns and villages.  
 
Town Centres and Retail  
4.44 The distinctiveness, h istoric character and accessibility of resort and market towns in the former Suffolk 
Coastal  area  presents an attractive setting for town centres as concentrations for shoppi ng, leisure, 
employment, business, social and cultural activities. This also makes  them popular with tourists and 
visitors from nearby areas within and beyond the plan area . The towns have varying tourism functions that 
contribute to the scale of the retai l offer and the presence of many specialist and artisan shops. The blend 
of differ ent types of shops  and leisure facilities  in town centres is important to the experience of visitors 
and local quality of life.  
4.45 Tourism and cultural aspects of town centres i n the plan area  and growing leisure activities  present 
opportunities for more incl usive day time and evening  time  economies, social interaction and the appeal 
of town centres as places to live. Town centres in the  plan area  provide residential development 
opportunities on appropriate sites that play  an important role in ensuring the ir vitality . Opportunities to 
encourage residential developments targeted at the provision of smaller homes and specialist housing will 
be suppor ted in appropriate locations (such as on upper floors) where they do not undermine the main 
town centre use.  Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
75 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 4.46 Town c entres are the most accessible places in the plan area  for shopping and commercial leisure. 
Commercial leisure is the business of entertainme nt facilities, the more intensive sport and recreation uses 
(including cinemas, restaurants, drive -through restaura nts, bars and pubs, night -clubs, casinos, health and 
fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls); and arts, culture and tourism  development 
(including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities).   
4.47 In comm on with national trends, food shopping growth has moved towards discounters and smaller store 
formats of large supermarket chains catering fo r more frequent, smaller shopping trips. High levels of car 
ownership and use in the plan area  and consumer choice mean people are increasingly prepared to travel 
further, in order to access a greater choice of shops and leisure facilities available in lar ger centres.  
4.48 Government policy and up -to-date evidence highlight that it is important that town centres offer a 
shopping and social experience that is different to out of town or online shopping. This reflects a broader 
change in the economy, population, e-commerce  and how town centres are used and the way people  
spend  their  money and leisure time.  More locally, this is in addition to the effects of a significant presence 
of out of town retail at Martlesham in the plan area  and nearby Ipswich.  
4.49 A balanced mix of town centre shops and services is important to ensure a strong offer to meet the needs 
of residents of the t owns and their surrounding rural areas. This includes well situated units suitable for 
modern operator requirements on main routes around and  through town centres.  
4.50 Local and regional projects and strategies (e.g. East Suffolk Business Plan) are consistent in supporting local 
prosperity, community and cultural life and access to facilities and opportunities.   
New Retail and Commercial Leisure De velopment  
4.51 Opportunities for new retail development can enhance customer choice, convenience and shopping 
experience  but can inevitably compete with existing shops and impact on town centres. Evidence d 
forecasts based on population change and household spen ding patterns (taking into account online 
shopping and new forms of retailing) show capacity to grow the amount of shopping floorspace in the 
former Suffolk Coastal area to be very modest.  In line with national trends, capacity for retail growth is 
concent rated on the large urban centres outside the plan area . Retail capacity for the towns in the plan 
area  and for the area between Ipswich, Woodbridge and Felixstowe is identified in the Ipswich and Suffolk 
Coastal Retail and Commercial Leisure Town Centre St udy (2017).  
4.52 In the context of rapid change in the retail sector, the National Planning Policy Framework requires Lo cal 
Plans to meet future shopping floorspace forecasts for 10 years rather than full plan period.  Changing  
consumer demand s related to new technologies are  driving comprehensive change from traditional retail 
supply chain processes . In land use terms this is seen in storage and distribution development (planning 
use class B8) rather than significant retail floorspace growth. However, retail f loorspace may incorporate 
changing showroom, customer experience, and collection and return facilities and functions.  There may be 
further implications for retail floorspace and development through the integration of the storage and 
distribution and goods inventories  with  the visibility of goods for sale by the different methods of shopping 
available to consumers.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Economy  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  76  
4.53 Estimated retail floorspace growth in the former Suffolk Coastal  area  is mostly for goods which are 
purchased less often (comparison goods). The capacity for c omparison goods retail growth for the plan 
period up to 2036 is assessed as up to 5,800 m2 in Woodbri dge, up to 3,4 00m2 in Felixstowe and up to  
3,500m2 shared between S axmund ham, Aldeburgh , Framlingham and Leiston. In terms of retail capacity 
for groceries and other goods purchased regularly like toiletries (convenience goods) very modest 
estimates of floorspace growth for the plan area  are identified. These are  400m2 in Woodbridge  and up to 
1,600m2 between Saxmundham, Aldeburgh, Framlingham and Leiston , with no forecast growth in capacity 
identified for Felixstowe . Garden neighbourhoods at Saxmundham and Felixstowe present opportunities 
for some new small scale conveni ence retail provision  to meet needs arising from these developments . 
4.54 Available evidence indicates that there are opportunities for growth of commercial  leisure uses including 
eating and drink ing venues. There are also commercial leisure growth opportunitie s in relation to hotel 
accommodation and health and fitness provision equivalent to 268 hotel rooms and between 5 and 7 
additional gyms in the plan area  over the plan period. Integrated use o f premises may represent use of 
floorspace in multiple planning u se classes , for example health and beauty facilities together with a hotel. 
Integrated use of town centre ground floor space may also combine some commercial leisure or 
community uses with re tail to enhance the retail experience and help sustain the retail  use. The town 
centres function within a wider network of retail centres that includes the established retail destination of 
the retail park and superstore in Martlesham  and the neighbouring county town of Ipswich as well as 
historic cities, towns and shopping centres outside the plan area .  
4.55 The Council recognises that each of the town centres within the plan area  is different, not least in terms of 
its particular shopping ch aracter, tourism o ffer and relationships with nearby places. This reflects links and 
relationships between shopping destinations offering choice and differentiation for shoppers’ 
Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
77 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n requirements, mobility and lifestyles. For example, Woodbridge is close to Ip swich and Martlesh am and 
has a larger existing retail offer than the other market towns.  
4.56 Evidence reveals significant shopping relationships between Woodbridge, Felixstowe, Martlesham and 
Ipswich. It is therefore important to consider provision for accessi ble retail and com mercial leisure in the 
south of the former Suffolk Coastal  District  in the context of the neighbouring county town of Ipswich.  
 
4.57 National planning policy  sets out the principles of the sequential test. Proposals for main town centre uses, 
which includes ret ail and commercial leisure uses, should be located in town centres. If no suitable sites 
are available then edge of centre locations should be considered, and if no suitable town centre or edge of 
centre locations are available then out o f centre may be co nsidered. A retail impact assessment will need 
to be submitted alongside any applications outside of town centres which exceed the thresholds set out in 
Policy SCLP4. 8, in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework  and the gui dance set out in t he 
Planning Practice Guidance.  
 
4.58 A retail hierarchy for the plan area  sets out the 
provision of facilities and scales of shopping 
development that can be expected of a centre. 
This recognises retail relationships between 
centres in the h ierarchy, especial ly in the south 
of the plan area  between Woodbridge, 
Felixstowe, the out -of-centre retail destination 
at Martlesham and the neighbouring county 
town of Ipswich.  
4.59 An out of centre location is one that is neither 
in, nor on the edge of a cen tre. As an out -of-
centre location, Martlesham Retail Park is not 
sequentially preferable for new retail and 
commercial leisure so it is therefore not 
included in the retail hierarchy.  
4.60 Small parades of shops serving only the 
immediate neighbourhood are not classed as 
centres  in national policy, and therefore are 
not designated. These include corner shops 
and other very small parades serving the 
immediate area.

Priority will be given to concentra ting retail and co mmercial leisure development within Town Centres in 
the Retail Hierarchy and the neighbouring regional town centre of Ipswich . The retail hierarchy is:  
 Level 1 – Town Centre – Felixstowe (resort town),  
 Level 2 – Town Centres – Aldeburgh, Framlingham, Leist on, Saxmundham, Woodbridge (market 
towns),  
 Level 3 – District Centres,  
 Level 4 – Local Centres.  
Retail and commercial leisure (falling within Use Classes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, C1 and D2) will be permitted  
within Town Centre  boundaries  as defined on the Polic ies Maps. This will reinforce and reflect compact 
town centres in the plan area .  
Retail and commercial leisure development will be permitted on edge of centre sites, only where there are 
no suitable or  available sites within a Town Centre. For retail deve lopments, edge of centre is defined as 
within 300 metres of the Primary Shopping Area, as defined on the Policies Maps. For commercial leisure, 
edge of centre sites should be within 300 metres of the To wn Centre.  
Retail and commercial leisure development will only be permitted on out of centre sites where there are 
no suitable or available sites within a Town Centre or edge of centre location. Retail and commercial 
leisure development will only be permi tted on out of centre sites where:  
a) The location is ac cessible by public transport and is accessible to pedestrian s and cyclists;  
b) The site is well connected  to a Town Centre, or links can be improved; and  
c) The site will not impact upon other neighbouring us es, in terms of traffic, parking and amenity 
issues.  
Proposals for retail or commercial leisure uses outside of Town Centres will only be permitted where it can 
be demonstrated that there will be no significant adverse impact on centres in the retail hiera rchy and the 
neighbouring regional town centre of Ipsw ich. This will be determined through an impact assessment 
which will be required for proposals greater in size than the thresholds set out below:  
Settlement Centre  Floor Space Impact Threshold (gross)  
Level 1 (Felixstowe)  750sqm  
Level 2 (Woodbridge)  750sqm 
Level 2 (Aldeburgh, Framlingham, Leiston, Saxmundham)  350sqm  
The impact assessment will need to consider potential impact on all relevant centres (including those 
outside of the plan area ) depending on the location, scale and nature of the proposal. The minimum gross 
floor space impact threshold to demonstrate impact o n Ipswich Town Centre is 750sqm. The scope and 
nature of an impact assessment will be determined at the time of a planning a pplication. Proposals that 
would have a significant adverse im pact on the vitality and viability of Town Centres will be refused.   
 Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
79 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Development  in Town Centres  
4.61 Development will improve and develop the Town Centres incrementally and organically to reflect their 
distinct historic character and functions having regard  to their position in the retail hierarchy and 
relationships with other shopping and leisure destinations. The policy approach is to support centre s in the 
hierarchy to consolidate and enhance their offer to local residents , surrounding rural areas and vis itors.  
4.62 The Local Plan designates Primary Shopping Areas, Primary Shopping Frontages, Secondary Shopping 
Frontages and Town Centre Boundaries. Prima ry frontages are where most shops are concentrated. 
Secondary frontages provide greater opportunities for a d iversity of uses such as restaurants, professional 
services and businesses. The Council undertakes monitoring of Town Centres annually and the 2018  
monitoring provides a baseline position for each Town Centre. Maintaining the high proportion of ground 
floor primary frontage units in retail use promotes customer choice and a healthy and appealing balance 
between retail and services in town centres acr oss the plan area . Setting out this direct and 
comprehensible approach provides businesses and decision maker s with clarity in the context of changing 
economic and social conditions faced by town centres.  
4.63 In primary shopping areas, the policy aims to ensur e a dominant retail appearance which supports high 
levels of footfall. As such the policy restricts proposals  which would undermine this approach and result in 
concentrations of non A1 uses. In coming to a view as to whether a proposal would result in a 
concentration of non A1 uses, using Table 4.1 as a baseline, the Council will have regard to the total 
number a nd proportion of different use classes along the immediate frontage and the continuity of non A1 
uses.

designated Conservation Areas. The Local Plan will seek to ensure these are protected to maintain distinct 
and individual Town Centres. In partnership with Historic England the Council will encourage the retention 
and/or rest oration of historic shop fronts through planning applications or specific interventions and 
projects in accordance with Policies SCLP11.3, SCLP11.4 and SCLP11.5.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Economy

Town Centres w ill improve and develop incremental ly and organically to reflect their distinct historic 
character and functions having regard to their position in the retail hierarchy and relationships with other 
shopping and leisure destinations.  
Town Centres will deve lop in ways that support healthy li festyles, social interaction, overnight stays, 
culture and the arts. Residential development  targeted at the provision of smaller homes and specialist 
housing on appropriate sites within town cent res will be supported whe re it does not undermine the main 
town centre use.  
Within the Primary Shopping Areas as identified on the Policies Maps, the primarily retail function of these 
areas will be safeguarded. Non -A1 uses on the ground floor will be supported where they will hel p to 
sustain A1 uses and enhance th e retail offer.  
New retail uses (A1) will be directed to the Primary Shopping Frontage in the first instance.  The majority of 
primary frontages will be in retail use at ground floor level.  Proposals that reduce the high p roportion of 
A1 uses and/or result in concentrations of non A1 use will be resisted.  
The Secondary Shopping frontage, as defined on the Policies Map, will provide a mixture of town centre 
uses whilst retaining a proportion of A1 uses at ground floor level to ensure a balance and blend of sh ops 
and services is maintained.  
Outside of the Primary and Secondary frontages the Council will take a flexible approach to future uses 
and redevelopment opportunities within the Town Centre which sustain and enhance the  vitality and 
viability of the town.  
Proposals for the redevelopmen t/change of use of existing units should give particular consideration to 
retaining and/or restoring historic shopfronts.  
 
Town Centre Environments   
4.65 All of  the Town Centres are at least p artly within designated Conservation Areas. Development should 
enhance and invest in historic environments and infrastructure including public seating, arts and cultural 
facilities. This will help promote community interacti on and healthy lifestyles. Devel opment in the Town 
Centre should also provide enhancements for urban biodiversity where possible. It is recognised that there 
may be opportunities or advantages for temporary use of historic buildings for buildings for a sho rt and 
prescribed period of time  especially whilst buildings are otherwise vacant.  
4.66 There are particular opportunities to enhance pedestrian connectivity and legibility related to 
development and change within the town centres. This includes but is not limi ted to the following 
examples:  Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

 Woodbridge - between town centre and riverside;  
 Aldeburgh - between car parks and town centre;  
 Framlingham - highways junctions (identified in the Neighbourhood Plan);  
 Leiston - mixed use town centre opportunit y site (identified in the Neighbourhood Plan);  
 Saxmundham – between railway station and town centre;  
 Martlesham – between retail units and employment areas.  
 
Policy SCLP4. 10: Town Centre Environments  
Development w ill encourage people to spend more time, e njoy and participate in town centres. It will do 
this by:  
a) Supporting opportunities for social interaction;  
b) Ensuring safe pedestrian access to link up with and enhancing existing pavements, pedestrian 
spaces, routes  and focal points;  
c) Improving access for cy clists, people with limited mobility and people with other disabilities;  
d) Enabling physical linkages so that pedestrians can move easily and safely between parts of the 
town centre; and  
e) Providing environmental impro vements that make the most of historic env ironments and heritage 
features.  
The expansion of Shared Space and Dementia Friendly areas will be supported where proposals maintain 
active town centre frontages without compromising highway access, vehicular and pedestrian movements.  
 
Retail and Commerc ial Leisure in Martlesham  
4.67 Martlesham is a popular place to live offering  a high quality of life40 including good employment prospects 
with a significant presence of diverse business areas. Connected by an extensive network of public open 
spaces and cycle r outes the area is a convenient  location from which to access other parts of the plan area  
and surr ounding area through a variety of transport opportunities. Martlesham and surrounding parishes  
have experienced economic and housing growth which places parti cular pressures on highways and local 
infrastructure.  
4.68 The retail park at Martlesham has evolved s poradically into a number of large modern premises 
comprising retail floorspace selling mostly non -bulky goods. This includes clothing and footwear as well as  
groceries and toiletries. The retail park is not characterised by the wider role or function of a town centre  
but does have issues associated with high volumes of traffic at peak periods . Capacity for its further

Policy SCLP4. 11: Retail and Commercial Leisure in Martlesham   
Retail and leisure develo pment will enable Martlesham to  thrive and support community interaction and 
inclusivity.  
Out of centre retail and commercial leisure uses at Martlesham will only be permitted where:  
a) There are no sites that are suitable or available to accommodate the nature and  scale of the 
proposal in or on the edge of a centre in the Retail Hierarchy; and  
b) The principal type of retail provision would not have a significant adverse impact on centres in the 
retail hierarchy including, but not limited to, the Square in Martlesham Heath, Woodbridge, 
Felixstowe and the regional town centre of Ipswi ch. Where development is considered acceptable 
in terms of the town centre sequential and impact tests proposals, it should make a positive 
contribution towards improving:  
i. Safe non -car circ ulation and pedestrian / highway conflicts;  
ii. The physical and visual  integration of out of centre retail and commercial leisure;  
iii. Green infrastructure supporting healthy lifestyles and social interaction;  
iv. Accessibility for persons with physical or mental dis abilities including dementia friendly 
environments; and  
v. Accessible local services.  
The change of use of existing office, industrial and storage floorspace (use classes B1, B2 and B8) to retail 
or commercial leisure uses will be resisted. Such changes of us e will only be permitted if the site is surplus 
to requirements for  B1, B2 and B8 uses, as satisfactorily demonstrated by marketing in accordance with 
Appendix E. 
 
District  and Local Centres  
4.69 A District Centre is a large group of shops anchored by a small supermarket, together with facilities, which 
collectively form a coherent area. They provide opportunit ies for local people to meet everyday needs 
without having to travel. Garden neighbourhoods identified at Felixstowe and Saxmundham present 
opportunities  for new District Centres. Existing District Centres are defined on the Policies Map at:  
 Cavendish Park, Felixstowe,  
 High Road East, Felixstowe,  
 Undercliff Road West, Felixstowe,  
 Walton High Street, Felixstowe,  
 Ropes Drive West, Kesgrave , Economy  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
83 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n  The Square, Martl esham Heath,  
 Sycamore Drive, Rendlesham , 
 The Hill, Wickham Market . 
 
4.70 A Local Centre is the next level down in the retail hierarchy, offering a smaller range of facilities than those 
present in a District Centre. Nonetheless, they play an equally important r ole in meeting the day -to-day 
shopping needs for a community, particularly the less mobile and elderly. Local Centres typically feature a 
newsagent and/or small convenience store, along with various other small shops serving a small 
catchment.  Existing Loc al Centres are defined on the Policies Map at:  
 Bixley Farm, Rushmere St Andrew, and  
 Saxmundham Road, Aldeburgh . 
 
4.71 Outside of District and Local Centres, small shops within communities play a vital role in serving the day to 
day needs for convenience goods f or residents, and often also provide a focal point for the community.  
Policy SCLP4. 12: District  and Local Centre s and Local Shops  
District Centres are defined on the Local Plan Policies Map. District Centres provide shops and some other 
local services to meet the needs of residents in the local area.  
Local shopping opportunities and facilities within District Centr es will be supported and safeguarded where 
possible. Proposals which seek to increase the shopping opportunities and facilities within District  Centres 
will be supported where they complement the existing role of these areas and do not have a detrimental 
impact on the town centres across the plan area  or on neighbouring residential amenity. Proposals for the 
redevelopment/change of use of existin g retail units should give particular consideration to retaining 
and/or restoring historic shopfronts in accordan ce with other policies in the Local Plan.  
Local Centres will provide a small range of shops and other local services which help meet the needs of 
residents. Local shopping opportunities and facilities within Local Centres will be supported and 
safeguarded where possible. Where appropriate, proposals for the redevelopment/change of use of 
existing retail units should give particular consideration to retaining and/or restoring historic shopfronts in 
accordance with other policies in the Local Plan.  
Individual  and groups of local shops, services and community facilities located outside of the designated 
centres will be protected where they are import ant to meet day -to-day needs of local communities.

Housing  
Area wide criteria based policies  Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
85 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 5  Housing  
5.1 This Local Plan sets a housing requirement of 542 dwellings per annum over the period 201 8 – 2036 ( 9,756  
in total). As at 31st March 2018, 6,998 dwellings  are already under construc tion, permitted or allocated, 
and, with a contingency applied to a llow flexibility, the policies and allocations in this plan seek to ensure 
that this requirement is met.  The residual need to be met is 2,758  dwellings (before a contingency is 
applied).  
5.2 The strategy in this Local Plan focuses on supporting economic growth and the provision of infrastructure, 
and alongside this, sets out ambitious plans for increasing the supply of housing. Integral to this is ensuring 
that the Plan supports existing infra structure and services particularly in the more rural parts of the plan 
area . Addressing the need for more affordable housing and housing to meet the needs of an increasingly 
elderly population is another key objective.  Accordingly, in addition to deliveri ng an ambitious housing 
requirement, the Local Plan seeks to diversify the supply of housing through delivering a range of different 
sizes of sites in a variety of locations, and ensuring that the mix of housing types and tenures reflects the 
needs of the plan area’s  population. The East Suffolk Housing Strategy also sets out the ways in which the 
Council will continue to pursue a range of models for housing delivery, including through working with 
Housing Associations and providing support to community led ho using initiatives.  
5.3 The amount of housing needed is covered in Section  3 of this Local Plan.  Allocations for housing 
development and the approach to housing provision in the Major Centres and Market Towns are 
contained in the settlement and area specific Section s of this Local Plan  in Section 12.   
Major C entres  
5.4 Detailed policies for Major Centres are contained in Section  12.  
5.5 As part of the development of the North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood, up to 2,00041 new homes are 
planned along with 80 new homes on  the existing Brackenbury Sports Centre site once new leisure uses 
are provided at the Garden Neighbourhood. It is expected that some small scale housing development  will 
come forward within the Settlement Boundary  in accordance with Polic y SCLP3.3 . 
5.6 For th e East of Ipswich, the Brightwell Lakes development is proposed to come forward during the plan 
period. Outline planning permission is granted under permission DC/17/1435/OUT.  This local plan also 
identifies the site of the current Suffolk  Police Headquart ers as an opportunity to deliver 300 homes on a 
brownfield site, due to its likely availability within the plan period . It is expected that some small scale 
housing development will come forward within the Settlement Boundaries  in accordan ce with Pol icy 
SCLP3.3 .

5.7 Detailed policies for the Market Towns are contained in Section  12. Policy SCLP4.9  identifies town centres 
as presenting opportunities for residential development including affordable homes, older person’s  
accommodation  and specialist h ousing for particular groups.  
5.8 A new Garden Neighbourhood is planned for the south of Saxmundham, which will deliver 800 dwellings.  
5.9 Whilst no other new allocations are proposed in the Market Towns, it is envisaged that some small scale 
development will co me forward within the Settlement Boundaries  in accordance with Policy SCLP3.3  or 
through “made” Neighbourhood Plans . 
Large Villages  
5.10 Whilst the Major C entres and Market T owns provide the main focus for a wide range of services and 
facilities, a number of ot her settlements across the plan area  nevertheless provide for a range of services 
meeting the daily needs of their residents and surrounding hinterland.  
5.11 Development of new housing in such settlements can help to support existing local services as well as 
contributing towards the mix of housing available in such locations. The National Planning Policy 
Framework states that housing should be located where it will enhance o r maintain the vitality of rural 
communities and that plans should identify opportuniti es for villages to grow and thrive, especially where 
this will support local services. This Local Plan therefore allocates some sites for housing in these 
settlements. A longside these, it is also necessary to consider the contribution that will come forwar d from 
‘windfall’ (i.e. not allocated) sites in Large Villages.  
5.12 Settlement Boundaries , formerly known as ‘physical limits boundaries’ are defined around Large Villages.  
The Settlement Boundaries  define the area within which the principle of development is  supported and 
where policies would support residential development outside of allocations, of a scale appropriate to that 
settlement.  
Policy SCLP5.1: Housing Developme nt in Large Villages  
Residential development will be permitted within defined Settlemen t Boundaries  where  it is: 
a) Development of a scale appropriate to the size, location and character of the village; or 
b) Infill development (in accordance with Policy  SCLP5.7).  
Residential development will be permitted on Exception Sites adjacent or well relate d to defined 
Settlement Boundaries in accordance with Policy SCLP5.11 .  
 Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
87 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Small Villages  
5.13 Small Villages are identifi ed due to their modest range of service provision, which will serve the needs of 
residents within the village . They  can also serve the needs  of those living in other settlements or the 
countryside nearby although will generally cater for a smaller catchmen t than the Large Villages.  As with 
the Large Villages, development of new housing in such settlements can help to support existing local 
services as well as contributing towards the mix of housing available in these villages. The form and 
character of Smal l Villages varies across the plan area  and the impact upon these will be a key 
consideration in determining planning applications.  
5.14 Settleme nt Boundaries  have been defined for Small Villages which  identify the area within which the 
principle of development  will be supported in accordance with Policy  SCLP5.2 below.  
Policy SCLP5.2: Housing Development in Small Villages  
Residential development w ill be permitted within defined Settlement Boundaries where it is:  
a) A small group of dwellings of a scale appropriate to the size, location and character of the village; 
or 
b) Infill development (in accordance with Policy SCLP5.7).  
Residential development will  be permitted on Exception Sites adjacent or well related to define d 
Settlement Boundaries in accordance with Policy SCLP5.11 .  
 
Countryside  
5.15 Areas outside of the defined Settlement Boundaries  of the Major Centres, Market Towns, Large Villages 
and Small Vi llages are defined as Countryside. The countryside includes a numbe r of small settlements, 
which have no or very few, services and facilities and are therefore not considered to be suitable locations 
as a focus for new development.  
5.16 However, consistent wit h policy in the National Planning Policy Framework the Council reco gnises that 
there is a need for housing in the countryside in certain circumstances and where this can help to sustain 
thriving rural communities. The East Suffolk Housing Strategy (2017 – 2023) contains five ‘areas of focus’, 
including ‘ Increasing the Sup ply of New Housing to meet a Range of Needs ‒ a more proactive role for East 
Suffolk supporting the development of affordable homes’, within which there is a specific action for 
delivering housing tailored to meet the needs of rural communities. The Housin g Strategy identifies that 
housing in rural areas can support the sustainability of those places, by enabling younger working families 
to remain and older residents to move to more suitable housing while continuing to live within their 
community.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  88 5.17 Whilst p roviding social benefits, housing in the countryside can have impacts upon the landscape and 
natural environment, and does not present the same opportunities in relation to encouraging sustainable 
transport as less remote locations would. It is therefore i mportant that the Local Plan achieves the correct 
balance between supporting some development that can help to sustain rural communities whilst not 
resulting in harm to the environment and undermining the reasons for which people choose to live in and 
visit the plan area .  
5.18 Isolated dwellings in the countryside in particular have the potential for harming the landscape and 
environment.  Reflecting this, the National Planning Policy Framework states that isolated new homes in 
the countryside should be avoided other than in a limited number of specific circumstances.  
5.19 Policy SCLP5.3 below sets out the circumstances where new housing in the countryside would be 
supported. Exception sites for affordable housing may include entry -level accommodation for first time 
buyers or those looking to rent their first home, in accordance with the National Planning Policy 
Framework, where this forms part of a scheme which aims to meet locally identified needs for affordable 
housing.  
5.20 In relation to replacement dwellings, the im pact of the new dwelling on the landscape when compared to 
the existing dwelling will be a key consideration. In this respect, particular consideration will be given to 
height, screening, footprint, design and ma terials.  Opportunities to enhance the appear ance of the 
dwelling in the landscape should be taken where feasible.  
Policy SCLP5.3: Housing Development in the Countryside  
Outside of the defined Settlement Boundaries, new residential development will be limited to:  
a) Affordable housing to meet identified  local needs on exception sites adjacent to, or well related 
to, Settlement Boundaries or clusters of housing in the countryside (in accordance with Policy 
SCLP5.11 and Policy SCLP5.4);  
b) Limited development w ithin existing clusters (in accordance with Polic y SCLP5.4);  
c) Replacement dwellings on a one to one basis where these are no more visually intrusive in the 
countryside than the building to be replaced;  
d) Subdivision of an existing larger dwelling;  
e) Conversion of an existing building (in accordance with Polic y SCLP5.5);  
f) Rural workers dwellings, where there is an essential need for a rural worker to live permanently at 
or near their place of work (in accordance with Policy SCLP5.6);  
g) Other residential development  consistent with policy on residential developmen t in the 
countryside contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.  
 Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
89 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Housing in Clusters in the Countryside  
5.21 Clusters can vary in size, and  can include those settlements in the countryside which do not have the range 
or amount of facilities to be cl assed as a Major Centre, Town, Large Village or Small Village. The geography 
of the former Suffolk Coastal District  is such that there are many sm all, dispersed communities and 
clusters of houses outside of the Towns, Large Villages and Small Villages. Whi lst they do not have the level 
of services and facilities to support larger scale new housing development, some locations where there are 
existing  clusters of five or more dwellings may be suitable for a small amount of development. Such an 
approach will h elp to meet local housing needs by enabling people to stay within their communities, 
reflecting the aims of the Council’s Housing Strategy as well  as helping to sustain rural communities and 
the services within them.  The policy therefore would support up t o three new dwellings in clusters of at 
least five existing dwellings, or up to five new dwellings in clusters of at least ten existing dwellings which 
are well related to services and facilities.   
5.22 The policy does not intend to support development which wo uld have an adverse impact upon the natural 
or historic environment or the landscape, but that can integrate with an existing cluster of houses, a nd the 
scale and design of schemes will be expected to not cause harm to the character of the cluster or the 
surrounding landscape.  
5.23 Alongside seeking to maintain and enhance the vitality of rural areas there is a need to protect sensitive 
environments and  landscapes and to seek to minimise the need to travel and reliance on the private car as 
far as is possible. The National Planning Policy Framework states that to  promote sustainable development 
in rural areas, housing should be located where it will enha nce or maintain the vitality of rural 
communities, whilst also seeking to avoid isolated dwellings in the coun tryside except in special 
circumstances.  The National Planning Policy Framework also states that in preparing Local Plans, local 
planning authorit ies should support a pattern of development which, where reasonable to do so, facilitates 
the use of sustainab le modes of transport.  
5.24 Whilst it is acknowledged that within these more rural locations, there is likely to be dependency on the 
private car for transport, it is considered appropriate to recognise that this may be reduced in some 
locations which are clos er to settlements with services and facilities. Therefore, in locations which are 
more accessible to services and facilities up to five dwellings would be supported.  Consideration will be 
given to proximity to a Major Centre, Town, Large Village or Small V illage and the accessibility to that 
location, for example through the existence of a continuous footpath.  
5.25 A ‘close group’ of dwellings adjacent t o an existing highway, is one where the dwellings are considered to 
be adjacent to each other, and not separat ed by extensive open areas. There may, for example, be garden 
space or other buildings between dwellings however separation by fields or open land  would not 
constitute a close group. Criterion  (c) in Policy  SCLP5.4 sets out policy regarding the characteris tics of the 
location of sites in relation to surrounding development.  In considering whether a proposal would be 
acceptable under criterion (c), adjacent development on two sides can include circumstances w here the 
site is separated from existing developme nt by the highway. The adjacent development on two sides must 
extend along the entirety of the proposed site.  
5.26 For development of four of five dwellings the Council would require applicants to demonstrate t hat 
meaningful and effective engagement has taken place with the community, including with the Parish 
Council, and that the submitted scheme addresses any planning issues raised and reflects needs identified Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  90 by the community. Applicants should submit a sta tement describing the consultation and engagement 
undertaken, the outcomes of the consultation and engagement and how this is reflected in the proposal.  
5.27 In contributing to the provision of a mix of dwelling types across the plan area , proposals that are s uitable 
under this policy may provide opportunitie s for custom and self build dwellings.  
5.28 As the policy is intended to support limited new development in clusters, it is important that consideration 
is given to cumulative impacts. In this respect, considera tion will be given to whether there is an extant 
permission or completed development permitted under this policy, and the cumulative impact on the 
character.  Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
91 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP5.4: Housing in Clusters in the Countryside  
Proposals for new dwellings within ‘clusters’ in the countryside will be supported where:  
a) The proposal is for up to three dwellings within a cluster of five or more dwellings;  
Or 
The proposal is for up to five dwellings within a cluster of at least ten existing dwellings which is 
well rela ted to a Major Centre, Town, Large Village or Small Villa ge;  
And 
b) The development consists of infilling within a continuous built up frontage, is in a clearly 
identifiable gap within an existing cluster, or is otherwise located adjacent to existing 
develop ment on two sides;  
c) The development does not represent an  extension of the built up area into the surrounding 
countryside beyond the existing extent of the built up area surrounding, or adjacent to, the site; 
and 
d) It would not cause undue harm to the charac ter and appearance of the cluster or, result in any 
harmf ul visual intrusion into the surrounding landscape.  
Where more than three dwellings are proposed under criterion b) above, applicants must be able to 
demonstrate that meaningful and effective  communi ty engagement  has taken place in the development 
of the s cheme  and that the mix of dwellings proposed would meet locally identified needs.  
Particular care will be exercised in sensitive locations such as within or in the setting of Conservation 
Areas  and the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Consideration wil l also need to be given to the features 
of Landscape Character Areas in accordance with Policy SCLP10. 4.  
The cumulative impact of proposals will be a consideration in relation to the criteria above.  
A ‘cluster’ in the context of this policy:  
 Consists of a  continuous line of existing dwellings or a close group of existing dwellings adjacent 
to an existing highway; and  
 Contains 5 or more dwellings.  
 
Conversion of Rural Buildings in the Countryside for Housing  
5.29 Rural buildings outside of settlements should id eally be used for the purposes for which they were 
constructed; however there are instances where commercial uses are no longer viable and a residential 
use may be appr opriate. The National Planning Policy Framework supports the re -use of redundant or 
disused buildings in the countryside for residential purposes where this would enhance the immediate 
setting. Permitted Development rights now also allow for some conversio ns of agricultural buildings to 
residential use.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  92 5.30 A key consideration in relation to pro posals for conversions is the extent to which the immediate setting is 
enhanced through conversion. In this respect, the conversion should not result in the creation of  
residential curtilages or other features that would detract from the rural nature of th e area and the 
building, such as porches and openings. Only extensions and alterations that are essential to enable the 
building to be converted for residential use sho uld be made. It is also recognised that in some cases 
conversion of buildings in the cou ntryside can help to safeguard heritage assets.  
Policy SCLP5.5: Conversions of Buildings in the Countryside for Housing  
The conversion of buildings in the countryside for residential use will be permitted where:  
a) The building is redundant;

Rural Workers Dwellings  
5.31 Policy on rural workers dwellings is well established in the planning system. There are a number of rural 
activities which r equire full time workers to be accommodated on site or nearby. In particular there are 
agricultural, horticultural and forestry prac tices which may require a worker to attend at short notice or to 
be available during night and day. The affordability and re latively short supply of accommodation in the 
countryside can mean that there is no suitable housing for such rural workers. Whilst it is important to 
provide accommodation to meet these needs, it is also important to ensure that this does not result in a 
proliferation of new dwellings in the countryside. The provision of a rural workers dwelling should 
therefore only be supported wher e it is essential to meet the needs of the business.  
Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
93 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 5.32 Applications will be assessed taking account of the history of the ent erprise. Evidence will need to 
demonstrate whether there are existing dwellings within the site/holding or nearby which could fulfil  the 
need. If any dwellings or buildings on the holding suitable for conversion have been sold on the open 
housing market th is is likely to constitute lack of evidence of essential need. To assess whether the existing 
business is viable, financial informat ion from the last three years prior to the planning application will be 
required which show that the business was profitable  for at least one of those years.  
5.33 Where planning permission is granted for a rural workers  dwelling, occupancy restriction conditions will be 
imposed to ensure the dwelling is used for that purpose and remains available for that purpose in the 
future. To avoid new isolated market housing in the countryside proposals to remove occupancy 
restrict ion conditions will rarely be approved. Where applications are made for the removal of an 
occupancy condition, evidence will be required to demonstrate that there is  no longer a need for the 
accommodation for either the business or for the wider local area , or to meet needs for affordable 
housing. Evidence of marketing should be provided. The Marketing Guidance in Appendix E should be 
referred to where relevant.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing

Proposals for permanent dwellings in the countryside fo r rural workers will only be permitted where:  
a) There is a clearly established existing functional need for a worker to be accommodated;  
b) The need could not be fulfill ed by another existing dwelling or accommodation in the area which is 
suitable and available for the occupied workers or, could be converted to do so;  
c) The need relates to a full time worker, or one who is primarily employed in  the rural sector, and 
does n ot relate to a part time requirement;  
d) The unit and the rural activity concerned has been established for at least three years, has been 
profitable for at least one of them, is financially sound and has a clear prospect of rema ining so; 
and 
e) The proposed dw elling is sensitively designed, landscaped and located to fit in with its 
surroundings and of a scale that reflects its functional role to support the agricultural activity.  
Where a rural dwelling is permitted, the occupancy w ill be restricted by conditio n to ensure that it is 
occupied by a person, or persons, currently or last employed in local rural employment. Applications for 
the removal of an occupancy condition related to rural workers will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that:  
f) There is no longer a need for accommodation on the holding/business and in the local area;  
g) The property has been marketed to ensure proper coverage within the relevant sector for at least 
one year at a price which reflects the exist ence of the occupancy conditi on; and  
h) The dwelling has been made available to a minimum of three Registered Providers operating 
locally on terms that would prioritise its occupation by a rural worker as an affordable dwelling, 
and that option has been refu sed. 
 
Infill and Garden Deve lopment  
5.34 Infill development is that which takes place in a gap between existing buildings. Garden development is 
that which takes place in the garden of an existing dwelling, often to the rear. The Local Plan  policies 
provide for infill development in certa in circu mstances, and these infill developments provide a valuable 
contribution to housing supply and the mix and type of housing delivered. This policy relates to the details 
of the design and siting of infill development, rather than to the principle.  
5.35 Infill dev elopment can have the potential to harm the character of a streetscape if not carefully designed 
or if it takes place on unsuitable sites such as those which are too small. In addition, development of 
backland or garden plots can impact on the land scape if  they encroach into the countryside, or can raise 
amenity issues within built up areas. This issue is recognised in the National Planning Policy Framework 
which states that local planning authorities should consider the case for setting out policie s to res ist 
inappropriate development of residential gardens, for example where development would cause harm to 
the local area.   Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
95 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP5.7: Infill and Garden Development  
Proposals for infill development or residential development within existing garde ns will be supported 
where:  
a) The scale, design and materials would not result in harm to the street scene or character of the 
area;  
b) The proposal is well related in scale and design to adjacent properties, including the design of 
curtilage areas, parking and  access, and incorporates landscaping where appropriate to mitigate 
any potential impacts or to enhance the appearance of the site;  
c) There would not be significant  harm to residential amenity of occupants of either the existing or 
proposed dwellings;  
d) Existi ng and proposed dwellings have sufficient curtilage space; and  
e) The proposals are otherwise in accordance with the housing policies of the Local Plan.  
Neighbourhood Plans are able to set their own policies on this type of development in response to local 
circumstances.

5.36 In addition to ensuring a supply of housing land, it is also necessary to ensure that the right size, type and 
tenure mix of housing built is delivered. The National Planning Policy Framework requires planning 
authorities to id entify the size, type and ran ge of housing required and, furthermore, the National Planning 
Practice Guidance  states that once identified, the housing need should be broken down by household size 
and type. Specifically, the National Planning Policy Framewo rk requires local planning au thorities to plan 
for a mix of housing including  the needs of families with children, older people, students, people with 
disabilities, service families , travellers, people who rent their homes  and people wishing to build their  own 
homes.   
5.37 The Strategic Ho using Market Assessment for Ipswich and Waveney Housing Market Areas (2017) (SHMA) 
is a key piece of evidence which identifies the needs for mix and type of housing across the District  to 
2036.   
5.38 The SHMA provides conclusions on  the size of property needed in each tenure for the  former Suffolk 
Coastal  District  as a whole , and this part of the SHMA has been updated in 2019  to reflect the 
disaggregation of the housing need figure calculated using the national standard methodology . Evidence 
shows that this vari es between tenure, but that overall there is a need for all sizes of property and that 
across all tenures there is a need for at least 40% to be 1 or 2 bedroom properties. Consultation feedback 
suggests a relatively high level of demand for smaller propert ies, particularly those to meet the needs of 
first time buyers or those looking to downsize. At present, around 30% of all properties in the plan area  are 
1 or 2 bedrooms , and therefore the need for 40% of new dwellings over th e Plan period should not be 
underestimated . To ensure that smaller properties are  delivered, and in particular recognising the issues 
around affordability and the potential demand for properties for downsizing due to the ageing population, 
a particular foc us on smaller properties has  been identified.  It should be noted that the requirements in 
Table 5.1 below relate to need  across the former Suffolk Coastal District . It is acknowledged that, 
depending on the character of the surrounding area, some sites may  present a greater opportuni ty to 
secure smaller properties and consideration will therefore be given to surrounding densities and character 
in this respect.

97 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 5.39 In the former  Suffolk Coastal District  the number of households in private rented accommodation has 
increased by 35% between 2001 and 2011. Whilst this incre ase is lower than that of surrounding 
authorities, it nevertheless highlights a growing need for rental properties. The SHMA concludes th at 16% 
of housing need to 2036 is for private rented properties.   
5.40 There may be circumstances where there is other evide nce of local housing  needs which may include the 
Housing Register or a housing needs survey carried out by a Town or Parish Council , Neig hbourhood Plan 
group  or other organisation , and this may form a material consideration to be  considered alongside the 
conclusions of the SHMA which sets out the need at the former Suffolk Coastal District  level. Any 
alternative assessment of local need would need to be viewed in the context that new housing 
development is contributing to the wide r need and not just to the needs of the Town or Parish where the 
development is proposed.  
5.41 The SHMA highlights t hat within the Ipswich Strategic Planning  Area the population of those aged over 65 
is projected to increase by 46.3%  between 2018 and 2036. The East Suffolk Housing Strat egy recognises 
that there are an increasing number of older people living in housing that is too large or is not suited to 
their mobility needs. It states that t here is a need for more housing to be adapted to make it accessible 
and for more specialist hou sing for older people, including higher level support for people with severe 
mobility  problems, chronic physical health conditions and dementia. The development of new housing 
provides an opportunity to design -in such considerations. Provision of smaller, more suitable, 
accommodation may result in more of the existing larger properties bec oming available.   
5.42 The Local Plan seeks to address the housing needs of older people in a number of ways. Whilst the 
unrestricted existing housing stock, in practice, forms  part of the supply of future housing for older people 
the Plan recognises that due t o the increasingly ageing population there is a need to ensure that new 
development provides for housing that will more specifically meet the needs for accommodation for o lder 
people. By 2036 it is projected that there will be 40,916 older person household s (gross) in the Suffolk 
Coastal area. The types of accommodation needed for older person households, derived from the Long 
Term Balancing Housing Markets model and Strate gic Housing for Older People tool as referenced in the 
SHMA, are set out in Table 5.2  below. It is evident that the majority of older people will require general 
housing.

housing development over the plan period will contribute to the significant need for accommodation for 
older people and that all housing development of ten or more dwellings should demonstrate how it will 
contribute to meeting the needs of ol der people. It is acknowledged that on smaller sites (below 50 
dwellings) the provision of specialist accommodation (sheltered and extra care) is less likely to be feasible 
and the Council would therefore expect that the needs for older persons housing to be addressed through 
provision of M4(2) and M4(3) housing an d other forms of housing as set out in paragraph 5.4 9, as part of 
the housing mix. On larger sites (of 50 or more dwellings) the Council would expect that, in meeting this 
policy requirement, cons ideration is given to needs for specialist housing and that this is addressed where 
feasible.  
5.44 Reflecting the opp ortunities provided by sites to deliver on the wider objectives set out in paragraph 5. 50, 
a number of site allocations within the Local Plan c ontain a policy criteria specifying that the mix of housing 
provided should include housing to meet the needs of older people. It is expected that development 
coming forward on these allocations would, as an integral part of the development, include housin g such 
as the types set out in paragraph 5.4 9 below and on larger allocations would consider and address needs 
for specialist accommodation where feasible as part of meeting this requirement.  
5.45 The allocations which contain a specific requirement to include  housing to meet the needs of older people 
are:

5.46 The SHMA includes an assessment of the needs for specialist accommo dation for older people (sheltered 
housing, enhanced sheltered housing and extra care housing) and identifies a need for a total of 1,287 
units by 2036. The SHMA also identifies a need for a further 1,118 spaces in Registered Care (nursing and 
residential care homes) over the plan period. These needs are set out in Table 5.3 below, and have been 
further disaggregated between market and affordable nee ds.

Traditional forms of provision may not always match modern demands and  although the specialist housing 
market sector addresses a wide variety of needs  it is considered that some of this need will be met 
through the  provision of non-specialist housing, and therefore it is important that the mix of housing helps 
to address these needs.  Provision for sheltered and extra care housing and registered care wil l be secured 
through larger residential allocations where feasib le, as part of a mix of housing types.  
5.47 It is expected that the two Garden Neighbourhoods, which form a central part of the strategy of the Local 
Plan, will deliver an element of specialist ho using through reference in the policies to the provision of 
hous ing to meet the needs of vulnerable people. Land is also allocated under Policy SCLP12.27 Land rear of 
Rose Hill, Aldeburgh for the development of a care home alongside residential dwellings. Policy SCLP5.8 
supports the provision of sheltered and extra car e housing where this incorporates a mix of tenures to 
meet an identified need. Policy SCLP5.11 Affordable Housing on Exception Sites also provides 
opportunities for the delivery of affordable specialist accommodation on sites outside of but adjacent or 
well related to Settlement Boundaries.  
5.48 In 2015, the Government introduced two new ‘optional’ Building Regulations standards relating to 
accessible dwellings, which set standards in relation to accessible and adaptable dwellings (Part M4(2)) 
and wheelchair acc essible dwellings (Part M4(3)) which are over and above the minimum requirements44. 
Local authorities can apply these optional standards by incorporating a requirement within the ir planning

Coastal District with a limiting long term illness by 203 0. Considered alongside the number of adaptations 
made annually to the existing stock45 and the scale of projected growth in population aged over 65, it is 
cons idered that there is a clear need for a significant proportion of new dwelling stock to be built to higher 
accessible and adaptable standards. Such dwellings are not only benef icial to older people but may also 
help to meet the needs of other groups for ex ample families with young children. Alongside expecting 
developments of 10 or more non -specialist dwellings to demonstrate how needs for older people are met, 
the policy theref ore requires at least 50% of dwellings in developments of 10 non-specialist dwel lings or 
more to meet the requirements of Part M4(2). This includes developments incorporating specialist and 
non-specialist dwellings where 10 or more non -specialist dwellings are proposed. In recognition of the 
types of needs being met by specialist acco mmodation, the policy expects that all specialist 
acco mmodation would meet the requirements for M4(2) dwellings. Whilst the Council will support the 
development of dwellings built to the wheelchair accessible standard, a requirement for these will not be 
set as the needs for them will be specific to individua l circumstances. This approach also supports the Joint 
Health and Wellbeing Strategy for Suffolk which identifies the provision of greater choice and innovation in 
housing for those with disabilities as  one of its priorities, and the East Suffolk Housing S trategy which 
identifies a need for more accessible accommodation.   
5.49 In addition to specialist accommodation, there is a range of types of housing that may be  particularly  well 
suited to the older popula tion, and which  may also help to improve choice in the  housing stock across the 
plan area more generally.  The Council will support innovative schemes which seek to create integrated 
communities and  will expect developers to consider whether such types of h ousing would be feasible 
depending on the site size an d location. Examples of housing types and design which may contribute to 
providing a mix of housing choices for older people could include  those set out below, however it is not 
the intention that these  would routinely be limited to occupation by older peo ple and they may also suit 
the needs of others. Types of housing which could be suitable for older people include : 
 Almshouses – housing provided by charities at a low rent, usually for older people;  
 Cohousing – community led schemes whereby residents share  some spaces / facilities;  
 Bungalows /level access homes , including dormer bungalows provided there is adequate living 
accommodation (i.e. bedroom(s) and bathroom(s)) on the ground floor;  
 Smaller propert ies, but which have larger than standard living and st orage space;  
 Provision of shared or smaller garden/outdoor spaces.  
5.50 Opportunities should be taken to integrate older persons housing into the community, in order to address 
potential issues of isolation  and to promote inclusivity. For example older persons  housing on sites that are 
well related to schools, community centres or other focal points can help to create integrated 
communities.  The Suffolk Healthy Ageing Needs Assessment (2018) identifies ta ckling social isol ation and 
 
45 Part 2 of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment shows  this to be around 100 per year on average over the past five year s, and is

have opportunities to access sustainable transport and modes of travel other than the car.   
5.51 To ensure that the size of dwelling s appropriately reflects the needs identified, the Cou ncil will consider 
the number of rooms and layout of dwellings proposed in determining the number of rooms that could be 
used as bedrooms .  
5.52 Neighbourhood Plans may wish to identify specific localised ne eds for certain types of dwellings where 
supported by evidence gathered through a local housing needs assessment which is supported by the 
Council. There are also other or complementary mechanis ms in which communities can deliver the homes 
needed in the lo cal community, for example through the establishment of a Community Land Trust.  
Policy SCLP5.8: Housing Mix  
Proposals for new housing development will be expected to deliver the housing needed  for different 
groups in the community as identified in the St rategic Housing Market Assessment, or latest equivalent 
assessment.  
New development should provide a mix of housing tenures, types and sizes appropriate to the site size, 
characteristics and loc ation, reflecting where feasible the identified need, particul arly focusing on smaller 
dwellings (1 and 2 bedrooms).  
To contribute towards meeting the significant needs for housing for older people, proposals for ten or 
more dwellings should demonstrate ho w the development will contribute to meeting the needs of olde r 
people.  
On proposals of 10 or more non-specialist dwellings at least 50% of the dwellings will need to meet the 
requirements for accessible and adaptable dwellings under Part M4(2) of the Buil ding Regulations . All 
specialist dwellings will be expected to  meet the requirements for accessible and adaptable dwellings 
under Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations.  Only in exceptional circumstances would a lower percentage 
of M4(2) dwellings be permi tted. In such circumstances applicants would need to demonstra te that 
provision is either unfeasible or unviable and that the development incorporates alternative measures to 
enhance accessibility and adaptability where possible.  
Sheltered and extra -care housing will be supported where the scheme incorporates a mix o f tenures and 
sizes to meet an identified need.  
Neighbourhood Plans may set out an approach to housing type and mix specific to the local area where 
this is supported by evidence.

5.53 From 1 April 2016, the Self Build and  Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 requires local planning authorities to 
keep a register of people who are interested in building their own homes. As part of meeting the n eeds for 
a mix of housing types, the National Planning Policy Framework states that plan ning authorities should 
plan for the needs of those wishing to build their own homes.  
5.54 Self build projects are defined as those where someone directly organises the des ign and construction of 
their own home. This covers a wide range of projects including a  traditional DIY self build home, to projects 
where the self builder employs someone to build their home for them. Community -led projects can also be 
defined as self bu ild. Custom build homes are where a person works with a developer as an individual or a 
group to help provide their own home. The developer may help to find a plot, manage the construction 
and arrange the finance for the new home. This is more of a hands -off approach but the home is tailored 
to match the individual’s requirements. Modular con struction may be an appropriate form of self -build or 
custom -build, where this is acceptable in design terms.  
5.55 As of  November 2018 there are  over 250 people on the Suffo lk Coastal Self -build and Custom Build 
Register, and analysis of the Register indicates that a large proportion of the demand  is for village and 
countryside locations, and geographically , where a location is identified, the area around the east of 
Ipswich , Woodbridge  and the Deben peninsula are popular locations . The SHMA identified that acro ss the 
Ipswich Housing Market Area , 94.7% of those on the Register are interested in a single plot of land to build 
a home for themselves to live in (or employ someone else to build this home), 28.1% are interested in a 
group self -build project (where a gr oup of people come together to design and develop a custom build 
housing development which they then live in) and 19.3% in a developer led custom build (where a  
developer divides a larger site into individual plots and provides a design and build service t o purchasers 
enabling people to customise existing house designs)46. Those on the Self -build Register were also asked 
about the minimum number of bedrooms they would  require in their new home. Some 46.9% of 
respondents indicated they require three bedrooms,  35.9% require four bedrooms, 15.9% two bedrooms 
and 1.3% five or more bedrooms.  
5.56 Policy SCLP5.9 below sets out the Council’s approach to delivering serviced plots across the plan area . As 
well as requiring all developments of 100 or more dwellings to prov ide a proportion of serviced plots for 
self and custom build units, the policy als o supports the delivery of solely self build and custom build 
developments where they are in conformity with the other relevant policies of this plan.  
5.57 A key element of self and custom build schemes is the flexibility to design and build homes to individua l 
requirements however it is important that an element of coherence in the design and appearance of the 
overall site is maintained. As such, where groups of plots are concern ed, a design code should be agreed 
as part of an outline planning permission which  establishes design principles to which each plot should 
adhere. This will also provide greater certainty for self and custom builders that their individual designs will

plot; plot coverage; materials palette; landscaping; parking; and waste management amongst others.  
5.58 Where serviced self build or custom 
build plots are made  available (i.e. 
the required highways and services 
are in place) but are not take n up 
after 12 months, permission may be 
granted for the plots to be 
developed by a developer. In such 
instances, the Council will require 
evidence to demonstrate that the 
plots have been actively promoted 
as self build and custom build plots,

other relevant  policies of this Local Plan.  
Developments of 100 o r more dwellings will be expected to provide a minimum of 5% self or custom build 
properties on site through the provision of serviced plots. Once completed and available for development, 
the serviced plo ts should be marketed for a period of not less than 12 months, in accordance with the 
principles set out in Appendix E. If, following this period, any of the serviced plots remain unsold; they may 
be built out by the developer.  
Proposals for 5 or more sel f build or custom build dwellings in a single site l ocation should be developed in 
accordance with a set of design principles to be submitted with planning applications and agreed by the 
local planning authority.  
 
Affordable Housing on Residential Sites  
5.59 High house prices across the former Suffolk Coastal District  mean that many people cannot afford to 
purchase or rent a house on the open market.  The Strategic Housing Market Assessment identifies that 
within the former Suffolk Coastal area median property p rices are higher than in the other parts of the 
Ipswich Housing Market Area.  
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  104 5.60 The East Suffolk Housing Strategy (2017 – 2023) identifies the affordability of housing as a key challenge 
and includes an area of focus around having a more proactive role towar ds supporting the delivery of 
affor dable housing in East Suffolk.  The provision of affordable housing through the development of market 
housing is an integral part of the delivery of the East Suffolk Housing Strategy, including through investing 
commuted s ums into additional affordable home s and achieving on -site affordable homes which provide 
the right mix of sizes and tenures to meet local need.  
5.61 Affordable housing is defined in the National Planning Policy Framework  as affordable housing for rent, 
starte r homes, discounted market sales ho using and other routes to home ownership which includes 
shared ownership, relevant equity loans  and other low cost homes for sale and rent to buy .  
5.62 The National Planning Policy Framework expects the need for affordable ho using to be met on -site unless 
off-site provision or a financial contribution can be justified and where the agreed approach contributes to 
creating mixed and balanced communities. The NPPF states that  affordable housing contributions should 
only be sought  for major housing development (def ined as sites of ten dwellings or more in the National 
Planning Policy Framework) .  
5.63 The National Planning Policy Framework includes a  requirement for major development (defined as that of 
ten or more dwellings) whereby at  least 10% of the homes should be available for affordable home 
ownership unless this would exceed the level of affordable housing required in the area or significantly  
prejudice the ability to meet the identified affordable housing needs of specific group s. The National 
Planning Policy Framework states that exemptions should be made where the development is for solely 
Build to Rent homes, is specialist accommodation for  a group of people with specific needs, is self build or 
custom build, is exclusively fo r affordable housing or is a rural exception site.   
5.64 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment update carried out in 2019  identifies that of the total housing 
need across the plan area  10.2% should be for social rent / affordable rent, 7.0% should be for shar ed 
ownership and 4.6%  should be for Starter Homes / discounted home ownership. In recognition that 
market schemes below 10 dwellings will not need to provide affordable  housing, it is appropriate that the 
proportion required on sites of ten or more dwellin gs makes a greater contribution to the overall plan area  
need. The National Planning Policy Framework requirement for  10% of homes on major development to 
be for afford able home ownership will be considered alongside the conclusions of the Strategic Housin g 
Market Assessment and other evidence of local need on a case by case basis.  
5.65 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment, included  some analysis of Starter Homes and disc ounted 
market housing  to identify their potential role in meeting housing needs. The Str ategic Housing Market 
Assessment concluded that these tenures would most likely be suitable for those who currently reside in 
the private rental sector and concluded th at there would be an indicative demand for 390 dwellings in 
these tenures. The provision  of Starter Homes and discount ed home ownership should not therefore be 
made at the expense of shared ownership and social / affordable rent. Further, as Starter Homes are not 
required to remain as such in perpetuity, policy needs to consider the longer te rm appropriateness of 
market housing in locations where Starter Homes are supported.  Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
105  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 5.66 In exceptional circumstances where proposals are not able to meet the requirements  for affordable 
housing for viability reasons, and to ensure that development can still come forward and overall housing 
delivery is not compromised, the Council may agree to alter the requirements subject to this being 
demonstrated through a comprehensive  viability assessment, to the Council’s satisfaction. Before reducing 
the overall provis ion of affordable housing, the tenure and type of affordable housing should be first 
adjusted to secure viability. In line with the National Planning Policy Framework, viability assessments will 
be made publicly available.  Guidance on viability assessments  is contained in Appendix G. The Council’s 
Whole Plan Viability Study (January 2019) identified a series of site and development typologies that are 
common across the D istrict. The Study shows that solely flatted developments on brownfield sites may not 
be viable when meeting the policy requirement for affordable housing. Schemes which propose a mix of 
unit type, will be assessed as a whole to determine the level of affo rdable housing to be provided. Where 
at the planning application stage provision of affo rdable housing in accordance with Policy SCLP5.10 is 
considered by an applicant to not be viable the Council would require demonstration of this through a 
viability ass essment following the guidance contained in Appendix G. In determining whether a site ha s 
capacity for more than ten units, consideration will be given to the potential developable area of a site and 
an appropriate density for development that accords with  Policy SCLP11.1 Design  Quality . The National 
Planning Policy Framework states that wher e vacant buildings are being re -used or redeveloped an 
affordable housing contribution should be reduced by a proportionate amount.  
5.67 Local need for affordable housing m ay be identified through a local housing needs assessment. Developers 
are encouraged to work closely with the Council’s Housing team to ensure appropriate evidence is 
provided with any planning application.  
5.68 Where a contribution towards affordable housing provision is secured, the Council will operate the 
allocation  of this thro ugh its Housing  remit .   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing

Proposals for residential development with ca pacity for ten units or more or sites of 0.5ha or more  will be 
expected to make provision for 1 in 3 units to be affordable dwellings, an d to be made available to meet 
an identified local need , including needs for affordable housing for older people . 
Propo sals which provide a higher amount of affordable housing than that set out above will also be 
permitted.  
Of these affordable dwellings, 50% should be for affordable rent / social rent, 25% should be for shared 
ownership and 25% should be for discounted ho me ownership.  
Provision is expected to be made on -site, unless it can be demonstrated in exceptional circumstances that 
it is not feasibl e or practical to provide the units on site in which case it may be agreed that a commuted 
sum could be paid towards pr ovision of affordable housing outside of the site.  
In exceptional circumstances, where the Council is satisfied that the provision of aff ordable housing is not 
viable, as demonstrated through a viability assessment the Council may agree to vary the require ment for 
affordable housing.  The requirement for affordable housing does not apply to developments which are 
solely brownfield flatted sc hemes. In schemes with a mix of housing types the affordable housing provision 
will be assessed as a whole.  
Neighbourhood Plans may set requirements for a greater proportion of affordable housing where this is 
supported by evidence of need and viability as sessment.  
 
  Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
107  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Affordable housing in the countryside  
5.69 Limiting development beyond Settlement Boundaries  lowers land values in these locations by removing 
the ‘hope value’ for high value developments such as market housing.  This allows the Council to develop 
‘exception site’ policies which allow for certain types of development such as 100% afforda ble housing 
schemes or schemes for the relocation of homes at risk from coastal erosion which wouldn’t otherwise be 
viable if they were competing for land with marke t housing. This approach is supported by national 
planning policy.  
5.70 Consideration should fi rst be given to whether the need can be met within the Settlement Boundary  or on 
allocated sites. To be supported, the housing proposed on exception sites should rel ate to an identified 
local need. The need may be identified through, for example, a communi ty planning exercise or a local 
housing needs assessment. Developers are encouraged to work closely with the Council’s Housing team to 
ensure appropriate evidence is  provided with any planning application. Affordable housing provision on 
exception sites sh ould have a tenure mix which is reflective of local housing needs identified in the local 
housing needs assessment.  
5.71 In recognition of the fact that Starter Homes ar e not required to remain as such in perpetuity, they are not 
considered appropriate on thei r own on exception sites but may form part of a mix of affordable housing 
where they would meet an identified local need.  A Starter Home is as defined in the Housing  and Planning 
Act 2016.  
5.72 The National Planning Policy Framework supports the development of  entry level exception sites suitable 
for first time buyers or those looking to rent their first home, unless the need for such homes is already 
being met within the  authority’s area. In accordance with criterion a) under paragraph 71  of the National 
Plann ing Policy Framework , such schemes would need to form part of a mix of affordable housing 
provision as identified within a local housing needs survey.

Proposals for the development of affordable housing in the countryside will be permitted where:  
a) It is demonstrated there is an identified local need for affordable housing and this cannot be met 
through existing  housing allocations in the Local Plan or relevant Neighbourhood Plan, or thro ugh 
development within the Settlement Boundary;  
b) The scheme is adjacent or well related to an identified Settlement Boundary or a cluster of houses 
in the countryside (as defined in Policy SCLP5.4);  
c) The scheme incorporates a range of dwelling sizes, types a nd tenures appropriate to the identified 
local need , including needs for affordable housing for older people ; and  
d) The location, scale and design standard of a scheme will retain or enhance the character and 
setting of the settlement or cluster and not lead  to settlement coalescence.  
A limited amount of market housing will be permitted as part of affordable housing development in the 
countryside where it is required to cross -subsid ise the affordable housing. Where market housing is to be 
provided on site thi s will be subsidiary to the affordable housing element of the proposal and the amount 
of market housing required will need to be demonstrated through a viability assessment. The amount of 
market housing on the site should be no more than one third of the d wellings on the site.  
Where Starter Homes are proposed, these should form part of a mix of tenures on the site.  
Where sites for affordable housing in the countryside are brought forward with an element of market 
housing, both housing tenures should be buil t to the same design standards and contribute towards the 
character of the area.  
 
Houses in Multiple Occupation  
5.73 Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) which fall within Use Class C4 are defined as ‘ small shared houses 
occupied by between three and six unrelated individuals, as their only or main residence, who share basic 
amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom.’  Change of use between Use Class C3 and C4 is ‘permitted 
development’,  although permission may be required for related works so the advice of t he Council should 
be sought. Larger HMOs are classed as ‘sui generis’ and will require planning permission for change of use.  
Licenses are also required for all HMOs of 5 or more indi viduals comprising 2 or more households.  
5.74 Proposals for conversion to HMO s usually occur within residential areas in the more urban parts of the 
plan area . HMOs present issues that distinguish them from residential dwellings (Use Class C3) through the 
need  for additional features including parking areas, bin storage, accesses a nd windows. Due to the nature 
of use of such properties, they are usually most suited to locations where there are a good range of 
services and access to public transport. This is par ticularly important in relation to parking provision and 
opportunities to  access jobs and services by public transport or by walking or cycling. These will be key 
considerations where there is insufficient scope for appropriate on -site parking.  Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
109  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCL P5.12: Houses in Multiple Occupation  
Proposals for Houses in Multiple Occ upation will be supported within Settlement Boundaries where:  
a) There is no adverse impact on the character of the dwelling or the surrounding area;  
b) Provision can be made for sufficient  parking and where the dwelling is, or can be made to be, 
accessible to public transport services and main employment and service centres on foot and by 
cycle; and   
c) Any extensions necessary are in accordance with the Council’s design policies.  
 
Residenti al Annexes  
5.75 Residential annexes can be important in enabling  families to live close to one another but maintain a 
degree of independent living. In view of the ageing population in the former Suffolk Coastal  area , it is 
expected that the demand for annexes i s likely to grow.  
5.76 However, in situations where policy woul d prevent the development of an independent dwelling, it is 
important that annexes are designed and used in a way which ensures that they are ancillary to the host 
dwelling and are not able to be u sed as an independent dwelling. In this respect, annexes sh ould be 
smaller in scale than the host dwelling and should not have their own separate curtilage or access. 
Proposals will be expected to demonstrate the way in which the annex has been designed to  prevent it 
being used as an independent dwelling in the fu ture.  
5.77 In order to ensure that annexes remain as such and are not sold, let or used as independent dwellings, 
occupation will be limited by way of a condition or planning obligation  in accordance w ith national policy 
for planning conditions and planning ob ligations . The use of such conditions will ensure that annexes are 
not used as dwellings in locations, or under circumstances, where a new dwelling would not usually be 
permitted. In particular, th e creation of an annex should not lead to the creation of a  new home in the 
countryside that would not be permitted under Policy SCLP5.3.  Particular care  will be taken in respect of 
residential annexes to ensure that, through design and/or planning conditi ons, annexes are not able to be 
separated from the main building in order to create a separate dwelling.  Where an annex is proposed as 
an extension, its later incorporation into the host dwelling should not lead to the creation of two dwellings.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Housing

An annex to an existing dwelling will be supported where:  
a) The annex is smaller in scale and clearly ancillary to the host dwelling;  
b) The proposal does not involve the physical separation of the residential curtilage;  
c) No separate a ccess is required;  
d) The annex is either an extension or is well related to the host dwelling;  
e) In the case of a new build annex, it is not feasible to create the annex through an extension or the 
conversion of an outbuilding;  
f) There is sufficient off -road par king;  and 
g) There is no significant adverse effect on the landscape or visual amenity.  
Conditions or planning obligations  will be applied to limit occu pation to use as an annex and to  prevent 
future use as a separate dwelling  in accordance with national poli cy for planning conditions and 
obligations . Where an annex is proposed as an extension, it should be designed in a way which will enable 
it to be inc orporated into the host dwelling when no longer required.  
 
Extensions to Residential Curtilages  
5.78 In some c ases, areas of land which it is intended to incorporate into the gardens of dwellings do not raise 
any concerns. In other cases, particularly where the proposed extension is into areas of open landscape or 
agricultural land, this can lead to consi derable h arm to the landscape and visual amenity, particularly 
within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The loss of hedgerows in particular can have a harmful 
impact.  
5.79 The size and scale of the proposed extension should reflect the character of the property an d the local 
area. Retention of boundary features or the use of appropriate landscaping and native species can help to 
address any potential visual impacts.  Permitte d Development rights may be withdrawn for the extended 
area where it is considered that the addition of swimming pools, greenhouses and garden sheds for 
example could potentially detract from the openness of the landscape or character of the area . 
Consider ation will also be given to the landscape character of the area in terms of Policy SCLP10. 4. Housing  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
111  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP5.14: Extensions to Residential Curtilages  
Extensions to residential curtilages will be permitted where:  
a) The resulting size of the curtilage reflects th e scale and location of the dwelling;  
b) They do not result in the removal of an existing hedge row of native species unless replaced by a 
similar hedgerow;  
c) They do not have a harmful impact on the historic environment, landscape or character of the 
area, incl uding as a result of developments ancillary to the residential use; and  
d) The proposed boundar y feature of the extended curtilage is of a form which reflects its location 
and the character of the area.  
In granting planning consent for the extension of reside ntial curtilages, the Council will consider the 
removal of Permitted Development rights.  
 
Houseboats  
5.80 Houseboats contribute to the overall housing stock of the former Suffolk Coastal District  and have grown 
in numbers over the course of time. There currently exists no standard definition for houseboats and no 
specific over -arching planning guidan ce for houseboats, although they are considered as a housing group 
by national planning policy. A h ouseboat is, forthwith, locally defined as a floating decked structure 
without a permanent foundation which is designed or adapted for use as a residence and  not primarily 
used for navigation.  
5.81 In 2017 a Boat Dwellers Accommodation Needs Assessment was unde rtaken on behalf of the Council, as 
part of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment, to estimate the need for additional houseboat moorings 
in the plan area  for the period 2016 -2036. The assessment indicated that there are a total of 16 
permanent houseboat s located in the plan area , but it was recognised that this may be an 
underestimation. The assessment concluded that there is a need for 17 additional moorin gs in the plan 
area for the period 2016 -2036.  
5.82 However, the estuaries where houseboats are located are sensitive environments and are nationally and 
internationally protected. Saltmarsh intrusion and poor pump -out facilities are issues that have been 
highl ighted in recent times which could potentially adversely affect the protected European sites in the  
Deben Estuary. Increased recreational activity can also have an impact upon European sites through 
disturbance, and the Council is producing a Recreation Av oidance and Mitigation Strategy to set out 
measures for securing appropriate mitigation. Slipways, jetties and river access points can also create 
similar issues to that of the actual houseboat, for example by covering of saltmarshes.

a berth or to facilitate a berth for a residential boat;  
 Alterations to a residential boat that may materially change its external appearance;  
 A replacement residential boat on an existing mooring which is substantially different in size 
and form from the original;  
 Construction of, jetties, platforms and sheds (including alterations materially changing the size 
of such structures).  
5.84 Due to the p revalence of houseboats on the Deben Estuary, the Deben Estuary Plan (produced by the 
Deben Estuary  Partnership) provides guidelines for residential boats including in relation to their design 
and siting and ancillary features. The Plan was endorsed by the  former Suffolk Coastal District  Council in 
2015 and  proposals on the Deben Estuary will therefore be expected to demonstrate that they are 
consistent with the Deben Estuary Plan.  
5.85 In addition to planning permission, some works may also require consent fro m the Marine Management 
Organisation , the Crown Esta te, or Natural England . The advice of the Environment Agency in relation to 
potential risk from flooding , and the advice of Natural England in relation to the Habitat Regulations  will be 
considered. Works  in, un der, over or within 8 metres  from a fluvial m ain river and from any flood defence 
structure or culvert may also require an environmental “Flood Risk Activity” permit from the Environment 
Agency . 
5.86 Sewage disposal has been consistently identified as a problem in the Deben Estuary. In this respect, any 
proposal involving a new or replacement houseboat or alterations to an existing houseboat that requires 
planning consent must fully address the matter of sewage disposal.  
5.87 Some ‘made’ Neighbourhood Plans 
on the Deben Estuary specify policy 
for houseboats wi thin their 
Neighbourhood Plan areas, namely 
Martlesham and Melton. The Council 
will assist Neighbourhood Plan 
groups in developing policy for 
houseboats specific to their area.  
5.88 The Council, in consultati on with the 
Deben Estuary Partnership, identified 
a number of areas of existing 
houseboats along the Deben Estuary. 
Maps of the areas of existing 
houseboats are shown on  the Policies Maps . Areas of existing houseboats are identifi ed at Felixstowe 
Ferry, Ma rtlesham Creek, Woodbridge and Melton.

c) They will not result in harm to the visual amenity and/or tranquillity of the estuary; and  
d)  An adequate means of sewage disposal is prov ided to the satisfaction of the relevant wastewater

Neighbourhood Plans may include local policies relating to residential moorings.  
 
Residential Caravans and Mobile Homes  
5.89 Residential caravans and mobile homes for permanent residential use are acknowledged as a form of 
housing which contributes to the overall mix of housing, and does make up part of the housing stock 
within the plan area . However, due to their construction a nd materials they have the potential to have a 
more harmful impact on th e landscape and character of the surrounding area than traditional homes. 
Careful siting and screening may help to reduce such an impact.  
5.90 It is acknowledged that temporary caravans ar e often required in the countryside for seasonal agricultural 
workers.  
5.91 In addition to planning permission, a licence is also required in relation to residential caravan or mobile 
homes sites.

5.92 National plan ning policy for Gypsies and Travellers is set out in Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015) 
and requires planning authorities to use their evidence to plan positively to meet the needs of Gypsies and 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople. G ypsies and Tr avellers are defined for planning purposes within the 
Planning Policy for Travellers Sites (2015) as:  
‘Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on 
grounds only of their own or their family ’s or dependants ’ educational or health needs or old age 
have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling 
showpeople or circus people travelling together as such.  
In determining whether persons are ‘gypsies and trave llers’ for th e purposes of this planning policy, 
consideration should be given to the following issues amongst other relevant matters:  
a) whether they previously led a nomadic habit of life  
b) the reasons for ceasing their nomadic habit of life  
c) whether there is an i ntention of living a nomadic habit of life in the future, and if so, how soon 
and in what circumstances.’  
5.93 Travelling Showpeople are defined within the Planning Policy for Travellers Sites (2015) as:  
‘Members of a group organised for th e purposes of holding  fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not 
travelling together as such). This includes such persons who on the grounds of their own or their 
family ’s or dependant s’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or health needs or old a ge 
have ceased to tra vel temporarily, but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as defined above.’  
5.94 The Gypsy, Traveller, Travelling Showpeople and Boat Dwellers Accommodation Needs Assessment for 
Babergh, Ipswich, Mid Suffolk, Suffolk Coastal and Waveney (2017) identifies  the former  Suffolk Coastal  
District  as ‘unique’ in the eastern region in that it has a relatively stable population of New Travellers and 
concludes that there is a need for 15 permanent Gypsy and Traveller pitches47 over the period 2016 – 
2036.  This need relates larg ely to the unauthorised nature of sites on which the existing population of New 
Travellers reside. The need over the period 2016 – 2036 is set out below.

develo pments being unauthorised. National Planning policy for Traveller Sites sets out the Government’s 
aim to reduce the number of unauthorised develo pments. In this respect, the Council will engage with the 
relevant landowners and occupants with a view to esta blishing a way in which appropriate use of the site 
can be regularised.  On this basis it is identified that over the Plan period there is a need  for a further 5 
new pitches.  
5.96 The Accommodation Needs Assessment also concludes that there is a need for 2 to 3  short stay stopping 
sites across the study area. The Council is working with other authorities across Suffolk to deliver the need 
for short stay  stopping sites, as set out in the East Suffolk Private Sector Housing Strategy (2019 – 2023).  
5.97 The former Suffo lk Coastal District  also has one, long -established Travelling Showpersons site.  The 
Accommodation Needs Assessment identifies a need for 2 plots for Travelling Showpeople in the plan area 
over the period 2016 - 2036.  The need over the period 2016 – 2036 is  set out below.

The Council will support the provision of permanent sites for Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople, to meet the needs identified through the 2017 Accomm odation Needs Assessment as set out 
below:  
a) Provision of 5  new  pitches to meet the needs for permanent accommodation for Gypsies and 
Travellers;  
b) Provision of 2 plots to meet the needs for Travelling Showpeople.  
The Council will work with other Councils acro ss Suffolk to deliver identified needs for short stay stopping 
sites, including the delivery of one short stay stopping site within East Suffolk.  
Sites for Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople will be permitted where:  
c) The proposed occupants mee t the definition of ‘Gypsies and Travellers’ or ‘Travelling showpeople’ 
as set out i n ‘Planning Policy for Traveller Sites’ (2015) (or subsequent revisions);  
d) The site is within, adjacent to or well related to a Major Centre, Town, Large Village or Small 
Village. Where the requirement for a site is linked to the education or health needs o f the 
occupants the site must be well related to locations where these services are provided;  
e) The site is capable of being provided with mains water and adequate sewage/was te disposal 
provision (including the storage of waste prior to disposal);  
f) The site i s acceptable in terms of highway safety;  
g) The site is designed so as to minimise visual impact on the surrounding area and landscape 
character, and does not dominate the nea rest settled community;  
h) The site is not located in flood zone 2 or flood zone 3;  
i) Any industrial, retail, commercial, or commercial storage activities to take place on the site must 
be ancillary to the primary use of the site for residential purposes and mu st not harm the amenity 
of occupants of the site or surrounding areas;  
j) The scale and  range of uses proposed within the site are acceptable in terms of their impact on 
any existing neighbouring uses; and  
k) Where it is intended that a site should be self manag ed by the occupants, the capacity of the site 
should not normally exceed 8 pitches.  
The Council will work with relevant parties with the aim of reducing the number of unauthorised 
permanent pitches. Where proposals would contribute towards reducing the num ber of unauthorised 
pitches, this will be a factor in decision taking.  
Where the pro posal is for a Travelling Showpersons site (or extension to an existing site) sufficient space 
for storage of vehicles and equipment will be provided.  
Neighbourhood Plans may allocate sites for Gypsy and Traveller use.  Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

6.1 The tourism sector is a substantial and important part of the area ’s overall economy, which brings benefit 
to the quality of life and the wellbeing of communities. The area  succeeds in  attracting visitors for a variety 
of reasons, but the character and appeal of its landscapes , villages and market towns is of fundamental 
importance.  
6.2 Tourism supports businesses, facilities, town centres and community life across the plan area . Destinati ons 
throughout the plan area  are popular for holidays, overnight stays and with residents of the district, 
nearby areas and further afield. Sustainable growth in tourism can promote a better understanding and 
appreciation of the natural , built and historic  environment, which in turn will help to maintain these finite 
resources for future generatio ns.  
6.3 Visitors to  the former  Suffolk Coastal  area  are attracted by the character, culture, history, festivals, music, 
art, film, food  and drink, clean beaches and s pectacular coastline, river valleys, and the outstanding 
countryside and wildlife found acros s the plan area . Capitalising on these strengths will enable the area  to 
continue to attract year round tourism trade.   
6.4 Tourism is an important part of the economy  of the former Suffolk Coastal  area , contributing 1 2% to total 
employment across the District  in 201 7. The Suffolk Coastal Economic Impact of Tourism Report 201 7 
identifies that  over 6.3 million tourist trips  were  recorded generating a total of £325 millio n total tourism 
value across the plan area . The Ipswich Economic Area Sector Needs Assessment  (2017) identifies that 
growth is expected to be seen within the ‘Hospitality and Leisure ’ sector of the economy.  Tourism is an 
important part of this  sector  refle cting both the cultural and natural environment across the plan area . 
6.5 The former Suffolk Coastal  area  offers a diverse range of tourism experiences to satisfy all tastes. The 
strength of the tourism offering in the peak summer months have created a seasona l tourism environment 
and it is important to exploit opportunities which support the tourism offer  all year round . Weaknesses 
include low pay and productivity in the sector along with gaps and inconsistencies in the overall offer made 
to visitors alongside  strong competition from other local, national and international locations.  
6.6 The East Suffolk Business Plan, the East Suffolk Tourism Strategy and the East Suffolk Economic Growth 
Plan 2018 strive to build on the strength of the tourism economy and set out  aims for increasing visitor 
numbers outside of the main tourist season including  delivering and supporting cultural and sporting 
events. Supporting the industry is of great importance but it must not be at the expense of the sensitive 
natural and historic  assets and attractions that draw people in to the area.  
6.7 Popular tourism destinat ions include locations with in the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), 
Heritage Coast, forests, estuaries, seaside towns and historic villages. This could result in some  places and 
communities experiencing potential significant adverse impacts such a s loss of natural habitats or 
overcrowding.  The Local Plan seeks to reduce these impacts whilst increasing the volume and value of 
tourism trade and extending the tourist seas on to support  compelling destinations and visitor experiences.  Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
119  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 6.8 The Local Plan re cognises the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB as vitally important to the tourism industry . 
The 2018 AONB Management Plan identif ies the natural beauty, tranquillity and histori c assets within the 
AONB  as supporting social wellbeing and the local economy .  
6.9 The National Planning Policy Framework encourages development of tourism initiatives in urban and rural 
locations, provided the character of the countryside is respected , and p ollution and other adverse effects 
on the local and natural environments are mini mised. The NPPF encourages the retention and 
development of accessible local services and facilities.  In the plan area  tourism uses can support local 
facilities but it is impo rtant to maintain a balance between facilities meeting the needs of visitors and 
communities. Sustainable tourism, as advocated in the AONB Management Plan, is strongly supported in 
the implementation of tourism development throughout the plan area , but wi th particular regard to the 
AONB and Heritage Coast.  Along the Heritage Coast it is important that sustainable tourism is integrated 
with local economic and community benefits , conservation  and enhance ment  of its  unique environment  
and valuable natural res ources . 
6.10 The Suffolk Coast Tourism Strategy 2013 -2023 further advocates support fo r sustainable tourism, with a 
strong reputation for its positive environmental values which attract visitors throughout the year, and 
encourage effective partnership working t o balance the environmental, heritage, economic, and 
community priorities. The Su ffolk Coast Destination Management Organisation (DMO) is the organisation 
established to manage the improved delivery, co -ordination, facilitation, and monitoring of the key 
elements of the tourism strategy across the Suffolk Coast, through the development  and marketing of the 
Suffolk Coast area as a visitor destination.

The Council will seek to manage tourism across the plan area  in a way that protec ts the features that make 
the area  attractive to visitors, and supports local facilities where the local road network has the capacity to 
accommodate the traffic generated from proposals.  
Proposals which improve the visitor experience and support opportuni ties for year round tourism will b e 
supported where increased tourism uses can be accommodate d. 
Proposals for tourist related development will be determined by the area’s capacity for further growth in 
the following locations:  
a) The resorts of Felixstowe and  Aldeburgh;  
b) Market towns of Woodbr idge, Framlingham, Saxmundham and Leiston;  
c) The Heritage Coast environment which is of national significance;  
d) The Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; and  
e) Rural areas across the rest of the District.  
Applicants will be expected to un dertake biodiversity and habitat assessments to ensure that any 
development of tourism related facilities does not conflict with environmental policies. Where appropriate 
the Council will support the introduction of local management solutions to address an y issues caused by 
tourism.  
 
Tourism Destinations  
6.11 As well as the natural environment, seaside towns and 
villages in  the former  Suffolk Coastal  area , there are a 
number of tourist destinations  which are popular places 
for visitors and local residents, including beaches, family 
attractions, special landscapes, and cultural and heritage 
assets.  The former Suffolk Coastal area is characterised 
by diverse tourism destinations across the district wh ich 
integrate experiences aro und culture, food and drink, 
artisan and creative products, aviation, military,  historical 
interpretation and education, active recreation and 
wellbeing.  
6.12 Tourism destinations  support businesses and jobs in 
other sectors of the local economy and the Local Plan 
recognises and supports tourism relationships and 
opportunities with neighbouring local authorities 
Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
121  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n including Ipswich  and Tendring, for example boat trips, pedestrian and cycle ferries and links between 
museums, businesses and communities.  
6.13 Within est ablished tourism destinations , there are likely to be opportunities for further development or 
intensification of use over the plan period and it is important that these are re alised in a sympathetic way 
which works for the site as a whole and surrounding area. In this regard, the addition of new buildings, car 
parking areas, bus routes, cycle facilities, rail infrastructure and pedestrian links will be supported when 
related to  the continued operation of the destination . In sensitive locations across the plan area , proposals 
will need to be subject to consideration under the Habitats Regulations to ensure that development does 
not cause any significant adverse impacts.  
6.14 Across th e plan area  there is a comprehensive range of tourism activities provided by org anisations, 
stakeholders and businesses. Some have the benefit of tourist road signage which are coordinated by 
Suffolk County Council as local Highways Authority, however many  more do not benefit from such 
dedicated signage. Many of these take place withi n the former Suffolk Coastal  area  but the area also 
benefits from attractions outside of the plan area  such as Latitude Festival and the County Town of 
Ipswich, which result in  additional visitors to the area and demand on accommodation in the plan area .  
6.15 Facilities  which broaden the tourist opportunities across the plan area  and extend the tourist season will 
be welcomed where they accord with other policies in the Local Plan. The Suffolk Coast Tourism Strategy 
2013 -2023 emphasises the need to maximise the  appeal, quality and popularity of the countryside, and 
the market and coastal towns to encourage more off and shoulder season visits for a range of activities.   
 
Policy SCLP6. 2: Tourism  Destinations  
The Council will support proposals for tourism developme nt that contribute to the broad appeal, 
accessibility and year round nature of destinations across the plan area . 
 Tourism proposals should be of the highest standard of design  and seek to protect and enhance the 
special character and interest of the desti nations  and the distinctiveness of the area with particular regard 
to sensitive landscapes and heritage assets.  
Where necessary, applications for new destinations  or the redevelopment or extension/intensification of 
destinations  will need to be subject to screening under the Habitats Regulations. Any destinations  which 
would result in significant adverse effects on European sites  which could not be appropriately mitigated 
will not be permitted. A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment will also be required where the 
destination  is in an area of landscape sensitivity in accordance with the Landscape policies.

and Heritage Coast  
6.16 The scenic beauty and special landscape qualities that j ustify the 155 square miles of designated Suffolk 
Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AON B) make a significant contribution to the 
attractiveness of the area to visitors. In this regard it is vitally important that the sensitive landscapes  of 
the AONB are conserved for the future success and public enjoyment of the area, as supported by nation al 
planning policy.  
6.17 The importance of conserving the Heritage Coast is also outlined in national planning policy. The Council 
recognises the wider ec onomic benefits that can be brought about through the conservation of the 
historic environment, bringing s ignificant benefit to local economies and communities.  
6.18 National planning policy is clear that major development in designated areas (such as the Suffo lk Coast and 
Heaths AONB and Heritage Coast) should be restricted except in exceptional circumstances and where it 
can be demonstrated that proposals are in the public interest.  
6.19 It is acknowledged in  the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB Management Plan of 201 8 that development of 
sustainable tourism and Heritage Coast conservation is vitally important to the succ ess of the tourism 
industry across the AONB. The value of the tourism economy to the AONB was nearly £200m in 2016 and 
supported over 4,000 jobs. The  AONB  Management Plan encourages  new tourism development in the 
AONB, provided it is inclusive, sustainable  and supports the conservation of the area.  
6.20 Tourism can take many forms but within the AONB, the Local Plan will only support  developments and 
propos als which are of a higher standard of design, that reduce the impact s on the environment, by where 
appropr iate, reusing existing buildings and which satisfy the primary purpose of designation, that is to 
conserve and enhance  the special qualities of the AONB. Opportunities for innovative contemporary 
design are welcomed in appropriate locations within the AONB. The success of the tourism industry and 
the conservation of the AONB are not mutually exclusive. In this regard a supportive tourism strategy must 
acknowledge the importance of the scenic beauty and special landscape qualities of the AONB and the 
benefits associated with collaboration and communication between tourism businesses, visitors, local 
communities, and the AONB Partnership.  
6.21 The Suffolk Coast  Tourism Strategy 2013 emphasises the need for continued uptake of the Community and 
Conservation Fund , operated by the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB Partnership, in aiding the 
conservation of the sensitive landscapes of the AONB through monetary contribut ions. In this regard, the 
Local Plan encourages businesses that benefit from the special character of the AONB for attracting 
visitors, to contribute financially to the Community and Conservation Fund.  
6.22 Sustainable tourism is strongly encouraged throughout the former Suffolk Coastal  area , and to a greater 
extent within the AONB and Heritage Coast. Sustainab le tourism is defined as tourism development that 
actively enables the wider environmental objectives of the AONB Partnership. These objectives, as stated  
in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB Management Plan, are as follows:   Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
123  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n  Special wildlife, landscape, s eascape and heritage qualities are conserved and meet the needs 
of people who live, work and visit the AONB;  
 Local communities are fully engaged in the ca re of the area;  
 A high -quality landscape and infrastructure exist to support sustainable access of the AONB as 
a whole.  
6.23 Extending opportunities for tourist activities that draw on and are consistent with, the conservation of 
their heritage features is enco uraged.

Management Unit in evolving development proposals, with the aim of delivering  development tha t takes 
an active role in the management of the local area.  
Tourism development in the AONB, or its setting and Heritage Coast will be supported where it:  
a) Enhances the long term sustainability of the area;  
b) Is of a scale and extent that does  not have a sign ificant adverse impact on the primary purpose of 
the AONB designation ; 
c) Is well related to existing settlements and / or supporting facilities;  
d) Avoids, prevents or mitigates for adverse impacts on the natural environment;  
e) Supports the conser vation and enhan cement of the natural beauty and special qualities of the 
AONB and its setting;  
f) Is of the highest design standards and where appropriate reuses existing buildings;  
g) Promotes innovative, contemporary design in appropriate locations;  
h) Minimises  light pollution from artificial light sources and ensures the retention of dark skies;  
i) Avoids locations sensitive to the exposed nature of the AONB and Heritage Coast; and  
j) Demonstrates sustainable aspects of the development during construction and through out the  life 
of the development. Renewable energy provision is strongly encouraged.  
 
Tourism Outside the AONB  
6.24 Outside of the AONB, the Council is welcoming of tourist enterprises and activities which can complement 
the tourism industry established in the ‘hotspo ts’ across the plan area . The areas outside of the AONB can 
play a key role in supporting and  facilitating the increase of destinations  and accommodation across  the 
plan area . 
6.25 The East Suffolk Business Plan and the East Suffolk Tourism Strategy both  support the focus of tourism 
across East Suffolk  and to establish strong links with neighbouring areas. Encouraging increased tourism 
opportunities in the less sensitive parts of the  plan area  will ensure that the overall tourism capacity is 
increased and  tourism spend increases across the  plan area  and throughout the year.  
6.26 Tourism development outside of the AONB should be directed to locations which are well related to the 
existing s ettlements and will need to demonstrate good connectivity with existing a menities, services and 
facilities, and promote walking and cycling opportunities where appropriate.  Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

New Tourist Accommodation  
6.27 Across the former Suffolk Coastal  area , tourist accommodation is provided in a variety of forms from large 
hotels, to small scale bed and breakfast establishments, to caravan and camping parks.  
6.28 The Local Plan supports tourism accommodation initiatives that enhance and broaden the choice of 
accommodation and visitor destination facilities, which promote year round tourism and longer stays. Th e 
town centres,  seafront resorts and market towns are priority locations for new  hotel development 
followed by other accessible locations within settlement boundaries.  
6.29 There is a broad range of self catering tourist accommodation available including camp sites, chalets, log 
cabins, caravan sites and glamping sites for all year round and seasonal uses. These sites provide a range of 
permanent and temporary buildings as well as differing in size and location and collectively create a rich 
and diverse choice of accommodation . It is important that the design of new accommodation  ensures t hat 
such developments do not conflict with the character of the landscape.   
6.30 Providing a diverse range of tourist accommodation across the plan area  is desirable and the Council is 
generally supportive of opportunities that come forward subject to complianc e with other policies in the 
Local Plan. Tourists visiting the area for shor t or longer periods of time have a positive impact on the 
viability of local shops and services and support the vitality of local and rural economies. The Local Plan 
recognises the  importance of maintaining vibrant and active local communities particularly  during off peak 
tourism months, as emphasised in the Local Plan consultation responses.   
6.31 National Planning Policy supports tourism opportunities in the rural areas which respect t he character of 
the area.  The rural parts of the  plan area  provide a valuabl e economic and social contribution through 
increased spend in the local area and the provision of jobs and associated employment as demonstrated in 
the Suffolk Coastal Economic Imp act of Tourism Report 2017. In order to promote the Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Tourism  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  126 reuse/redevelopment of e xisting buildings, the Council will be supportive of proposals which bring these 
back into use.  
6.32 In the interests of sustainable travel, proposals for new tourist accommodation wil l need to demonstrate 
good connectivity with tourist destinations, local ame nities and promote walking and cycling 
opportunities.  
6.33 The Local Plan seeks to provide a diverse range of accommodation to cater for the tourist demand. Tourist 
accommodation parti cularly that which is in permanent buildings can sometimes come under pressu re to 
be occupied for full time residential use. New tourism accommodation will be  restricted by planning 
conditions and/or legal agreements to ensure that these uses can provide a ll year -round occupation for 
tourists and are not occupied by a person or pe rsons as their main residence . Restricting  occupation of 
new self -catering tourist accommodation units to a continuous period of 56 days by one person or persons 
within one calenda r year  retains these units for the benefit of the tourism economy by providi ng a range 
of available accommodation for those wishing to visit the district . The owners/operators of the 
accommodation will be required to maintain an up -to-date Register of all lettings, which shall include the 
names and addresses of all those persons o ccupying the units during each individual letting. The Register 
will be required to be made available at all reasonable times to the Local Planning Authority.  
 Tourism  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
127  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP6.5: New Tourist Accommodation  
Proposals for new  tourist accommodation will be acceptable where:  
a) The demand or need for tourist accommodation is clearly demonstrated;  
b) They are of a high standard of design;  
c) They are of a scale appropriate to the nature of the site a nd its setting;  
d) They do not have a material adverse impact on the AONB  or its setting, Heritage Coast or 
estuaries;  
e) Covered cycle storage, proportionate to the size of the site is provided on site;  
f) The road network is able to accommodate the volume of traf fic generated without having a 
significant adverse impact on the free flow of traffic and highway safety;  
g) Ancillary facilities to support the tourist uses are provided on the site where required; and  
h) Flood adaptation and mitigation measures are included wh ere required.  
Tourist accommodation comprising permanent buildings wil l only be permitted :  
 
• Within the Settlement Boundaries ;  
• Through the conversion of  buildings of permanent structure  where they lie outside the Settlement 
Boundary ;  
• On medium and large scale  sites where commercial, recreational or entertainment facilities are 
provided on site ; or  
• Where such development forms part of a comprehensive masterplan which supports wider 
landscape and ecological gain . 
New  tourist accommodation will be restricte d by means of planning conditions or obligations  in 
accordance with national policy for planning conditions and obligations which permit holiday use only, 
restricted to a continuous period of 56 days by one person or persons within one calendar year,  plus 
require a register of all lettings, to be made available at all times.  
 
Protection of Existing Tourist Accommodation  
6.34 The existing stock of hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast businesses and self catering accommod ation 
provide an important role in supp ort of the plan area’s  economy. Council monitoring in 2018 shows that 
the former Suffolk Coastal  area  has over 4000 rooms providing over 7500 bedspaces for tourist 
accommodation.  
6.35 However, this diverse range of accommo dation can sometimes come under pressur e for conversion into 
residential properties, particularly in countryside settlements where new residential development is more 
strictly controlled. In recent times the rise of more flexible tourist accommodation prov ided through 
websites such as Airbnb ha s seen a more diverse range of accommodation being available which 
supplements the more established provision.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Tourism  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  128 6.36 The Local Plan recognises the importance of maintaining vibrant and active local communities particularly 
during off peak tourism months, as emph asised in the Local Plan consultation responses. A balance must 
be made between the need to provide permanent housing for local people and provide tourist 
accommodation to support the local economy. As such, regard wi ll be given, where the lack of demand f or 
tourist accommodation can be demonstrated, to the vitality of local communities throughout the year.  
6.37 The Local Plan therefore needs to set out an approach to protect existing tourist accommodation from 
conversion t o residential use where tourist use may  continue to be viable. The policy resists the change of 
use apart from exceptional cases where an identified lack of demand for tourist accommodation is clearly 
and satisfactorily demonstrated. As a minimum, planning  applications for a change of use will need to 
provide marketing evidence demonstrating the accommodation has been marketed for a sustained period 
in accordance with the requirements set out in the Commercial Property Marketing Guidance seen in 
Appendix E. 
Policy SCLP6.6: Existing Tourist Accom modation  
Existing tourist accommodation will be protected. Change of use will only be considered in exceptional 
circumstances where it can be fully and satisfactorily demonstrated that there is no current or future 
demand for the tourist accommodation.  
Marketing evidence must be provided which demonstrates the premises has been marketed for a

                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  130 7  Transport  
7.1 The Suffolk Coastal Local Plan area has a mixture of urban and rural settlements  with limited public 
transport opportunities in certain parts of the plan area which places  a heavy  reliance on the private motor 
car as a form of transport to conduct day -to-day business.  Many local roads are single track and unsuitable 
for conventional pu blic transport and the lack of alternatives increases the use of the private motor car 
across the plan area . For those residents and visitors close to a ran ge of facilities a bicycle may offer an 
alternative or additional transport option but this is limit ed. 
7.2 As a result of this, the Local Plan seeks to acknowledge that sustainable transport opportunities are limited 
and appropriate provision for vehicle park ing is required alongside developments and to maintain the 
viability and vibrancy of the area ’s town  centres, visitor locations and wider communities.  The Local Plan 
outlines strategic ambitions in respect of transport and highways infrastructure in Chapte rs 2 and 3.  
Policies in this chapter relate to local and site specific transport issues.  
7.3 The Council  has prepared a parking strategy and policies as part of Civil Parking Enforcement to be 
introduced across the District  in April 20 20. The Parking Plan deta ils the Council’s approach to parking 
management and enforcement, and the Local Plan helps to delive r the objectives through appropriate 
parking provision and sustainable transport as part of new developments.  
Sustainable Transport  
7.4 Many areas do not have a ccess to convenient public transport and many local roads are single track and 
unsuitable for conventional public transport  such as buses . This is reflected by the level of household 
vehicle ownership in the plan area  which amounts to 86% compared to a nat ional average of 74% (Census, 
2011). Furthermore, approximately 44% of people in the plan area  use a car as their primary mode of 
travel to work compared to a national average of 37% (Census, 2011).  
7.5 In order to mitigate the cumulative impacts of growth in  the Ipswich Strategic Planning Area on junctions 
and roads in and around Ipswich, and to prom ote healthy travel options, a package of transport measures 
has been identified to reduce vehicle movements. They include:  
 Transport infrastructure to encourage a nd support sustainable modes of transport  
 A Bus Quality Partnership  
 A Smarter Choices programme  
 Review of car parking and pricing strategies  
 Review of park and ride strategy  
 Junction improvements  
 
Sustainable transport measures will therefore be expected to promote and deliver modal shift in a manner 
consistent with local  strategies.  
 Transport  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
131  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 7.6 The Suffolk Local Transport Plan 2011 -2031 sets out priorit ies to support the growth of businesses, 
reducing demand for car travel, making efficient use of transport networks  and improving infrastructure. 
The County Council’s Rights of Way Im provement Plan compl ements  the Local Transport Plan by 
identifying changes that will secure an improved network, contributing to its four shared priorities of 
reducing congestion, accessib ility, air quality and safety. In consideration of this, Policy  SCLP 7.1 encourages 
and facilitates the use of sustainable transport options where possible, and supports the efficient use of 
existing transport networks.  
7.7 In designing and assessing developme nt proposals, the Public Rights of Way Network  should be considered 
as a means of encouraging physical activity, providing access to the  natural environment, supporting 
tourism, reducing travel by vehicular modes, reducing carbon  emissions and (where relev ant) aiding 
recreational avoidance of sensitive sites.  
7.8 Travel Plans are required by the National Planning Policy Framework for all new developments that create 
significant amounts of movement. The purpose of a Travel Plan is to set out measures to facilit ate 
sustainable forms of travel and reduce the use of the  private car. This will help to leave a lighter footprint 
on the environment by enhancing sustainability and will ultimately create better places to live  - an action 
of the Government’s 25 year Envir onment Plan. It is not necessarily the size of the develo pment that 
triggers the need for such a plan but more the nature of the use.  
7.9 The Council will work in partnership with Suffolk County Council as they draft new guidance for Travel 
Plans.  When publish ed the new guidance  will be considered by the Council and  adopted for use as a 
material planning consideration if appropriate.  
7.10 Travel planning can offer good practice for meeting the requirements set out in this policy for maximising 
sustainable transport  even on sites that do meet the thresholds for a full tra vel plan.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Sept ember 2020 | Transport

Development proposals should be designed from the outset to incorporate measures that will encourage 
people to travel using non -car modes to access hom e, school, employment, services and facilities.  
Development will be supported where:  
 
a) Any significant imp acts on the highways network are mitigated ; 
b) It is proportionate in scale to the existing transport network;  
c) All available opportunities to enable and s upport travel on foot, by cycle or public transport have 
been considered and taken;  
d) It is located close t o, and provides safe pedestrian and cycle access to services and facilities;  
e) It is well integrated into and enhances the existing cycle network includi ng the safe design and 
layout of new cycle routes and provision of covered, secure cycle parking;  
f) It is well integrated into, protects and enhances the existing pedestrian routes and the public 
rights of way network;  
g) It reduces conflict between users of t he transport network including pedestrians, cyclists, users of 
mobility vehicles and drivers and does not  reduce road safety; and 
h) The cumulative impact of new development will not create severe impacts on the existing 
transport network.  
Development will be  expected to contribute to the delivery of local sustainable transport strategies for 
managing the cumulative impacts of growth.  
Opportunities to improve provision of or access to public transport, in rural and urban areas will be 
supported.  
Proposals for new development that would have significant transport implications should be accompanied 
by a Travel Plan. A Travel Plan will be required for proposals for:  
 
i) New large scale employment sites;  
j) Residential development of 80 or more dwellings; and  
k) A developme nt that when considered cumulatively with other developments, is likely to ha ve a 
severe impact on the local community or road network.  
In consultation with the Highway Authority, the scale, location and nature of development will be 
considered in determin ing how the transport impacts of development should be assessed. As indicativ e 
thresholds a Transport Statement will be required for development of 50 -80 dwellings and a Transport 
Assessment and Travel Plan will be required for developments of over 80 dwe llings.  Non residential 
development will be considered on a case by case basi s dependent on the volume of movements 
anticipated with the use proposed.   
 Transport  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
133  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Vehicle Parking  
7.11 The reliance on the car as a primary form of transport in the plan area  necessitates the need for provision 
of adequate, reasonably priced car parking to maintain the viability and vibrancy of town and district  
centres, as well as resorts and other areas popular with tourists across the plan area . 
7.12 Transport and logistics form  a very signif icant part of the local economy. To support the specific needs of 
this sector, the Council will work with relevant organisations such as Highways England and Suffolk County 
Council to ensure that needs such as stopping places are provided.  Vehicle parking is an important tool for 
visitor management particularly in relation to tourism across the 
plan area . The provision of off -street visitor parking , (including 
multi storey)  particularly where it applies to tourism and town 
centres, will be s upported in appr opriate locations.   
7.13 Some people, either self employed, or as a condition of their 
employment, are required to take their work vehicle (such as a van 
or recovery vehicle) home with them. Modern vehicles tend to be 
bigger than the size of re sidential garage s and parking spaces 
which means that these are not always suitable or available for 
parking.  Where possible, the Council will encourage larger 
residential garages  and parking spaces  in new and renovated 
residential development to help addr ess this.  
7.14 Many modern vehicles are being manufactured with the aim of 
decreasing carbon emissions. This has led to the increase of low -
emission vehicles as a usable and reliable form of transport. 
Although the concept of low -emission vehicles has been pro moted 
and embrac ed in urban areas (such as town centre locations, supermarkets or places of work), rural areas 
have not seen a similar level of uptake. Notwithstanding this, the National Planning Policy Framework 
promotes the facilitation of low -emission v ehicles. Over th e plan period , it is anticipated that technological 
advances could lead to a wider uptake of such vehicles and the Council will support and encourage the 
facilitation of low -emission vehicles and their ancillary infrastructure needs, such a s: 
 Passive elect ric charging (capacity in the connection to the local electricity distribution network 
and electricity distribution board, as well as cabling to parking spaces).  
 Active electric charging (fully installed and ready -to-use charging points):  
o Rapid charging hu bs (22 -50kw charging power)  
o On-street electric charging (7kw charging power)  
o Off-street electric charging (3kw charging power)  
7.15 The level of charging supplied should reflect  the standards set out for electric vehicle charging in the 201 9 
Suffolk Guidance fo r Parking (or subsequent revisions) . However, higher levels of charging power will be 
supported, if considered appropriate and desirable. Technological advances  throughout the lifetime of the

points in developments.  
Parking Proposals and Standards  
7.16 The level of parking provision required can be influenced by the location of new development, accessibility 
to public transport, provision for cyclists and the ava ilability of public and on -street parking. The Local Plan 
recognises that improvements to pub lic transport can reduce the requirement for parking provision, and 
have a beneficial impact on ‘anti-social ’ parking, particularly with respect to commuter vehicl es. The Local 
Plan will therefore support all improvements in public transport and sustainabl e travel options that have a 
positive impact on existing problems of parking provision and congestion at key ‘pinch points ’. 
7.17 When considering proposals for parking , in order to reduce potential for surface water flooding and for the 
protection of water qua lity, sustainable drainage systems should be implemented (S uDS) with permeable 
surface materials48.  
7.18 As local highways authority, Suffolk County Council published the current ‘Suffolk Guida nce for Parking’ in 
2019 . The document provides details in respect of vehicle parking standards to be implemented across the 
county subject to local considerations. Residential standards in the County Council document are 
presented  as minimums and the Local Plan will seek to ensure appropriate parking does not proliferate  the 
parking issues faced by many communities. The visual impact of parking will be considered against relevant 
policies of this Local Plan including Policies SCLP 10.4 and SCLP 11.1. The parking standards contained in the 
Suffolk Guidance for Parking, and a ny subsequent revisions, should be considered as the principle starting 
point for development proposals involving parking. Development proposals involving parking t hat are 
unable to apply the guidance should provide evidence justifying why the guidance is not applicable to the 
proposal.  
 
 
48 Examples of such can be found in the CIRIA S uDS Manual which details examples of best practice in this rega rd. 
Transport  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
135  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP7.2: Parking Proposals and Standards  
The Council will work with partners to ensure that vehicle parking provision is pr otected and managed to 
support the economy and sustainable communities. The level of parking  provision required will depend on 
the location, type and intensity of use. Proposals that minimise congestion, encourage sustainable 
transport modes and reduce con flict between road users across the plan area  will be supported.  
Proposals involving vehicl e parking will be supported where  they take opportunities to make efficient use 
of land and  they include:  
a) The provision of safe, secure, and convenient off -street p arking of an appropriate size and 
quantity including addressing the need for parking or secure storage for cars, cycles and 
motorcycles, and where relevant, coaches and lorries;  
b) Opportunities to reduce the recognised problem of anti -social parking or poten tial problems that 
may arise which impacts the quality of life or vitality of an area for residents and visitors;  
c) Appropriate provision for vehicle charging points and ancillary infrastructure associated with the 
increased use of low emission vehicles; and  
d) The incorporation of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), permeable surfacing materials and 
means of protecting water quality in drainage schemes should be ensured.  
Where propos als involve public transport improvements or re -developments, the Council will  encourage 
the provision of Park & Ride facilities, if appropriate.  
Proposals will be expected to have regard to the parking standards contained in the Suffolk Guidance for 
Parki ng (including  subsequent revisions) , excluding the elements of the Guidance re lated  to ‘Residential 
Parking Design’ , unless other local planning considerations indicate otherwise. Proposals should also 
accord with both the East Suffolk Area Parking Plan an d the Suffolk Parking Management Strategy, or 
Neighbourhood Plans for the area  where applicable.

Area wide crite ria based policies  Community Facilities and Assets  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September  2020  
137  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 8  Community Facilities and 
Assets  
8.1 Community facilities and assets are an important part of the social fabric of neighbourhoods and 
communities. Facilities can include shops, post offices, public houses, medical facilities,  police facilities, 
sports venues, cultural buildings , places of worship  and places which promote social interaction and 
provide opportunities for meetings between people who might not otherwis e come into contact with each 
other . Individually and collectively  these provide places for people to meet and socialise as well as valuable 
services which encourages active communities and fosters a sense of identity and well -being for those who 
live in a nd visit the area.  
8.2 The National Planning Policy Framework reflects  the need to plan positively for and promote the retention 
and development of local services and facilities which is supported by the Council. Protecting community 
facilities and assets redu ces social exclusion which can be disproportionally influenced by limited access to 
facilities. The loss of facilities across the plan area  could lead to a significant number of residents being 
socially excluded and have a detrimental impact on community c ohesion and the creation of successful 
communities across the form er Suffolk Coastal  area . 
8.3 Large scale developments provide the opportunity to create places where communities can thrive through 
the provision of social, recreational, cultural and community facilities to meet the needs of residents and 
visitors.  Ensuring t hat community facilities and assets enable and support healthy lifestyles across the 
district is essential and will broaden the variety of provision for all.  
Protection of Communit y Facilities  
8.4 The Council considers it is important to retain community facil ities across the plan area  to both serve the 
local community and support tourism activities in the area.  
8.5 The Localism Act 2011 introduced ‘assets of community value’, providing com munity groups with the 
ability to nominate non -residential buildings or land  which is important to their community. Once an asset 
is listed, if the owner decides to sell, within five years of listing, they must inform the local authority of 
their intention  to do so.  The community has up to six weeks to express an interest in becom ing potential 
bidders to buy the asset. Once an expression of interest has been received, a further four and a half month 
pause in the sale process is triggered. This gives potenti al bidders a total of six months to raise the funds 
required to purchase the  asset. At the end of the period, the owner may sell the asset to whomever and at 
whatever price they choose. However, the listing of an asset does not provide protection against a  change 
of use or redevelopment. This can mean the value of the asset is gre ater due to its potential to be 
converted to non -community uses. This can frustrate the ability of the community to raise sufficient funds 
to purchase the asset.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Community Facilities and Assets  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  138 8.6 The Local Plan also has a role to provide protection to community facilities which have not be en identified 
as assets of community value. These facilities are still important to the local community and help enhance 
the level of services across the plan are a. Consultation responses have highlighted that there is strong 
support for investigating all potential options before the redevelopment for a non -community use is 
allowed. The consultation responses also highlighted that the rural areas of the plan area  lack adequate 
facilities which places a greater emphasis on the facilities in the market towns and larger villages in the 
area.  
8.7 However, there is a need for flexibility to allow the change of use or redevelopment in certain 
circumstances such as lack of com munity need, lack of viability or re -provision of the building in an equally 
or more accessibl e location. In demonstrating that there is no community need for the facility or an 
alternative community use, evidence should be submitted with a planning applic ation which provides 
details of consultation with the local community and an analysis of servi ce provision in the locality which 
demonstrates that accessibility to similar services and facilities will not be adversely affected. Evidence will 
need to demons trate that the premises have been marketed in a manner agreed with the Council for at 
least 12  months for the current use or alternative community facility in line with the requirements of the 
Commercial Property and Marketing Guidance as detailed in Appen dix E. 
8.8 The Government periodically amend the General Permitted Development Order which in some  
circumstances allows some changes of use to take place without the need for planning permission.  
 Community Facilities and Assets  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September  2020  
139  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP8.1: Community Facilities and Assets  
Proposals for n ew community facilities and assets will be supported if the proposal meets the needs of the 
local community, is of a proportionate scale, well related to the settlement which it serves and would not 
adversely affect existing facilities that are easily acce ssible and available to the local community.  
Proposals to change the use, or redevelop for a n on-community use, a facility registered as an asset of 
community value, will not be permitted.  
Proposals to change the use, or redevelop for a different use, a co mmunity facility which is not registered 
as an asset of community value, will only be permitte d if: 
a) It can be demonstrated that there is no community need for the facility and the building or the 
site is not needed for an alternative community use;  
b) It can be demonstrated that the current, or alternative community uses are not viable and 
marketing e vidence is provided which demonstrates the premises have been marketed for a 
sustained period of 12 months in accordance with the Commercial Property Marketing Gu idance;  
Or 
c) Development would involve the provision of an equivalent or better replacement com munity 
facility either on site or in an alternative location in the vicinity that is well integrated into the 
community and has equal or better accessibility than  the existing facility which meets the needs of 
the local population.  
 
Open Space and Recreat ional Facilities  
8.9 The open space and recreational facilities  and the continued management 
of these areas  across the plan area  are vital for the promotion of healthy 
communities and active lifestyles for all as well as mitigating the impact of 
development, and has been emphasised by consultation responses.  Open 
space  which is accessible  can be provided through formal facilities s uch as 
playing pitches and courts, but also through informal spaces such as 
village greens, woodlands, beaches, and public rights o f way which 
collectively contribute to healthy communities and active lifestyles.  Open 
space such as countryside which provid es a visual sense of openness is not 
included within this policy as normally those areas are not publically 
accessible, other than on public rights of way.   
8.10 Ensuring the appropriate provision and retention of a wide variety of 
accessible open spaces and re creational facilities is an important role for 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Community Facilities and Assets  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  140 the Local Plan, and providing access to these areas is important for people’s mental  and physical well -
being. Open spaces also have a role in helping to support habitat creation, enhancement of biodiversity 
networks, the aesthetic quality of the public realm and built environment and to manage surface water; 
improving water quality; enabl ing conservation/reuse and supporting the mitigation of flood risk . 
8.11 East Suffolk is committed to improving the health and wel l-being of people in the plan area  and published 
a Leisure Strategy in 2014. The Leisure Strategy and the supporting assessments49 identify existing 
provision of open space and recreational facilities across the plan area  and identify areas of deficiencies.  
8.12 The Council supports the provision of open space and recreational facilities (or expansion of existing 
facilities) across the plan area  to encourage active lifestyles and community well -being and this should be 
delivered alongside new development. The National Planning Policy Framework acknowledges the need 
for open space and recreational facilities and how these contribute to soci al interaction and the creation of 
healthy, inclusive communities. National standards recommended by Fields in Trust promotes a 
requirement for 2.4 hectares of open space (play areas and playing fields) per 1,000 people which enables 
residents of all ages to participate in sport and play. East Suffolk uses this calculation as a standard and this 
is to be continued over this plan period when considering applications for new open space and 
recreational facilities  apart from when local evidence and provision d emonstrates the need for an 
alternative approach . 
8.13 Given the age structure of the  plan area , proposals which support more specific provision for recreational 
facilities which are designed to meet the needs of the ageing population will be encouraged alongsi de 
those targeted at the wider community.  
8.14 As well as the provision of open space and recreational facilities over the plan period, the Local Plan also 
seeks to protect these spaces from redevelopment unless exceptional circumstances can be 
demonstrated. Th is has been strongly encouraged throughout consultation responses regarding the 
provision and protection of new and existing community facilities.  
8.15 To demonstrate whether an open space proposed for development is surplus to requirements, applicants 
are expe cted to undertake an open space needs assessment. This should follow the approach taken in the 
Suffolk Coastal Open Space Needs Assessment and consider the provision of open space with the same use 
within the site catchment area, alternative open space use s and how the site relates to existing provision 
for each respective type of open space use in the locality. The contribution an open space makes towards 
local amenity, public realm, biodiversity and the wider green infrastructure network should be conside red 
as part of an open space needs assessment.  
8.16 The National Planning Policy Framework allows local communities through Local Plans and Neighbourhood 
Plans to identify green areas of particular importance to them for special protection. By designating land as 
Local Green Space local communities are able to rule out new development other than in very special

evidence to designate Local Green Spaces across the plan area  in the Local Plan but local communities can 
consider designating areas important to them in Neighbourhood Plans.

The Council supports the provision of open space and recreational facilities and their continued 
managemen t across the plan area . Primarily to encourage active lifestyles and to increase participation in 
formal and informal recreation for all sectors of th e community, and also to support the biodiversity, 
promote effective water management and to enhance the p ublic realm. New residential development will 
be expected  to contribute to the provision of open space and recreational facilities in order to benefit  
community health, well -being and green infrastructure . 
There will be a presumption against any developmen t that involves the loss of open space or community 
sport and recreation facilities.  
Proposals for development that results in the loss of open spaces  will only be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances where:  
a) The proposal is ancillary to the open nature o f the area and will enhance local character, increase 
local amenity and be of greater community or wildlife benefit ; 
b) An open space assessment demonstr ates the site is surplus to requirements including its ability to 
be used for alternative open space uses;   
Or 
c) The loss resulting from the proposed development will be replaced by equivalent or better 
provision  in terms of quantity, quality and in a  suitab le location . 
Neighbourhood Plans may identify areas of Local Green Space and include policies relating to their 
protection.  
 
Allotments  
8.17 Allotments are valuable community spaces that provide people with 
the opportunity to enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle and benefit the 
quality of life of residents across the plan area . They  provide 
opportunities for foo d production, exercise and commu nity interaction 
as well as being valuable green spaces which provide habitats for many 
forms of wildlife alongside the built environment.  
8.18 The Council have transferred ownership of land used as allotments to 
Town or Parish Councils with a legal requiremen t that these are 
retained for use as allotments as statutory allotment land.  The 
statutory designation requires these to be retained for use as 
allotments.  Allotments are also provided by community groups and 
Community Facilities and Assets  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September  2020  
143  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n private landown ers but in respect of the Local Plan the land use and community benefit are treated 
equally.  Across the plan area , many settlements benefit from the provision of allotments, although some 
settlements do not have the same provision.  
8.19 Proposals for new allotm ents will be preferred alongside  residential allocations , masterplans for the 
Garden Neighbourhoods  or through Neighbourhood Plans which emerge over the plan period.  Alongside 
the provision of the land for allotments, it is also necessary to ensure that in frastructure associated with 
this community facility is provided, such as vehicle parking and water supply.  
Policy SCLP8.3: Allotments  
The Council will encourage the provision of new allotments in order to meet a locally identified demand. 
Allotments and a ssociated infrastructure should be located in locations well related to the existing 
community.  
The loss of existing allotments to alternative uses will be resisted unless:  
a) Evidence shows that there is unlikely to be any future demand for the allotments;  
b) Other allotments exist and have the necessary capacity to meet demand; or 
c) Alternative provision is made on an alternative site within the settlement which ensures an 
increase in the overall level and standard of allotments across the plan area .  
 
Digital Infrastructure  
8.20 Advanced, high quality and reliable digital infrastructure is essential for modern  life in respect of improved 
economic development and well -being across the plan area . With more facilities being accessed on -line 
(such as personal banking an d shopping  as well as to access educational and health services ) the need for 
modern digital infrastructure including mobile and broadband services which are reliable and meet the 
demands of both residents and businesses is fundamental to sustaining local communities.  
8.21 Across the plan area  there is a deficit in reliable and high quality digital infrastructure.  Currently demands 
for mobile phone services and broadband are increasing, and across the former Suffolk Coastal  area  there 
is a variety of provision wi th some rural areas experiencing poor service and signal.  National programmes 
supported by the Government are continually being expanded and updated across the plan area . These 
are expected to continue and increase provis ion over the plan period as digital  technology evolves.  
8.22 The East Suffolk Business Plan demonstrates that the Council is committed to supporting the improved 
delivery of telecommunications across East Suffolk . The Council’s Enabling Broadband Programme 
comp lements the improvements undertaken  by service providers across the plan area . Improving the 
telecommunications across the plan area  has the potential to boost the local economy as well , boosting 
community well -being and transforming the lives of local res idents  through improving access to services .  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Community Facilities and Assets

country.  In Suffolk, service providers are working with Government agencies, New Anglia Local Enterprise 
Partner ship and Suffolk County Council to improve provision across the  plan area . Technology and 
infrastructure to support network expansion for the next generation of communications is being  trialled in 
pilot areas nationwide and will provide better coverage in a more concentrated area. Although widespread 
rollout of the next generation  network is not expected in the immediate future, developments that come 
about in the future should be cognisant of this.  
8.24 The Council as local planning authority has a role to pla y in supporting the provision of di gital 
infrastructure through the consideration of equipment such as masts to improve the overall network.  The 
location and setting of equipment associated with digital infrastructure will need to balance the technical 
requirements of providing the services  against the design and location of such facilities.  
8.25 Across the plan area  a number of sensitive locations and landscapes are identified and designated.  Within 
these areas the Local Plan requires sympathetic design standards to be achieved and this principa l will also 
apply to the provision of digital infrastructure.  For the purposes of this policy, sensitive locations include 
the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage Coast, Conservation Areas, Listed Building s, Scheduled 
Monuments, Historic Parklands  or features identified in the Landscape Character and Sensitivity Study.  
Policy SCLP8.4: Digital Infrastructure  
Proposals to improve the provision of digital infrastructure across the plan area  will be supported, 
provided:  
a) The siting and external appearan ce of all equipment does not have a significant detrimental 
impact on the surrounding area and is sympathetically located while respecting the operational 
needs of the digital infrastructure net work;  
b) Equipment installed on buildings is sited and designed to minimise the impact on the external 
appearance of the building; and  
c) Applications are supported by evidence which demonstrates early engagement with relevant 
digital infrastructure providers a nd the need for the equipment to be located within that area.

                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  146 9  Climate Change  
9.1 The National Planning Policy Framework sets out strong measures to address climate change as well as 
encouraging local planning authorities to set target contributions and promote the uptake of decentralised 
renewable or low -carbon energy in developments. Transitioning to a low carbon future, encouraging the 
reuse of existing resources (including conversion of existing buildings), and encouraging the use of 
renewable resources are measures which are promoted by the National Plan ning Policy Framework. The 
Government’s recently published 25 year Environment Plan outlines a broader commitment to reduce 
emissions from 1990 levels by 80% by 2050. The Council will aim to contribute to this wider national 
commitment to address climate c hange.   
Renewable Energy   
9.2 East Suffolk is part of the Norfolk & Suffolk Energy Coast which is part of the wider East of England Energy 
Zone. The New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership  intend s to maximise the energy opportunities in this 
area.  This is an i ntention that the Council will endeavour to support, where possible.  The former Suffolk 
Coastal area can contribute towards the generation of renewable energy, most notably through biomass 
and anaerobic digestion schemes , solar panel schemes  and wind power , including turbines and land ing 
points to serve off -shore provision.  Proposals relating to offshore wind should also take account of 
relevant policies  and guidance in  the East Marine Plan . 
9.3 The National Planning Policy Framework promotes and encourages sch emes that utilise renewable energy 
resources. This should be in tandem with energy efficiency measures, particularly in any new 
development , and should be consistent with the need to safeguard residential amenity, the environment 
and the landscape.  
9.4 Nation al planning policy  states that Local Plans should consider identifying suitable areas for renewable 
and low carbon energy development. Local planning authorities should also support community -led 
initiatives for renewable and low carbon energy taken forwar d through Neighbou rhood Planning. The 
Government have stated that wind farm developments should only be granted planning permission if the 
site is identified as a ‘suitable area ’ and the proposal has the backing of the local community.  The level of 
local c ommunity support f or low carbon and renewable e nergy proposals will be evalua ted in terms of 
engagement related to planning applications  and through the neighbourhood planning processes  where 
applicable . 
9.5 Proposals for wind energy and energy from biomass or  waste of more tha n 50MW installed capacity are 
defined as nationally significant infrastructure projects and are determined by the Secretary of State. 
Policy relating to such proposals is contained in the National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy 
Infrastructure. Propo sals for energy from waste schemes of less than 50MW will be determined by Suffolk 
County Council as Waste Planning Authority and policy for such schemes is currently contained in the 
Suffolk County Council Waste Core Strategy (2011).  Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
147  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 9.6 Biomass and anaerobi c digestion schemes  can provide an important contribution to energy generation, in 
particular in areas not served by the national gas grid.  However, there also exists the potential for such 
schemes to effect air quality. In this respect,  proposals for ener gy generation from biomass will be 
supported in principle but particular consideration will be given to air quality impacts, transport impacts, 
proposals for associated buildings and, where relevant, grid connections.  
9.7 Solar panel develop ments can range in  scale from installations on individual buildings to solar farms, and 
can range in type, from in -built solar panels to mounted solar panels. Solar panel schemes will generally be 
supported,  particularly in new development . Careful conside ration will be giv en to the visual impact in 
sensitive locations including through design, siting and, where possible, natural screening.   
9.8 In respect of wind power, much of East Suffolk’s  environment is a sensitive one and needs protection. 
Given the natio nal and local reco gnition of the need to transition to a low carbon future, the option of 
resisting wind power generation entirely is not appropriate. The Local Plan will encourage onshore wind 
within the mix of the generation of renewable energy, most not ably to serve loca l communities. Although 
generally encouraged, proposals will need to ensure they do not adversely affect the high quality 
landscape, natural beauty and special qualities of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB , wildlife populations 
or habita ts and avoid noise  pollution across the former Suffolk Coastal District .  
9.9 Reflecting the policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, applicants for wind energy development  
of one or more turbines  will be expected to demonstrate how the local communit y has been involve d in 
developing proposals and that the submitted scheme has the support of the local community. Where 
Neighbourhood Plans are produced, the opportunity exists to obtain local community support in the 
identification of suitable areas for r enewable energy as  part of the Neighbourhood Plan process. The 
Council aims to undertake a Supplementary Planning Document related to low carbon and renewable 
energy development, following completion of this Local Plan, to support this process.  
9.10 Due to the potential for impa cts on the landscape, the Suffolk Coastal Landscape Character Assessment  
(2018 ) and Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018) , and any subsequent iteration s, should be consulted 
when evaluating the landscape and visual impact of low carbon  and renewable ene rgy development. The 
cumulative impact of energy proposals could have potentially significant impacts on the East Suffolk 
countryside and the Council will be working closely with Government and other agencies  to ensure issues 
related to t he National Grid are considered comprehensively and not incrementally.  
9.11 As not all renewable and low carbon energy installations require planning permission it is not always 
possible to monitor renewable energy capacity accurat ely. Therefore, actual install ed capacity is likely to 
be higher than reported in the Authority Monitoring Reports.

                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  148 Policy SCLP9.1: Low Carbon & Renewable Energy  
The Council will sup port Neighbourhood Plans in identifying suitable areas for renewable an d low carbon 
energy developmen t, particularly where they relate to developments that are community -led. In 
identifying suitable areas, consideration should be given to the criteria listed below:  
a) They can evidence a sustainable and, ideally, local source of fuel;  
b) They can facilitate t he necessary infrastructure and power connections required for functional 
purposes;  and 
c) They are complementary to  the existing environment without causing any signifi cant adverse 
impacts, particularly relating to the residential amenity, landscape and visu al impact, the natural 
beauty and special qualities of the AONB, transport, flora and fauna, noise and air quality, unless 
those impacts can be appropriately mitigate d. 
The Council will support low carbon and renewable energy developments, with the excepti on of wind 
energy schemes, where they are within an area identified as suitable for renewable or low carbon energy 
or satisfy the above criteria.  Wind energy schemes must be located in an area identified as suitable for 
renewable or low carbon energy in a Neighbourhood Plan.  
When the technology is no longer operational there is a requirement to decommission, remove the facility 
and complete a restoration of the site to  its original condition.  
 
Sustainable Construction  
9.12 Buildings are no longer viewed as prod ucts of construction and engineering, but as products of place -
making and design that reflect the environment in which they  are situated. This is proven by the fact that 
sustainable construction does not solely relate to the physical structure of a buildin g, it also relates to  
other aspects such as transport, waste and water management and in some cases, ecological value. 
Theref ore, comprehensive sustainable construction that appropriately incapsulates the values of 
sustainability will be strongly supported  by the Council. This will help to achieve the concept of 
‘environmental net gain’ promoted in the Government’s 25 year Envir onment Plan. Sustainable 
construction methods can also help to reduce the running costs of housing, helping to contribute towards 
objectives of improving the affordability of housing.  
9.13 Sustainable construction methods , water efficiency standards  and the ene rgy consumption of buildings are 
largely controlled by Building Regulations. However, the Council is still able to require lower en ergy and 
water usage in new developments.   
9.14 From October 2015, local planning authorities can require higher ‘optional’ Buildi ng Regulations standards 
to be met. For water efficiency the Government has introduced an optional technical standard that 
requires  new housing to go further than Building Regulations and be designed to consume 110  
litres/person/day, as opposed to 125 litr es/person/day.  The Environment Agency  have identified East Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
149  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Anglia as an area of ‘ serious  water stress’ and the Anglian Water Resour ces Management Plan (2015) 
identifies lowering demand as one way in which this can be addressed.  Requiring the optional stand ard to 
be met will contribute towards lowering demand for water use.  
9.15 In the interests of mitigating climate change and to help achi eve the objectives of the Suffolk Climate 
Action Plan, the Council will also implement higher energy efficiency standards and  will expect all new 
developments of more than 10 dwellings to achieve a 20% improvement in C02 emissions performance 
above the Tar get Emission Rate of the 2013 Edition of the 2010 Building Regulations.  Coastal development 
proposals should also take accoun t of Policy  CC2 of the East Marine Plan  when minimising emissions.  
Higher energy efficiency standards need not be met if they amoun t to maladaptation, for example, 
designing buildings to maximise solar gain in winter without addressing  the implications for  overheating in 
summer.  
9.16 For all non -residential development, the Council will expect compliance with BREEAM standards. BREEAM 
is a tool that allows the owners, users and designers of buildings to review and improve environmental 
performance throughout the life of a building. The Council expects all non -residential development to 
comply with these standards, as detailed in Policy SCLP9 .2, to mitigate further against climate change.  
9.17 Improved energy efficiency and a reduction in CO2 emissions in buildings can be achieved through various 
means including orientation, siting, photovoltaics  and heat pumps. The Council supports viable and 
perm issible methods of improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions in buildings.  
9.18 The Council is mindful that local sus tainable construction requirements lead to increased costs and may 
impact upon development viability (in this context  defined  as wh at is practical and affordable). On this 
basis and in exceptional circumstances where the additional costs attributed to achi eving  sustainable 
construction standards  represent the overriding factor in preventing the site from being delivered , the 
Council w ill be prepared to consider detailed information on the viability of a particular scheme, where 
justified, to alter the susta inable construction requirement s. The viability information must be compiled in 
line with viability guidance contained in Appendi x G. 
9.19 In order to allow for higher energy efficiency standards to be achieved, a meaningful proportion of the 
energy consumed by  new builds or conversions should be provided from an on -site renewable source. The 
meaningful proportion should be considered on a  case -by-case basis. Locally sourced, reused and recycled 
materials should also be used in the construction of new builds or conversions, where practicable. Where 
possible, circularity should be considered – that is the materials used in construction and t he ability to 
deconstruct and reuse post use.  Waste arising from construction itself  should be minimised, where 
possible . 
9.20 Major developments in particular, will have greater opportunities to incorporate high build standards due 
to economies of scale. Provi sion should also be made for ‘environmental net gain’ from new or conversion 
development, including infrastructure developmen ts. Considering the fact that the principle of 
‘environmental net gain’ is strongly promoted in the Government’s 25 year Environmen tal Plan, this 
should be considered an imperative provision in new or conversion development, including infrastructure 
develo pments.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Climate Change  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  150 9.21 In recognition of the potential for conflicts between achieving sustainable methods of construction and 
conserving and enh ancing the historic environment, Historic England’s guidance relating to the application 
of the Building Regulations should b e consulted when evaluating the energy efficiency of historic and 
traditionally constructed buildings.  
9.22 As evidence of sustainable c onstruction compliance for all new dwellings, the Council will require the 
submission of a n interim compliance report prior t o development commencement. A final compliance  
report  will be required to be submitted upon development completion. This should be compiled in line 
with advice provided in the Building Regulations.  
9.23 In order to demonstrate compliance with BREEAM standards, developers will be required to submit Design 
Stage Assessments and Post Construction Reviews, carried out by a qualified BREEAM ass essor (as 
appropriate), for all planning applications for qualifying development.  
Policy SCLP9.2: Sustainable Construction  
All new developments of more than 10 dwellings should achieve higher energy efficiency standards that 
result in a 20% reduction in C O2 emissions below the Target CO2 Emission Rate (TER) set out in the 
Building Regulations. Exceptions should only apply wher e they are expressed in the Building Regulations or 
where applicants can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Council, that it is  not viable or feasible to 
meet the standards.  
All new residential development in the plan area should achieve the optional technical standard in terms 
of water efficiency of 110 litres/person/day.  The use of locally sourced, reused and recycled materials,  
along with on -site renewable energy generation are encouraged in order to achieve environmental net 
gain in new build or co nversion developments. Development proposals are also encouraged to set out 
measures for minimising waste arising from the construct ion process.  
All new non -residential developments of equal or greater than 1,000sqm gross floorspace are required to 
achieve  the British Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method ‘Very Good’ standard or 
equivalent unless it can be demonstrated  that it is not viable or feasible to do so.  
Proposals should improve the  efficiency of heating, cooling and lighting of bui ldings by maximising daylight 
and passive solar gain through the orientation of buildings.  
 
Coastal Management  policies  
9.24 The coastal  zone is a distinct part of the former Suffolk Coastal District  containing a diverse range of 
interests such as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, internationally and nationally important 
environmental areas, tourism destinations, Sizewell nuclear power plants,  offshore wind infrastructure, 
Felixstowe Port , the larg est container port in the UK, and some of the most productive arable land in the Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
151  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n UK; playing a vital role in creating  area -wide  economic growth and tourism opportunities. However, this 
diverse and dynamic coast has the ever present threat of both coastal e rosion and coastal flooding.  
9.25 The Suffolk coast is known to be one of the fastest eroding areas in Europe and is vulnerable to major 
storm surges. These factors make it necessary to actively man age the coastal zone to ensure it is resilient50 
in the face of  coastal change, by incorporating the holistic principles of Integrated Coastal Zone 
Management into coastal policies. In this respect, the Council will work closely with coastal communities 
and other Risk Management Authorities such as the Environment Age ncy, the Marine Management 
Organisation, and Natural England. The Council also recognises the importance of partnership working and 
will continue to work with coastal and estuary partnerships go ing forward.  
Coastal Change Management  
9.26 Land affected by physic al change to the shoreline through coastal erosion, coastal landslip  or permanent 
inundation is defined in the National Planning Policy Framework as a Coastal Change Management Area.  
The boundar ies are based on coastal erosion estimates and assumptions, wi th information taken from the 
current Shoreline Management Plans. The Shoreline Management Plans are integral to the formulation of 
planning policy and act as the primary evidence base for the p olicy in this area. Shoreline Management 
Plans reflect the lon g term intent of management towards coastal change in the form of epochs or time 
periods up to 2025, 2055 and 2105.  
9.27 The current Shoreline Management Plan for the Suffolk coast was prepared betw een 2007 and 2010.  
However , it is recognised by all Risk Manag ement Authorities that there is a need to regularly review and 
update key information within the Shoreline Management Plan on erosion and flood risk. The approach to 
defence management may chang e, which  may change the delineation of the Coastal Change Mana gement 
Areas. This policy afford s a level of flexibility to allow for consideration of changes in the evidence base 
over the plan period. To help inform responses to coastal management proposals  on the Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty, specialist advice  is available and should be consulted.  
9.28 Infrastructure such as access roads and pipelines need s to be fully considered when delineating Coastal 
Change Management Areas. This can lead to propertie s that are not within a Coastal Change Management 
Area becoming inaccessible when an access road, for example, is lost to coastal erosion. It is the aim of the 
Council, going forward, to fully consider the existing infrastructure and topography of an area when 
delineating a Coastal Change Management Area and evaluating sites for rollback.  
9.29 National planning guidance suggests that new permanent residential stru ctures are not permitted in a 
Coastal Change Management Area. Therefore, the Council will continue t o implement this policy.  
9.30 Although Coastal Change Management Areas exist to highlight where rates of shoreline change are 
significant over the next 100 years  and new residential development is generally avoided in these areas, 
there are some cases where dev elopment exceptions are permitted. Temporary or seasonal developments 
 
50 Resilience accepts, and as a result works with, rather than against, natural processes.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Climate Change  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  152 or extensions to properties are often considered as exceptions, subject to certain ass essments. The 
Council will aim to facilitate appropriate development in the Coastal Change Managemen t Area and to 
divert inappropriate development away from the Coastal Change Management Area. Policy SCLP9.3 details 
development considered appropriate in th e Coastal Change Management Area.  
9.31 Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessments are the primary means of  assessing the coastal erosion impacts 
of proposed developments in and within a specified distance landward of the Coastal Change 
Management Area. The Coast al Erosion Vulnerability Assessment should consider the management 
proposals for the coastline and t he likelihood of investments being made and the risk of erosion impacting 
upon the development in light of these factors. The assessment should be undertake n by the developer to 
demonstrate that the development will not be at risk from coastal change for t he lifetime of the 
development  or at risk as a result of the expected life of relevant coastal defence . In this regard, the 
assessment should comply with po licy CC1 of the East Inshore and Offshore Marine Plans. The assessment 
will also need to demonstrate  that the proposed development will not increase the risk of erosion (e.g. 
from surface water run -off). It is considered essential to liaise with the Counci l’s Coastal Management 
team in carrying out this assessment.  
9.32 There currently exists a 30 metre  risk zone landward of areas identified as Coastal Change Management 
Areas in order to ensure that developments take account of the coastal erosion risk in the general vicinity. 
Added to this, the Council will implement a 30 metre risk zone landward of are as wh ere the intent of 
management is to Hold the Line (HTL) and where, consequently, no Coastal Change Management Area has 
been identified. This is to ensure that access to coastal defences is not inhibited by new and/or 
replacement development. However, t his m easure should not be used in such a manner that precludes 
development from coming forward.  
9.33 Where known geological information demonstrates that soft cliffs51 located behind coastal defences are 
likely to adversely affect the capacity of said defences , a Co astal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment should 
be considered. As a starting point, development up to 60 metres landward of coastal defences should 
consult the Council’s Coastal Management team as to whether or not a Coastal Erosion Vulnerability 
Asses sment is required. This will allow for greater consideration of both coastal erosion and the threat of 
soil degradation when considering proposed developments in defended areas.  
9.34 The National Planning Policy Framework requires the delineation of the Coastal  Chang e Management Area 
to be informed by, amongst many other things, Estuary Plans. It is the intention of the Council to expand 
the boundary and principles of Coastal Change Management Areas to the estuaries of the plan area  in 
order to fully address coa stal c hange along the Suffolk coastline which, by law , extends to the  mean low 
water mark in the estuaries. This will involve consideration of both the Deben and Alde & Ore Estuary 
 
51 Soft cliffs are formed in less resistant rocks such as shales or in unconsolidated materials such as boulder clay; being unstable they often 
form less steep slopes and are therefore more easily colonised by vegetation. Soft cliffs are subject to frequent slumping and land slips, 
particularly where water percolates into the rock and reduces its effective shear strength  (JNCC, UK Biodiversity Action  Plan Priority Habitat 
Descriptions, 2016) . Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
153  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Plans and will be undertaken as part of any review to the Shoreline Managem ent Pl an which ultimately 
identifies the Coastal Change Management Areas.  
9.35 Coastal Squeeze is the term used to describe habitats on the coast that are ‘squeezed’ between man -made 
barriers, such as river walls, sea walls and farmland, and an eroding coast. I n a na tural system, areas of 
saltmarsh or shingle ‘move’ inland as sea levels rise, and the animals and plants that depend on them 
migrate with the habitat.  
9.36 Realignment is one answer to the problems caused by coastal squeeze because it gives the coast room  to 
evolve. This can be done in both a managed and unmanaged way. An example of this being the 
construction of walls inland of historic defences to protect land and property behind them, while in front, 
natural processes take over and saltmarsh, for exampl e, is allowed to develop. Innovative approaches such 
as this that are in keeping with the natural processes of the coastline will be supported, where 
appropriate, by the Council.

The Coastal Change Manage ment A rea is identified on the Policies Map. Reputable and scientifically robust 
evidence that emerges over the lifetime of this plan which effects the delineation of the Coastal Change 
Management Area should be considered when applying this policy.  
Planni ng app lications for all development within and 30 metres landward of the Coastal Change 
Management Area and within and 30 metres landward of areas where the intent of management is to 
Hold the Line, identified on the Policies Map must be accompanied by a C oastal  Erosion Vulnerability 
Assessment.  
In areas of soft cliff located up to 60 metres landward of coastal defences where known geological 
information indicates that the capacity of coastal defences are likely to be adversely affected by 
development, a Co astal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment should be considered.  
In parts of the Coastal Change Management Area expected to be at risk from change within a 20 year time 
horizon, only temporary development directly related to the coast, for example beach huts,  cafes , car 
parks and sites used for touring caravan and camping will be permitted.  
In parts of the Coastal Change Management Area expected to be at risk from change beyond a 20 year 
time horizon, other commercial and community uses will be permitted provi ding t hey require a coastal 
location and provide economic and social benefits to the local community.  
Proposals for new or replacement coastal defence schemes will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that the works reflect  the management approach for the frontage presented in the relevant 
Shoreline Management Plan and/or endorsed Coastal Strategy, and there will be no material adverse 
impact on the environment, including exacerbation of coastal squeeze.  
Proposals for new or  replacement estuary defence  schemes will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that the works reflect the management approach for the frontage presented in the 
endorsed estuary plans/strategies, and there will be no material adverse impact on the  environment, 
including exac erbation of coastal squeeze.  
Essential infrastructure, including transport infrastructure, utility infrastructure and wind turbines will only 
be permitted in the Coastal Change Management Area where no other sites outside of the  Area are 
feasible and there  is a management plan in place to manage the impact of coastal change including their 
future removal and replacement.  
Planning permission for all development within the Coastal Change Management Area will be time -limited 
accord ing to the risk identified i n the Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment.  
 Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
155  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Adapting to a Changing Coast  
9.37 The Council recognises that the coast will change and there are both properties and infrastructure at risk. 
Coastal adaptation  is generally considered as a response to coastal c hange, and can be defined as ‘making 
changes to prepare for and negate the  effects of climate change, thereby reducing the vulnerability of 
communities and ecosystems. By adapting to cope with the effects of climate change, communities, 
enterprises and ins titutions can build up their climate change  resilience ’ (Action  on Climate  Toda y).  
9.38 This approach is being pursued in coastal locations worldwide, and it is through the initiative of both 
coastal stakeholders and communities that the Council aims to achiev e effective coastal a daptation in 
Suffolk.  
9.39 Facilitating coastal relocation52 or rollback53 has been one of the main approaches undertaken to 
implement coastal adaptation in the East Suffolk area in recent years. The Council will continue with the 
exception policy of facilitating rollback or relocation for sites under threat from c oastal erosion which 
demonstrates that  the Council  is able and willing to adapt to coastal change. In doing so, the Council will 
aspire to long term thinking in affecting this appro ach in order to properly and effectively prepare for 
coastal adaptation, an d to allow communities to thrive in their coastal locations.  
What is Currently Anticipated to be at Risk?  
9.40 Suffolk has some of the fastest eroding coastline in Europe. Over the next  20 to 100 years there is the 
potential for properties, agricultural land a nd conservation land in some of our more vulnerable areas to 
be considered ‘at risk’ or lost to increased coastal erosion.  
 
Taking a Proactive Approach  
9.41 The Council aims to take a p roactive approach in dealing with loss of land and/or property to coastal 
erosion by encouraging rollback or relocation before the land or property is lost.  
9.42 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Plans should make provision for developme nt 
and infrastructure that needs to be relocated away from Coastal Change M anagement Areas. The National 
Planning Practice Guidance  advises that either formally allocating land in a Local Plan or allowing for 
relocation where planning permission would norm ally be refused are two ways in which this can be 
achieved. The Council con siders it feasible, in this respect, to relocate and replace agricultural buildings 
that are required to meet the essential needs of an agricultural development.  
9.43 In order to benefit  from the exception rollback or relocation policy, properties must be at ri sk from erosion 
within a 20 year period. This enables property owners to take a pro -active approach to relocate to an 
alternative location well before erosion becomes an imminent th reat. In order to maintain the

                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  156 sustainability of coastal settlements, reloc ation should take place close to the existing community, where 
possible. Relocation of residential properties should also be to land which is outside of the Coastal Change 
Managemen t Area. Alternative land uses within Coastal Change Management Areas that c ontribute to the 
sustainability of coastal communities and also reduce the risk of the development being adversely 
impacted by coastal erosion are encouraged. Such uses will be eval uated on a case by case basis.  
9.44 It is important to ensure decisions with lon g-lasting consequences do not create obstacles for future 
adaptation, known as avoiding ‘lock -in’. As an example, siting new buildings and infrastructure in low flood 
risk areas whe re possible, will have a long term benefit. Therefore, it is important to c onsider both flood 
risk and coastal adaptation policies concurrently when evaluating development on the coast.   
Policy SCLP9.4: Coastal Change Rollback or Relocation  
Proposals for t he relocation and replacement of community facilities, commercial, agricultural and 
business uses affected by coastal erosion will be permitted in the countryside, provided that:  
a) The proposed development replaces that which is within the Coa stal Change Man agement Area as 
identified on the Policies Map and is forecast to be affected by erosion within 20 years of the date 
of the proposal;  
b) The new development is located at an appropriate distance inland with regard to Policy SCLP9.3 
on the Coast al Change Manag ement Area;  
c) The new development is in a location that is accessible to the coastal community from which it 
was displaced; and  
d) The existing site is either cleared and made safe or put to a temporary use beneficial to the local 
community.  
Prop osals for the r elocation and replacement of dwellings affected by coastal erosion will be permitted in 
the Countryside where:  
e) The development replaces a permanent building which is within the Coastal Change Management 
Area as identified on the Policies Map  and is forecas ted to be affected by erosion within 20 years 
of the date of the proposal;  
f) The re located dwelling should be in a  location which exhibits a similar or improved level of 
sustainability with respect to access to services and facilities as the original dwelli ng;  
g) The relocated dwelling is outside of the Coastal Change Management Area as identified on the 
Policies Map; and  
h) The existing site is either cleared and made safe or put to a temporary use beneficial to the local 
community.

9.45 The Council, in its capacity as a Flood Risk Management Authority, ensures that flood risk related to 
development is effectively managed through the planning system, and have the power to carry out flood 
risk management wor ks on ordinary  waterc ourses and works on coastal defences. Other Flood Risk 
Management Authorities include Suffolk County Council, the Environment Ag ency, Internal Drainage 
Boards and Water and Sewerage Companies. The responsibilities of each Flood Risk Ma nagement 
Authority ca n be seen here: https://www.gov.uk/guid ance/flood -risk-manage ment -information -for-flood -
risk-management -authorities -asset -owners -and-local -authorities#managing -flood -risks -who -is-responsible   
9.46 The low -lying nature of the coastline means that Suffolk is no stranger to flooding – flood events over the 
last few generat ions have resulted in infrastructural damage and, in some cases, loss of life. Flash flooding, 
estuarine and coastal flooding, partl y induced by climate change, have been the main cause of this. The 
Council will work with flood risk stakeholders to lessen the impacts of flooding going forward by 
recognising and assessing the flood risk, mitigating against it and providing resilience me asures to alleviate 
it. Working together with communities and stakeholders, the Council will look to help combat flood risk,  
particularly in coastal areas where national funding for flood protection is limited.  
9.47 Government guidance advocates various flood risk assessments and approaches to guide new 
development to areas with the lowest probability of flooding. Notwithstanding t his, it is appreciated that 
development in areas at some risk of flooding is sometimes unavoidable, as many of the towns in the Loca l 
Plan area  such as Aldeburgh, Woodbridge and Felixstowe are located in high risk areas. To address this, 
mitigation will be  required to ensure no net increase in the risk of flooding.  
Addressing Flood Risk across the District  
9.48 The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Planning Authorities to prepare a Strategic Flood 
Risk Assessment to inform the Local Plan. A Strat egic Flood Risk Assessment has recently been completed 
for East Suffolk and has identified areas at risk from flooding both now and in the future after taking 
climate change into account. This includes flooding models prepared by the Environment Agency as well as 
modelling from other Risk Management Authorities, which helps to attain the most up to date 
understanding of risk.  
9.49 The Strat egic Flood Risk Assessment should be used in assessing the flood risk of new development 
proposals. All sources of flooding should be considered including surface water flooding and flooding from 
sewers.  
9.50 National planning policy seeks to mitigate the risk of flooding by restricting vulnerable new development 
within areas at risk from flooding. It does this by requiring developm ent proposals in areas at risk from 
flooding to be subject to a sequential test where it has to be proven there are no suitable area s of land 
with a lesser risk of flooding and an exception test which identifies sustainability benefits of development 
and e nsures the development is safe for its lifetime.  
9.51 A site -specific flood risk assessment should be provided for all development in Flo od Zones 2 and 3. In 
Flood Zone 1, an assessment should accompany all proposals involving:  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Climate Change

 Land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as having critical 
drainage problems;  
 Land identified in a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as being at increased flood risk 
in future;  
Or 
 Land that may be subject to other sources of flooding, where i ts development 
would introduce a more vulnerable use.  
9.52 Reflecting the conclusions of the Habi tats Regulations Assessment, project level flood risk assessment 
should also consider any potential risks of flooding to designated European sites.  
9.53 If development is to be constructed with less vulnerable uses on the ground level, covenants need to be 
put in place to prevent future alteration of these areas to ‘more vulnerable’ uses without further 
consideration of the associated flood risk.  
9.54 The Shoreline Managemen t Plan proposes various management approaches such as ‘managed 
realignment ’ and adaptation me asures. This method of actively managing the shoreline allows for, or 
creates, conditions for the coast to move. An example of this would be to relocate a linear f lood defence 
back from the active coastal zone to a more secure long 
term position and, there fore, allow the shoreline to re -
adjust naturally. It can bring benefits including the 
creation or recreation of valuable and threatened inter -
tidal habitats as wel l as more robust flood defence for the 
community, but may result in the loss of some 
agricult ural land and, in a number of limited cases, 
property. If it is not carefully managed it could have a 
major impact on the economic and social infrastructure, 
as we ll as the everyday operation of communities.   
9.55 The Local Plan will need to take account of any  review of 
the Shoreline Management Plan. It may be necessary to 
ensure that development to be permitted in areas at risk 
from coastal erosion or flooding by the s ea is 
proportionate to the level of risk.  
9.56 Developments should be designed to incorporate natu ral 
flood management measures that sustainably utilise 
natural capital, in line with the Natural Capital 
Committee’s advice. By working with natural processes, 
we can better protect ourselves from hazards such as 
flooding. Natural flood management involves  the use of a 
variety of measures including tree planting, river bank 
Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
159  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n restoration, building small -scale woody dams, reconnecting rivers with their flood plains and  storing water 
temporarily on open land. Of course, such measures should be complementary of traditional flood 
defences in the interests of integrated flood management. However, where flood risk measures result in 
significant depreciation of natural capita l, the creation of compensatory natural capital will be required.  
Policy SCLP9.5: Flood Risk  
The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment should be the starting point in assessing whether a proposal is at risk 
from flooding . 
Proposals for new development, or the in tensification of existing development, will not be permitted in 
areas at high risk from flood ing, i.e. Flood Zones 2 and 3, unless the applicant has satisfied the safety 
requirements in the Flood Risk National Planning Policy Guidance (and any successor). These include the 
‘sequential test’; where needed the ‘exception test’ and also a site specif ic flood risk assessment that 
addresses the characteristics of flooding and has tested an appropriate range of flood event scenarios 
(taking climate change into co nsideration). This should address as a minimum: finished floor levels; safe 
access and egress ; an emergency flood plan; identification and provision of surface water exceedance 
routes;  flood resilience/resistance measures; any increase in built or surfaced  area; and any impact on 
flooding elsewhere , including sewer flooding . 
Developments should ex hibit the three main principles of flood risk, in that, they should be safe, resilient 
and should not increase flood risk elsewhere. In this respect, single storey  residential developments will 
not be permitted in areas of high risk of flooding within or o utside Settlement Boundaries.  
Developments are encouraged to include natural flood management measures that complement existing 
flood defences if pre -existing floo d defences are in place, in the interests of integrated flood management.  
Any new flood risk  measures that result in significant depreciation of natural capital will be required to 
create compensatory natural capital.  
Neighbourhood Plans can allocate land  for development, including residential development, in areas at risk 
of flooding providing i t can be demonstrated:  
a) There are no alternative available sites appropriate for the proposed use within the 
Neighbourhood Area;  
b) The development provides sustainab ility benefits which outweigh flood risk; and  
c) Evidence is provided that  it is possible for flood risk to be mitigated to ensure development is safe 
for its lifetime  and the lifetime of the relevant flood defence .

9.57 It is import ant to ensure that new development does not impede flood flows, reduce flood storage 
capacity, or exacerbate problems of flooding in areas downstream through an increase in run -off from 
impermeable surfaces such as roofs and paved areas. A common way of ac hieving this is through use of 
sustainable drainage systems  (SuDS) . Sus tainable drainage systems can  take up large areas of land on 
development sites and therefore significantly influence the layout  through good design which responds to 
built , historic  and natural surroundings .  
9.58 Sustainable drainage systems should be integrated into the green infrastructure provision on the site and 
complement the overall landscaping scheme of the site. They should not be surrounded by palisade 
fencing and where restriction s to access are required due to safety considerations, these sh ould be 
innovatively designed by low impact barriers such as landscaping or planting. Sustainable drainage systems 
should also incorporate ‘Blue Corridors’, where possible, to create a network of corridors designed to 
facilitate natural hydrological proces ses that help to minimise flooding.  
9.59 Well designed drainage systems can deliver environmental improvements including water quality, 
biodiversity and reduced flood risk. Discharges of surface wat er should be designed to deliver water 
quality improvements to help meet the objectives of the Water Framework Directive  relating to 
deterioration and improvement in water body status . Surface water should be discharged as high up the 
drainage hierarchy as  possible in line with the concept of the SuDS management train . Presently, there is a 
tendency for required attenuation volumes to be accommodated below ground. In order to discourage 
this, preference should be given to the installation of blue -green surf ace infrastructure, as opposed to 
hardscape or underground solu tions, due to the wider benefits attained through ecosystem services 
provided by natural capital. This includes habitat provision, recreational benefits and mitigation against the 
urban heat is land effect, where relevant.  
9.60 The latest advice from the Lead Lo cal Flood Authority at Suffolk County Council, the CIRIA SuDS Manual 
and the latest Suffolk Flood Risk Management Strategy should be consulted when considering SuDS 
planning , design  and mainten ance . Climate Change  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
161  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP9.6: Sustainable Drainage Systems  
Developments  should use sustainable drainage systems to drain surface water. Developments of 10 
dwellings or more, or non -residential development with upwards of 1,000 sqm of floorspace or on sites of  
1 he ctare or more, will be required to utilise sustainable drainage  systems, unless demonstrated to be 
inappropriate. Sustainable drainage systems should:  
a) Be integrated into the landscaping scheme and green infrastructure provision of the development;  
b) Contrib ute to the design quality of the scheme; and  
c) Deliver sufficient  and appropriate water quality and aquatic biodiversity improvements, wherever 
possible. This should be compl ementary of any local designations such as Source Protection 
Zones.  
Runoff rates fro m new development must be restricted to greenfield runoff rates  wherever possible. 
Where a site is previously developed, the proposed runoff rates should be restricted as close to the 
greenfield rates, or at the very minimum a betterment of at least 30% sh ould be considered over the 
brownfield runoff rates.  
No surface  water connections should be made to the foul system and connections to the combined or 
surface water system should only be made in exceptional circumstances where there are no feasible 
alterna tives. Foul and surface water flows should also be separated.  
 
Holistic Water Management  
9.61 In recognition that water does not respect administrative  boundaries, the Council will work with 
neighbouring authorities and other relevant stakeholders to devise a catchment -based approach to holistic 
water management. In respect of implementing holistic water management, and applying the conclusions 
of the Hab itat Regulations Assessment that underpins the Local Plan, to assure the timely delivery of 
required infrast ructure and treatment capabilities, new developments will be required to be phased to 
allow water and wastewater infrastructure to be in place when needed.  There will however not always be 
a requirement for development to be phased, for example, where ther e are no identified water and/or 
wastewater improvement works required to serve the development, or where measures are or will be in 
place in a time ly manner. The Council will work with the water companies, Natural England and the 
Environment Agency to ens ure that water related matters and required infrastructure needs are 
continually reviewed and resolved to meet the needs arising from growth, as set  out in the Monitoring 
Framework (Appendix C) of this Plan.      
9.62 The Deben Holistic Water Management Pilot Pr oject provides a best practice example of holistic water 
management, in that, it involves the re -use of water that would normally be pumped into the  river system 
which adds to flow velocity and ultimately the rate of erosion. Through holistic water managem ent 
methods such as attenuation ponds and managed aquifer recharge, the pilot project will filter excess Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Climate Change

The Council supports this approach to holisti c water management and will aim to compl ement such an 
approach, where possible.  
Policy SCLP 9.7: Holistic Water Management  
All development will be ex pected to demonstrate that water can be made available to support the 
development and that adequate foul wat er treatment and disposal already exists or can be provided in 
time to serve the development. Development will be phased to allow water and water re cycling 
infrastructure to be in place where needed.  
All new developments will be expected to incorporate wat er efficiency and re -use measures to maximise 
the opportunities to reduce water use . This includes , but is not limited to : 
a) Grey water recycling;  
b) Rainwater harvesting; or  
c) Water use minimisation technologies .  
Infrastructure that leads to a reduction in the  amount of water released to the sewer system and allows 
for natural infiltration into groundwater tables will be favoured in this instance.

10.1 The former Suffolk Coastal area is an area  with a high quality natural environmen t which is enjoyed by 
residents, visitors, businesses and , most importantly,  wildlife.  The natural environment is primarily rural 
with coastline, river valleys  and undulating countryside interspersed with market towns and villages.  There 
is a range of loca lly, nationally and internationally designated sites of natural importance in the former 
Suffolk Coastal area spanning the length and breadth  of the area . Sites of  note include the Suffolk Coast & 
Heaths AONB, RSPB Minsmere, Orford Ness National Nature Res erve and Sutton Heath.  
10.2 The Local Plan seeks to protect , retain and enhance the high quality natural environment and designated 
landscapes and sites found across t he Local Plan area  which contribute to the overall success of the area  
and provides economic and social benefits for all.  Of further importance, however, are  the wider 
environmental and ecological benefits provided by the natural environment including, for  example, carbon 
sequestration, natural flood protection and habitat creation. It is wider be nefits such as this that the Local 
Plan will seek to foster in new developments and to protect, retain and enhance in existing developments. 
Locally adopted plans such as the Deben Estuary Plan and Alde & Ore Estuary Plan will need to be 
considered in resp ect of locally important natural environment issues.  
Biodiversity & Geodiversity   
10.3 Biodiversity54 and geodiversity55 are of great significance 
across the former Suffolk Coastal  area  due to the extent 
and range of sites and habitats identified. Many of these 
areas are spread across the Local Plan area  but the coastal 
areas are of particular importance due to internationa l, 
national and local designations. Across the Local Plan area  
there are a variety of land based and marine based 
designations as seen in Tabl e 10.1.   
10.4 Both biodiversity and geodiversity represent elements of 
natural capital. A natural capital approach is an integral 
aspect of the Government’s recently published 25 year 
Environment Plan. The Council aims to incorporate this 
approach into this Lo cal Plan.  
 
 
54 Biodiversity means the variety of life forms, the ecological roles they play, and the genetic diversity they contain.  
55 Geodiversity may be defined as the natural range of geological features (rocks, minerals, fossils, and structures), geomo rphologic features 
(landforms and processes) and soil features that make up the landscape. It includes their assemblages, relationship s, properties, 
interpretations and systems.

10.5 By their nature, areas of biodiversity and geodiversity importance are particularly sensitive to development 
and, therefore, careful consideration should be given when  assessing new proposals. Consideration should 
be given to the European Birds or Habitats  Directives as to whether ‘screening ’ of impacts and/or an 
Appropriate Assessment is required. In accordance with national policy guidance, the strongest level of 
prot ection is given to these areas and the presumption in favour of sustainable development t herefore 
does not apply to development proposals requiring Appropriate Assessment under European Birds or 
Habitats Directives.  
10.6 Sites of European importance, which inc lude Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection 
Areas (SPAs) are statuto rily protected under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 201 7 
(based on EU directives), and wetlands of global importance (Ramsar sites) are protected  by Government 
policy to apply the same level of protection as to European sites. Sites o f Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), 
of national importance, are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). The 
Local Plan area  also contain s sites of local importance including County Wildlife Sites (CWSs) designated by 
the Suffolk County Wildlife Sites panel, Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) designated by Local Authorities, and 
County Geodiversity Sites (CGSs)  (formerly Regionally I mportant Geol ogical Sites) designated by 
GeoSuffolk. Considerable weight is given to protecting these designated sites. However, the level of 
protection should be commensurate with the level at which the site is designated (i.e. international, 
national and  local).  The NPPF defines irreplaceable habitats as those which would be very difficult or would 
take a long time to restore, and in the former Suffolk Coastal  area  would include habitats such as ancient 
woodland, veteran trees and sand dunes. Development resulting in the loss or deterioration of 
irreplaceable habitats should be refused unless there are wholly exceptional reasons as defined by the 
NPPF.  
10.7 Whilst these designated areas are provided with protection, the potential exists nonetheless for all new  
developments  to look at ways of increasing or improving areas of biodiversity and/or geodiversity Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Natural Environment  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  166 importance, providing a net gain of biodiversity and/or geodiversity and enhancing the green 
infrastructure network. Areas of value, or potential value, for biodiversity include freshwater and marine 
environments as well as terrestrial habitats. Any increase or improvement to areas of biodiversity and/or 
geodiversity importance and to the green infrastructure network should be accurately evidenced at an 
early stage in the planning process. Creation of ecological corridors, connections to existing habitats and 
habitat ‘stepping stones’ represent examples of how this can be achieved. This will simultaneously help 
contribute to the establishment of a wider Nature Recovery Netw ork; an action outlined in the 
Government’s 25 year Environment Plan.   
10.8 When considering the creation of ecological corridors that could affect neighbouring authorities, any 
relevant plans or policies relating to ecological corridors in that au thority shoul d be consulted.  Semi -
natural areas, circular dog walking routes, dedicated dogs off leads areas and dog waste bins should be 
incorporated into ecological corridors or networks within new developments in order to encourage routine 
recreational activities wi thin the vicinity of the development.  
10.9 Strategic, flexible and locally tailored approaches that recognise the relationship between the quality of 
the environment and development should be pursued. Previously developed sites will be considered 
favourably whe n evaluating development proposals in order to increase the likelihood of achieving 
biodiversity and/or geodiversity net gain, unless the site has been proven to be of high biodiversity value. 
The Brownfield Register should be consulted in thi s respect.  
10.10  The opportunity exists for development proposals involving SuDS schemes to facilitate enhancement of 
the green infrastructure network and to provide a net gain for biodiversity and/or geodiversity by 
incorporating such principles into the propo sal. It is th erefore expected that all development proposals 
involving SuDS schemes will complement the green infrastructure network in the interests of achieving 
wider sustainability benefits and a net gain for biodiversity and/or geodiversity.  
10.11  Developme nt proposals located in coastal, riverine and estuarine areas should have regard for the 
cumulative impact of development on biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides, particularly in 
relation to coastal and marine protected areas. This will help  to contribut e to an ecosystem based 
approach , a common approach taken in the marine planning sphere.  The Marine Management 
Organisation, Natural England and any adopted Estuary Plans must be consulted in this respect.  
10.12  Development proposals should be accom panied by suf ficient information to assess the effects of 
development on priority habitats and species, protected sites, protected species, biodiversity or geology, 
together with any proposed prevention, mitigation or compensation measures. The Suffolk Bio diversity 
Information Service can provide general species distribution data for development sites and further 
information is also available from the Suffolk Wildlife Trust. Natural England and GeoSuffolk can provide 
detailed information regarding sites of geological im portance.  
10.13  Plans or projects which may have a likely significant effect on a European site will require Appropriate 
Assessment under Reg. 63 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.  Accordingly, local 
authorities can only c onsent plans or projects where it can be ascertained that they will have no adverse 
effect on the integrity of a European site. In exceptional circumstances, where there are no alternative Natural Environment  | Suffolk Coas tal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
167  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n solutions, a plan or project may meet the tests of Imperative Reaso ns of Overrid ing Public Interest (IROPI), 
which then requires demonstration that appropriate compensation will be provided to ensure that the 
integrity of the Natura 2000 network is not compromised. Given the rigour of these tests, the presumption 
is that plans or proj ects that could adversely affect Natura 2000 sites will not be approved. In practice, 
schemes which qualify for IROPI are extremely rare and are very unlikely to fall under the Council’s remit 
for decision making.   
10.14  The NPPF states that if significant harm to biodiversity resulting from development cannot be avoided, 
adequately mitigated, or,  as a last resort, compensated for, then planning permission should be refused. 
This sequential approach is  referred to as the ‘mitigation hierarchy’ and th e policy has been created to 
cover these scenarios.  
Conserving and Enhancing our Natural Areas  
10.15  It is important to protect habitats outside designated sites and to protect particular species , such as those 
which are rare or protected. Suffolk Biodiversity Action Plan pr iority species and habitats and other species 
protected by law will be protected from harmful development. Where there is reason to suspect the 
presence of nature conservation interests, applications for development should be accompanied by a 
survey and as sessment of their value, in accordance with local biodiversity validation requirements. If 
present, the proposal must be sensitive to, and make provision for, their needs. For example, through the 
provision of nest sites for swifts in developments and reno vations  or including features to create 
permeability for hedgehogs.  
10.16  The high quality natural environment is important to many local communities as it positively contributes to  
quality of life , quality of place  and mental health. The Council recognises that  issues relating to biodiversity 
and geodiversity need to be considered collaboratively with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure 
that natural assets are protected. To address the impact of development on the European Sites across the 
plan area , the Council  has been working in partnership with Ipswich Borough Council, Babergh and Mid 
Suffolk District Councils, Suffolk County Council and Natural England to d evelop a Recreational disturbance  
Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy (RAMS). The strategy provid es the practical basis and evidence to 
identify projects to mitigate the impact of new development on the protected sites.  In the majority of 
cases, a RAMS contr ibution will be the Council’s preferred mechanism for securing mitigation.  Such an 
approach has  been successfully implemented in developments such as the ‘Brightwell Lakes’ development 
of approximately 2,000 dwellings in the south of the Local Plan area . Likewise, compensatory areas have 
been provided at Sizewell Nuclear Power plants to mitigate the  effects of development on SSSIs. In the 
interests of ensuring the continued effectiveness  of mitigation measures such as SANGs and compensatory 
areas, they will  be protected in perpetuity.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Natural Environment

Development will b e supported where it can be demonstrated that it maintains, restores or enhances the 
existing green infrastructure network and positively contributes towards bio diversity and/or geodiversity 
through the creation of new habitats and green infrastructure and  improvement to linkages between 
habitats, such as wildlife corridors and habitat ‘stepping stones’.  All development should follow a hierarchy 
of seeking firstly  to avoid impacts, mitigate for impacts so as to make them insignificant for biodiversity, or 
as a last resort compensate for losses that cannot be avoided or mitigated for. Adherence to the hierarchy 
should be demonstrated.  
Proposals that will have a dire ct or indirect adverse impact (alone or in -combination with other plans or 
projects) on locally  designated sites of biodiversity or geodiversity importance, including County Wildlife 
Sites, priority habitats and species, will not be supported unless it can  be demonstrated with 
comprehensive evidence that the benefits of the proposal, in its particul ar location, outweigh s the 
biodiversity loss.  
New development should provide environmental net gains in terms of both green infrastructure and 
biodiversity. Proposals should demonstrate how the development would contribute towards new green 
infrastructure  opportunities or enhance the existing green in frastructure network as part of the 
development. New development must also secure ecological enhancements as part of its design and 
implementation, and should provide a biodiversity net gain that is proportion ate to the scale and nature of 
the proposal.  
Where compensatory habitat is created, it should be of equal or greater size and ecological value than the 
area lost as a result of the development, be well located to positively contribute towards the green 
infrastructure network, and biodiversity and/or g eodiversity and be supported with a management plan.  
Where there is reason to suspect the presence of protected UK or Suffolk Priority species or habitat, 
applications should be supported by an ecological sur vey and assessment of appropriate scope underta ken 
by a suitably qualified person. If present, the proposal must follow the mitigation hierarchy in order to be 
considered favourably. Any proposal that adversely affects a European site, or causes significan t harm to a 
Site of Special Scientific Interest , will not normally be granted permission.  
Any development with the potential to impact on a Special Protection Area , Special Area for Conservation 
or Ramsar site within or outside of the plan area  will need to be supported by information to inform a 
Habi tat Regulations Assessment , in accordance with the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 
2017, as amended (or subsequent revisions) .  
The Recreational disturbance Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy h as been prepared to provide a 
mechanism through  which impacts from increased recreation can be avoided and mitigated via  financial 
contributions towards the provision of strategic mitigation. Where mitigation is proposed to be provided 
through alternative mechanisms, applicants will need to provide evidence to demonstrate that all impacts 
are mitigated for, including in -combination effects. Depending on the size and location of the  Natural Environment  | Suffolk Coas tal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
169  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n development, additional measures such as Suitable Alternative Natural Green Spaces (SANGS) may be 
required as part of devel opment proposals.  
A Supplementary Planning Document will be prepared to assist with the implement ation of the 
Recreational  disturbance  Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy. The Council will work with neighbourin g 
authorities and Natural England to implement this strategy.   
 
Visitor Management of European Sites  
10.17  In partnership with Natural England and neighbouring authorities , the Council  is committed to the need to 
mitigate the recreational impact on sites desig nated as being of international importance for their nature 
conservation interest (European Sites) from increased housing provision.  
10.18  Across the Local Plan area  the following sites are designated as being o f international importance for their 
nature conserv ation interest:  
 Alde -Ore Estuary SPA/Ramsar;  
 Alde -Ore and Butley Estuaries SAC;  
 Deben Estuary SPA / Ramsar;  
 Minsmere – Walberswick SPA/Ramsar;  
 Minsmere to Walberswick Heaths and Ma rshes SAC;  
 Orford Ness – Shingle Street SAC;  
 Sandlings SPA;  
 Staverton Park a nd Thicks SAC;  
 Stour and Orwell Estuaries SPA / Ramsar.  
10.19  The Council is aware that the distribution of growth proposed by the Local Plan along with developments 
that come forward over the plan period can have an impact on European Sites.  The impact is prim arily in 
relation to an increase in disturbance to 
wildlife linked to people walking dogs 
along with increased recreational use of 
estuaries from water based activities.  
10.20  The previous Local Plan supported by an 
Appropriate Assessment required 
specific mitig ation measures in respect 
of strategic housing growth in the 
southern part of the plan area . The 
Appropriate As sessment identified a 
1km buffer from the boundary of a 
designated area as an appropriate 
distance to apply when determining 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Natural Environment  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  170 impact. This is beca use studies have shown that people are reluctant to walk 1km to get to the start of 
their main walk. Beyond thi s distance they tend to drive.  
10.21  The Council has prepared  a ‘Recreational disturbance  Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy ’ (RAMS) with  
Babergh and Mid Suffolk District  Council s and Ipswich Borough Council.  The strategy will review and 
monitor effectiveness and  amend the approach as deemed necessary.   
10.22  Estuary management plans that have been endorsed / adopted by the Council as well as the AONB 
managemen t plan are material planning considerations along with the RAMS in the determination of 
planning applications w hich are considered to have an impact on designated sites.  These include the 
Deben Estuary Plan and the Alde and Ore Estuary Plan.  
Policy SCLP10 .2: Visitor Management of European Sites  
The Council has a duty to ensure that development proposals will not r esult in an increase in activity likely 
to have a significant effect upon sites designated as being of international importance for their nature 
conservation interest.  
Applications for new car parking provision (public or privately owned which are availabl e for wider public 
use) located within 1km boundary of a designated site or new access points direct into the estuary such as 
slipways or jetties  will need to demonstrate that they will not result in an increase in activity likely to have 
a significant eff ect upon a European site whether on their own, or in combination with other uses. Such 
proposals need to be subject to a project level Habitats R egulation Assessment.  
 
Environmental Quality  
10.23  The quality of environment in which people reside is inextricably linked to quality of life and invariably 
affects their standard of living. Pollution is widely regarded  as a negative influence on environmental  
quality due to carbon emissions, particulate matter emissions and soil contamination, for example. 
Regulation of air and soil quality, in this respect, is important in order to mitigate such pollution.  
10.24  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellenc e (NICE) encourages Local Authorities to addre ss the 
issue of air pollution in their Local Plan to help improve air quality. The NPPF requires planning policies and 
decisions to ‘sustain and contribute towards compliance with relevant limit values or natio nal objectives 
for pollutants, taking into account the presence of Air Quality Management Areas and Clean Air Zones, and 
the cumulative impacts from individual sites in local areas.’  This Local Plan will seek to improve air quality 
not just in the two Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) across the  plan area , but also elsewhere . 
Development proposals will be expected to minimise and mitigate air pollution  and to contribute towards 
the achievement of air quality objectives.  An Air Quality Assessment may be r equired in support of any Natural Environment  | Suffolk Coas tal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
171  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n development propo sals; this should be produced in accordance with the latest Environmental Protection 
UK guidance56. 
10.25  In line with the  National Planning Policy Framework  the Plan seeks to protect high quality agricultural land 
where  possible. Whilst in some cases meeting wi der objectives will necessitate the loss of agricultural land, 
particularly considering the relatively limited amount of brownfield land available for development in the 
plan area , the policy seeks to ensure that l oss of agricultural land is a consideratio n.  
10.26  The Habitats Regulations Assessment of the Local Plan has identified the potential for emissions from 
vehicles and impacts on water quality and water quantity to have an effect on European protected sites, 
and has made recommendations in relation to mo nitoring as referred to in the Monitoring Framework in 
Appendix C. Where necessary, potential effects on European protected sites would need to be considered 
through the Habitats Regulations Assessment process.  
Policy SCLP10.3: Environmental Quality  
Develo pment proposals will be expected to  protect the quality of the environment and to minimise and, 
where possible, reduce all forms of pollution and contamination.  
Development proposals will be considered in relation  to impacts on;  
a) Air quality, and the impact on receptors in Air Quality Management Areas;  
b) Soils and the loss of agricultural land;  
c) Land contamination and its effects on sensitive land uses;  
d) Water quality and the achievement of Water Framework Directive obj ectives;  
e) Light pollution; and  
f) Noise p ollution.  
Proposals should seek to secure improvements in relation to the above where possible.  
The cumulative effect of development, in this regard, will be considered.   
 
Landscape   
10.27   The quality of landscapes , visibl e features of land  or scenery is a defining feature of the  former Suffolk 
Coastal  District  and the identity of local communities. The diverse landscapes of the former Suffolk Coastal  
District  have been influenced and defined by natural and human act ivity, including a long tradition of 
farming. The former Suffolk Coastal District  area includes large areas of farmland, much of which is the 
most productive in the country i.e. grades 1, 2, and 3 under the Agricultural Land Classification57.

and beneficial management of that change, including restoration and protection where necessary, is 
essential to maintaining the quality, distinctiveness and vitali ty of th e local environment.  
10.29  The landscape of the plan area  is varied but characterised by areas which have important landscape 
designations such as the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage Coast  and 
Historic Parks and Gar dens.  Previous Local Plan documents included a county wide approach in the form of 
Special Landscape Areas (SLA) which originated from the Suffolk Structure Plan.  The SLA designations 
primarily identified the river valleys and tributaries as areas with spe cial lan dscape attributes that are 
particularly vulnerable to change.  
10.30  Government guidance and best practice advise that a landscape character assessment approach should be 
taken to inform policy making and planning decisions, rather than locally defined ar ea speci fic landscape 
designations.  To accord with Government guidance, the Council commissioned a Suffolk Coastal Landscape 
Character Assessment (2018) and Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018)  of the former Suffolk Coastal 
District  Council  and the fri nges of Ipswich58. The evidence provides a tool to help understand the character 
and local distinctiveness of the landscape and identifies the special qualities and features that give it a 
sense of place, as well as providing guidance on how to manage chan ge. Lands cape character is the 
distinct, recognisable and consistent pattern of elements that make one landscape different from another.  
The assessment recognises all landscapes, not just those that are designated, and considers sensitivity to 
change inclu ding in r elation to recognised features.   
10.31  The Suffolk Coastal Landscape Character Assessment (2018) and Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018)  
analyse the sensitivity of settlement fringes, their capacity to accommodate future development and 
priorities for the e nhancement, protection, management and conservation of these landscape areas.  
Suffolk Coast & Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  
10.32  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) are national landscape designations afforded the highest 
protection for their  landscape and scenic quality. Protection of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths relates not 
only to the land within this AONB, but also to its setting.  In line with national policy great weight is 
attributed to conserving and enhancing the landscape and scenic b eauty in the AONB and t he conservation 
and enhancement of wildlif e and cultural heritage are  importa nt considerations . A large part of the AONB 
is also identified as Suffolk Heritage Coast. The AONB Management Plan explains that the H eritage Coast 
purpose includes objectives for conserving the environmental health and biodiversity of inshore waters 
and beaches, and to extend opportunities for recreational education, sport and tourist activities that draw 
on, and are consistent with, th e conservation of thei r heritage features.  
10.33  The conservation and enhancement of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB and its setting  is also an 
important influence within the plan area. Incorporating extensive landscapes , from the River Blyth Estuary

Borough and Babergh and Mid Suffolk Districts.  Natural Environment  | Suffolk Coas tal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
173  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n in the no rth to landscapes arou nd the River Orwell and River Deben Estuaries in the south, the AONB also 
extends beyond the plan area  to the north and south.  
10.34  The Suffolk Coast and Heaths Management Plan 2018 is a material consideration and sets out the 
management objectives for the AON B. The Management Plan has a key role in supporting and co -
ordinating the role of management of the AONB as required by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 
2000.  A key objective of the Management Plan is to conserve and enhance the AONB’s natural beauty and 
improve its special qualities.  Working with local communities, farmers, businesses, non -government 
organisations, local authorities, statutory agencies and individuals the AONB Management Plan reflects the 
co-ordinated activity of  the partnership.   
10.35  The National Planning Policy Framework under paragraph 172  states that planning permission should be 
refused for major development other than in exceptional circumstances and where it can be 
demonstrated that the development is in the pu blic interest, and set s out a series of assessment criteria 
against which applications for major development would be considered. The NPPF explains that whether a 
proposal is ‘major development’ is a matter for the decision maker, taking into account its n ature, scale 
and setti ng, and whether it could have a significant adverse impact on the purposes for which the area has 
been designated or defined.  
 
Landscape Character and Assessment  
10.36  Landscape character is the distinct, recognisable and consistent pattern of elements that mak es one 
landscape different from another. Landscape assessment helps to describe the important features and 
characteristics of different areas of landscape. This he lps to make recommendations for future protection, 
management and planning. An up to date Suffolk Coastal Landscape Character Assessment (2018) and 
Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018)  are important tool s in proposing, shaping and determining 
proposals  for new development, analysing and identifying landscape features and characteristics in 
particular parts of the plan area . This kind of information and guidance is helpful in the conservation of 
features that give places their unique character, in ident ifying opportunities for enhancement and positive 
change, and in providing evidence to suppor t local action. The Landscape Character Area Maps are 
contained in Appendix H.  
10.37  Landscape assessment is not limited to designated landscapes. It recognises particu lar qualities and 
features of landscapes to provide an understanding of distinct sense of pla ce and sensitivities to 
development and change. Types of landscapes with broadly similar combinations of geology, landform,

particular type, such as Valley Meadowlands, may be found in different places. Particularly valued 
landscape types within  the former  Suffolk Coastal  District  of the greatest sensitivity to  change are rural 
river valleys, historic park and garden, coastal, estuary and heathland are as.  
10.38  The Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018)  analyses the sensitivity of settlement fringes, their capacity 
to accommodate future development and priorities f or the enhancement, protection, management and 
conservation of landscape areas.  
10.39  Proposals for  development should be informed by, and be sympathetic to, the special qualities and 
features, strategy objectives and considerations identified in the Suffolk Coa stal Landscape Character 
Assessment (2018) and Settlement Sensitivity Assessment (2018). This  evidence may be updated during 
the plan period in which case successor documents will be used in decision making.  
10.40  The Council acknowledges that landscape is important to healthy and active communities across the 
former Suffolk Coastal District . The Public  Rights of Way network and areas of green infrastructure 
associated with developments support social interaction, w ell being and ease disturbance on protected 
wildlife sites, for example, by providing alternative outdoor recreation places.  Proposed develop ment 
should take into account Public Rights of Way and provide enhancements to the network where possible. 
The prov ision of new footpaths should ensure that these are accessible for all users.  
 
Natural Environment  | Suffolk Coas tal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
175  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 10.41  The Deben Estuary Plan as well as the Suffolk Coast and Heat hs AONB Unit both acknowledge the defining 
feature of tranquillity in parts of the former Suffolk Coastal District . Tranquillity is categorised by areas of 
semi -natural habitat, a general absence of developments and apparent lack of human activity.  Tranqui llity 
is further enhanced by natural sounds and the areas of darkest skies. Evidence indicates that the areas of 
the former Suffolk Coastal District  with greatest tranquillity are the estuaries, river valleys and heaths. 
Extensive areas of estuary, river v alley and heaths are characterised by relatively little artificial light helping 
to keep the sky dark at night and supporting quality of light and space, wild bird migration and feeding 
behaviour and sounds like bird calls, the wind through reeds in estuar ies and waves on shingle.

Settlement Coalescence  
10.43  Landscapes are a unique combination of features that make a place distinctive. There are a number of 
locations t hroughout the plan area  where important undeveloped areas of land exist between 
settlements. These gaps help protec t the identity and character of separate settlements.  
10.44  Gaps between settlements help give the sense of leaving one place and arriving at another . Feedback from 
community engagement and public consultation used to help shape this Local Plan document stresse s the 
importance of communities retaining their individual identity. Many distinct villages in the former Suffolk 
Coastal District are ne ar to other villages and towns. In places such as Rushmere St Andrew and 
Martlesham landscapes characterise village cha racter as distinct from nearby suburban areas. The 
presence of buildings, signs and other development along roads prevents the sense of l eaving a settlement 
and passing through the countryside. At night, various forms of artificial lighting can also lead t o a sense of 
continuous urbanisation.   
Policy SCLP10. 5: Settlement Coalescence  
Development of undeveloped land and intensification of dev eloped land between settlements will only be 
permitted where it does not lead to the coalescence of settlements through  a reduction in openness and 
space or the creation of urbanising effects between settlements.  
Neighbourhood plans may include policies ad dressing local issues related to settlement coalescence.

11.1 The Suffolk Co astal Local Plan area  is fortunate to have a rich and varied built and historic environment 
with significant heritage assets alongside contemporary developments which provide a significant boost to 
the local economy.  The Suffolk Coastal  Local Pl an area  contains around 2, 400 Listed Buildings and 3 6 
Conservation Area s, as well as numerous archaeological assets and historic parkland.  
Design Quality  
11.2 Design is a key principle in the creation of sustainable development and should contribute positively to 
making  communities better for everyone. Good design is concerned not only with how development looks 
but how it feels and functions. Incorporating both  the enhancement of local character and distinctiveness 
that encourages innovative and creative solutions is en couraged. The Local Plan seeks to plan positively for 
high quality and inclusive design by creating places that function well, and establish a st rong sense of place 
with comfortable places to live, work and visit.  As stated in  paragraph 124 of the  National  Planning Policy 
Framework ’the creation of high quality  buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and 
development process should achieve’.  
11.3 The National Planning Policy Framework also emphasises high quality design and good amenity standards  
as a core planning principle. It is therefore, of great  importance that design principles are understood and 
appropriately considered by the Local Plan and planning applications. Creating well designed places that 
incorporate all aspects of design in an i nclusive manner can help to deliver a high quality of li fe. The 
Council is committed to providing a framework for good design that contributes to improvements in crime 
prevention, access and inclusion, safe and connected streets, cohesive neighbourhoods, w ell connected 
green spaces, and provision of services. T he Local Plan seeks to ensure these principles are brought 
forward over the plan period.  The National Planning Policy Framework also promotes the effective use of 
land and it is important that this is  achieved alongside delivering high quality and inclusiv e design.  
11.4 Local distinctiveness plays an important role in enhancing local character and site specific qualities, the 
importance of which was highlighted through consultation feedback. The Local Plan  encourages design 
that creates a sense of place and ack nowledges local form and character. The aim of development should 
be to create new and exciting places where people want to live, work and visit. In this regard, design 
should be of its time and site specific. The National Planning Policy Framework  establi shes the importance 
of supporting innovative and outstanding design. The Council encourages this across the Suffolk Coastal 
Local Plan area  where it is respectful of its surroundings . In areas of more  limited design quality the Council 
encourages developme nt to significantly enhance design quality through innovative and creative means . 
Innovative design should be understood to include, but not be limited to, high levels of sustainability and 
new constr uction methods and materials.  
11.5 The local character and di stinctiveness of the Suffolk  Coastal Local Plan area  are derived from the diversity 
of architecture, landscape  and coastal setting. These have given risen to an architectural typology not just 
of farm houses, picturesque cottages and churches but of resort tourism, military research and defence, Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment

landscap es and 19th and 20th century military airfields, towers and pagodas.  
11.6 To help facilitate th e understanding of local character and to support development that acknowledges and 
enhances the essence of  local character it is important that the most appropriat e information sources are 
referenced in relevant planning applications . Sources which may as sist with identifying and assessing local 
character include Conservation Area Appraisals, Neighbourhood Plans, village / parish plans and the Suffolk 
Design Guide.  
11.7 The introduction of Neighbourhood Plans in the Localism Act 2011 has encouraged local commu nities to 
take an active role in the plan -making process and prepare plans and policies that, in gaining statutory 
weight, have a real impact on the development of lo calities. In this regard, Neighbourhood Plans can, and 
are encouraged to, set out design p olicies which respond to their own local circumstances.  
11.8 The Suffolk Design Guide was adopted as Supplementary Planning Guidance by the Council in 1993, and 
revised in  2000 to acknowledge changes in national planning policy guidance. Although an ageing 
docu ment, it is comprised of fundamental design principles that will continue to be important 
considerations. The Suffolk Local Authorities are in the early stages of rev iewing the Suffolk Design Guide 
which will supersede the current guide, and which will be an important reference in relation to design 
considerations.  
11.9 Local Plan consultation representations  support the use of Building for Life 12 (BFL 12). Building for L ife 
1259 is advocated in paragraph  129 of the National Planning Policy Framework as a tool to deliver well 
designed development proposals and to assess development proposals. In this regard, the Local Plan 
encourages all development proposals to use BFL 12 in demonstrating how the scheme meets the criteria 
for delivering high quality design. BFL  12 will be used as a tool to assist with design discussions during the 
pre-application and planning application stages, not as a pr escriptive set of inflexible ru les. BFL 12  (the 
most recent nationally endorsed version) will be used  to inform the decision  making process to provide a 
design quality assessment against all major applications. These assessments should be undertaken at the 
earliest possible opportunity in the decision making process so that schemes can be amended to deliver 
high quality design,  if necessary. Residential development proposals will be supported where they perform 
positively when assessed, by planning officers and/or agreed upon through a d ialogue between planning 
officers and applicant, against the Building for Life 12 guidelines.  In demonstrating positive performance, 
applicants should include a design quality assessment of their proposal using all of the BFL 12 Guideline 
categories within  a Design and Access Statement. Such BFL 12 Guideline categories include; integrating the 
scheme into its surroundings, locally inspired or otherwise distinctive character, and adequate provision of 
external storage space for bins and recycling. Such asses sments should clearly set out how the elements of 
a proposal contribute to good design and av oid bad design as detailed in the BFL 12 Guidelines. In addition

design quality of completed schemes.  
 
11.10  The Built for Life accreditation reflects high  quality design and provides  confidence that appropriate 
consideration has been given to all aspects of design. BFL 12 operates a traffic light scoring system when  
assessing developments against the 12 criteria. Developments that achieve at least 9 ‘green’  scores are 
eligible for the Built for Life quality mark, which indicates a high quality of design has been achieved. 
Developments that achieve a ‘green’ score for  all 12 criteria can be  awarded the Built for Life ‘Outstanding’ 
accreditation  through an ind ependent assessment process , with the best developments recognised at BFL 
12 organised events.  
11.11  The Suffolk Design Review Panel was established by the Royal Instit ute of British Architects Suffolk in 2012, 
to help consider the design quality of planning ap plications. Comprised of local design experts, the aim of 
the Panel is to promote and encourage high standards in design of the built environment across Suffolk. In 
determining planning applications, regard is given to any recommendations detailed in the r eports 
generated by the Design Review Panel.  
11.12  The East Suffolk  Quality of Place awards , reviewed by judges which are comprised of local design experts 
and chaired by a District  Councillor, are a celebration of the effort being made by people across East 
Suffolk to add to the quality of the environment, by creating high quality designs in both the built and 
natural environment and helping to conserve historic buildings.  The best designed developments across 
the District  are recorded on the Council’s website.  
11.13  The Suffolk Coastal Local Plan area  has a large proportion of older residents  and as such the need for 
housing to meet the needs of an ageing population is  increasing. The Office for National Statistics predicts 
the population for the over 65 age group is  set to increase by 59.7% between 2014 and 2039 across 
Suffolk. The RTPI’s recent Dementia and Town Planning Document60 and the Alzheimer’s Society state th at

million by 2021 and to 2million by 2051. It is therefore important that the design of the built environment 
caters for people throughout their lif etime and is suitable and accessible for people regardless of age, 
mobility or disability. This polic y establishes the considerations against which residential developments will 
be considered, to provide for the needs of the most vulnerable in our society.   
11.14  Creating a high quality environment for the elderly and those with disabilities will also result in  a high 
quality environment for young people, for families with young children, and ultimately for everyone. 
Felixstowe has established a reputation as a D ementia Friendly Town, which can be attributed to 
Felixstowe Town Council actively engaging with comm unities as a Dementia Friendly Organisation and a 
Dementia Action Alliance Member.  
Dementia Friendly Design Principles   
 Familiar environments – functions o f places and buildings are obvious, any changes are small 
scale and incremental;  
 Legible environment – a hierarchy of street types, which are short and fairly narrow. Clear signs 
at decision points;  
 Distinctive environment – A variety of landmarks, with ar chitectural features in a variety of 
styles and materials. There is a variety of practical features ( e.g. trees and street furniture);  
 Accessible environment – Land uses are mixed with shops and services within a 5 -10 minute 
walk from housing. Entrances to  places are obvious and easy to use and conform to disabled 
access regulations.  
11.15  Inclusive design is concerned with understanding how we use places differently and how this can inform 
design decisions for the benefit of all users. Inclusive design is defined as the design of mainstream 
products and/or services that are accessible to and useable by, as man y people as reasonably possible 
without the need for special 
adaptation or specialised 
design. However, it is also 
important that inclusive 
design rec ognises the need 
for specialised adaptation 
where necessary. The 
principles of inclusive design 
detailed i n above should be 
considered as standard 
practice and at the earliest 
possible opportunity in the 
evolution of development 
proposals with the aim of 
creating balanced and mixed 
communities.  
Built and Historic Environment  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
183  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 11.16  Developers are advised to undertake pre -application consultation w ith local communities when proposing 
development. They are encouraged to seek views regarding local community needs and expectations from 
a broad spectrum of the community, in relation to the design of a proposal. Applicants are e ncouraged to 
engage with c ommunities through the use of Building for Life 12.   
11.17  Policy SCLP5.8 Housing Mix details the policy requirements in relation to accessible and adaptable 
dwellings, under Building Regulations standard M4(2). The requirements will be  met where a new dwelling 
makes reasonable provision for most people to access the dwelling and incorporates features that make it 
potentially suitable for a wide range of occupants, including older people, those with reduced mobility and 
some wheelchair u sers. This policy will hel p to ensure the principles of inclusive design are met.

The Council will support locally distinctive and high quality design that clearly demonstrates an 
understanding of the key features of loca l character and seeks to e nhance these features through 
innovative and creative means.  
In so doing, permission will be granted where proposals:  
a) Support inclusive design environments which are legible, distinctive, accessible, comfortable, and 
safe, and ado pt the principles of demen tia friendly design;  
b) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the character of the built , historic  and natural environment 
and use this understanding to complement local character and distinctiveness  through  robust 
evidence , informed sources and site specific context and analysis ; 
c) Respond to local context and the form of surrounding buildings in relation to the following 
criteria:  
i. the overall scale and character should clearly demonstrate consideration of the 
component parts of the bu ildings and the developmen t as a whole in relation to its 
surroundings;  
ii. the layout should fit in well with the existing neighbourhood layout and respond to the 
ways people and vehicles move around both internal and external to existing and 
proposed buildin gs; 
iii. the height and massing  of developments should be well related to that of their 
surroundings;  
iv. there should be a clear  relationship between buildings and spaces and the wider street 
scene or townscape; and  
v. high quality materials appropriate to the local context  should be used ; 
d) Take account of any important landscape or topographical features and retain and/or enhance 
existing landscaping and natural and semi -natural features on site;  
e) Protect the amenity of the wider environment, neighbouring uses and provide a good standard of 
amenity for future occupiers of the proposed development;  
f) Take into account the need to promote  public safety and deter crime and disorder through well lit 
neighbourhoods and development of public spaces that are overlooked;  
g) Create permeable and legible d evelopments which are easily accessed, throughout the site and 
connections outside the site, an d used by all, regardless of age, mobility and disability;  
h) Provide highway layouts with well integrated car parking and landscaping which create a high 
quality public realm and avoid the perception of a car dominated environment . In doing so, 
proposals wi ll be expected to prioritise safe and convenient pedestrian and cycle movement;  
i) Include hard and soft landscaping schemes to aid the integration of the developme nt into its 
surroundings;  
j) Ensure that the layout and design incorporates adequate provision fo r the storage and collection 
of waste and recycling bins in a way which does not detract from the appearance of the 
development; and  Built and Historic Environment  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
185  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n k) Utilise measures that suppor t resource efficiency.  
 
All major residential development proposals will be expected to perform positively when assessed against 
Building for Life 12 guidelines. Developments should seek to avoid red outcomes unless there are 
exceptional circumstances. All Building for Life 12 as sessed schemes will be reviewed once built out and 
compared to initial BfL12 assessments.  
Neighbourhood Plans can, and are encouraged to, set out design policies which respond to their own local 
circumstances.  
 
Residential Amenity  
11.18  The planning system plays an important role in safeguarding the quality of life of residents of the area . 
New development of any type is required to be located and designed with regard to the amenity of both 
existing and future residents to avoid generatin g significant harmful effects. Harmful effects can include 
those arising from overlooking, loss of privacy, noise, odour and light pollution and overbearing 
development. Residential amenity can be affected by individual developments or, as a result of cumu lative 
impacts.  There is a need to consider impact s on the development as well as from the development.  
Policy SCLP11.2: Residential Amenity  
When considering the impact of development on residential amenity, the Council will have regard to the 
following:  
a) Privacy/overlooking;  
b) Outlook;  
c) Access to daylight and sunlight;  
d) Noise and disturbance;  
e) The resulting physical relationship with other properties;  
f) Light spillage ;  
g) Air quality and other forms of pollution; and  
h) Safety and security.  
Development will provide fo r adequate living conditions for future occupiers and will not cause an 
unacceptable loss of amenity for existing or future occupiers of development in the vicinity.  
 
Historic Environment  
11.19  Heritage gives places their character and individuality. It creat es a focus for community pride, a sense of 
shared history, and a sense of belonging. Historic buildings and the historic parts of our towns and villages 
provide a focus for social and economic activity. Historic places that are w ell-maintained and well -Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  186 man aged add greatly to cultural life, community resilience and our individual and collective wellbeing. The 
conservation and enhancement of this heritage contributes directly to a healthier environment, benefiting 
people and offerin g support to thriving rural  economies which are home to a large amount of the historic 
fabric in the former Suffolk Coastal  area .  
11.20  The acknowledged quality of the built, natural and historic environments within the former Suffolk Coastal 
area  is one of its key assets, making it an a ttractive area to live, work and visit. Th is area  is home to around  
2,300 Listed Buildings, 36 Conservation Areas, over 100 Scheduled Monuments, more than 7,300 sites of 
archaeological interest and 7 Parks and Gardens of Speci al Historic Interest as well a s 17 locally identified 
historic parklands  and 1 protected wreck, alongside a military history . Within the former Suffolk Coastal 
area  the heritage assets characteristic of the area reflect the important coastal, cultural, far ming and 
military history and relate to a diverse range of building typologies including resort tourism, aviation, 
landed estates and park and garden structures amongst many others.  Of international importance is the 
archaeological Anglo -Saxon royal burial  site of Sutton Hoo; Bawdsey M anor which is significant for the 
development of radar; and Snape Maltings, a cultural venue of outstanding significance. The quality of the 
former Suffolk Coastal area is crowned by these highly valuable sites, the diversity of which illustrates the 
varia tion of the area’s distinctiveness.  
11.21  These heritage assets need to be protected and enhanced for the benefit of current and future 
generations. National policies require Local Plans to set out a positive strategy for the protec tion and 
enhancement of these valuable assets. It is recognised that heritage assets are significant and are a 
resource that cannot be replaced. Therefore, the Council intends to pursue a policy approach that 
incorporates a positive strategy for the protec tion and enhancement of the former Suffolk Coastal area’s  
heritage assets.   
11.22  National planning policy states that a heritage asset can be a building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape, identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions 
beca use of its heritage interest. Designated herit age assets are defined in the National Planning Policy 
Framework as World Heritage Sites, Scheduled Monuments, Listed Buildings, Protected Wreck Sites, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, Registered Battlefields and Conservation Areas. It is acknowledged that 
large developments and small developments can have a similar impact on designated heritage assets, 
whether that be singularly or cumulatively.  
11.23  Policy for determining proposals that would affect a heritage asset i s set out in the National Planning Policy 
Fram ework. The Council will therefore rely on national policy and guidance in this regard.   
11.24  Heritage protection is most effective, and the benefits of the historic environment are most likely to be 
seen, when local  communities are engaged and encouraged to dis cover, understand and appreciate their 
history. The Neighbourhood Plan process, in this respect, plays an important role in identifying and 
protecting locally important/significant heritage assets. Therefore, t he Council will encourage any future 
Neighbour hood Plans to consider identifying and protecting non designated heritage assets.  
11.25  It is generally recognised that encouraging active use of a heritage asset is the best way to prevent 
deterioration and a proact ive approach such as this is supported by the Council, where possible.  In all Built and Historic Environment  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
187  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n cases there will be an expectation that any new development will enhance the historic environment or 
better reveal the significance of the heritage asset, in the first instance, unless there are no identifiable 
opportunities  available.  In instances where existing features are found to have a negative impact on the 
historic environment, the Council will encourage the removal of those features that undermine the historic 
environment  as part of any proposed development.  The Coun cil will encourage the provision of creative 
and accessible interpretations of heritage assets impacted by development, where this is appropriate to 
the asset and the development. Such interpretations should lo ok to promote and display the features of 
the asset that make it a heritage asset.  
11.26  Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment should be achieved in line with Policy  SCLP9.2, 
where possible.  
11.27  Heritage assets should not be allowed to fall into a state of disrepair as a means of gaining pla nning 
permission or increasing the likelihood of such. The Council will ensure that any identified or evidential 
deterioration or damage to a heritage asset, as a result of deliberate or intentional neglect, wi ll not be 
taken into account to secure develop ment that would otherwise be unacceptable, in line with national 
planning policy.  
11.28  In accordance with good practice the Council will strive to maintain a register of Listed B uildings at risk. 
The Council will w ork with owners in this respect, but also has access to a range of statutory powers, 
where needed. Evaluation of proposals that have an impact on buildings at risk should apportion weight to 
any impacts that positively enhance a building at risk.  
11.29  The Reta il & Commercial Leisure Town Centre Study 2017  indicates that historic and small sites contribute 
to a balanced mix of retail in the town centres of the former Suffolk Coastal area . Proposals for new 
shopfronts or retail uses should carefully consider the contribution to the street scene, balanced aga inst 
the need for shops and services to be accessible.  
11.30  Heritage Impact Assessments and/or  Archaeological  Assessments will be required  for proposals related to, 
or impacting on, heritage assets and their settin g and/or known or possible  archaeological  sites, and where 
there is potential for encountering archaeological sites. This is to ensure that sufficient information is 
provided to assess the significance of the heritage assets and to assess the impacts of de velopment on 
heritage  asset s alongside any public benefits.  
11.31  Pre-application consultation with the Council is encouraged to ensure the scope and detail of a Heritage 
Impact Assessment and/or Archaeological Assessment is sufficient. The level of detail of a Heritage Impact 
Assessment and/or Archaeological Assessment should be proportionate to the scheme proposed and the 
number and significance of heritage assets and/or known or possible archaeological sites affected.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment

All development proposals which have the potential to impact on heritage  assets or their settings should 
be supported by a Heritage Impact Assessment and/or an Arc haeological Assessment prep ared by an

11.32  Listed Buildings are designated heritage assets and, as such, are afforded a high level of protection. There 
are around 2,300  Listed Buildings in the former Suffolk Coastal area . Listed Building consent will be 
required for many works relating to Listed Buildings, and is a separate consent to planning permission. 
National planning policy rela ting to Listed Buildings, as designated assets, is contained in the National 
Planning Policy Framework and will be applied alongside Policy SCLP11.4. As set out in th e relevant 
sections of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, in considering whether to 
grant planning permission or listed building consent for development that impacts a listed building, or its 
setting, the decision maker must h ave regard to the desirability of preserving the listed building or its 
setting or any fea tures of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.  
Policy SCLP11.4: Listed Buildings  
Proposals to alter, extend or change the use of a listed bui lding (including curtilage listed structures) or 
development affecting its setting will be  supported where they:  
a) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the significance of the building and its setting alongside an 
assessment of the potential impact of the pr oposal on that significance;  
b) Do not harm the character  of the building  or any architectura l, artistic, historic, or archaeological 
features that contribute towards its special interest;  
c) Are of an appropriate design, scale, form, height, massing and positio n which compl ement the 
existing building;  
d) Use high quality materials and methods of constr uction which complement the character of the 
building;  
e) Retain the historic internal layout of the building; and  
f) Remove existing features that detract from the building to enhance or better reveal its 
significance.

11.33  Conservation Areas are designated heritage assets and are afforded a high level of protection under the 
relevant sections of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas ) Act 1990 and  national planning 
policy. At present, there are 36 designated Conservation Areas a cross the former Suffolk Coastal area , 
ranging from the centre  of older villages and towns to hamlets and include open spaces and the landscape 
setting s. Conservation Areas are an important part of the evidence base which underpins this Local Plan 
and to w hich, the Council will have regard, when determining planning applications for schemes affecting 
Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings.  Amendments may be made to individual Conservation Area 
boundaries as they are re -appraised and consulted upon as part of a separate on -going programme being 
undertaken by the Counc il.  
11.34  There are no Article 4 Directions in former Suffolk Coastal area . Development within Conservation Areas 
will be required to be consistent with measures set out in the relevant Conservation Area Appraisal or 
Management Plan, and any related policies in  the wider Local Plan. The South Felixstowe Conservation 
Area is identified as being ‘at risk’ and within this area proposals will be expected to enhance the 
Conservation Area. Development withi n Conservation Areas should take account of the relevant 
suppl ementary planning guidance. For demolition of listed buildings in a Conservation Area the Listed 
Buildings Policy SCLP11.4 will also apply. National planning policy relating to Conservation Area s, as 
designated assets, is contained in the National Planning  Policy Framework and will be applied alongside 
Policy SCLP11.5.

Development within, or which has potential to affect the setting of, Conservation Areas wil l be assessed 
against the relevant Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans and any subsequent additions or 
alterations. Developments should be of a particularly high standard of  design and high quality of materials 
in order to preserve or enhance  the character or appearance of the area.  
Proposals for development within a Conservation Area should:  
a) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the significance of the conservation area alon gside an 
assessment of the potential impact of the proposal on that s ignificance;  
b) Preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area;  
c) Be of an appropriate design, scale, form, height, massing and position;  
d) Retain features important to  settlement form and pattern such as open spaces, plot divisions, 
position of dwellings, hierarchy of routes, hierarchy of buildings, and their uses, boundary 
treatments and gardens; and  
e) Use high quality materials and methods of construction which compl ement the character of the 
area.  
Proposals for development which affect the setting of a Conservation Area should be considered against 
criteria a), c) and e) above.  
Proposals which involve the demolition of non-listed buildings that make a positive contribut ion to  a 
Conservation Area , including those identified in Conservatio n Area Appraisals and Management Plans,  will 
be expected to demonstrate : 
f) The building is structurally unsound and beyond technically feasible and economically viable repair 
(for reasons other than deliberate damage or neglect); or 
g) All measures to sustain t he existing use or find an alternative use/user have been exhausted . 
In all cases, proposals for demolition should include comprehensive and detailed plans for redevelopment 
of the site.  
 
Non -Designated Heritage Assets  
11.35  Non-designated heritage assets can v ary in type and form, and  should possess a degree of heritage 
significance that merits consideration in planning decisions. Non -designated heritage assets can be either 
buildings or structures, or non -built assets such as archaeological assets and parks an d gardens. The 
Council en courages Neighbourhood Plans to identify non -designated heritage assets, examples of such can 
be seen in the Great Bealings and Martlesham Neighbourhood Plans. Neighbourhood planning groups 
seeking to identify Non -Designated Herita ge Assets are encouraged to work with the Council in developing 
the necessary identification criteria, particularly in respect of potential Non -Designated Heritage Assets 
that are not buildings or structures.  Non-designated heritage assets are not protecte d in the same way as Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  192 Desi gnated Heritage Assets but the identification of them as a non -designated heritage asset is a planning 
consideration when determining applications.  The National Planning Practice Guidance states that Local 
Planning Authorities may identify non -designated h eritage assets that are buildings and that it is helpful to 
have criteria in place to allow the identification of such assets.  
11.36  In relation to archaeological assets, any non -designated heritage assets that are deemed to be of equal  
importance to a Schedule d Monument by way of a heritage assessment and/or Government guidance 
should be considered under the same policy as a Scheduled Monument, in accordance with paragraph 194 
and footnote 63 of the NPPF. In this case, Polic ies SCLP11.3  and SCLP11.7  along with the National Planning 
Policy Framework will apply.  
11.37  The following criteria will be used to establish if any potential non -designated heritage asset that is a 
building or structure meets the definition in the National Planning Policy  Framework at an early st age in 
the process, as advised by the national Planning Practice Guidance. A building or structure must meet two 
or more of these significance -measuring criteria to be identified by the Council as a non -designated 
heritage asset. G reater weight should be a ttributed to the conservation of any building or structure that 
meets more than two of the significance -measuring criteria. The weight attributed should be reflective of 
the number of criteria met.

11.38  The above criteria can be located on the Council’s website and may be subject to change over time, 
therefore, it is advised to consult the website when utilising the criteria. The criteria are also contained in 
Appendix F. W hilst the criteria apply to buil dings and structures, Policy SCLP11. 6 applies to all Non 
Designated Heritage Assets.  The National Planning Policy Framework contains policy in relation to 
assessing the impact of proposals on a Non -Designated Heritage Asset.  Built and Historic Environment  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
193  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP11. 6: Non -Designate d Heritage Assets  
Proposals for the re -use of Non -Designated Heritage Assets which are buildings or structures will be 
supported if compatible with the elements of the fabric and setting of the building or structure which 
contri bute to its significance. Applications, including those for a change of use, which result in harm to the 
significance of a Non -Designated Heritage Asset will be judged based on the balance of the scale of any 
harm or loss , and the significance of the herit age asset .  
In considering proposals which involve the loss of a non -designated heritage asset, consideration will be 
given to:  
a) Whether the asset is structurally unsound and beyond technically feasible and economically viable 
repair (for reasons other than  deliberate dam age or neglect); or  
b) Which measures to sustain the existing use, or find an alternative use/user, have been fully 
investigated.  
Neighbourhood Plans can identify Non -Designated Heritage Assets. However, the protection afforded to 
these should  be no more tha n that provided to Non -Designated Heritage Assets protected by this policy. 
Buildings or structures identified  as Non -Designated Heritage Assets  should at least meet the Council’s 
criteria for identifying Non -Designated Heritage Assets.  
 
Archaeology  
11.39  The former Suffolk Coastal area has a rich, diverse and dense archaeological landscape with the river 
valleys, in particular, topographically favoura ble for early occupation of all periods. The distinctive 
character of the historic environment in  the former Suffolk Coastal area  includes outstanding coastal 
archaeology of all dates, prehistoric burial tumuli on the open heathlands around the eastern mar gins of 
Ipswich and on the Felixstowe peninsula, the remains of Roman small towns at Felixstowe a nd Wenhaston, 
the internationally important Anglo -Saxon burial ground at Sutton Hoo, numerous medieval historic towns 
and villages with both above and below gr ound heritage assets, for example Woodbridge and Aldeburgh, 
and the strategically placed, Napoleo nic Martello towers.  
11.40  Some archaeological sites are designated as Scheduled Monuments, although most assets are non -
designated and sometimes not known of until development proposals come forward. Scheduled 
Monuments , and non -designated heritage assets of ar chaeological interest that are demonstrably of 
equivalent significance to scheduled monuments,  are nationally significant assets and afforded great 
protection in the National Planning Policy Framework. The Council recognises that archaeological remains 
are non-renewable resources which are valuable for their own sake and for their role in education, leisure 
and tourism.  
11.41  The Suffolk Historic Environment Record pr ovides information about archaeological sites throughout the 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan area and is used to identify sites that may be at risk from development. Policy Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  194 SCLP11. 7 requires a full archaeological assessment of sites within potential areas of ar chaeological 
importance to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected and to ensur e that provision is 
made for the preservation of important remains, particularly those that may be demonstrably of national 
significance. Archaeological Assess ment prior to determination may comprise a combination of desk -based 
assessment, geophysical surv ey and/or field evaluation.  
11.42  The Council will work with Historic England, Suffolk County Council  and the local community in identifying 
and protecting or relocating archaeology that comes to light as a result of erosion. The level of protection 
afforded sho uld be relative to the significance and importance of the archaeological remains. The known 
rate of erosion should be considered when determining the significance and importance of archaeological 
remains and when determining whether or not relocation of th e archaeological remains is required.  
11.43  Where proposals affect archaeological sites, preference will be given to preservation in situ unless it can 
be shown that recording of remains, assessment, analysis, reporting, dissemination and deposition of 
archive for access and curation, will constitute appropriate mitigation for the impacts of development.  
Archaeological conditions or planning obligations will be imposed on consents as appropriate. Appropriate 
programmes of work post -consent could include some or all of:  
 further evaluation;  
 upfront excavation;  
 paleo -environmental work;  
 building survey an d or monitoring;  
Or  
 control of contractor groundworks.  
11.44  The provision of interpretation about archaeological work will be encouraged, as appropriate to the sca le 
of development and the nature of the archaeological remains.   
Policy SCLP11. 7: Archaeology  
An archaeological assessment proportionate to the potential and significance of remains must be included 
with any planning application affecting areas of known or  suspected archaeological importance to ensure 
that provision is made for the pres ervation of important archaeological remains.  
Where proposals affect archaeological sites, preference will be given to preservation in situ unless it can 
be shown that record ing of remains, assessment, analysis report and/or deposition of the archive is mo re 
appropriate.  
Archaeological conditions or planning obligations will be imposed on consents as appropriate. Measures to 
disseminate and promote information about archaeolog ical assets to the public wil l be supported.

11.45  Registered Parks and Gardens are identified as Designated Heritage Assets within the National Planning 
Policy Framework. In addition to these, Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) 6 identifi es 21 parks and 
gardens of historic interest of 50 hectares or mo re, which are important within the Suffolk Coastal Local 
Plan area . The site size threshold is considered to be an appropriate measure for identifying parklands of 
Authority -wide significance . They are identified primarily for their historic landscape sign ificance, and also 
contribute towards other objectives such as the protection and enhancement of habitats. Policy relating to 
historic parks and gardens identified as Non Designated Heritage Assets is contained with Policy SCLP11. 6. 
The Council will keep t he list of locally identified Historic Parks and Gardens under review and will 
designate further Historic Parks and Gardens where this is considered appropriate.  
11.46  The criteria for identifying  the existing Historic Parks and Gardens  are set out below:  
 The extent of parkland coverage is significant, or has been in the past, usually in excess of 50 
hectares;  
 The parkland either provides, or did so in the past, the setting of an historic house;  
 The parkland’s historical development is considered unique wit hin the District;  
 The parkland’s evolution has been influenced by a notable landscape designer;  
 The parkland contains fine examples of those features associated with historic parklands. These 
features are as follows:  
o Free standing par kland trees,  
o Parkland tree belts, clumps and woodland,  
o Exotic planting,  
o Avenues,  
o Hedges,  
o Grassland,  
o Lakes,  
o Fish ponds and stews,  
o Fountains, cascades and canals,  
o Moats,  
o Ha-has, 
o Parkland buildings,  
o Walls,  
o Kitchen gardens , and  
o Gatehouses, lodges and gateways;  
 The parkland  positively contributes to the wider, surrounding, landscape; and  
 When lying adjacent to a settlement, the parkland provides an attractive setting and, indeed 
may have a relationship with that settlement.  
The boundaries of Historic Parks and Gardens are defined by:  
 That area currently forming the visual extent of parkland, and  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Built and Historic Environment

Proposals affecting or within the designated and non -designated parks and gardens will be required to be 
accompanied by landscape design and management proposals, to ensure a high level of desig n, mitigation

Newbourne: Former Land Settlement Association Holdings  
11.47  Newbourne is defined as a Small Village in the Settlement Hierarchy. The part of Newbourne  which 
comprises the Former Land Settlement Association Holdings i s a unique area within the plan area . The 
Land Settlement Association was set up in 1934 as an experimental scheme to provide unemployed 
workers from depressed industrial areas with employment on the land. The scheme and its legacy can still 
be seen in the  number of large regular shaped plot s, some of which still contain commercial scale 
greenhouses.  
11.48  Due to its unique nature, Newbourne does not have a defined Settlement Boundary in the same way as 
other settlements in the plan area . It is considered that b ackland development, particularly fo r residential 
use, has the potential to harm the character of the village. Whilst it is preferable to maintain the plots and 
their associated horticultural and agricultural buildings in those uses, it is recognised that a number are not 
being used for thei r original purpose or have become derelict. There may be instances therefore where 
low key employment uses would be appropriate on the site of former horticultural and agricultural 
buildings, where this does not result i n the functional or physical separat ion of the dwelling and the wider 
plot.  
11.49  To retain the character, it is also important to continue to control changes which may occur through new 
dwellings or the replacement or enlargement of dwellings and consideration  will be given to the impact on 
the character of the Former Land Settlement Association Holdings area of Newbourne in this respect.  Built and Historic Environment  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
199  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP11. 9: Newbourne - Former Land Settlement Association Holdings  
The Council will encourage the retention of suitab le buildings in horticultural or agr icultural use of those 
parts of the former Land Settlement Association Holdings shown on the Policies Map, not currently used or 
required in connection with the residential curtilages, taking account of any physical feat ures which 
currently mark garden lim its.  
New employment uses on backland plots will be supported where:  
a) It is demonstrated that the land and/or buildings are surplus to agricultural and horticultural 
requirements;  
b) Any new or replacement buildings are of a  scale and nature appropriate to the character of the 
Former Land Settlemen t Association Holdings area;  
c) They do not result in physical  separation of individual plots; and  
d) They are of a suitable design and construction for the proposed use.  
The erection of  new or replacemen t dwellings, or extensions to existing dwellings or ancillary residential 
development will be supported where:  
e) Their scale and design would not harm the character of the former Land Settlemen t Association 
Holdings area; and  
f) In the case of  new dwellings, it  would represent infill development within the existing frontage 
and not  result in backland development.

12.1 This part of the Plan sets out the strategy for specific parts of the plan area  including th e Major Centres of 
Felixstowe and the communities neighbouring Ipswich, the towns and the rural areas. This reflects the 
strategy of the Plan which looks to create two new Garden Neighbourhoods to the north of Felixstowe and 
the south of Saxmundham, respon d to opportunities presented by transport connections, and sustain and 
enhance the vitality of the rural parts of the plan area .  
12.2 The areas are considered below in Settlement Hierarchy order, following the section on Neighbourhood 
Plans, as follows:  
 Neigh bourhood Plans  
 Approach to Site Allocations  
 Strategy for Felixstowe  
 Strategy for Communities Surrounding Ipswich  
 Strategy for Aldeburgh  
 Strategy  for Framlingham  
 Strategy  for Leiston  
 Strategy  for Saxmundham  
 Strategy  for Woodbridge  
 Strategy  for the Rural Ar eas 
Neighbourhood Plans  
12.3 Neighbourhood Plans were introduced through the Localism Act 2011 and enable communities to produce 
their own policies and to allocate sites for development. It is for Town and Parish Councils to decide 
whether they wish to produce a Neighbourhood Plan and  where they do the Council has a supporting role 
in the production of the Plan. Across the plan area , a number of communities have sought to develop their 
own plan, with a total of 18 Neighbourhood Plan areas designated (see Table 1 2.1 and map below). Of 
these, there are 7 ‘made’ Neighbourhood Plans. Once ‘made’ a Neighbourhood Plan forms part of the 
Development Plan for the District.  A Neighbourhood Plan will need to be in general conformity with the 
strategic policies of the Local Plan and communities may  choose to review their Neighbourhood Plans to 
reflect the strategic policies within this Local Plan.  
12.4 Table 12.1 and Table 12.2 below set out the position as at November 2018 for those Towns and Parishes 
which have a designated Nei ghbourhood Plan area. Tr imley St Mary and Woodbridge also have designated 
Neighbourhood Plan areas, however Trimley St Mary Parish Council and Woodbridge Town Council have 
confirmed that they do not wish to progress with a Neighbourhood Plan at present.

referendum, are subject to an Examination undertaken by an independent Examiner. Neighbour hood Plans 
must meet  a s et of ‘basic  conditions’  including  that it must be in general conformity with the strategic 
policies of the Local Plan  and have  regard  to national policy,  as well as complying with regulations relating 
to environmental  assessment and the protection  of habitats . The Council is committed to supporting those 
communities who wish to produce a Neighbourhood Plan and a number of the Local Plan policies contain 
specific guidance in relation to areas of policy that Neighbourhood Plans may choose to cover.  
12.6 The National  Planning Policy Framework requires local planning authorities to provide a housing 
requirement for designated Neighbourhood Plan areas. The Council also appreciates that it is beneficial to 
groups who are planning for housing  in their Neighbourhood Plan t o have an understanding of the broad 
number their plan should address. It is acknowledged that not all Neighbourhood Plan groups will wish to 
address housing, however the Council’s starting point is that Neighbourhood Plan gro ups should have the 
opportunit y to address housing wherever this is appropriate to the strategy of the Local Plan. Policy 
SCLP12.1 therefore provides each Neighbourhood Plan area with an indicative housing number, and the 
Council will support Neighbourhood  Plan groups in the production  of Neighbourhood Plans to identify sites 
to deliver these figures where this is appropriate in the context of the Settlement Hierarchy. 
Neighbourhood  plans  are expected  to plan  positively  to deliver  the housing  requirements  set out in Policy  
SCLP12.1.  In identifying numbers, consideration has been given to the strategy of the Local Plan and the 
position of the settlement in the Settlement Hierarchy. Where positive strategies for the delivery of 
housing are not forthcoming in a  timely way through Neighbour hood Plans, the Council may consider it is 
appropriate to allocate land for housing through a future Local Plan review.  
12.7 In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework, the Local Plan identifies policies which are 
strategic and those which are not strategic. Many of  the policies in the Local Plan are ‘strategic policies’ , 
and these policies together set the overal l strategy for the pattern, scale and quality of development . In 
meeting the ‘basic conditions’ for Neighbo urhood Plans, policies and proposals within future 
Neighbourhood Plans should be in general conformity with these policies. Policies in the Plan do p rovide 
flexibility for Neighbourhood Plans to develop their own locally specific policies and in a number o f policies 
there is specific reference to the types of policies that Neighbourhood Plans may choose to include. 
However, Neighbourhood Plans may cove r other topics and provide local detail in relation to other policy 
areas where appropriate.  Where policies  are identified as not being strategic, as they relate solely to local 
or specific development management matters, Neighbourhood Plans which cover th ese topics will not 
need to demonstrate general conformity with these policies, however they must still hav e regard to any 
relevant parts of national policy. Appendix M of the Local Plan identifies whether policies are strategic or 
non-strategic.  
12.8 Neighbour hood plans will need to consider the infrastructure requirements related to growth planned for 
in the Neigh bourhood Plan. Infrastructure requirements related to the housing numbers identified in 
Policy SCLP12.1 are set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Fr amework and these should be considered, and 
reviewed if necessary, through the production of Neighbourhood Plans.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
205  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.9 In instances where growth in a community is fundamental to the strategy of the Local Plan, it is 
appropriate for this to be planned through t he Local Plan as a strategic policy. In such cases however, 
Neighbourhood Plans may add value through creat ing locally specific policies on other topics. This applies 
to Saxmundham where the Local Plan allocates land for the development of a new Garden Nei ghbourhood 
to the south of Saxmundham.  
12.10  The Neighbourhood Plans that have been made identify visions for the ir areas and cover a range of topics 
that reflect the unique local circumstances of each area. Some, but not all, of the ‘made’ Neighbourhood 
Plans a llocate sites for housing, employment or others uses. Other policies cover such topics as identifying 
areas  of Local Green Space or provision for walking and cycling. Where figures are provided below for 
designated neighbourhood areas that already have mad e Neighbourhood Plans, this provides an 
opportunity for these to be reviewed to identify sites that would m eet the indicative minimum 
requirements set out. Whilst Woodbridge and Trimley St Mary have designated Neighbourhood Plan 
areas, as these plans are n ot being progressed a number is not included.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

207  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Site Allocations  
12.11  In order to ensure that the strategy of the Local Plan is delivered, and to provide a degree of certainty to 
communities, lando wners and developers in relation to the scale and location of growth which will come 
forward during the Local Plan period, the Lo cal Plan allocates sites for housing and employment 
development.  
12.12  The approach to site allocations is based primarily around de livering the strategy of the Local Plan, through 
strategic mixed use allocations for new Garden Neighbourhoods in Felixstowe and Saxmundham, and 
focussing employment allocations on the A14/A12.  
12.13  A ‘call for sites’ was undertaken in autumn 2016 which invited  sites to be submitted for consideration for 
allocation through the Local Plan review. Sites submitted, along with sites which ha d been submitted 
through previous consultations and call for sites exercises, were presented in the 2017 Issues and Options 
consultation document. The 2017 consultation also invited further sites to be submitted.  A small number 
of further additional sites were submitted through the consultation on the First Draft Local Plan.  
12.14  Criteria for assessing a site’s suitability were develo ped to align broadly with other local planning 
authorities in the Ipswich Strategic Planning  Area (Babergh District Council, Mid Suffolk District Council and 
Ipswich Borough Council). The criteria cover the following topics:  
 Access to Site;  
 Utilities Capac ity; 
 Utilities Infrastructure;  
 Contamination;  
 Flood Risk;  
 Coastal Change;  
 Market Attractiveness;  
 Landscape / Townscape;  
 Biodivers ity and Geodiversity;  
 Historic Environment;  
 Open Space;  
 Transport and Roads; and  
 Contributions to Regeneration / Re -use. 
12.15  The ou tcome of this site assessment work is presented in the Strategic Housing and Employment Land 
Availability Assessment (SHELAA).  
12.16  The Settlement Hierarchy forms the starting point for identifying potential locations for site allocations, 
whereby Major Centre s, Towns, Large Villages and Small Villages are considered in principle to be suitable 
locations for development. Consideration w as then given to the opportunities and constraints present in 
each settlement, in particular in relation to:  
 The existence of s uitable sites;  
 Capacity of infrastructure, such as schools and highways;  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

Councils; and  
 Environmental constraints.  
12.17  Following this, potential sites were considered further  in settlements where it was considered that there 
was potential for deve lopment. This involved considering the outputs of the SHELAA and the Sustainability 
Appraisals of sites, the relationship of the site to the settlement form and character, as well as consultation 
responses received in relation to specific sites.  
12.18  By using t he evidence provided in the Ipswich Economic Area Sector Needs Assessment (September 2017) 
and the Employment Land Supply Assessment (2018), the Council is able to direct employment r elated 
allocations to those sites within the identified areas most attrac tive to the market. Directing future 
allocations into these areas will ensure that the Council has greater confidence in the deliverability of 
these sites over the plan period.  
12.19  This Local Plan has reviewed and carries forward the unimplemented allocations  (as at 31st March 2018) 
contained in the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan Document and the

Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
211  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.20  Felixstowe is the largest settlement in the former Suffolk Coastal  area . It is located on a peninsula bounded 
by the River Deben, River Orwell and the North Sea . The peninsula contains areas  designated as being of 
national and international importance for landscape, the environment and nature conservation.  
12.21  The town serves many important functions in respect of community and education provision alongside a 
range of shopping opportunities and facilities for the residents of Felixstowe and the surrounding 
com munities. Felixstowe also benefits from its coastal location and retains an attractive resort with access 
to the beach providing a range of complementary resort  attractions and traditional seaside activities, 
alongside a rich architectural heritage and  high quality buildings. This heritage is reflected in the two 
extensive Conservation Areas that serve to preserve and enhance the predominantly unlisted late 
Victo rian and Edwardian architectural legacy of the resort.  Felixstowe is also home to the largest container 
port in the country which provides a variety of economic opportunities and jobs locally as well as 
supporting the national and international economies.  
12.22  Felixstowe is a town with many different characteristics and the Local Plan seeks to r etain and enhance 
this unique community. The town is well served by a successful town centre with a low level of vacant 
units and provides a mixture of national and indep endent retailers and enterprises . It is anticipated that 
over the plan period there wi ll be further opportunities for social interaction and appropriate residential 
developments . 
12.23  The sea front location is attractive and appeals to a wide variety of residen ts and visitors. The contrast of 
activities and attractions caters for all sectors of the tourism industry which is of great benefit to the town 
and the rest of East Suffolk . In recent years, significant regeneration and investment has taken place in the 
Spa Pavilion, Pier head, Seafront Gardens, Promenade and coastal defences which have be en successful. 
Over the plan period, the success of these regeneration projects and investment will be realised alongside 
future opportunities.  
12.24  Felixstowe is served prima rily by the A14 and a limited number of local roads which provide connections to 
the r est of the District and beyond. In partnership with Suffolk County Council and Highways England, the 
Council will support opportunities over the plan period to promote su stainable forms of transport and 
mitigate transport related issues that may arise as a  result of the cumulative impact of new developments 
within Felixstowe and the surrounding area.  
12.25  Car parking provision is spread across Felixstowe with a variety of short  and long term facilities targeted at 
meeting the needs of residents, visitors to the town centre and resort. In peak periods, the car parking 
provision can be stretched and requires on street opportunities to be utilised. Over the plan period, 
opportuniti es to improve the car parking provision through redevelopment of existing sites (inclu ding multi 
storey) will be encouraged to support the vitality of Felixstowe.  
12.26  Land to the north and south west of Felixstowe is designated as being of national and interna tional 
importance for its landscape and nature conservation interests . Over the plan p eriod opportunities to 
enhance design, landscaping and green spaces will be realised which take account of the town setting and 
protected landscapes , including  opportunit ies to provide for  biodiversity  net gain. Alongside the Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  212 countryside locations, the sea as well as the River Deben and River Orwell provide an important and valued 
backdrop to the town for both residents and visitors.  
12.27  The Port of Felixstowe and businesses a ssociated with the port provide a significant amount of 
employment o pportunities and this is seen in the high volume of commuting flows into the town. Over the 
plan period, it is fundamental that the operations of the Port of Felixstowe are maintained and economic 
opportunities realised, but widening the range of employmen t opportunities in Felixstowe is also 
encouraged. Providing a wider range of employment opportunities in the town will ensure that the local 
economy becomes more resilient and continues to  thrive.  
12.28  In recent years, Felixstowe has experienced a number of pub lic and private regeneration initiatives and 
projects which have had a positive effect on the town and resort. However parts of the town experience 
significant levels of deprivation with s ome areas being in the 10% most deprived areas in the country. Over 
the plan period, opportunities to address the levels of deprivation will be welcomed to provide a 
sustainable future for communities across the town.  
12.29  The town has good transport links thro ugh the A14 and rail access. Both are vital to the operation of the 
Port of Felixstowe as well as to residents and visitors. However, the geographical location at the end of the 
peninsula means there are no suitable alternative routes, particularly for the  HGV traffic when the A14 is 
closed. Maintaining the flow of the tra ffic along the A14 is vital for the Port of Felixstowe and the rest of 
town. Rail services are made up of passenger and freight traffic which provide an alternative to the road  
and it is e ssential that increased capacity on the railway line is realised . Over the plan period, the Council 
will continue to promote improvements to the A14 and  passenger and freight  rail services where 
appropriate due to their regional, national and international  importance  in conjunction with partner 
organisations such as Highwa ys England, Suffolk County Council, Network Rail and Greater Anglia.  
12.30  Felixstowe, like many other parts of East Suffolk has an ageing population. Over the plan period, residential 
opportun ities will be focussed on providing for the needs of the ageing popu lation through appropriate 
accommodation. However, this 
must be balanced by the need 
to provide accommodation for 
younger generations who wish 
to continue to live in the area. 
Increasing n umbers of people 
are looking outside of 
Felixstowe for careers and 
housing, and this Local Plan 
seeks to address this issue by 
providing appropriate housing 
and employment opportunities 
over the plan period.  
 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
213  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP12.2: Strategy for Felixstowe  
The vi sion for Felixstowe will be to retain its role as a thriving coastal resort and major centre with a 
comprehensive range of services and facilities which supports the community of Felixstowe and the 
neighbouring settlements on the Peninsula. Infrastructure improvements are required over the plan 
period to me et future needs as well as enhancing the quality of life of existing communities and visitors.  
Over the plan period a thriving seaside town and port which is attractive to residents of all ages, and 
welco ming to visitors who wish to experience the town’s b eautiful coastal location, built heritage, vibrant 
and diverse retail centre and healthy outdoor lifestyle will be achieved.  
The strategy will seek to ensure that:  
a) Employment opportunities are maintained to support the operations of the Port of Felixstowe and 
a wider range of employment types including tourism and technology related enterprises and sites 
are provided  across the town;  
b) Services and facilities support t he needs of local residents, visitors an d those in surrounding 
communities;  
c) Areas of deprivation are supported through positive interventions;  
d) Dementia friendly environments are created throughout the town;

the housing market and those  of an ageing population and changing demographic over the plan 
period ; and  
n) Open spaces are preserved, enhanced or otherwise re -provided to en sure that all residents have 
easy access to informal  recreational green space.  
The creation of the North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood will provide new opportunities for a leisure 
centre, housing, employment, education provision and community facilities,  focused around the principles Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
215  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood  
 
12.31  The previous  Local Plan (Core Strategy and Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan) sough t to ensure that 
Felixstowe will be further enhanced as a thriving community, coastal resort and port with a mix of 
employment and housing opportunities attractive to residents of a ll ages and welcoming to visitors. The 
North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhoo d encompasses 143ha, a comprehensive development of which is 
expected to deliver a leisure led development, provide up to 2,000 dwellings incorporating dwellings for 
older and young er people, affordable housing and self -build plots.  
12.32  Land at Candlet  Road wa s granted outline planning permission for 560 dwellings by the Secretary of State 
in 2017 and it is anticipated that additional housing will also be provided in this area to complement this 
existing provision,  based upon the principles of establish ing a Ga rden Neighbourhood. The masterplanning 
approach will  ensure that the Candlet Road site is an integral part of the development.  
Masterplan approach  
12.33  It is essential that this Local Plan retains the principles  of the previous Local Plan  and the Counci l consid ers 
that in order to do this there is an opportunity to take a masterplan approach informed by public 
engagement and land owner collaboration . A masterplan will seek , to deliver a leisure led sustainable 
garden neighbourhood to the north of the existing bu ilt up area  of Felixstowe . Landowner collaboration 
and partnership working with a range of stakeholders such as Suffolk County Council, Felixstowe Town 
Council , Trimley St Mary Parish Council, Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB unit  and community gro ups will be 
required . A masterplan approach covering the whole site will be used to inform individual planning 
applications for parcels of land as they come forward over the plan period.  
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  216 12.34  The existing Felixstowe Leisure Centre  and Brackenbury Sports Centre  are coming to the end of their 
operational life and the Council considers it necessary to redevelop these existing facilities with a new 
purpose built modern facility which will serve the community for future generations . As well as being able 
to provide a  destinatio n facility to attract tourists and visitors to Felixstowe . As part of the Council Leisure 
Redevelopment Programme, the purpose of which is to increase participation in health and well being 
activities across East Suffolk  a new leisure centre as part of the  Garden Neighbourhood will meet future 
needs.  The creation of new leisure facilities will be delivered as part of the programme which provides 
redevelopment opportunities at Brackenbury Sports Centre (Policy SCLP12.5) and Felixstowe Leisure 
Cent re (Policy SCLP12.16).  
12.35  In spring 2018, the Council undertook a public consultation survey as a provider of leisure facilities. 
Individuals who currently use the existing facilities in Felixstowe, as well as sports groups and local 
organisations provided re sponses to this consultation. Many respondents to the consultation felt the 
current facilities were inadequate with 68% identifying that they travelled to the existing leisure centre by 
car. The consultation asked what people used the existing facilities f or and the most common responses 
were swimming for leisure and keeping fit, gym use, exercise classes and racket sports. The feedback from 
the consultation will inform the future provision of facilities at a new modern facility. A new modern 
facility will significant ly improve the recreational facilities available to the local community as well as 
reducing the need for old facilities to be closed for a significant period of time  should redevelopment of 
existing provision take place on existing sites . 
12.36  To the  north of F elixstowe, some areas are designated as part of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and provide an attractive landscape on the edge of the River Deben. To 
complement the landscape designation, it is essential that the  masterplan  development proposed for this 
area includes significant green infrastructure provision and areas of natural green space for recreation. 
Integrating the provision of appropriate green infrastructure is a fundamental part of the creation of a new  
Garden Nei ghbourhood in Felixstowe and will complement the existing areas,  the public rights of way and 
the adjacent countryside.  
12.37  The Grove Woodland which comprises broad leaved semi natural woodland has many veteran trees and is 
an important area for wi ldlife and biodiversity along with the playing pitches and open space at Eastward 
Ho. The Grove Woodland and Eastward Ho are well used recreational and community facilities for the 
residents of Felixstowe. Consultation responses have highlighted the import ance of the se existing areas 
and through the masterplanning process these areas are to be retained for continued community uses, 
biodiversity and ecological importance. Although the land at Eastward Ho provides open space and 
recreational activities in the  form of pl aying pitches the quality of these is below what might be expected 
within a Garden Neighbourhood. As part of the masterplan process, opportunities to improve the quality 
and amount of recreational provision will be explored in conjunction with s takeholders . 
12.38  The Garden Neighbourhood  is within close proximity to a number of European protected sites including 
the Stour and Orwell Estuaries SPA/ Ramsar and the Deben Estuary SPA/Ramsar. The Habitats Regulations 
Assessment has identified that the Garden  Neighbourh ood requires the provision of “Suitable Alternative 
Natural Greenspace” (SANG) areas to mitigate any potential impact on the protected sites in the plan area . Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
217  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n These areas provide an alternative on -site recreational opportunity for walkers with o r without d ogs which 
reduces the visitor pressure on the European protected sites and address any likely adverse effects. The 
SANG requirements need to be central to the design and layout of the Garden Neighbourhood and 
provided in convenient locations whi ch are easy  to access. Walking routes which can utilise the existing 
network of public rights of way need to provide opportunity for a long and exhilarating circular walk as an 
alternative to the nearby estuary environments. The size of the SANG areas for the Garden Neighbourhood 
is to be informed by locally relevant information and further provision of natural green space throughout 
the masterplan in accordance with the Habitats Regulations and the principles of Garden Cities . 
Development will also be expe cted to con tribute to the Recreation Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy.  
12.39  The services and facilities outlined as part of the masterplan will in part be provided through the statutory 
responsibilities of service providers and landowners, but to assist the t imely deliv ery of these they will 
need to be supported by residential development.  
Creating a community  
12.40  Felixstowe is well served in respect of community facilities, such as meeting places, places of worship, 
sports facilities and health care provision. However with a comprehensive masterplan it will be essential 
that residents have access to appropriate com munity facilities  and key services such as policing  are 
provided and integrated into the Garden Neighbourhood , with contributions provided to help improve and 
enha nce existing facilities throughout Felixstowe . As the masterplan evolves the Council will wor k with the 
local community, landowners and service providers to ensure the delivery of appropriate facilities over the 
plan period. Through a masterplan approach, the opportunity is available to consider the enhancement, 
extension or re -provision of existi ng facilities such as playing fields and public rights of way  which are 
currently found on the site.  
12.41  In January 2018, Felixstowe became a dementia friendly town. T hrough the Felixstowe Dementia Action 
Alliance set up in 2015 the aim is to make Felixstowe a  dementia friendly community by engaging with 
local businesses and organisations to deliver person centred outcomes in a timely fashion. Across 
Felixstowe organisa tions and businesses are working to identify and implement improvements to assist 
those with dementia in the town.   
12.42  A range of dwelling types and tenures will be required in accordance with housing policies in this Local 
Plan. The opportunity exists to mee t the needs of local people and re -establish higher standards of 
building design which takes into account modern environmental and energy efficient standards to create a 
healthy community. Dwellings targeted at younger people as well as those which meet th e needs of the 
ageing population will be delivered as part of a mix of affordable housing and  open market housing. The 
masterplan approach should also provide for  self-build dwellings . 
12.43  The delivery of some higher density residential areas can introduce a v ariety of designs or different 
character areas into the neighbourhood, whilst still incorpora ting green infrastructure and green spaces.  
12.44  Any new residential development, places a greater demand on the early years provision, primary and 
secondary school pla ces in the area. Suffolk County Council as local education authority has identified a Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  218 need fo r further education provision across Felixstowe64. Through the creation of a masterplan, the 
Council along with Suffolk County Council will seek to ensure that appr opriate provision to accommodate  
630 primary school  places  and early years settings  within t he Garden Neighbourhood . The exact location 
of the primary school  provision  and early years settings will need to be considered early in the 
masterplanning stages , subject to further engagement with Suffolk County Council and landowners  so that 
it takes into account the design and layout of the masterplan which is yet  to be prepared.  
12.45  Depending on the rate of delivery associated with the masterplan development, the C ouncil will work in 
partnership with Suffolk County Council to ensure th at sufficient capacity for secondary education 
provision in Felixstowe is maintained over the plan period.  Felixstowe Academy currently provides 
provision for secondary education in th e town, but over the plan period will require improvements to 
ensure suf ficient capacity is maintained. A contribution via the Community Infrastructure Levy will be 
required towards improvements at Felixstowe Academy.  
12.46  This site falls within the catchment o f Felixstowe library which has been identified as a library where 
improv ements are necessary to enhance  provision, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework. A 
contribution will be requested through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the i mprovement of 
library provision as identified in the Infrastructure Deli very Framework.  
Integration and connectivity  
12.47  An important aspect of any masterplan development of this scale is to ensure that the relationship 
between the existing community and the n ew Garden Neighbourhood is seamless and connections 
between can be easil y navigated through a choice of walking, cycling and vehicular routes.  
12.48  Integrating new connections with the existing network of roads and footpaths will provide opportunities to 
enhan ce the area and encourage ease of movement for all. The area to be maste rplanned is in close 
proximity to established areas of residential development, community facilities such as the Grove Medical 
Centre & Pharmacy, railway station and the town centre. F undamental to the success of any masterplan is 
to ensure that the local community can access existing services and facilities as well as those which will be 
created over the plan period. Taking a comprehensive approach to facilities and ensuring that links  
connecting the new Garden Neighbourhood are attractive to use, secure, well designed and implemented 
at the start of the development will be beneficial to creating a successful community.   
12.49  Currently Candlet  Road is the northern boundary of Felixstowe and as such is anticipated to provide the 
primary vehicular access points into the areas to be masterplanned. It is anticipated that a site of this size 
will require multiple access point for vehicular traffic a s well as further links provided solely for walki ng and 
cycling.  Opportunities to create a network of vehicular and non vehicular (pedestrian and cycling) links 
throughout the Garden Neighbourhood are to be explored to provide interconnectivity and free 
movement through the site and beyond. New vehicular  junctions will need to be established to provide 
 
64 Need identified in the Feli xstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan (2017) along with Statements of Cas e prepared for the Candlet Road 
Planning Inquiry (2016).  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
219  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n access from Candlet Road and ensure that Gulpher Road which is a designated ‘Quiet Lane’ is not used for 
vehicular access. The Council will work closely with  landowners, Suffolk County Council and Highways 
England to establish the most appropriate highway access points. In terms of the wider highways network, 
transport modelling has identified potential issues at Dockspur roundabout and the A14 corridor and 
developers will be expected to work with Highways E ngland to ensure that any necessary works are 
provided for. Transport modelling has also identified potential capacity issues at junctions on Garrison 
Lane. A Transport Assessment will need to consider the s pecific impacts and mitigation further. In relati on 
to promoting rail travel, Greater Anglia have highlighted the need for development proposals to contribute 
to the accessibility of rail stations and the quality of its ancillary facilities and to enhance the visitor 
experience. In this respect, a contri bution relating to Felixstowe rail station may be required.  
12.50  Opportunities to provide off road cycle paths are encouraged to increase recreational opportunities for 
active lifestyles as well as making provis ion to access employment sites (such as the Port of Felixstowe, 
Policy SCLP12.7) through sustainable forms of travel.  
12.51  Introducing a comprehensive approach to green infrastructure will allow the biodiversity networks to be 
enhanced both through natural proc esses and any management techniques that may be i ntroduced over 
the plan period. Guidance from Public Health England is clear that access to the natural environment 
improves physical and mental health and wellbeing for communities. Open space provision at the Garden 
Neighbourhood should be integrated acr oss the development and enable people of all ages to be active.  
12.52  Currently the green infrastructure and biodiversity networks in Felixstowe are supported by the allotments 
which are owned by Felixstowe Town C ouncil. As well as making a valuable contribution  to the biodiversity 
network in this part of East Suffolk , the allotments provide a successful community facility in a location 
well related to the existing Felixstowe communities. Through the masterplan it will be important to 
consider the contribution th e allotments make to the environment and community well being. The 
masterplan approach provides the opportunity to consider the enhancement and/or increased provision of 
allotments to serve the existing and future residents of Felixstowe.  
12.53  A Heritage Impact  Assessment has been undertaken to assess the sensitivity of the heritage surrounding 
the site to development.  The assessment has highlighted that there are a number of Listed Buildings 
outside but in close proximity to the northern boundary of the site, n otably the Grade II Listed Candlet 
Farmhouse, Gulpher Hall and Park Farm Cottages. Development of the site will need to ensure that any 
potential harm to the setting of these buildings is mitigated through t he retention of open spaces and 
important views.  
Comprehensively delivering sustainable development  
12.54  To ensure that the Garden Neighbourhood accords with the principles of sustainable development, 
consultation feedback and evidence has highlighted a variet y of site specific issues that need to be 
conside red as the masterplan evolves.  
12.55  Areas of surface water flooding currently exist within the site and an area within the northern part of the 
site is within Flood Zone 2. The development will need to ensure that any potential risk of flooding from Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  220 surface wat er is addressed and that Sustainable Drainage Systems are an integral part of the masterplan  
through Holistic Water Management . Focusing the development away from the northernmost parts of the 
site will help  to address this, whilst also avoiding the most s ensitive areas in landscape and nature 
conservation terms. Any proposals for  development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk 
Assessment.  
12.56  This allocation spans an area of high archaeological potential and sensitivity, with Prehistoric, Roman, Early 
Saxon, Medieval and other multiperiod remains across the area. Development here will undoubtedly have 
an impact on archaeological sites. It has not been subject to systematic evaluati on, but information in the 
Historic Environment Record records sign ificant cropmarks, indicating remains. In the western part of the 
site, this may include a barrow cemetery. Roman and multiperiod remains indicate a site in the northern 
part of the allocat ion. World War 2 features may also constitute non - designated asset s under the National 
Planning Policy Framework. Suffolk County Council have highlighted that an archaeological assessment 
should be required to inform a masterplan, to inform viability of s chemes, mitigation requirements and 
conservation in situ of signifi cant remains. Any mitigation should involve outreach proposals . 
12.57  Additional floorspace for primary care will need to be provided to meet growth planned in the Felixstowe 
area and therefore a  contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy will be req uired towards 
enhancements in provision. Strategic planning in consultation with the NHS and Ipswich & East Suffolk 
Clinical Commissioning Group will also be required.  
12.58  Suffolk Constabulary  have identified the need for funding for new police facilities as detailed in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework, incorporating new floor space at the Felixstowe Safer Neighbourhood 
Team Police Offices, Police Community Support Officers, equipment and police vehicles . 
12.59  There are existing water mains and sewers in Angli an Water’s ownership within the boundary of the 
masterplan. Individual development parcels will need to give this consideration when bringing forward 
detailed proposals and the  layout shoul d be designed to take these into account . The  existing 
infrastructu re is protected by easements and should not be built over or located in private gardens where 
access for maintenance and repair could be restricted. The existing sewers should be located in  highways 
or public open space. If this is not possible a formal ap plication to divert Anglian Water’s existing assets 
may be required . 
12.60  Development proposals at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary W ater Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Felixstowe  Water Recycling 
Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to serve 
proposed development.  Over the plan period the Council will work with Anglian Water to ensure that 
improvements funded through the Anglia n Water Asset Management Plan are delivered in a timely 
manner alongside the delivery of the Garden Neighbourhood.  Solutions will need to be considered at the 
masterplanning stage.  
12.61  The sit e is located within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suff olk County Council as the Minerals 
Planning Authority. Therefore any planning application should be supported by evidence which assesses 
the quality and quantity of sand and gravel resource s. Planning applications are expected to be supported Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
221  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n by evidence c onsidering the suitability for prior extraction , as directed by the Policy, having regard to the 
Suffolk Minerals and Waste Local Plan and other material considerations. Should the site be considered 
suitable for prior extraction, having regard to the evid ence submitted together with advice from the 
Minerals Planning Authority, an y planning permission for development will be conditioned to take place in 
phases which allow for prior extraction of some or all of the economic resource.  
12.62  The illustration below shows how the Garden Neighbourhood could be developed, and demonstrates the 
principles of creating a community focused around provision of green infrastructure. The masterplan is 
indicative at this stage and further refinement of the masterplan will be inf ormed by responses to the 
Local Plan and community engagement .

Land North of Conway Close and Swallow Close, Felixstowe  
  
12.63  This allocation is carried forward from the Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan Development Plan 
Document (2017).  This site is allocated for development of approximately 150 dwellings.  
12.64  The properties on Conway Close, Swallow Close and Upperfield Drive currently define the edge of the built 
up area of Old Felixstowe with countryside to the north. The l and to the north of Conway Close and 
Swallow Close can provide a natural extension to the built form of Felixstowe without causing a 
detrimental impact on the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or important views of the Deben Estuary.  
Understanding the potential impact  on the natura l beauty  and special qualities  of this area and  identifying  
appropriate  mitigation  measures  to be delivered on  site will be necessary  to               help  conserve  and enhance  the 
nationally  designated  landscape.  
12.65  As the current properties define the edge of the built up area, it will be important to ensure that future 
development on this site is sympathetic to the size and scale of the existing properties. Old Felixstowe is 
predominately 1 or 2 storey buildings and  as this site is bordered by countryside i t is appropriate to retain 
the low rise nature of the area.  
12.66  The Suffolk Coastal Leisure Strategy (2014) and the evidence base supporting that document identifies that 
all new development which results in an increa se in the number of dwellings should contr ibute towards 
the provision of open space. Open space provision can take many different forms and facilities can differ 
from site to site but may include parks and gardens, amenity green space, allotments, play are as, 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
225  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n footpaths or dog walking areas. Develo pers will be required to consider local needs and requirements as 
part of their proposals alongside the nationally published standards of 2.4ha per 1000 population, and will 
be expected to make provision for people  of all ages to be active . 
12.67  Along with a sy mpathetic design to reflect the edge of the built up area, Historic England advise that the 
layout and design will need to be sympathetic to Park Farm Cottages which is a Grade II Listed Building to 
the west of the site.  
12.68  The site lies in an area that is to pographically favourable for early occupation, with Bronze Age ring ditches 
to the north and cropmark evidence of field systems. Archaeological finds on the site to the east suggest 
that extensive remains may be  found on this site. Suffolk County Council h ave highlighted that an 
Archaeological Assessment is to be undertaken at an appropriate design stage prior to the granting of 
outline, technical details or full planning permission.  
12.69  Links to the existing Public  Rights of Way network from new developments are key to promoting 
sustainable forms of travel, as well as providing circular routes for recreational purposes. Upgrading 
Footpath 8 should be given consideration to ensure greater connectivity through the pro posed site.  
12.70  In 2014, an outline planning appl ication was permitted (DC/13/3069/OUT) which provides for up to 200 
units on an adjacent site. In order to understand the cumulative impacts of both sites coming forward with 
access onto Ferry Road, Suffolk Coun ty Council as highways authority will require  a Transport Assessment 
to be undertaken and submitted as part of a future planning application. Part of this Transport Assessment 
will also need to consider the impact the development would have on Gulpher Road  which has been 
designated as ‘Quiet Lane’ by  Suffolk County Council.  
12.71  The site is adjacent to the proposed North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood and this site should be 
designed in a way which enables it to be integrated through appropriate access for vehi cles, pedestrians 
and cyclists with the Garde n Neighbourhood.  
12.72  Kingsfleet  Primary School is forecast to be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period . A 
new primary school will be delivered as part of the North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood with the 
potential to provide capacity f or 630 spaces. A contribution towards  additional school spaces will be 
required as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . Felixstowe Academy currently provides 
provision for secondary educat ion in the town, but over the plan period will require  improvements to 
ensure sufficient capacity is maintained. A contribution will be requested via the Community Infrastructure 
Levy towards improvements at Felixstowe Academy.  
12.73  Early years provision in Fe lixstowe is forecast to be over capacity and therefore  a contribution towards the 
provision of a new setting will be required.  
12.74  The Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group have advised that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required to meet the needs arising from new development, as det ailed in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework . A contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards 
additional primary care floorspace will be requested. Given the close proximity of this s ite to the proposed Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group will also be required.  
12.75  Development proposals at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings  of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary Water  Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Felixstowe  Water Recycling 
Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to serve the 
proposed develop ment.  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this site as being within Flood Zon e 1. As the 
site area is over 1 ha, any proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk 
Assessment.  
12.76  Suffolk County Council have indicated that there is no planned expansion of the Felixstowe household 
waste recycling centre; however, the development proposed in this area would result in an increase in 
throughput at this site and improvements are therefore required. A contribution will be required  through 
the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the improv ement of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.77  Suffolk County Council have provided information relating to library improvements across the plan area . 
This site falls  within the catchment of Felixstowe library which has been id entified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance provision, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework. A 
contribution will be requested through the Community Infrastruc ture Levy towards the improvement of 
library provision as ide ntified in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.78  Greater Anglia have highlighted the need for development proposals to contribute to the accessibility of 
rail stations and the quality of its anc illary facilities and to enhance the visitor experience. In t his respect, a 
contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy relating to Felixstowe rail station may be 
required.  
12.79  The Council’s Environmental Protection Team have advised that an Air Qu ality Assessment would be 
required alongside any future plann ing application to assess the cumulative impacts of the developments

12.80  Land at Brackenbury Sports Centre is expected to become available over the plan period as a result of a 
new purpose built leisure facility as part of the Garden Neighbourhood to the north of Felixstowe. Upon 
the opening  of a new leisure facility the site a t Brackenbury may come forward for residential 
development of approximately 80 dwellings.  
12.81  Brackenbury Sports Centre provides indoor sport facilities, outdoor courts, play areas, open space and car 
parking. Once the leis ure uses have been relocated it will be essential that the play areas and open space 
are retained or redeveloped as part of a comprehensive scheme for this site in accordance with other 
policies in the Local Plan.  
12.82  The site is adjacent to existing residenti al development with walking and cycli ng links connecting High 
Road East and High Row Field which is to be retained. The High Road East District Centre is adjacent to the 
site and this area provides a range of local services and shopping opportunities to su pport the local 
community. The site i s also served by public transport services which provide direct links to Felixstowe 
Town Centre and other parts of the town.  A Transport Assessment will need to consider the cumulative 
impacts of the development with ot her development in Felixstowe.  
12.83  As pr eviously developed land and well served by public transport and local facilities, the site has the 
potential to deliver higher density development which will widen the choice of residential units across the 
District. De velopment which provides units target ed at the ageing population will be welcomed as will the 
delivery of smaller units to provide a mix of residential opportunities . Development should preserve  the 
setting of  surrounding Listed Buildings , with particular regard to Grade II Tyndale House .

12.93  This allocation is carried forward from the Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan Development Plan 
Document (2 017).  The site is allocated for development of approximately 40 dwellings.  The site at Sea 
Road, Felixstowe is a site of 0.58ha and is in a prime location on the sea front. The site is currently used for 
a market on a Sunday and  as a temporary car park dur ing the peak tourist periods.  
12.94  The Sunday Market site is adjacent to Mannings Amusements which provides a leisure attraction for 
Felixstowe. Part of the site, is within Flood Zone 3 as seen on the Flood Risk maps published by 
Environment Agency and will be  a material consideration as part of any future redevelopment proposals.  
12.95  Public consultation responses considered it essential that commercial / tourism related activities on the 
frontage with Sea Road are retained. Retaining th e commercial / tourism relat ed activities on the frontage 
with residential dwellings above would reflect uses seen in other locations on the sea front.  
12.96  The rear of the site is adjacent to existing  residential properties on Mick legate  Road and Beach Station 
Road. Redevelopment of thi s site needs to be sympathetic to the existing residential properties in respect 
of scale, setting and design to ensure that the quality of life of existing residents is safeguarded and that 
future uses on this site are complementary to the established use s. 
12.97  The Sea Road frontage is dominated by tall buildings predominately 3 or 4 storeys high and a similar 
development would be in keeping with the existing streetscene. To ensure the comprehensive 
redevelopme nt of this site it is essential that commercial / tourism related activities are not prejudiced by 
the residential development in relation to issues such as noise, smell or air quality. The Council will expect

12.102  Development proposal s at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Felixstowe  Water Recycling 
Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be ma de available in time to serve the 
proposed development.  The Water Cycle Study also identifies  this site as being within an area of high tidal 
or fluvial flood risk . Any proposals for further development at this site must therefore have regard to this 
issue  and be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
12.103  The current Sunday Market provides an economic benefit to the Felixstowe Peninsula. Redevelopment of  
this site may result in the market being displaced. Relocating the market to an alternative location which is 
easily accessible and meets the needs of the market traders will need to be considered further by the 
Council, Felixstowe Town Council and  landow ners.  
12.104  Suffolk County Council have indicated that there is no planned expansion of the Felixst owe household 
waste recycling centre; however, the development proposed in this area would result in an increase in  
throughput at this site  and improvements are th erefore required. A contribution will be requ ired through 
the Community Infrastructure Levy  towards the improvement of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.105  Suffolk County Council have provided information relating to library i mprovements across the plan area . 
This site falls within the catchment of Felixstowe library which has been identified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance provision, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  A Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

  Policy SCLP12.6: Land at Sea Road, Felixstowe  
0.58ha of land at Sea Road, Felixstowe as shown on the Policies Map, is identified for a mixed use 
development of commercial / tourism uses and approximately 40 residential dwellings.  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) Mixed use development site;  
b) Sea Road frontage of the site to be retained for commercial / tourism related activitie s which are 
in keeping with the surrounding resort activities;  
c) Affordable housing provision to be in line with Policy SCLP5.10;

12.107  This allocation is carried forward from the Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan Development Plan 
Document (2017).  The site is identified for port related employment uses, Prop osals for development 
relating to this site will also be considered against the employment policies in Chapter 4.  
12.108  The previ ous Local Plan identified the Port of Felixstowe as a Strategic Employment Area because of its 
contribution to the sub -regional, nati onal and international economies. As well as the operations within 
the Port itself, many businesses and organisations rely on the activities of the port for their own 
operations, such as shipping, logistics, distribution and transport companies which are c ommon across the 
southern part of the former Suffolk Coastal  area . 
12.109  Employment opportunities across the Felixstowe Peninsula  are dominated by the Port of Felixstowe. The 
New Anglia LEP Norfolk and Suffolk Economic Strategy  (2017) , outlines that ‘Felixstowe is the UK’s largest 
container port, handling 40% of the national container traffic. ’ The Port employs over 2,700 people dir ectly 
and a further 10,000 jobs are based in related industries. In recent years the Port has undergone 
significant expansion and inv estment which has seen improvements to the railway connections, and 
further infrastructure has enabled the Port to handle t he latest mega -vessels. However, it will be 
important to balance pressure on rail capacity to ensure quality rail services remain for  both passenger 
and freight users.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
235  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.110  The East Inshore and East Offshore Marine Plans 65support port growth and development to  protect the 
economic interest of the port whilst seeking to prevent development which may restrict the ability to 
respond to future g rowth opportunities that the Port of Felixstowe may consider.  
12.111  The Employment Area allocation identifies the extent of lar ge scale employment opportunities to meet 
both local and national needs. It has been defined to cover the majority of the port related  activities which 
are currently located in this area through planning applications and lawful uses. It is bound primarily by the 
A14, the River Orwell and the railway line which provides a valuable alternative means of transportation  
and needs to be safegu arded to ensure continued economic prosperity.  
12.112  The port related activities within the Employment Area benefit from being c lustered in one location to 
make use of existing strategic infrastructure and opportunities, as well as minimising the negative impact s 
on residents and of other businesses. There is also an emphasis on retaining existing employment 
opportunities, and inte nsifying activities within the employment area.  However, the demand for land 
within the port is always high and operations need to be flexible to cope with changing requirements and 
activities. In recent years the Port of Felixstowe has seen demands for ad ditional space to enable increased 
productivity in respect of container storage and facilities associated with the Roll -on and Roll -off services 
that operate from Felixstowe.  
12.113  Ensuring that there is sufficient infrastructure to support the Port of Felixsto we will be fundamental to the 
continued success of the Employment Area.  
12.114  Alongside the port related activities, a number of small scal e complementary uses are also found within 
the Employment Area. These complementary uses serve the needs of the Port and t he businesses and 
support the economic activity in this area. Small scale complementary uses such as cafes, small 
convenience shops or  childcare nurseries may be appropriate within the  Employment Area, or another 
well related location where these do not ha ve a detrimental impact on the overall function of the 
employment area, Town Centre or District Centres.  
12.115  The Habitats Regulation Asses sment and Natural England have identified that any future applications for 
development at the Employment Area will need to be subject to Habitats Regulation Assessment screening 
to mitigate any significant adverse effects on the Special Protection Areas. T he Habitats Regulations 
Assessment will need to consider the nature of development and the proximity to th e Stour and Orwell 
Estuaries SPA and may need to cover issues such as noise, lighting, disturbance, contamination and 
dredging. Anglian Water have ide ntified a need to improve the foul sewerage network at the Port to 
enable future development of this  site.  
12.116  The Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study indicates that the Felixstowe water 
recycling centre will be overcapacity by 2030 and  will require improvements to increase capacity. The

Policy SCLP12.7: Port of Felixstowe  
The Port of Felixstowe is identified on the Policies Map as an existing E mployment Area. Land will be 
promoted and safeguarded for employment, activities and operations which support the retention, 
expansion and consolidation of the Port  of Felixstowe and the jobs associated with the Port.  
Employment proposals which are considered to be of a  strategic scale and nature, or those which generate 
large movements of heavy goods vehicles will be directed to sites within the Employment Area. Imp roving 
the capacity of the foul sewerage network and seeking opportunities to enhance  transport links on t he A14 
and railway line will need to be undertaken to ensure that the Port of Felixstowe continues to operate 
efficiently as a major contributor to th e local and national economies.  
Proposals which provide small scale complementary uses which serve the ancillary needs of those 
businesses operating within the employment area will be supported, where necessary, where they are not 
detrimental to the overal l function of the Employment Area, Town Centre or District Centres.  
Applications for development of this site will need to be subject to a Habitats Regulation Assessment 
screening. Any development which would result in significant adverse effects  on protec ted landscapes 
such as the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  which could not be appropriately mitigated will not be 
permitted. Future development will also require improvements to the foul sewerage network to be 
undertaken.

this site will also be considered against the e mployment pol icies in Chapter 4.  
12.118  Land at Bridge Road Felixstowe is to be retained as an employment area. The area was identified within 
the 2001 Local Plan and is still appropriate to protect for employment purposes. Retention of existing 
operations on thi s site is ess ential as this site provides employment opportunities in a location which is 
well related to Felixstowe Town Centre, as well as some small scale units which serve a variety of needs.  
12.119  The employment area is in close proximity to residential pro perties on St  Andrews Road and it is important 
that the residential amenity of these properties is not adversely affected by employment operations. In 
order to ensure that detrimental impact is kept to a minimum the Council will seek to resist large number s 
of traffic movements on this site as well as controlling hours of operation.  
12.120  Vehicle movements and turning within the site is problematic. Over time and as opportunities arise 
consideration should be given to the introduction of a turning head to ensure that issues f acing vehicular 
movements within the site are resolved.  
12.121  Development proposals at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich

this site will also be considered against the employmen t policies in Chapter 4.  
12.129  Land at Haven Exchange w as allocated as part of a general employment area in the 2001 Local Plan. Since 
that allocation, the site has been subject to various planning applications and proposals which retain the 
employment uses on t he site as well as other uses which create jobs. The site as seen on the Policies Map 
currently has a mixture of office type uses, a McDonalds restaurant , Lidl Supermarket  and vacant parcels of 
land.  
12.130  On the northern boundary is the Peewit Hill area of ope n space. Beyond this area is an established 
resid ential area  and opportunities to create sustainable links for pedestrians and cyclists are to be created . 
To the east of the employment site is the Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Peewit Caravan Park which  
provide an important contribution to the tourist  accommodation offer across the Felixstowe Peninsula. 
The caravans and holiday park are low rise (predominately one storey in height) and any future 
employment development will need to be sympathetic to the surrounding areas.  
12.131  The proximity of these residen tial and holiday uses preclude the use of the site for uses which may cause a 
detrimental impact on the residential amenity of the area. Uses which involve a large number of heavy 
goods vehicles will be resi sted in this location, in order to minimise the i mpact upon the existing residential

Felixstowe Sea Front  
12.135  The Suffolk Coastal Local Plan continues to recognise the importance of the tourism industry in Felixstowe 
primarily centred on the coastal location, resort activities and proximity of the town to the Suffolk Coast 
and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
243  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.136  Felixstowe is the largest tourist resort in the former Suffolk Coastal  area  and offers a wide range of 
attractions and facilities to cater for a variety of tourist needs and requireme nts, as well as those of local 
residents and businesses. At peak periods car parking provision is not sufficient to meet demand which can 
result in conflicts between visitors, residents and businesses across the town. Over the plan period, the 
Council will  continue to monitor car parking provision and use to ensure demand at peak periods is not 
detrimental to the local commu nity and the town’s economy. The introduction of Shared Space in the 
town centre, new beach huts, new coastal defence works, and redeve lopment of the Spa Gardens, 
Martello Park and the Pier demonstrate a long standing commitment to inward investment in the  resort 
and across the town.  
12.137  The East Suffolk Business Plan identifies specific actions for Felixstowe which focus on the resort and 
tourism opportunities and this Local Plan seeks to ensure further opportunities are realised over the plan 
period.  
12.138  Felixsto we’s long promenade which stretches from Felixstowe Ferry in the north to Martello Park in the 
south provides direct access to the beach and sea. Previously it was not possible to access the beach at 
Cobbolds Point but r ecent works in respect of co astal ma nagement have enabled opportunity to access 
this area which is of great benefit to the resort. The coastal management works have made further 
provision for a continuous promenade  along the sea front and  help to ensure Natural England’s 
requirements  are met  in respect of a Coastal Path around England.  
12.139  Along the frontage there are clearly defined areas which serve different markets and cater for varying 
needs. These were originally established through the Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan and are being 
carried forward in this Local Plan. The areas are:  
 Felixstowe Ferry and Golf Course  
 Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club to Cobbolds Point  
 Cobbolds Point to the Spa Pavilion  
 Spa Pavilion to Manor End  
 Manor End to Landguard  
12.140  Protecting the distinct character of various parts of the sea front is necessary, but flexibility needs to be 
promoted to ensure that appropriate redevelopment opportunities can be taken up at the appropriate 
time, to boost Felixstowe’s wide ranging tourist industry. The Council consider it e ssential  that the wide 
range of tourism activities taking place in Felixstowe are maintained and regenerated to promote year 
round tourism based on the environmental, cultural and social attractions of Felixstowe.  
 
Felixstowe Ferry and Golf Course  
12.141  Felixst owe Ferr y pre -dates much of the rest of the town, having developed as a small fishing and boat 
building community at the mouth of the River Deben. Many of these original activities are still taking place 
alongside a small number of residential dwellings an d other business uses. The high quality of the Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  244 landscape with views of the estuary, sea and open countryside provide opportunities for recreation and 
make the area popular for residents and visitors alike.  
12.142  Felixstowe Ferry is outside of the Settlement Boun dary of Felixstowe and is therefore considered to be a 
countryside location where any development proposals are strongly resisted unless material 
considerations justify an exception. Maintaining the current access to the water in this area is fundamental 
to the lo cal community and visitors alike. As well as access to the water it is essential that limited parking 
provision and turning opportunities are retained to ensure the free and satisfactory movement of 
vehicular traffic in this location without having  an adve rse impact on the unique character of the area.  
12.143  South of Felixstowe Ferry is Felixstowe Ferry Golf Course which has an open character adjacent to the sea 
wall. The sea wall provides a public footpath which links Felixstowe Ferry with other tourist activiti es and 
further car parking opportunities.  
Policy SCLP12.11: Felixstowe Ferry and Golf Course  
Felixstowe Ferry is to be protected to ensure that the unique traditional character continues to contribute 
to the overall tourism offer. Any future devel opment p roposals need to be sympathetic to the traditional 
low key activities in the area. Views and interactions between the existing buildings, landscape and water 
need to be retained to maintain the overall setting of Felixstowe Ferry as a small fishing  and boa t building 
community.  
Proposals for new access points to the river or houseboats within existing houseboat areas as shown on 
the Policies Map will only be supported where they do not have a detrimental effect on the Special 
Protection Area.  
The ope nness of  the Golf Course is to be protected as this area provides uninterrupted views of the AONB 
and the sea.  Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club is recognised as an important leisure, community and tourism 
facility and proposals which significantly improve the cl ub house  facilities in order to safeguard the long 
term future of the golf club will be welcomed where they retain the openness of the golf course . 
Public access along the sea wall is to be retained within the area to ensure that sustainable links and 
conn ections are provided to maintain the unique character of the community and reduce the dominance 
of the car.

245  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club to Cobbolds Point  
12.144  This part of the Felixstowe frontage is characterised by low impact uses of beach huts and traditional gree n 
open spaces on the cliff top. Limited commercial activities provide a tranquil and peaceful environment.  
12.145  Development on the cliff top is to be restricted to activities such as car parking, beach huts, sea angling 
opportunities or other to urism related us es (kiosks) to ensure that the open character of the cliff top is 
retained and views of the sea are not obstructed.  
12.146  Beach huts provide an essential contribution to the Felixstowe tourist industry and provide a unique 
seaside experience enj oyed in various locations on the east coast. Previous Local Plans have sought to 
concentrate beach huts in specific areas enabling the number of beach huts to be managed in a planned 
manner and avoid conflict with other sea front activities. Beach huts sho uld be sited so as not to cause 
unnecessary blockages to the promenade.  
12.147  The area around Cobbolds Point has a special character of large residential curtilages on the cliff top within 
the Settlement Boundary. Sub division of these curtilages will be resiste d unless in exce ptional 
circumstances.  
Policy SCLP12.12: Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club to Cobbolds Point  
The area from Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club House to Cobbolds Point is characterised by the open green cliff 
top and undeveloped nature of the seafront with  car parking opp ortunities.  
Traditional beach huts and gardens provide a tranquil and unique character which is to be retained. 
Proposals which retain the undeveloped non -commercial character of this area will be supported. New 
development will only be acc eptable in excep tional circumstances where it contributes or is essential to 
support ing existing tourist activities.  
Beach huts will be concentrated in this location and where possible kept below the level of the cliff to

commercial activities will be welcomed where they do not have a detrimental impact on the surrounding 
residential areas.  
12.149  Following major investment i n 2015, the Spa Garde ns are a major tourist attraction for the town, providing 
a high quality environment that respects the traditional character of the area. The Spa Pavilion which 
reopened in 2015 also provides a boost to the tourism and cultural activit ies in Felixstowe.

Proposals which offer tourist and commercial activities on the ground floor and maintain an active 
frontage will be supported, provided they do not have a detrimental impact on residential  uses or the 
wider to urism offer.  
The Spa Gardens provide a major attraction which is enjoyed by residents and visitors. These areas will be 
maintained as formal gardens and open space. No further beach huts or kiosks will be located in this area 
except in  exceptional circumst ances, such a s providing significant economic benefits to the resort.

12.150  This area of Felixstowe provides a number of traditional seaside  uses such as amusement arcades, crazy 
golf, fairground rides, eating and drinking establishm ents, Pier head and Leisure Centre. The mix of uses 
along this section of the sea front provides attractions for residents and visitors.  
12.151  Adjacent to Sea Road and U ndercliff Road West, are numerous residential streets which provide a mix of 
permanent dwelli ngs as well as guest house / B&B uses to serve the tourism industry. Residential uses in 
close proximity to active tourist uses may provide conflict at times, espe cially during the peak periods 
when car parking within the resort becomes an issue for local people and visitors alike.  
12.152  Maintaining the active commercial frontages on the ground floor with a focus on tourist activity is 
fundamental to the local economy and  opportunities for promoting year round tourism will be supported. 
Tourism and other commerci al related uses are preferable on upper floors, but where this is not possible 
or viability dictates otherwise, residential development will be welcomed.  
12.153  The Pier head (redeveloped in 2017) and Leisure Centre provide the anchors to ensure year round touris m. 
These facilities and their central location are fundamental to the success of the Felixstowe sea front. 
Proposals for the redevelopment of the Leisure Centre wi ll need to be complementary with the 
surrounding tourism and resort activities and provide a landmark attraction which has wider economic and 
social benefits. Redevelopment of the Leisure Centre will need to be carefully considered in relation to the 
surro unding built environment and take account of physical site constraints. Opportunities for 
redevelopment will only be required once a new Leisure Centre has been opened in accordance with the 
masterplan approach for North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood.  
12.154  Bent Hill and Convalescent Hill provide the opportunity for redevelopment which could complemen t the 
tourism uses in Felixstowe alongside improving the links between the resort and the town centre.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

The Council will support and promote high intensity tourist uses in this area, with a high proportion of 
these to be located along the Sea Road frontage. The area has, in part, a rich Edwardian and Victorian 
character and any proposals will need to maintai n the active commercial frontage and be of a high quality 
design which respects the town’s heritage. Proposa ls which actively encourage new resort experiences will 
be welcomed.  
Resort related uses will be supported on the Sea Road frontage. Proposals shoul d consider the whole site 
for resort related uses to provide a vibrant mix of activities. Where this is not possible or unviable there 
may be opportunities for residential units on upper floor or at the rear of sites.  
Additional beach huts in this area wil l be limited to locations which complement the existing resort uses 
and do not fill the important gaps betwe en huts.  
The Leisure Centre and the Pier head are the focal point of tourism related activities in Felixstowe. 
Proposals which seek to redevelop and  support this central location will be supported to ensure that the 
resort offers a range of high quality at tractions for visitors and residents , as set out in Policy SCLP12.16.  
Between the Pier and the Spa Pavilion, activities which promote cultural attra ctions including cafes, 
restaurants and shops on the ground floor will be supported where they make a positi ve contribution to 
the significance of the two Conservation Area s, and respect the Registered Gardens  and the Victorian and 
Edwardian architectural heritage of the resort. Proposals which provide a link between the resort and the

12.155  The Landguard Peninsula is an area of contrast with the Scheduled Monumen t of Landguard Fort (Grade I 
Listed), the Port of Felixstowe, a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The historic 
inter est needs to be carefully considered against the favourable habitats for wildlife and breeding birds 
and recre ational opportunities for residents and visitors.  
12.156  The existence of a number of potentially conflicting land uses and activities in close proximity  to one 
another needs to be carefully managed to ensure that activities are not detrimental to one another or the 
Felixstowe Peninsula as a whole.  
12.157  The Landguard Partnership66 is a long standing partnership between key players involved with the 
Landguard Pen insula. The Partnership seeks to provide a long term  framework for the future management 
and development of this highly valued coastal peninsula. The Partnership recognises the very special 
qualities of the area which are of importance locally, nationally and internationally.  
12.158  Through the Landguard Partnersh ip, the Council was able to secure improved opportunities for public 
viewing of the Port of Felixstowe. Any future redevelopment of the Port adjacent to Landguard, will need 
to be carefully considered. Th e Landguard Partnership will have an important role in considering mitigation 
measures necessary to ensure that proposals do not have a detrimental impact on the Scheduled 
Monument and environmental designations.  
Policy SCLP12.15: Manor End  to Landguard  
The Landguard  Peninsula is a key contributor to the tourism offer in Felixstowe but is an area where visitor 
numbers and attractions need to be balanced with the protection of the Scheduled Monument, and 
maintain the favourable condition of the Site of Spec ial Scientif ic Interest and Local Nature Reserve.  
Uses which are sympathetic to the unique landscape and Scheduled Monument will be supported where 
additional traffic generation is mitigated and appropriately managed through improved access and car 
parking  arrangement s to minimise the impact.  
Any future redevelopment of the Port in this area will need to be carefully considered with the Landguard 
Partnership. Redevelopment of the port land in close proximity to Landguard may provide opportunities 
for additi onal car par king provision and vehicular access arrangements to serve needs at peak times.

12.159  Land at Felixstowe Leisure Centre encompasses 1.25ha, redevelopment of which is expected to provide 
resort, tourist and visitor uses i n support of both the day and night time economy and complementary to 
Felixstowe Town Centre.  
12.160  The existing  leisure centre at Felixstowe is coming to the end of its operational life and requires 
redevelopment to continue to serve the needs of the local comm unity and visitors to the area. The site is 
in a high profile location on the seafront and the relocation of this use as p art of the Felixstowe Garden 
Neighbourhood development presents a unique ‘once in a generation ’ opportunity to enhance the area 
and de liver a modern and imaginative attraction.  
12.161  Recent investment and redevelopments have significantly improved the attractio ns and sea front 
experience for residents and visitors alike and the redevelopment of the leisure centre and surrounding 
area will com plement the activities that have taken place.  Uses and activities which encourage public use 
and provide opportunities for  social interaction will be welcomed in this high profile location which has 
been a key focus for the local community for generations.  
12.162  The existing leisure centre is a dominant building which in part blocks the views of Felixstowe Pier and the 
seafront.  Redevelopment of this site provides the opportunity to change the built form and provide an 
improved area for resort and seafront activi ties to take place.  
12.163  Enhancing the public realm and space in this part of the Felixstowe seafront will provide flexible 
opportunities for events and entertainments to take place in a high quality landscaped environment which 
reflects the coastal location.   
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
251  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.164  Any future redevelopment of this site will need to make a positive contribution to  the Conservation Area 
and architectura l heritage of Felixstowe and provide built form that includes  attractive spaces for resort, 
tourist and recreational uses that support  both the day time and night time economy of Felixstowe.  
Limited residential opportunities such as serviced apartments on upper floors which do not conflict with 
the predomina nt use may provide additional opportunities as part of any future redevelopment o f this 
high profile location.  
12.165  Car parking provision in  this part of  Felixstowe at peak time s is over subscr ibed.  The current car park 
provides 85 spaces (including disabled bays).  Redevelopment of this site will need to ensure that as a 
minimum the same l evel of car parking provision is provided to serve visitors to the town.  
12.166  Redevelopment of this site will be closely linked both in terms of timing and funding to the provision of a 
new leisure centre as part of the Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood.  
12.167  Develop ment proposals at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Bound ary Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Felixstowe  Water Recycling 
Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capaci ty will be made available in time to serve the 
proposed development.  The Water Cycle Study also identifies t his site as being within an area of high tidal 
or fluvial flood risk. Any proposals for further development at this site must therefore have regard to this 
issue and be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.

Land currently occupi ed by Felixstowe Leisure Centre, car parking and event space as identified on the 
Policies Map is allocated for m odern and imaginative resort, tourist  and visitor uses which support both 
the day time and night time econom y in Felixstowe.  
Development of this site will not come forward until new leisure facilities with equivalent or better 
provision in terms of quantit y and quality  have been brought into operation as part of the Felixstowe 
Garden Neighbourhood.  
Development w ill be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) A mix of uses which promote unique, modern and imaginative tourist, resort and visitor
oppor tunities;
b) Uses which do not adversely impact the town centre;
c) Improved public realm and accessibility;
d) Design and layout which complements the prominent seafront location and makes a positive

Tourism Accommodation 
12.168  Felixstowe is a popular seaside destination with a variety of accommodation available. In order to promote 
year round tourism the Local Plan seeks to ensure the further provision of appropriate holiday 
accommodation across the plan area  and Felixstowe is a key contributor to this provision through a variety 
of forms. Maintaining the level of accommodation for to urism is important to support the tourist activities 
within the resort, however tourism accommodation does  not need to be confin ed to sea front locations.  
12.169  Proposals for new tourism accommodation will be welcomed primarily within the Felixstowe Settlement 
Boundary. New accommodation will need to take into account the impact on residential amenity and 
ensure adequate off street park ing is delivered alongside any new development.  
12.170  Alongside the hotel, guest houses and B&B provision, Felixstowe has a number of caravan parks and 
holiday villages which provide a different type of accommodation and provide a significant contribution to 
the local economy which is not to be underestimated. These sites are established and surrounded by 
existing land uses which potenti ally limit their future expansion.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
253  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.171  Proposals which seek to intensify or modernise the tourism use on these sites will need to be  considered 
against the character and appearance of the surrounding landscape, highway and access arrangement and 
the living con dition of neighbouring residents. Flood mitigation will also be a key consideration as large 
parts  of these sites are  in areas a t risk from flooding.  
12.172  The Habitats Regulations Assessment has identified tourism development could lead to a significant 
increas e in visits to the estuaries, with some parts of the Orwell estuaries potentially accessible on foot, 
depending on the location of the proposal. A project level Habitats Regulations Assessment will therefore 
be required .  
Policy SCLP12.17: Tourism Accommod ation in Felixstowe  
The need to strengthen Felixstowe as a seaside destination is recognised. Holiday accommodation will be 
encouraged and supported across Felixstowe where proposals will have a positive impact on the local 
economy and respect the charact er of the surrounding street scene. Proposals will normally be expected in 
sea front locations but may also be welcomed across F elixstowe where they are of a high design standard 
and do not have a detrimental impact on residential amenity.  
Existing caravan  parks and holiday village uses will be retained. Proposals for permanent tourist 
accommodation or facilities in the form of permanent buildings (or upgrading of existing facilities) will be 
supported but only where they meet the following criteria:  
a)They d o not have a detrimental impact on highway and access arrangements;
b)They are of a scale and size in keeping with the existing  caravan parks or holiday village s;
c)There are no material adverse impacts on the environment or residential amenity; and
d)They inclu de flood mitigation measures.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  254 Strategy for Communities Surrounding Ipswich  
12.173  The county town of Ipswich lies to the south of the Local Plan area . By virtue of their proximity to the eas t 
of Ipswich, the built up areas of Kesgrave, Martlesham Heath, Purdis Farm and Rushmere St Andrew are 
more urbanised than other parts of the plan area  and are well served by a range of services, facilities, 
public transport, employment and housing opportu nities. These areas have a strong relationship with the 
town; a relationship that is enhanced through the urban road corridors which provide access into and out 
of Ipswich town centre. The Settlement Hierarchy ident ifies that collectively these communities  to the east 
of Ipswich represent a Major Centre. In addition to these urbanised areas, a number of rural communities 
such as Foxhall, Nacton, Playford, Rushmere St Andrew (village) and Westerfield also have a stron g 
relationship with Ipswich and these are  identified in the Settlement Hierarchy as Large or Small Villages. 
Brightwell Lakes is a new community of 2,000 dwellings which will be delivered over the plan period and 
which has recently been granted outline pla nning permission. This development is con sidered as part of 
the East of Ipswich Major Centre67 within the Settlement Hierarchy.  
12.174  Employment opportunities in this part of the plan area  are focused on Ipswich and other large scale areas 
of economic activity s uch as Martlesham Heath and Ransomes Europ ark to the south east of Ipswich. 
These areas of employment are to be retained over the plan period and where possible enhanced to 
ensure economic benefits are realised.  
12.175  Previous Local Plan documents have identifie d the communities surrounding Ipswich as l ocations for large 
scale residential and community development. Developments such as Grange Farm, Bixley Farm and most 
recently Brightwell Lakes (outline permission approved May 2018) have been identified in previo us Local 
Plans. Ipswich Borough Council ha s also identified the Ipswich Garden Suburb to the north of the town and 
land south of Westerfield. Large scale residential developments have delivered new communities in this 
part of the former Suffolk Coastal District alongside the necessary social and c ommunity infrastructure. 
Consultation responses have highlighted the pressure that some of these facilities are currently under.  
12.176  Suffolk County Council has identified capacity issues in primary and secondary school s neighbouring 
Ipswich. The development at  Brightwell Lakes will help provide greater capacity across the plan area  but 
further capacity will be needed over the plan period. The Council will continue to work with Suffolk County 
Council and , where appropria te, Ipswich Borough Council to ensure that  opportunities to increase 
education provision within this part of East Suffolk  are realised over the plan period.  
12.177  The communities surrounding Ipswich are generally well served by public transport opportunities and  the 
provision of infrastructure which pro motes walking and cycling. Areas of residential development, 
employment sites and community facilities are accessible by public transport, walking and cycling 
opportunities that reduce demand on the private motor c ar. Consultation responses have highlighte d the 
pressure the road network comes under at peak periods in locations such as the A1214 and the A12

255  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n between Martlesham and Seven Hills as well as some local routes which can become popular alternatives 
to the ma in roads. The Council will continue to wor k with Suffolk County Council to ensure that mitigation 
associated with the development at Brightwell Lakes mitigates  impact s of traffic throughout this part of 
East Suffolk . 
12.178  Development in the Ipswich  Strategic Pl anning  Area is predicted  to collectively  add to  significant strain  on 
the transport network  in and around  Ipswich. Additional highway  capacity  will not  on its own  address  these  
issues  and the ISPA  authorities  agree that robust  steps must  be taken  to prioritise  healthy  and sustainable  
travel.  A package  of transport  mitigation  measures  has been  identified  to reduce  vehicle  movements.  
Suffolk  County  Council  as the Highway  Authority  has developed  a strategy  which  contains  a package  of 
mitigation  measures  to deliver  modal  shift and mitigate  impacts  on the wider  Ipswich  highways  network.  
The Council will work  with the other  authorities across  the ISPA  to ensure  that there is  a co-ordinated  
approach  to funding the mitigation  through  the delivery  of the Local Plan.  
12.179  Communities in this part of the plan area  
have seen significant levels of growth 
through previous Local Plan allocations. In 
the short to medium term the development 
of Brightwell Lakes will deliver a high quality 
masterplan development and it is 
recognised that this development will need 
the opp ortunity to settle and mature. In 
support of delivery of the Ipswich Garden 
Suburb and Brightwell Lakes, this plan does 
not propose significant additional growth in 
this area in the early years of the plan 
period. In order to assist with delivery of 
housin g across the Ipswich Strategic 
Planning Area, this plan identifies land at 
Humber Doucy Lane, Rushmere St Andrew / 
Tuddenham as part of a cross boundary 
allocation with Ipswich Borough to deliver 
housing. The opportunity for redevelopment 
of the Police Hea dquarters site in 
Martlesham Heath would enable the 
provision of a high density brownfield 
development of a mix of smaller units led by innovative design. An allocation is also proposed at 
Woodbridge Town Football Club to deliver housing and to provide a d egree of certainty regarding 
potential future uses, and whilst this is in Martlesham Parish it is detailed within the Strategy for 
Woodbridge due to it being adjacent to the urban area of Woodbridge. Elsewhere in the area 
neighbouring Ipswich, future devel opment will be limited to sites within the defined Settlement 
Boundaries.  
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  256 12.180  This part of the plan area  is constrained by the cumulative impact of residential development on the Orwell 
and Deben Estuaries. The estuaries are designated landscapes and ecologic al areas and mitigation 
measures are needed to ensure that the impact of development does not have a detrimental impact on 
these sites. The Sustainability Appraisal and Appropriate Assessment identify any  mitigation measures that 
will be needed throughout the plan period , and these are incorporated into policy where appropriate . The 
introduction of site specific mitigation such as provision of country parks and accessible natural green 
spaces in this part of the plan area  will need to be monitored as develo pment comes forward.  
12.181  A number of communities neighbouring Ipswich have considered undertaking Neighbourhood Plans over 
recent years. The Council supports the production of Neighbourhood Plans where the community consider 
it appropriate for their area. Mart lesham have prepared a Neighbourhood Plan which was subject to a 
positive vote at Referendum in May 2018. Neighbourhood Plan areas are designated in Kesgrave and 
Playford and work on the plans is ongoing.  
Policy SCLP12.18: Strategy for Communities surroun ding Ipswich  
The strategy for the communities surrounding Ipswich is to maintain the healthy and vibrant communities 
which provide a diverse mixture of residential and employment opportunities alongside services and 
facilities by maintaining and enhancing the relationship with Ipswich and other parts of the plan area . 
Provision of appropriate community infrastructure, education facilities and public transport will be 
supported where the needs are clearly demonstrated.  Development will be expected  to maximis e its 
contribution  to sustainable  transport  and promotion  of modal  shift  in order  to contribute  to the delivery  of 
new and  enhanced  sustainable  transport  measures  in and around  Ipswich.  
Residential developments will be limited to the proposal at Brightwell  Lakes , land at Humber Doucy Lane 
to come forward alongside land in Ipswich Borough, the provision of housing in association with 
redevelopment of the Police Headquarters site  and development  within the Settlement Boundaries 
consistin g of infill or small s cale redevelopments which make the most appropriate use of previously 
developed land, plus small allocations or development identified through Neighbourhood Plans. 
Economic proposals which are well related to the strategically important employment areas w ill be 
supported where they maximise provision and support the diverse range of opportunities in the area in 
accordance with other policies in the Local Plan.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

12.182  The Core Strategy outlined an area of strategic development to the south a nd east of Adastral Park. In 
2018, the Council approved an outline masterplan (DC/17/1435/OUT) for 2,000 dwellings to be known as 
Brightwell Lakes. Alongside the residential units, t he site will also deliver employment areas, local centres, 
education provi sion, green infrastructure, outdoor play areas, sports ground and allotments/community 
orchards, public footpaths, cycle ways, vehicle accesses  and associated infrastructure. The phy sical extent 
of the area subject to outline planning permission is shown o n the Policies Map.  
12.183  The Northern Quadrant of Brightwell Lakes will provide road access and potential for this to facilitate 
comprehensive employment development and regeneration to supplement the existing employment areas 
in this part of the District.   
12.184  Brightwell Lakes is in close proximity to the designated European sites on the Deben Estuary, Stour and 
Orwell Estuaries and the Sandlings Special Protection Areas. In order to overcom e any potential significant 
adverse effects on these designated landscapes , comprehensive mitigation measures are required as 
identified by Habitats Regulation Assessments. Over the plan period as Brightwell Lakes is developed, 
monitoring will be undertake n in conjunction with Natural England  to ensure that visitor pressure on t he 
European sites is not causing any likely adverse effects.  
12.185  There are Scheduled Monuments within and in close proximity to the site, including a scheduled bowl 
barrow and pill box, and development will need to ensure that these are protected . Provision of  a Heritage 
Park, in substantial accordance with the design principles of the concept diagram (Drawing No: 3167712) 
conditioned with the outline permission (DC/17/1435/OUT), will hel p to ensure development respects the

an attractive formal park style setting to heritage assets overlooked by homes while maintaining key views 
through the development.  
12.186  Over the plan period the site is expected to be delivered  and the policy will guide the future considerations 
for the delivery of infrastructure, community provision and residential opportunities.  
12.187  Opportunities to connect and integrate Brightwell Lakes with surrounding communities through its

a) Provision of strategic open space in the form of Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG) 
including extensive play and trim tra il facilities and a wide range of walking, cycling  and 
recreational routes. This is designed and planned to meet the mitigation measures outlined in the 
2011 Core Strategy Appropriate Assessment and Habitats Regulations Assessment carried out 
within the ou tline planning permission. This includes contribut ions to enhanced wardening and 
monitoring of visitor impacts upon designated European nature conservation sites;

12.188  Land at Felix stowe Road encompasses 22.5ha and is identified as an allocation for B1 and B2 employment 
uses. The site can provide economic opportunities which are targeted at the Business and Professional 
Services sectors. The site is well related to the A12 and the A1 4 and in a part of East Suffolk  which provides 
good access to Ipswich.  It is important that development of the site has regard to its sensitive setting 
within the setting of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).  
12.189  Access to the site is  expected to be provided via Felixstowe Road and would need to be agreed subject to 
the satisfaction of Suffolk County Council as Highways Authority. Opportunities to improve access to the 
Seven Hills Crematorium should also be explored. Due to the proximi ty of the site to the Seven Hills 
Junction on the A12 and A14 , any access arrangements and traffic management solutions will need to be 
informed by Highways England. Improvements to the junction are due to be undertaken as a result of 
developmen t at Bright well Lakes and the implications of economic uses at this site need to be considered 
in conjunction. Transport modelling shows that the development is likely to contribute to pressure on the 
A14 and the Seven Hills roundabout and therefore any ne cessary mit igation measures will need to be 
provided.  
12.190  The Economic Sector Needs Assessment highlights that there is greatest need across Suffolk Coastal for 
land targeted at Business and Professional Services sectors. In order to meet this need, land at Fe lixstowe 
Road is expected to provide a high quality prestigious business park which utilises good design and

261  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n materials. Green infrastructure and spaces are to be provided throughout the business park to provide an 
exceptional high quality environment that boosts econ omic activity in the area . 
12.191  The business park should include a focal outside area containing public seating and public art.  To support 
the green infrastructure throughout the site, significant landscaping will be required to reduce the visual 
impact of the business park and ensure it is a complementary neighbour to the Crematorium  and 
Scheduled Monuments  adjacent. Opportunities should also be explored to integrate and connect 
landscaping to the existing Public Rights of Way Network in the area. Th e site is s urrounded by known 
archaeological sites recorded in the Historic Environment Record, and to the west, cropmarks include a 
Bronze Age barrow cemetery of at least four barrows, likely associated with the wider group of Scheduled 
Monuments at Seven  Hills, which is of outstanding local importance . Suffolk County Council have 
highlighted that an Archaeological Assessment is to be undertaken at an appropriate design stage prior to 
the granting of outline, technical details or full planning permission t o inform  viability of schemes, 
mitigation requirements and conservation in situ of significant remains.  
12.192  The site is located within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suffolk County Council as the Minerals 
Planning Authority. Therefore any planning applicat ion should be supported by evidence which assesses 
the quality and quantity of sand and gravel resources. Planning applications are expected to be supported 
by evidence considering the suitability for prior extraction , as directed by the Policy, having regard to the 
Suffolk Minerals and Waste Local Plan and other material considerations. Should the site be considered 
suitable for prior extraction, having regard to the evidence submitted together with advice from the 
Minerals Planning Authority, any planning  permission for development will be conditioned to take place in 
phases which allow for prior extraction of some or all of the economic resource.  
12.193  The area’s  economy relies on the provision of appropriate spaces to encourage start up units as well as 
large r units which provide the opportunity for enterprises to grow into. Alongside the high quality 
environment targeted at Business and Professional Services Sectors, the Council, informed by consultation 
responses , would support the provision of units  targete d at start up enterprises. Units such as these are 
required across the area  and this site provides an opportunity in this accessible location. To provide a 
balance across the site, larger units with grow -on space will also be encouraged to enable o pportuni ties 
for established businesses to relocate to, and expand within, the area.  
12.194  In the context of changing retail supply chain processes related to new customer technologies, p roposals 
which provide small scale storage and distribution (B8 uses) integ rated with other B use floorspace may be 
appropriate. It is important that this does not detrimentally impact the overall function al differentiation of 
the business park destination from other nearby employment areas . To support the business park nature 
of the employment area , uses may be permitted outside B use classes where the primary purpose is to 
provide a service to the businesses and employees operating on the site . Such uses may include cafes, 
hotels or childcare nurseries but others may also be acc eptable.   
12.195  Development proposals at Felixstowe should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Felixstowe  Water Recycling 
Centre. Evidence will be required to demon strate how capacity will be made available in time to serve the 
proposed development.  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study identifies  this site as being within Flood Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  262 Zone 1. As the site area is over 1  ha, a ny proposals for further development must be accom panied by a 
site-specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
Policy SCLP12.20: Land at Felixstowe Road  
Land is identified at Felixstowe Road for a high quality business park to provide employment spaces 
targeted  at Business and Professional Services Sectors in the fo rm of B1 and B2 uses. Start up units and 
grow on space will be supported as part of the overall mix of units on the site.  
Access to the site will be required from Felixstowe Road. The access arrangements should demonstrate no 
severe impact on the A12 and the A14  and local road network. Opportunities to enhance the capacity of 
the Seven Hills junction and access to the Cremato rium should be explored and will be supported.  
The development will be expected to represent a high quality of contemporary design an d to achieve high 
standards of sustainable construction. 
Exceptional design will be expected to provide a high quality and  well screened business destination 
appropriate to the site’s location in the setting of the AONB  and the nearby cluster of Scheduled  
Monuments that form part of Seven Hills barrow cemetery , in terms of scale, massing, materials and 
lighting. A lighting st rategy will be required as part of any proposals. Significant landscaping and buffers are 
to be provided on the site, informed by Lan dscape and Visual Impact Assessment. A proportionate 
archaeological assessment will be required. 
Buildings will be expecte d to provide a high quality attractive environment with areas of green 
infrastructure. Opportunities  to encourage  and enable  travel to the site by walking and  cycling must  be 
realised  along  with measures  to encourage  travel to the site by public transport.  Opportunities to enhance 
and link into the existing Public Rights of Way network are encouraged. 
Proposals outside of B1 and B2 cla ss uses which support the high quality business park nature of the 
employment area, will be permitted where integ rated in premises with B1 and B2 uses or whose primary 
purpose is to provide a service to the businesses and employees operating in that locati on. 
A site -specific flood risk assessment will also be required as the site is over 1ha. Evidence is required to 
demonstrate there is adequate Water Recycling Centre capacity or that capacity can be made available.  
Proposals should also provide confirmatio n of adequate capacity in the foul sewerage network or action to 
upgrade to create the required capacity.  
Any planning application should be supported by evidence which assesses the quality and quantity of sand 
and gravel resources on site in order to dete rmine whether the site is suitable for prior extraction.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

12.196  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017).  The site is allocated for employment us es. 
12.197  This 30 ha  site lies to the east of the existing Ransomes Business Park. The whole site is self contained 
being bounded by the A14, the railway line and the adjacent employment corridor of Ransomes Business 
Park/Ransomes Europark. The site is suitable  for a range of  uses including B1 Business, B2 general industry 
and B8 storage and distribution. The primary issues are access and impact on the local road network, the 
desire to maintain a mix of employment uses across this wider employment area, and pote ntial adverse 
impacts on the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) such as visual impact on the landscape and the 
natural beauty of the wider AONB.  
12.198  The site represents the final phased area of development of the Ransomes Business Park/Ransomes 
Europark  employment are a, the majority of which lies within the neighbouring Ipswich Borough Council 
administrative area. Outline planning permission was granted in June 2018 for B8 development under 
application DC/17/4257/OUT  which relates to 26.6ha of the site.  
12.199  The site will assist in providing employment land in a well established employment area with easy access 
to Ipswich and the wider area via the A14. The eastern most part of the site lies wholly within the Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty, of national im portance for it s natural beauty. The boundary of the AONB 
follows the track running north -south along the eastern boundary of the Piggeries and the lorry park. This 
part of the AONB has a degree of physical and visual separation from areas of AONB lying to  the south, 
having been severed from the larger AONB designation by the construction of the A14 trunk road in 1980.

Where objection was raised, this appear ed to be an objecti on in principle to the loss of AONB rather than 
specific objection to the parcel of land in question and could potentially be overcome if mitigation 
measures are provided. Discussions have previously taken place between Ipswich Borough Counc il, who 
have a similar site specific issue in the AONB, Suffolk County Council and the AONB Partnership to see if 
common agreement could be reached that would allow development to take place on the sites in 
question. As a result, a statement was agreed wit h the Suffolk C oast and Heaths AONB Partnership that 
recognises the importance of sustainable development and the economic well -being of the area and 
provides support in principle for the site being allocated for economic development. The Partnership is 
clear that any de trimental impact upon the natural beauty and specia l qualities of the AONB landscape 
should be appropriately mitigated, through site masterplanning or consultation with the Partnership.  
12.201  Historic England has confirmed that development of the  part of the si te in the AONB could have an impact 
on a number of Scheduled Monuments immediately to the east; namely several pre -historic bowl barrows 
(burial sites) as part of the Seven Hills barrow cemetery. These would require further investigation as 
proposals are b rought forward for this site . Archaeological trenched evaluation is required prior to detailed 
applications for the eastern area.  
12.202  The Environment Agency have highlighted that the site overlies Principal and Secondary Aquifers and 
whilst this  does not affec t the allocation of the site it may impact on future uses or activities. 
Contamination from previous uses will also need to be investigated prior to the submission of a planning 
application. As a site of over 1 ha, a site-specific F lood Risk Assessment wil l be required.

  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  266 Recreation and Open Space in Rushmere  
12.204  Within this part of the plan area , the pressure of settlement coalescence is seen most prominently. Some 
communities are separated from others by large areas of open space , sport and recreation areas or 
countryside , whilst others blend into one another. Previous Local Plans sought to protect the open space 
between Ipswich and Rushmere Village through a specific policy and this is continued in this L ocal Plan.  
12.205  Much of the land is in use as playing pitches and associ ated buildings and other infrastructure, occupied by 
a number of sporting clubs and organisations. The continued provision and enhancement of sports and 
recreation facilities in this locat ion should enable the separation of Rushmere village and Ipswich to be 
maintained, through the presence of formalised green spaces. Ipswich Town Football Club have had a 
presence on land north and south of Playford Road for nearly three decades, and there also remains 
evidence of former uses on some of this land, including  through the presence of currently unused areas of 
land.  
12.206  Over the plan period, the provision of sport and recreational facilities , both public and privately accessible, 
will therefore  be supported and retained for the benefit of the community and local spo rts clubs and 
associations, as well as avoiding  the coalescence of settlements.  Development associated with the 
provision of sports and recreation may include for example related education al facilities, where this is 
ancillary to the provision of outdoor s ports and recreation, and maintains the separation of Rushmere 
village and Ipswich.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
267  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.207  Whilst much of the open space is formal in nature, the area also has potential to enhance conditions for  
biodiversity, and development proposals would be expected to demons trate how they support the 
maintenance and enhancement of biodiversity networks, in accordance with Policy SCLP10.1.  
Policy SCLP12.22: Recreation and Open Space in Rushmere  
Land is identif ied between Ipswich and  Rushmere Street as shown on the Policies Map  to retain settlement 
separation through the presence of natural and formal open green spaces , whilst also contributing to the 
recreational needs of the District and Ipswich Borough. 
Prop osals will only be supported where they are for sports ground uses , or for associated uses which 
contribute to provision for outdoor sports and recreation and which maintain t he separation of Rushmere 
village and Ipswich.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

Park)  
 
12.208  Land is identified under this policy for open space. In the former Suffolk Coastal District there is a deficit of 
accessible natural greenspace along the northern edge of Ipswich. The planned provision of a  country park 
at Ipswich Garden Suburb will help address this deficiency. This is relevant for nearby parishes in the plan 
area  such as Westerfield.  
12.209  The Ipswich Garden Suburb is a significant urban extension to Ipswich which will provide up to 3,500 new 
homes, supported by new social, community and physical infrastructure provision. The provision of a 
country park is an  important element of the Ipswich Garden Suburb required to mitigate the impact of 
new development from the Ipswich Garden Suburb and beyon d the Ipswich Garden Suburb in both 
Ipswich Borough Council and former Suffolk Coastal District areas on nearby sites  designated as being of 
international importance for their nature conservation interest (e.g. Orwell and Deben estuaries European 
sites). P art of the land required for the provision of a country park, including a car park to serve the 
country park is locat ed within the former Suffolk Coastal  District .  
12.210  An outline planning application for the Henley Gate part of the Ipswich Garden Suburb, whic h includes the 
areas within the former Suffolk Coastal District, received a resolution to grant permission in April 2 018 
subject to the Section 106 agreement being drawn up.  
12.211  Policy SCLP12.2 3 allocates two parcels of land for public open space as part of th e new country park. This 
allocation will help maintain the separate identity of Westerfield from the new development.  The provision 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
269  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n of the car park to serve the country park is expected to be provided within that parcel of land accessed via 
Westerfield Roa d.  
Policy SCLP12.23: Land off Lower Road and Westerfield Road (Ipswich Garden  
Suburb Country Park)  
Two parcels of land, as shown on the Policies Map, are designated as public open space. This land is 
intended to form part of the country park (minimum of 2 4.5ha total) required to be provided in association 
with the new Ipswich Garden Suburb, the built ar ea of which is located within the administrative boundary 
of Ipswich Borough Council. The detailed scheme for the country park as it relates to East Suffolk  will be 
expected to:  
a) Safeguard existing pedestrian and cycle access points and provide suitable li nks to the existing 
public rights of way network;  
b) Make provision for a car park to serve the country park within that parcel of land fronting 
Westerfield Ro ad; 
c) Make suitable provision for any necessary maintenance tracks and access points;  
d) Provide detaile d boundary treatments and be required to demonstrate that the residential 
amenity of dwellings which abut the boundary of the country park and the public ri ghts of way has 
been safeguarded ; and  
e) Provide net gains for biodiversity.  
Sensitive treatment will also need to be given to Mill Farm, which is a listed building, and its setting. An 
archaeological investigation may be required dependent on the nature of t he groundworks involved.

12.212  Land at Humber Doucy Lane is allocated for development of 150 dwellings, alongside land in Ipswich 
Borough.  
12.213  East Suffolk borders Ipswich Borough. The Ipswich Borough bound ary is tightly drawn and to assist with 
enabling the housing need for Ipswich to be met within the Borough, land at Humber Doucy Lane within 
the Suffolk Coastal Local plan area  is identified as an allocatio n for housing development which would 
come forward  as part of a masterplanned approach including land within Ipswich Borough. It would not be 
appropriate for the land in East Suffolk  to come forward without the land in Ipswich Borough as a ccess to 
the site  is required through  land in Ipswich Borough. An e quivalent policy relating to land within Ipswich 
Borough is being established through the Ipswich Local Plan, which is currently under preparation.  
12.214  The site is within the parishes of Rushmere St Andrew and Tuddenham St Martin, however the site is 
geographi cally related to the edge of Ipswich rather than to the villages themselves.  
12.215  The site is agricultural land and forms part of a wider, continuous, area of agricultural land which has been 
made available for development through the production of both the Ip swich Local Plan and the Suffolk 
Coastal Local Plan. The area of land in Ipswi ch Borough includes the land to the immediate south west of 
the site and the land to the immediate north west of the site. Development should also seek to preserve 
the significan ce of the Listed Buildings to the north and east of the site. These are Allens  House, Laceys 
Farmhouse, and the Garden Store north of Villa Farmhouse.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
271  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.216  To the north east of the site is a relatively enclosed area comprising a small number of dwellings within  an 
area of mature trees. These are accessed via Tuddenham Lane which borders part of the north eastern 
boundary of the site.  
12.217  The Settlement Sensitivity Assessment identifies opportunities in this area to soften the urban edge of 
Ipswich, and therefore de velopment would be expected to provide significant landscaping and open space 
in the north eastern part of the site which would also act to retain separation and the rural character of 
the area around Tuddenham Lane to the north. This could also help with the delivery of a ‘green trail’  
around Ipswich, which is a well -established po licy within the Ipswich  Borough Council Local Plan.  
12.218  The site is in close proximity to the Ipswich Garden Suburb, a strategic allocation in the adopted Ipswich 
Local Plan which i s anticipated to deliver approximately 3,500 dwellings and other uses, includi ng three 
new primary schools, largely over the course of the Local Plan period. Primary school capacity is a current 
constraint on development at Humber Doucy Lane coming forward , and it is anticipated that additional 
capacity can be provided through the p lanned new provision at the Ipswich Garden Suburb to ensure there 
is adequate provision for this development. This is anticipated to affect the timing of development coming 
forwa rd. 
12.219  The site is expected to be accessed via Humber Doucy Lane, as part of the masterplanned approach with 
the adjoining land in Ipswich Borough. Transport modelling indicates that there are capacity issues on the 
network close to the site. Due to the proxi mity and connectivity of the site to Ipswich, and to seek to 
mitigate any impa cts on the surrounding road network, it is expected that a robust package of measures to 
promote sustainable transport would form part of any proposals.  
12.220  The site lies in an area  of archaeological potential. Cropmark sites of boundaries relating to histori c 
landscape use are recorded to the east, as well as prehistoric artefact scatters. A scatter of medieval 
artefacts is recorded in the north western part of the site. However, th is site has never been the subject of 
systematic archaeological investigations  and previously unidentified remains may exist on the site which 
could be damaged or destroyed by development.  
12.221  The site is located  in a Source Protection Zone and  treatment  of surface  water  for pollutants  prior  to 
disposal  is vital.  This may  require  larger  areas  to be dedicated  for SuDS  than  standard. The Cross 
Boundary  Water Cycle Study between Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich Borough Council 
identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any proposals for further 
development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Ris k Assessment.  
12.222  Project level Habitats Regulation Assessment will be required and should be carried out alongside  the 
masterplanning process, considering the whole site along with the adjacent allocation in Ipswich Borough. 
Project level HRA will need to de monstrate that adverse effects can be prevented with long term 
mitigation measures.  
12.223  Rushmere Hall Primary School  is operating close to capacity and is forecast to exceed capacity. 
Consideration will therefore need to be given to the provision of primary sc hool spaces  to meet the needs 
arising from the development which may include a contribution towards the provisio n of additional spaces  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

due to be made at Ipswich Garden Suburb , as referred to above . Between them, these schools should be 
able to make provision for th ese pupils, although a contribution would be required through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy towards additional spaces.  
12.224  Early years provi sion is forecast to be over capacity within the Fynn Valley Ward. The development of this 
site would therefore be r equired to provide 0.1ha of land for a new early years setting, and this could be 
either within Ipswich Borough or Suffolk Coastal  District . Contributions will also be sought through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy to provide additional spaces in Witnesh am.  
12.225  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that a contribution will be 
required through the Community Infras tructure Levy towards enhancements at the Two Rivers Medical 
Centre, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Fra mework.  
12.226  Suffolk County Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and 
under pressure due to the si te size and access from the highway. As a result, a contribution through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy will be required towards the expansion of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.227  Suffolk County Council have provided in formation relating to library improvements across the plan area . 
This site falls within the catchment of Ipswich li brary which has been identified as a library where

District and surrounding area is possible through a variety of transport opportunities including cycle routes 
and bus services.  
12.229  Land at Suffolk Police Headquarters, Po rtal Avenue is allocated for development of 300 dwellings.  The 
Suffolk Police Headquarters site is situated on the northern edge of Martlesham Heath with vehicle access 
onto the A1214 via Portal Avenue. Suffolk Constabulary have indicated that they intend to vacate the site 
during the plan period , and thus it is e xpected that redevelopment of the site would come forward as part 
of a programme of re -provision of Police facilities.  However, it is understood the Police Investigation 
Centre (PIC) located direct ly adjacent to the eastern site boundary will be retained i n use. The existing 
buildings on the site are becoming dated and are unlikely to provide the high quality office space which 
would meet modern day needs. This provides an opportunity to plan positi vely to deliver dwellings and 
community uses on a brownfiel d site. The site is well connected to the Martlesham Heath District Centre 
by existing walking and cycling infrastructure that could be enhanced through redevelopment of the site.

the north rather than via Eagle Way. Redevelopment of the site should seek to maintain the character of 
distinct area s within Martlesham Heath, through the retention of open space and enhancement of 
boundary treatment between this site and the residential areas to the south and by adopting its own 
distinctive des ign and  character.  
12.231  The Martlesham Neighbourhood Plan was ‘ made’ in July 2018. Policy MAR5 identifies a need for 
bungalows, flats and sheltered accommodation in Martlesham Heath.  Due to its physical separation from 
the lower density parts of the village an d its accessible location, i t is considered that this site lends itself to 
incorporating a mix of flatted development and small, high density units  in a manner which contributes to 
a high quality of design .  
12.232  In the west of the site there are currently spor ts pitches. The existing sports facilities on the site prov ide an 
opportunity to increase provision of such facilities for all age groups by exploring arrangements to make 
them available for community use, as supported in Policy SCLP12.18 . The Martlesham N eighbourhood Plan 
supports measures to address the lack of sports facilities for all ages and the underuse of the Police 
Headquarters sports facilities. The Martlesham Neighbourhood Plan identifies a need for additional sports 
provision in the village and therefore it is expected that provision of sports facili ties for use by the 
community should be provided as part of the proposals.  In identifying provision for open space and sports 
facilities, consideration should also be given to any needs being met by t he existing sports provision on 
site, and any loss of pr ovision, including through the proposed creation of alternative sports uses. Existing 
open space and sports facilities provision should be assessed in terms of whether it is surplus to 
requirements, w ould be replaced elsewhere or redevelopment of the site would incorporate equivalent or 
better provision in respect of quantity and quality. Owing to the existing facilities on site, the policy 
expects that open space and sports provision would be made ava ilable for the community through the 
redevelopment of th e site.  
12.233  The heavily wooded boundaries to the north and west of the site act as an important contextual feature, 
as well as providing a high quality biodiversity habitat, and will be retained. These ar eas would provide an 
attractive area of informal open sp ace and should be retained as such. Alongside this, p rovision of open 
space on site should reflect local needs and be provided in accordance with the national recommended 
standard of 2.4ha per 1,000 p opulation. Opportunities for all ages of the population to be active should be 
provided.  
12.234  This site affects an area of extremely high archaeological significance and potential, on the former 
Martlesham Heath in the area of a series of at least eight Bronze -Age/prehistoric barrows which are either 
extant monumen ts or cropmarks. Three of the aforementioned eight bowl barrows are Scheduled 
Monuments and are outside but in close proximity to the site boundary to the north and west. The centre 
of the site includ es below ground remains of one of these eight bowl barro ws. Anglo -Saxon round barrows 
are recorded to the east and Prehistoric and Roman finds are also recorded in the vicinity. There is 
particular potential for archaeological remains of the barrow and ass ociated burials to survive on the site, 
along with prehi storic and Anglo -Saxon satellite burials and activity. The site is also within the extent of Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  276 Martlesham airfield. This site has never been the subject of systematic archaeological investigations and 
previously unidentified remains may exist on the site whi ch could be damaged or destroyed by 
development.  The impact of past land use is not known.  
12.235  Martlesh am Neighbourhood Plan Policy MAR 11 details the desire for the provision of allotments and 
community growing spaces. The location of the site in close proxim ity to existing residential areas of 
Martlesham Heath hamlets to the south and Kesgrave residents to the west lends itself as a location for 
the provision of allotments and community growing spaces. T he provision of allotments is considered to be 
particula rly appropriate in the context of higher density residential development.  
12.236  The site presents an opportunity to provide outdoor spaces, exercise trails, community facilities and 
shared work / meeting s pace.  The natural woodland surroundings, sports facilities and location in relation 
to networks of green infrastructure present an opportunity to provide community facilities such as 
allotments and sports pitches which would benefit the wider community. Opportun ities for community 
ownership and/or management of such community facilities could be explored.  Permeability  throughout 
the site and linking into the existing public rights of way network is strongly encouraged, with particular 
regard to pedestrian a nd cyc le accessibility.  
12.237  The design , layout and landscaping of the development will need to have regard to the amenity of 
residents in relation to  any continued use of surrounding areas of land for police  functions , including to 
ensure that their quality o f life  is not undermined by the fear of crime .  
12.238  A Transport Assessment will be required to determine any mitigation measures including in relation to the 
junction of the site with the  A1214.  
12.239  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk C oastal  District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for further development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk  Assessment.  
12.240  Martlesham Primary Aca demy a nd Gorseland Primary School are forecast to be over capacity during the 
first five years of the plan period and additional school spaces will be required as detailed in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework . A contribution will be required through th e Community Infrastructure 
Levy towards increasing primary school provision . Kesgrave High School is currently operating over  
capacity with no immedi ate opportunities for expansion and a  contribution will, therefore, be required 
through the Community Infra structure Levy towards the creation of additional capacity at the proposed 
school at Brightwell Lakes. The focus within the policy on smaller and flatted development is expected to 
result in a lower demand for school spaces from this  development.  
12.241  Current forecasts show that there is sufficient early years capacity within Martlesham ward to provide the 
proposed development. However, due to the scale of the development it will be necessary to reconsider 
this position at the point at which a planning applicat ion is made, and if necessary provision of 0.1ha of 
land on the site will need to be made available for a new early years  setting.  
12.242  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that additional primary care 
floorspace will be requi red to meet the needs arising from new development.  A contribution through the Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
277  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Community Infrastructure Levy will be required towards provision at Martlesham Surgery  and Birches 
Medical Centre, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery  Framework.  
12.243  Suffolk  County Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and 
under pressure due to the site size and access from the highway. As a result, a contribution through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy will be required towards  the expansion of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery  Framework.  
12.244  Suffolk  County Council have provided information relating to library improvements across the plan area . 
This site falls within the catchment of Ipswich library which has been identified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance provision. A contribution would be made through the Community 
Infrastructure Levy as set out in the  Infrastructu re Delivery  Framework.

Strategy for Aldeburgh  
Key Statistics for Aldeburgh70 
 
12.245  Aldeburgh is a small coas tal town and resort (2011 pop. 2,466) which is an extremely popular destination 
for tourists and visitors, which poses significant challenges in the peak periods and places increased 
 
70 Data sources provided in Appendix I – Glossary and Acronyms . 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  280 pressure on the range of services and facilities  in the town. The town of  Aldeburgh is within the Suffolk 
Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, surrounded by a natural landscape . The exceptional 
natural, built and historic environment is important to the town’s prosperity.  
12.246  As a centre, t he town provides a range of services and facilities which meet the needs of local residents as 
well as tourists. Aldeburgh has become a prominent location for cultural events and activities related to 
arts, music and food which has made the area a popular location and the Local Pl an seeks to support such 
activities.  
12.247  A high proportion of dwellings in the town are second homes or holiday homes which mean there can be 
significant seasonal variations in population numbers. The high number of second homes, high  house 
prices and lack of  employment opportunities make it difficult to retain and attract young people to the 
town. As a result, the resident population is declining and the population profile of the town is ageing.  
12.248  Many of the shops and facilities are t argeted at the tourism in dustry rather than the local population and 
there is a continuing need to ensure that this difference is rebalanced to ensure all year round services and 
facilities are viable.  
12.249  Although categorised as a Market Town in the Settlemen t Hierarchy, Aldeburgh la cks some  facilities of 
other Market Towns, namely secondary school provision and leisure facilities. The town also provides 
limited employment opportunities outside of the retail, tourist and service sectors.  
12.250  In peak tourist period s, the town is very popul ar with tourists and visitors, placing greater pressure on 
existing facilities and infrastructure such as roads and car parking.  There are also pressures around 
maintaining a balance of town centre shops and services that meet the needs of the local commun ity, 
nearby rural areas and tourists.  At the same time, these visitors bring great economic benefit to the area .  
12.251  Aldeburgh is physically constrained by issues of coastal erosion and flood risk and surrounded by high 
quality landsc apes and sites of ecologi cal value, which means that limited opportunities are available for 
future development. Therefore no additional specific allocations are identified, for uses such as housing or 
employment, although the allocation at land to the rea r of Rose Hillis will be carried forward from the Site 
Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan Document. Within the Settlement Boundary there 
are likely to be opportunities over the plan period for redevelopment of previously developed land  and 
buildings .  
12.252  Where op portunities for development of previously developed land or infill come forward these will be 
required to provide residential accommodation that meets the needs of the local population, including 
affordable housing for young people and to address the agein g population.  Aldeburgh has a more acutely 
locally  ageing population than other towns in the plan area  and this requires a more targeted range of 
facilities to meet these local needs. Over the plan period, the Council will wo rk with service providers to 
ensure that appropriate infrastructure is delivered.   
12.253  Aldeburgh has a special and particularly distinctive built character and the Garrett Era Area which was built 
in the mid 19th century is unique. Large houses in equally larg e grounds, well planted with tr ees, occupy a 
prominent position close to the town centre. Much of the character of this area is afforded by trees and Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
281  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n the spaces they occupy, rather than the buildings as these are well hidden by the nature of the area. Due 
to the limited land available i n Aldeburgh, this area may come under pressure from potential sub -division 
which would impact the character of this area over the plan period.  
12.254  Over the plan period it is fundamental that the vibrancy of the town is retained a nd opportunities are 
brought fo rward to improve the quality of life of the local community. Encouraging economic 
opportunities along with the appropriate infrastructure and residential development will enable the 
community of Aldeburgh to be maintained and  enhanced.  
Policy SCLP12.26: S trategy for Aldeburgh  
The strategy  for Aldeburgh is set within the physical and natural constraints of the town and the need to 
retain a balanced and cohesive community.  
The strategy will seek to ensure that:  
a) The historic character of the town is r etaine d, protected and enhanced ; 
b) Service s and facilities support the local residents and those in surrounding rural communities;  
c) New residential development is targeted at meeting the needs of the local community through 
provision to meet the needs of the ageing  population and enabling local res idents to stay within 
the area;  
d) The sensitive environment surrounding the town is not detrimentally impacted;  
e) Its role as a tourist centre and resort, offering a range of accommodation is maintained; and  
f) The flood risk is minimised and coastal defences are  effectively managed.  
 
The Garre tt Era Area defined on the Policies Map has a unique and distinctive townscape character which 
is important to retain. Proposals to substantially enlarge existing properties or sub -divide ex isting plots will 
not be supported  where they would:  
 
g) Materially adversely affect the character of the area;  
h) Materially adversely affect the setting of the existing buildings;  
i) Result in the serious loss of existing trees; or  
j) Prejudice replanting schemes of  suitable species once existing trees die or are removed.

12.255  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017).  
12.256  This site to the rear of Rose Hill is 3ha in size , development of which is expected to provide 10 dwellings . It 
is fairly regular in shape with adjacent low density residential development on three sides. The site is 
accessed via a track running north direct onto Saxmundham Road w hich would need to be widened to 
bring it up to standard. The tr ack is within the control of the  site owner. Land to the west of the track is in 
the ownership of the Aldeburgh Golf Club who may be willing to fa cilitate that widening s ubject to 
agreement of  appropriate terms . Furthermore improvements to this junction would also meet with their 
aspirations to provide a safer junction at this point. The access track forms the western boundary beyond 
which is open countryside.  
12.257  To maintain  the low density chara cter of development in this part of Aldeburgh, to limit its visual impact 
further, and to help provide a wider mix of accommodation within the town, the site is promoted for a 
care home development with some (approximately 10) open ma rket houses within the  ‘grounds’. 
Development would be restricted to a maximum of two storeys. Care would need to be taken with the 
overall design and landscaping to ensure that any new development did not appear as a large block out of 
keeping with nearby  development, when vie wed from the estuary.  
12.258  The presence of bats has been recorded nearby. Further information on the extent of bat activity will need 
to be obtained from relevant experts and may require the incorporation of bat friendly features within t he 
design of the new b uildings.

Estuary, a Habitats Regulation Assessment will be required at the planning application stage. The allocation 
is app roximately 300m from t he River Alde. Project level HRA will need to assess disturbance risks through 
the consideration of up to date ecological and visitor survey data. Project level HRA will need to 
demonstrate that adverse effects can be prevented with l ong term mitigation me asures.  
12.260  Suffolk County Council Archaeology, note that the site is close to a Bronze Age occupation site. Prehistoric, 
Saxon and Iron Age remains have been recorded from the golf course and that it is also close to World War 
II feature s. Given this rich his tory, an archaeological assessment will be required at an appropriate stage in 
the design of new development to allow for in situ preservation if appropriate.  
12.261  Suffolk County Council have noted that this site is located within a Source  Protection Zone which  makes 
treatment of surface water for pollutants prior to disposal vital. Therefore, a larger area of the site than 
would normally be required may need to be dedicated to SuDS.  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study 
between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich Borough Council identifies this site as 
being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, a ny proposals for  development must be 
accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.   
12.262  Early years provision  in Aldeburgh w ard is forecast to be over capacity and this development will be 
required to contribute through the Community Infrastructure Levy, towards the expansion of existing 
settings as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.263  The East Suf folk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that enhancements  will be 
required in Aldeburgh  to meet the needs arising from new development . A contribution will be required 
through the Community Infrastructure Levy for enhancements at Church Farm Surgery , as detailed in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework . 
12.264  Suffolk County Council have indicated that f uture improvements are needed  at Leiston household waste 
recycling centre  to accept additional waste from housing growth.  A contribution will be  required throu gh

3ha of land to the rear of Rose Hill, Saxmundham Road, Aldeburgh, as shown on the Policies Map, is 
identified for a mixed  developme nt comprising a care home and open market housing for approximately 
10 units.  
Applications for development of this site will need to be subject to a Habitat Regulations Assessment 
screening. Any development which would result in significant adve rse effects upon the nearby European 
site, which could not be appropriately mitigated, wi ll not be permitted.  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) A financial contribution will be sought towards affordable housing provision ; 
b) An archaeological assessment will be required at an early stage in the design process;  
c) Provision of a site-specific F lood Risk Assessment;  
d) No development should exceed two storeys in height;  
e) Careful consideration being given to the scale and massing of n ew building to ensure that it does

Key Statistics for Framlingham71 
 
12.266  In March 20 17, the Framlingham Neighbourhood Plan was ‘made’ as part of the Development Plan  for the 
former Suffolk Coastal area . The Neighbourhood Plan sets out a vision and strategy for Framlingham (2011 
 
71 Data sources provided in Appendix I – Glossary and Acronyms . 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  286 pop. 3,342) which the Council strongly supports. The Neighbou rhood Plan allocates sites for a variety of 
uses including residential, community , employment, cemetery and pedestrian walkway routes which will 
guide the future development in Framlingham until 2031. All of these allocations are shown on the Policies 
Map.  
12.267  It is important for this Local Plan to ensure that the principles within the Nei ghbourhood Plan and the 
vision are retained up to 2036 to facilitate a review of the Neighbourhood Plan when the local community 
considers it necessary.  
12.268  As well as the Neighbo urhood Plan identifying sites for residential use, Framlingham has also seen 
significant levels of development coming forward through the planning application process. It is therefore 
not considered necessary for this Local Plan to allocate further develop ment in the town. However, a key 
part of the relationship between the Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plans is to provide direction on 
housing requirements. Growth in Framlingham to 2031 is already planned for, so it is not anticipated that 
any future growth will come forward until post 2031.  
12.269  By 2036, Framlingham will have continued to be  a vibrant, distinctive and prosperous parish with a thriving 
market town at its heart. The town will have evolved and expanded whilst retaining its unique and 
distinctive cha racter and providing an outstanding quality of life for current and future genera tions of local 
residents and visitors, as well as the inhabitants of the surrounding villages it serves.  
12.270  Framlingham is a market town which serves the needs of its own residen ts and visitors as well as those of 
neighbouring communities. It is also a key em ployment centre with a range of services, facilities and 
opportunities as well as Primary, Secondary and Independent education. Although well served by a range 
of services and  facilities consultation responses have highlighted that a significant increase i n 
infrastructure is required to ensure that the market town continues to thrive.  
12.271  In recent years, Framlingham has seen significant residential development allowed through app eals which 
has resulted in sites coming forward outside of the plan led approach.  The individual sites have collectively 
had a detrimental impact on the provision of infrastructure in the town which has not been able to keep 
pace with current demands.  
12.272  The Framlingham Neighbourhood Plan identifies need for additional education provisio n (including Early 
Years), expansion of medical facilities, adequate and accessible community and leisure space as well as the 
need for a large community centre. Over the Loca l Plan period, the Council will support improvements and 
enhancements to infrastr ucture which are proposed through a review to the Neighbourhood Plan or 
planning applications on appropriate sites. In November 2017  and October 2018 , the Council committed 
to spend funds generated through the Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedul e on projects in 
Framlingham . 
12.273  The historic environment comprising Framlingham Castle, the Mere and many Listed Buildings attract 
many tourists and provide a unique area to vis it and experience. The historic environment also acts as a 
constraint in respect of vehicular movements around the town. The existing road network and car parking 
opportunities are becoming increasingly under pressure as a result of the increased traffic g enerated by Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
287  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n the recent developments. Over the plan period, actions to mitigate th e impact of vehicular movements on 
the environment will be supported in principal subject to the satisfaction of Suffolk County Council as 
highways authority.  
12.274  The Framlingham Neighbourhood Plan identifies allocations in the town to come forward over the pe riod 
to 2031. As a market town, it is appropriate that some additional growth is identified to come forward in 
Framlingham during the latter part of the Local Plan period. The  Local Plan therefore identifies a figure of 
100 dwellings, to come forward towar ds the later stages of the plan period above that which is already 
allocated in the Framlingham Neighbourhood Plan or with planning permission. As outlined in the Spatial 
Distribution of Housing, this equates to approximately 2% of the growth  to be planned for through the 
Local Plan  (see Table 3. 4). 
12.275  The Neighbourhood Planning Regulations require Neighbourhood Plans to be kept under review and in 
conformity with the Local Plan. In the short to medium term the policies within this Local Plan will not 
require a review of the Neighbourhood Plan but in the  longer term this may be required to identify sites to 
meet the housing requirement outlined in the Spatial Distribution of Housin g for the later stages of the 
plan period.

289  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.276  In March 2017, the Leiston Neighbourhood Plan was ‘made’ as part of the Development Plan  for the 
former Suffolk Coastal area . The Neighbourhood Plan sets ou t a vision and strategy for Leiston which the 
Council strongly supports. The Neighbourhood Plan allocates sites for a variety of uses including 
residential, employment, car parking and tou rism which will guide the future development in Leiston until 
2029. All of these allocations are shown on the Policies Map.  
12.277  It is important for this Local Plan to ensure that the principles within the Neighbourhood Plan and the 
vision are retained up to 20 36 to facilitate a review of the Neighbourhood Plan when the local c ommunity 
considers it necessary.  
12.278  Given the significant level of development being brought forward in Leiston through the Neighbourhood 
Plan and planning applications, it is not considered necessary for this Local Plan to allocate further 
development in the  town. However, a key part of the relationship between the Local Plan and 
Neighbourhood Plans is to provide direction on housing requirements. Growth in Leiston to 2029 is already 
planned for, so it is not anticipated that any future growth will come forwa rd until post 2029.  
12.279  By 2036, Leiston will have continued to thrive as a community that recognises and embraces its industrial 
heritage whilst serving its residents and surrounding communit ies. Sizewell nuclear power station has an 
influence on Leiston and over the plan period nationally significant decisions made in respect of Sizewell C 
or other major energy projects will have impacts locally which the Neighbourhood Plan (or Local Plan) will 
seek to mitigate in future revisions. This may include planning p olicies in respect of local housing needs, 
the private rented sector and houses of multiple occupation (HMO).  
12.280  Decis ions made in respect of Major Energy Infrastructure proposals will be informed by Local Plan Policy 
SCLP3.5 and it is anticipated that these will have a significant impact on the community of Leiston. It is 
imperative that the Council and the local communi ty work in partnership to ensure that any impacts of 
these projects are mitigated to the benefit of Leiston and also the wider natural enviro nment.  
12.281  Leiston is located within the setting of the Suffolk Coast & Heaths AONB. It is an area which makes a 
signif icant contribution to the local  economy and provides a variety of employment opportunities. To 
support these employment opportunities and act ivities the Local Plan requires a sufficient mix of 
community facilities, services and residential development over  the plan period as outlined in the Leiston 
Neighbourhood Plan.  
12.282  The Leiston Neighbourhood Plan identifies allocations in the town to come fo rward over the period to 
2029. As a market town, it is appropriate that some additional growth is identified to com e forward in 
Leiston during the latter part of the Local Plan period. The Local Plan therefore identifies a figure of 100 
dwellings, to come forward towards the later stages of the plan period above that which is already 
allocated in the Leiston  Neighbourh ood Plan or with planning permission . As outlined in the Spatial 
Distribution of Housing,  this equates to 2% of the growth  to be planned for through the Local Plan  (see 
Table 3.3). 
12.283  The Neighbourhood Planning Regulations require Neighbourhood Plans to be ke pt under review and in 
conformity with the Local Plan. In the short to medium term the policies within this Local Plan will not 
require a rev iew of the Neighbourhood Plan but in the longer term this may be required to identify sites to 
meet the housing req uirement outlined in the Spatial Distribution of Housing for the later stages of the 
plan period.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

291  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.284  Saxmundham  is an historic market town on the banks of the River Fromus. It is bound by the A12 to the 
west which provides road access to the rest of the plan area . The town has good rail access on the East 
Suffolk rail line which provides pas senger services to Ipswi ch and Lowestoft.  
12.285  The town functions as an important centre for the community of Saxmundham as well as nearby  rural 
communities. In recent years Saxmundham has seen residential development, as well as supermarket 
developments, which  have changed the focus of the town centre away from the High Street. Saxmundham 
is a town which is well placed geographically in relation to transport routes and other settlements to take 
advantage of town centre redevelopment opportunities to enhance the  vibran cy and visitor ap peal of the  
market town as outlined in the Suffolk Coastal Retail and Commercial Leisure Study.  
12.286  The amount  of employment in Saxmundham is limited with net out commuting for employment . A range 
of employment sites and economic opport unities exist in close p roximity to Saxmundham but a significant 
proportion of residents travel for employment to locations such as Ipswich, Martlesham and Lowestoft.  
12.287  Saxmundham Town Council has committed to undertake a Neighbourhood Plan to guide the futu re of 
their community. T he Neighbourhood Plan Area was designated in August 2017 and in accordance with 
the Neighbourhood Planning Regulations will be required to broadly accord with the policies in the Local 
Plan. The Council will continue to engage and s upport the work being un dertaken on the Saxmundham 
Neighbourhood Plan as the Local Plan evolves.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

Saxmundham will be enhanced as a market town, employment and service centre, serving a key role in 
meeting the needs  of its residents, surro unding rural communities and visitors, recognising the 
opportunities related to the connections offered by the rail and A12 transport corridors.  
The strategy for Saxmundham is to:  
a) Enhance the vitality and vibrancy of the town centr e, including through pro tecting and enhancing 
the historic core of the town  and the railway station ; 
b) Utilise opportunities related to the presence of the railway and the proximity to the A12;  
c) Diversify and expand employment opportunities;  
d) Enhance pedestria n and cycle connectivity around and beyond the town, particularly to the town 
centre and the railway station;  
e) Promote quality of life including through enhancements to networks of green infrastructure;  
f) Increase the provision of housing and affordable hous ing, and providing greater choice in the mix 
of housing available ; 
g) Provide for a safe and inclusive community; and  
h) Protect and enhance the natural environment.  
The creation of the South Saxmundham Garden Neighbourhood will provide new opportunities for 
housing, emp loyment and community facilities, focused around the principles of an inclusive community 
and integration with Saxmundham and the surrounding countryside through enhancing green 
infrastructure networks.

Background and Context  
12.288  The previous  Local Plan sought  to ensure that Saxmundham focus ed on its function as a local retail, 
employment and service centre which makes the most of its historic environment and connections to the 
rest of the plan area .  
12.289  The Sout h Saxmundham Garden Neighbourhood encompasses 66.6ha, development of which is expected 
to provide an education led scheme of approximately 800 dwellings , community facilities and employment 
land.  
Masterplan approach  
12.290  It is essential that this Local Plan ret ains these principles and to do this there is an opportunity to take a 
masterplan approach, informed by public engagement and multiple land owner collaboration, to deliver an 
education and employment led sustainable garden neighbourhood as an exten sion to the existing built up 
area, including land within the parish of Benhall. Landowner collaboration and partnership working with a 
range of stakeholders such as Suffolk County Council, Benhall Parish Council, Saxmundham Town Council 
and community grou ps will inform a masterplan for the garden neighbourhood covering the whole site as 
part of a future planning application.  A masterplan approach covering the whole site will be used to inform 
individual planning applications for parcels of land as they com e forwar d over the plan period.  
12.291  To the south of Saxmundham, the landscape is characterised by Hurts Hall, an area known as ‘The Layers’, 
agricultural land, the railway line and the A12. From the south, Saxmundham is primarily accessed by the 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  294 B1121 South En trance. This provides an historic entrance to the town. The buildings at South Entrance 
have an historic character and are within the Conservation Area.  
12.292  The Suffolk Coastal Settlement Sensitivity Assessment identified that land to the east of the B1121 is  
sensiti ve with views of Hurts Hall and the town beyond. Consultation responses have further expressed the 
sensitivity of The Layers to development, including the open area to the west of the B1121. A Heritage 
Impact Assessment has been undertaken to asses s the se nsitivity of the heritage surrounding the site to 
development, and this has highlighted the open area in the east of the site, in particular the area between 
the B1121 and the tree belt, as being particularly sensitive  to built development.  The Her itage Im pact 
Assessment advises that built development in this part of the site should be avoided.  Proposals on the site 
would need to consider their impact on heritage assets and their settings, including those identified in the 
Heritage Impact Assessment ; Grade II* Listed Church of St John the Baptist, Grade II Listed Hurts Hall, 
Saxmundham Conservation Area, Grade II Listed Crown House, Grade II Listed The White House, Grade II 
Listed Monks Cottages, and Grade II Listed Benhall Stores.  
12.293  The Habitats Regul ations A ssessment has identified the need for Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace 
(SANG areas) to mitigate the potential impacts of recreational disturbance on the Sandlings , Alde -Ore and 
Minsmere –Walberswick Special Protection Areas. The Appropriate A ssessmen t identifies the need for 
SANGS to be of high quality and design to deter visitors from popular sensitive sites, to be of a sufficient 
scale to deter driving to European sites and to accommodate circular walks that provide a varied and high 
quality  experie nce in terms of visual and other sensory factors. Development will also be expected to 
contribute to the Recreation Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy.  
12.294  To reduce the impact of the development and alongside providing for sufficient SANG areas, signi ficant 
green infrastructure provision and areas of natural green space for recreation should be integral to the 
layout of the Garden Neighbourhood. Reflecting the heritage sensitivities and requirements for SANG, the 
Policy sets out that any uses to be del ivered o n land to the east of the railway are to be open space/SANG 
provision only. However, provision of open space and enhancements related to provision of SANG do not 
need to be confined to land to the east of the railway. Alongside this, the delivery o f an int egrated network 
of green infrastructure is expected to be provided throughout the Garden Neighbourhood.  
12.295  Green infrastructure  will provide amenity value for the future community and, a variety of habitats for 
wildlife. Green areas will also reduce the perce ption of settlement coalescence between the built up areas 
of Benhall and Saxmundham. Ensuring the provision of appropriate green infrastructure is a fundamental 
part of the creation of a new community in this part of the plan area and will complement the existing 
areas of woodland, the public rights of way and the adjacent countryside. Particular  attention  will need  to 
be paid  to how  movements  will take  place  between  the areas  to the east and west  of the railway.  The 
northern part of the area to the west o f the B1121 known as The Layers provides an open setting to Hurts 
Hall, and has the potential to be enhanced to provide a high quality area of open space which makes the 
most of its history and links with surround ing heritage as well as potentially contrib uting to SANGs 
requirements. Any enhancements in relation to the provision of open space in this area need to be 
sympathetic to the character and setting of this area and heritage assets. There may be potential wi thin Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
295  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n the land to the east of the railway  for existing use s to remain , and links could be retained between Benhall 
and the rest of the Garden Neighbourhood through existing footpaths.  
12.296  Introducing a comprehensive approach to green infrastructure will allow the biodiversity networks to be 
enhanced bo th through natural processes and any management techniques that may be introduced over 
the plan period. Guidance from Public Health England is clear that access to the natural environment 
improves physical and men tal health and wellbeing for communities. T he approach to the development of 
the site with green infrastructure as an integral part of the layout and design will also provide benefits in 
terms of water management on the site, noting that there is an existi ng area of surface water flooding 
towards t he centre of the site.  
12.297  The indicative masterplan provides an indication of how the principles outlined above could be 
incorporated within the Garden Neighbourhood. The masterplan shows that the area to the east o f the 
railway is expected to be characteris ed by the provision of informal and formal open space whilst the area 
to the west of the railway will provide for mixed use development linked to employment uses to the west 
of the A12.  
Creating a community  
12.298  Consultation responses and engagement with Suffol k County Council have highlighted the need for 
increased primary school provision in the Saxmundham area. Limited capacity in existing schools is 
increasingly acting as a barrier to the future deve lopment of Saxmundham and the surrounding 
communities. The provision of a primary school with early years provision would support future 
development in this part of the plan area . The exact location of a new primary school with early years 
provision will n eed to be considered early in the masterplanning stages to ensure it is an integral and 
accessible part of the design and layout of the new development , and opportunities to benefit from shared 
facilities with Saxmundham Free School will be supported . Early years  capacity  is forecast  to be exceeded  in 
the area ove r the plan  period, and therefore  new provision  is expected  to be provided  alongside the new 
primary  school.  In addition, to meet  forecast  need, the policy  also requires  provision  for a new early  years 
setting on 0.1ha  of land  unless  suitable  and accessible  accommodation  is available  elsewhere.  At the time 
of a planning application,  it will need  to be demonstrated  either  that provision  is to be made on site,  or that 
there is  certainty  that suitable  provision  can be pr ovided  elsewhere.  
12.299  To support the deliver y of these requirements, residential development of approximately 800 dwellings 
will be required in this location. The dwellings will generate the need for primary school a nd early years 
provision but can also help facilitate additional provision of infras tructure required.  
12.300  A range of dwelling types and tenures will be required in accordance with housing policies in this Local 
Plan. The opportunity exists to meet the needs of local people and re -establish higher standards of 
building design which takes int o account modern env ironmental and energy efficient standards to create a 
healthy community. Dwellings targeted at younger people as well as those which meet the needs of the 
ageing population will be delivered as part of a mix of affordable housing and op en market housing. The 
masterplan approach should also provide for  self-build dwellings . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  296 12.301  It is expected that a mix of dwelling sizes, types and densities will be provided.  The delivery of some higher 
density residential areas can introduce a variety of des igns or different ch aracter areas into the 
neighbourhood, whilst still incorporating green infrastructure and green spaces.  
12.302  A community hub will provide a range of facilities to support and complement the residential uses in the 
neighbourhood. This is expe cted to include uses  such as play areas and formal open space, allotments and 
small scale convenience retail, and could also include education and medical facilities and some 
employment space compatible with surrounding residential uses.  
12.303  In order to provid e a further mix of u ses within the masterplan, the Local Plan will require the provision of 
employment land to the west of the A12. New employment opportunities are limited in the north of the 
plan area  and the creation of new employment land targeted at s tart up enterprises or to provide grow on 
space for existing businesses will be encouraged. The design and layout of employment uses will need to 
be appropriate to their location, particularly when viewed from rural areas to the west.  
12.304  Suffolk County Counci l have provided info rmation relating to library improvements across the plan area . 
This site falls within the catchment of Saxmundham library which has been identified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance  provision.  A contribution will be requested towards  the 
improvement of library provision as identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
Integration and connectivity  
12.305  An important aspect of any masterplan development of this scale is to ensure that the relationship 
between the ex isting communities and the new development is seamless and connections between can be 
easily navigated through a choice of walking, cycling and  vehicular routes. Integrating new connections 
with the existing network of roads and footpaths will provide oppo rtunities to enhance the area and 
encourage ease of movement for all. The area to be masterplanned is in close proximity to established 
areas o f residential development, Saxmundham Free School and the town centre. Fundamental to the 
success of any masterpl an is to ensure that the local community can access existing services and facilities 
as well as those which will be created over the plan perio d. Taking a comprehensive approach to facilities 
and ensuring that links connecting the new developments are attr active to use, well designed and 
implemented at the start of the development will be beneficial to creating a successful community.  
12.306  Opportuniti es to encourage and facilitate use of sustainable transport in particular walking and cycling 
should be maximised . Opportunities to provide walking and cycling links to Benhall utilising existing Public 
Rights of Way should also be created.  Greater Anglia have highlighted the need for development proposals 
to contribute to the accessibility of rail stations and the q uality of its ancillary facilities in order to enhance 
the visitor experience. In this respect, a contribution relating to Saxmundham rail stat ion may be required.  
12.307  Vehicular access is expected to be from the A12. The creation of a new access point onto the  existing road 
network will ensure that the new community is served by appropriate vehicular access.  The access point 
will also serve the emplo yment area to the west of the A12. Alongside this, there is a need to ensure safe 
pedestrian and cycle access acr oss the A12 between the residential / mixed uses and the employment 
uses. It is likely that the development will result in localised impacts on the transport network, and any Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
297  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n necessary mitigation measures will need to be provided, as informed by Transport Assessments, which 
would include consideration of  the capacity of the B1121 / B1119 signalised crossroads . 
12.308  The masterplan approach provides the opportunity to create new community spaces and facilities which 
can serve the new community but also support the  existing facilities in nearby settlements , along side 
contributions to help improve and enhance existing facilities in Saxmundham . The need for community 
facilities and spaces such as play areas, meeting places, sports provision , medical facilities or poli ce 
facilities will be informed by public engageme nt in the masterplan process to ensure that concerns raised 
in respect of provision through the consultation responses are taken into account.  
Comprehensively delivering sustainable development  
12.309  To ensure th at the Garden Neighbourhood accords with the prin ciples of sustainable development, 
consultation feedback and evidence has highlighted a variety of site specific issues that need to be 
considered as the masterplan evolves.  
12.310  The East of England Clinical Comm issioning Group have identified that enhancements  to provision of 
primary care would be needed to support growth in Saxmundham, and it is expected that a contribution 
will be required towards expansion works at Saxmundham surgery as detailed in the Infrast ructure 
Delivery Framework.  
12.311  Suffolk Constabulary  have identified the need for funding for new police facilities as detailed in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework, incorporating new floor space at the Saxmundham Safer 
Neighbourhood Team Police Offices, Police Community Support Officers, equipment and police vehicles . 
12.312  Development proposals should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary 
Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Benhall Water Recycling Cen tre. Evidence will be 
required to demonstrate how  capacity will be made available in time to serve the proposed development.  
12.313  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, 
any proposals for deve lopment must be accompanied by a site -specific Fl ood Risk Assessment.  
12.314  The site is located  in a Source Protection Zone and  treatment  of surface  water  for pollutants  prior  to 
disposal  is vital.  This may  require  larger  areas  to be dedicated  for SuDS  than  standard. Given  the size of 
the development,  if infiltration  is not possible  then  the cumulative  impact  on nearby  watercourses  
will need  to be  considered  and modelled.   
12.315  UK Power Networks have indicated a need to improve the 11kv network between Benhall primary  
substation and Saxmundham. A financial contribution may be required for this site. The extent of any 
improvements will need to be assessed through discussion betwee n the developer and UK Power 
Networks ahead of any relevant  planning application being subm itted to East Suffolk  Council.  
12.316  This site has high archaeological potential. It is situated in a favourable location for archaeological activity, 
overlooking the River Fromus on an area of light soils. To the north, in a similar topographic location, 
prehis toric and Anglo Saxon settlemen t has been identified. Within the site, an undated double line Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

medieval date have also been recorded from immediately adjac ent fields.  
12.317  Geophysical survey has identified complex remains in the eastern part of the site in particular. Suffolk 
County Council have highlighted that archaeological assessment should be required to inform the 
Masterplan to inform viability of schemes, mitigation requirements and con servation in situ of significant 
remains. Any mitigation should involve outreach proposals.  
12.318  The site is located within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suffolk County Council as the Minerals 
Planning Authority. Ther efore any planning application should be supported by evidence which assesses 
the quality and quantity of sand and gravel resources on site in order to help judge whether on -site 
resources should be used on -site during development , as directed by the Polic y. This may help reduce the 
amo unt of material transported on and off site during development.  
12.319  Suffolk County Council have indicated that future improvements are needed at Leiston household waste 
recycling centre to accept additional waste from housing gr owth. A contribution will be re quired through 
the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the improvement of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.320  The illustration below provides an initial indication of how the Garden Neighbourh ood could be 
masterplanned, dem onstrating the focus on the creation of neighbourhoods focussed around green 
infrastructure and the provision of significant areas of open space.  The masterplan is indicative at this 
stage and further refinement of the master plan will be informed by respon ses to the Local Plan and

Approximately 67.8ha  of land for a garden neighbourhood is identified to the south of Saxmundham, 
which includes land within the parish of Benhall, for an education led development, comprising primary  
school provision, community facilities , employment land and open space alongside a variety of residential 
development. This new development will be delivered through a masterplan approach brought forward 
through landowner collaboration and community engag ement. 
Critical to the success of this masterplan will be the integration of the new garden neighbourhood with the 
existing community of Benhall and Saxmundham, as well as taking into account the location of the site.  
The masterplan should be informed by c ommunity engagement and include:  
 
a) Provision of a one form of entry primary school on a 2.2ha site  to enable further expansion  and 
early years provision ; 
b) 0.1ha of land on the site should  be reserved  for a new early years setting  should suitable  and 
accessibl e alternative  provision not be available  elsewhere.  Proportionate  contributions  will be

12.321  This al location is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017) . 
12.322  The land north -east of Street Farm comprises an area of approximately 2.18ha of agricultural land, 
development of which is expected t o provide approximately 40 dwellings including affordable housing. The 
design of the scheme will need to take into account the residential development to the south. At the south 
western corner, it abuts Street Farm which contains a range of employment uses . The railway line forms 
the northern boundary of the site. The eastern boundary to the site adjoins the open countryside s o 
provision of a substantial landscape scheme will be required as a buffer between the built area and open 
countryside beyond.  
12.323  Conce rns regarding the capacity of the highway network in this part of the town and its ability to 
accommodate additional provis ion over that already permitted means that a transport assessment will be 
required. Suffolk County Council Archaeology have confirmed  that the site is in an area of high 
archaeological potential overlooking the River Fromus. Evaluation to the south identif ied possible 
occupation layers of Later Neolithic / Early Bronze Age date. An archaeological assessment will therefore 
be required to  be undertaken at an appropriate stage in the design of new development to allow for in -situ 
preservation if appropriate.  
12.324  Anglian Water have confirmed there will be a need for improvements to the foul sewerage network to 
enable the development of this site . Development proposals at Saxmundham should have regard to the 
findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary Wa ter Cycle Study which indicates capacity

303  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n limitations at Benhall Water Recycling Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will 
be made available in time to serve the proposed development.  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this 
site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over  1ha, any proposals for development must be 
accompanied by a site -specific Floo d Risk Assessment.  
12.325  The East of England Clinical Commissioning Group have identified that enhancements to provision of 
prima ry care would be needed to support growth in Saxmundham, and it is expected that a contribution 
will be required towards expansion wo rks at Saxmundham surgery as detailed in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Framework.  
12.326  Suffolk County Council have indicated that future improvements are needed at Leiston household waste 
recycling centre to accept additional waste from housing growth. A contribu tion will be required through 
the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the improvement of the centre as identified in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.327  Suffolk County Council have provided information relating to library improvements across the plan area . 
This site falls within the catchment of Saxmundham library which has been identified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance provision. A contribution through the Community Infrastructure 
Levy will be requested towards the improvemen t of library provision as identified in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Framework.  
12.328  Greater Anglia have highlighted the need for development proposals to contribute to the accessibility of 
rail stations and the quality of its ancillary facilities and to enhance  the visitor experience. In this respect, a 
Community Infrastructure Levy contr ibution relating to Saxmundham rail station may be required.  
Policy SCLP12.30: Land North -East of Street Farm, Saxmundham  
2.18ha of land north -east of Street Farm, Saxmundham, as shown on the Policies Map, is identified for 
residential use for approximate ly 40 units.  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) Provision of affordable housing;  
b) Main access through existing residential developments off Churc h Hill;  
c) Potential to improve east -west access across the site to provide pedestrian and cycle access to the 
north end of the High Street;

12.329  Woodbridge is the lar gest market town in the plan area.  It has an historic centre sandwiched between the 
A12 and the Deben Estuary with the built up  area of the town extending into the neighbouring parishes of 
Martlesham and Melton. Both adjoining parishes have prepared Neighb ourhood Plans.  
12.330  The town is an important retail , leisure, business  and employment centre and provides a variety of leisure, 
med ical, education and transport facilities which serve the surrounding rural settlements. The town is also 
popular with visitors an d tourists who wish to experience the historic town, cultural attractions, riverside 
character and access to the rest of the area. Woodbridge lies adjacent to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Deben Estuary Special Pro tection Area.  
12.331  Previous Local Plans have identified the A12 as the western limit of the town, beyond which growth would 
not be supported , and this Local Plan continues this approach .  
12.332  In order to maintain the vitality of Woodbridge, the need to improve lin ks between the different parts of 
the town, namely the riverside, Thoroughfare and Market Hill will be supported by the Council  over the 
plan period. The riverside and town centre complement one another and serve residents, businesses, 
visitors and tourist s. It is acknowledged that there are issues associated with car parking within the town, 
and the Council will therefore seek to  protect and enhance car parking provision where possible.  
12.333  The built up area of Woodbridge is constrained and within the Settleme nt Boundary, which extends into 
the Melton Neighbourhood Plan area75, limited opportunities are available for new housing provision. In 
 
75 The Mel ton Neighbourhood Plan area extends into the built up area of Woodbridge and defines the Settlement Boundary  for that area. 
The Martlesham Neighbourhood Plan area excludes the built up area of Woodbridge.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
307  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n recent years, development opportunities have come forward on previously developed land through 
conversions and reuse whic h has maintained a level of housing delivery in the town, or within  the parishes 
of Martlesham and Melton which adjoin Woodbridge which has provided housing opportunities in the 
area. Further residential opportunities are limited within Woodbridge but are expected to come forward 
on sites within the Settlement Boundaries over the plan period.  
12.334  Woodbridge like many other parts of the plan area  is experiencing an increasingly ageing population 
alongside higher house prices (when compared to other parts of the plan area ). Any residential 
development that comes forward over the  plan period will be expected to target the ageing population 
and provide lower cost housing opportunities to meet locally generated needs.  
12.335  Encouraging redevelopment opportunities to come f orward on sites within the Settlement Boundaries 
may put non reside ntial uses, such as parks, open spaces and playing fields under pressure for 
development over the plan period. These areas provide recreational opportunities and promote healthy 
communities  and well being and it is essential these are retained and protecte d over the plan period. 
Through redevelopment of sites across the town, the Council will seek opportunities to maintain and 
further enhance the provision of recreational facilities to suppo rt the needs of the existing and future 
communities.  
12.336  In 2006, an Ai r Quality Management Area was declared which covers 6 properties at the junction of Sun 
Lane and Melton Hill in Woodbridge as a result of traffic emissions at this junction. Following the 
declaration of an Air Quality Management Area, the Council is requir ed to produce an Action Plan to 
provide a framework for identifying and implementing measures to reduce emissions and mitigate the 
effects of air pollution. The Council works in partnership  with Suffolk County Council and landowners to 
implement the Action  Plan which is monitored and reported on annually. The Local Plan acknowledges the 
Air Quality Management Area and seeks to direct new development away from this area. Where 
redevelopment o pportunities come forward over the plan period, the impact of these  on the Air Quality 
Management Area will need to be considered alongside other material planning considerations.  
12.337  The 2001 Local Plan had a number of area specific policies which related to areas of Woodbridge. Over 
time Woodbridge has evolved and the objec tives of the policies are, in some circumstances no longer 
relevant. However the principles of riverside character which seek to protect the area from inappropriate 
development whilst seeki ng opportunities to enhance the character of the area are to be ret ained within 
this plan period. Proposals in riverside locations however, need to be balanced against the principles of 
visitor management of the Deben Estuary, as outlined in the Deben Estu ary Plan, and the Suffolk Coastal 
Recreational Avoidance and Mitiga tion Strategy. The area between the railway line and the River Deben 
comprises a number of marine related uses, including boatyards and other marine related businesses, as 
well as water bas ed recreational facilities. Several policies in the Former 2001 Loc al Plan (Policies AP245 
AP249, AP250 , AP252) sought to protect the character of this area as a working riverside environment by 
only seeking employment and leisure/tourism uses appropriate to the riverside location, as well as 
protecting more sensitive und eveloped sites from further development. Residential uses in this area are 
strongly resisted to ensure that employment uses and its tourism and amenity offers are not jeopardised.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

Woodbridge at times experiences traffic management issues which were also highlighted in the 2001 Local 
Plan (Policy AP263). Consultation responses have outlined t hat traffic management is still an issue which 
needs to be consider ed with partner organisations such as Suffolk County Council and Woodbridge Town 
Council over the plan period.  
12.339  Through this L ocal Plan Review, the C ouncil proposes to supersede the ‘saved’ policies from the 2001 Local 
Plan into a new policy to guide the future development of Woodbridge.  
 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
309  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP12.31: Strategy for Woodbridge  
The strategy for Woodbridge is to balance opportunities with the acknowledged physical and 
environmental constrai nts in order to maintain and enhance its role as a market town, a n employment 
centre and a tourist destination.  
Opportunities to enhance the historic environment and the riverside character area of the town will be 
supported where they bring economic and s ocial benefits which do not have a significant adverse impact 
on the environmental designations.  
Allocations for residential use are identified to facilitate and guide the redevelopment of sites in the town. 
Additional r esidential development will be expec ted to come forward on sites within the Settlement 
Boundary, cons isting of infill or small scale redevelopments which make the most appropriate use of 
previously developed land.  
On land between the railway and the River Deben, proposals for development wi ll only be supported 
where they are for B1 business use, marine r elated business or leisure/tourism uses and where they are of 
a scale appropriate to the character of the area.  
The strategy, therefore is to consolidate a  town that:  
a) Retains the special qual ity of the built environment including Conservation Areas and Listed 
Buildings and the character of the riverside and estuary  and Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB ; 
b) Retains the A12 as a firm edge to the town;  
c) Enhances the links between the town centre and the riverside;  
d) Enhances the town centre through the retention of n ational and independent shopping 
opportunities;  
e) Actively manages traffic and visitors to the town and surrounding areas through the use of 
appropriate traffic management, suitable car parking an d signage;  
f) Promotes improvements to air quality; and  
g) Supports the further provision of open space and recreational facilities to meet the needs of the 
town over the plan period.

Land at the former Council Offices, Melton Hill  
 
12.340  Land at former C ouncil Offices encompasses 1.33ha, and  is allocated for the development of 
approximately 100 dwellings.  
12.341  The former Suffolk Coastal District Council offices at Melton Hill are located partly in Woodbridge and 
partly within Melton parish. The brownfield sit e is in close proximity to Woodbridge Town Centre. To the 
south of the site are the rear of properties on Deben Road which are separated from the site by mature 
hedgerows. To the north of the site is the Grade II Listed Maltings Cottage, separated from the  site by 
mature hedgerows, and to the east is the River Deben which is separated from the site by the railway.  
12.342  The site presents an opportunity to re -use a previously developed site to provide a high quality, high 
density development, providing predominan tly smaller dwellings in a flatted sch eme. The development 
could also incorporate community and complementary uses, of a scale that does not have a significant 
impact on the town centre. Such uses would also provide an element of employment use on the site .  
12.343  Reflecting the principles of the Na tional Planning Policy Framework in relation to promoting the efficient 
use of land, the Council would expect a high density of development on the site. The design of the 
developme nt will need to be distinctive and inn ovative  whilst appropriate in terms of  the proximity to the 
Grade II Listed Maltings Cottage and Woodbridge Conservation Area as well as the Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty  and the prehistoric settlement and group of barrows at Sutton Hoo . Views through  the site 
to the River Deben are a key  part of its current character and should be integral to the design and layout of 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
311  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n any scheme. A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment should assess the potential impact upon the 
AONB.  
12.344  The design and layout of the sit e should focus on pedestrian movements  and it is expected that car parking 
and space for vehicle movements would be less dominant. The eastern part of the site is in Flood Zone 3a 
and should therefore be retained as open space within the site.  
12.345  This site l ies in an area of archaeological inter est and potential, within the historic core of Melton. The site 
is close to the foreshore of the Deben, and on historic pasture land with, to the east, potential for 
underlying flood -zone wetter deposits. There is part icular potential for remains relating to historic activity, 
as well as for organic remains which may have preserved structural remains and environmental indicators 
relating to the history of the river valley. There are also buildings on the site which may be considered non -
designated heritage assets of local interest, and which should be considered in decision making processes.  
12.346  The allocation is adjacent to the Deben Estuary. Project level HRA will need to assess disturbance risks (to 
include recreation, l ight, noise etc.) through the consideration of up to date ecological and visitor survey 
data, to demonstrate that adverse effects can be prevented with long term mitigation measures.  
12.347  Melton Primary School is forecast to be over capacity during the first fi ve years of the plan period an d 
therefore additional primary school spaces will be required. Farlingaye High School is currently operating 
overcapacity with no immediate opportunities for expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be required 
through the C ommunity Infrastructure Levy t owards the creation of additional capacity at the proposed 
school at Brightwell Lakes to increase secondary education capacity in the area.  
12.348  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Woodbridge ward and therefor e a contribution will 
be requi red through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards provision of additional spaces.  
12.349  Development proposals should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary 
Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Melton Water Recycling Centre. Evidence will be 
required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to serve the proposed development.  
12.350  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, 
any proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
12.351  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that enhancements may be 
required at Framfield House Surgery or L ittle St John Street Surgery to meet the needs arising from new 
development. A contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy will be required, as detailed in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework .  
12.352  Suffolk County Council have indicated that Foxhal l househo ld waste recycling centre is overcapacity and

 Policy SCLP12 .32: Former Council Offices, Melton Hill  
1.33ha  of land at the Former Council Offices, Melton Hill, is allocated for a residential -led mixed use 
development of approximately 100 dwellings.  
Development will be expected to be of an exem plar, high quality  design, and comply with the following 
criteria:  
 
a) Provision of a mix of units including a predominance of flatted dwellings, including affordable 
housing on -site; 
b) Design, layout and height of buildings to be appropriate to the site’s location in pro ximity to 
heritage assets and the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty;  
c) Provision of a high standard of sustainable design;  
d) Provision of open space providing opportunities for all ages;  
e) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment will be required;  
f) Project level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required;  
g) Evidence is required  to demonstrate there is adequate Water Recycling Centre capacity or that

12.355  Development of Land at Woodbridge Town Football Club, which encompasses 4.16ha is expected to 
provide 120 dwellings including housing for older people and affordable housing, subject to the suitable 
relocation of the Woodbridge Town Football Clu b. 
12.356  Land at Woodbridge Town Football Club is within Martlesham Parish, but is physically connected to the 
market town of Woodbridge. The area was excluded from the Martlesham Neighbourhood Plan 
designated area as it was considered more appropriately designa ted as part of the Woodbridge 
Neighbourhood Plan area76.  
12.357  The site is currently occupied by Woodbridge To wn Football Club however it is acknowledged that a new 
location for the football club will need to be identified during the Local Plan period. The alloc ation of this 
site is intended to provide a degree of certainty to the football club and the community i n identifying 
options for relocation of the site. Critical to the policy is that the development of the site would only be 
supported as part of a compre hensive scheme within which the football club is facilitated in relocating to a 
suitable location  in compliance with the criteria set out in the policy . The policy criteria include a 
requirement for equivalent or better management and accessibility arrange ments to be provided, which 
aims to ensure that users can continue to access the new facility and rel ates to matters such as any 
community use agreements.

development and to the west and south by the A12 and the B1438, and an existing line of trees borders  
the site where it is adjacent to these roads. The site is in an elevated position adjacent to the Suffolk Coast 
and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Bea uty, and a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment will 
therefore need to inform any proposals.  
12.359  In or der to reflect the location of the site adjacent to the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the built 
part of the development would be expected to be locat ed in the north of the site and to be of a height and 
layout that respects its position in the landsc ape.  
12.360  Developers will be required to consider local needs and requirements for open space as part of their 
proposals alongside the nationally published sta ndards of 2.4ha per 1000 population, and will be expected 
to make provision for people of all ages to  be active . 
12.361  A project level Habitats Regulations Assessment will need to ensure that hydrological impacts are checked 
and adequately mitigated for.  
12.362  It is expected that the site would be accessed through Fynn Road, and a robust programme of sustainable 
transport measures would need to support any proposal to seek to mitigate potential impacts on the 
surrounding road network, in particular considering the pre sence of the Air Quality Management Area 
within the town itself.  
12.363  This site lies within an area of ar chaeological potential. Neolithic and Mesolithic finds are recorded from 
the site. Roman finds are reported to the north and Neolithic pits and Iron Age fe atures have been 
excavated to the south, and remains have been recorded. However, this site has never  been the subject of 
systematic archaeological investigations and previously unidentified remains may exist on the site which 
could be damaged or destroyed  by development. An archaeological assessment at an appropriate stage in 
the design of the developmen t will be required to allow for in -situ preservation as necessary. An 
archaeological assessment at an appropriate stage in the design of the development wi ll be required to

 Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
317  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Strategy for the Rura l Areas  
12.371  The rural areas of the plan are a comprise the Large 
Villages, Small Villages and countryside across the 
area .  
12.372  45% of the population of the former Suffolk Coastal 
District live within the rural areas. Within rural 
areas it can be more difficult to  access services and 
the potential for p eople to become isolated, 
particularly if they do not own a car, is greater than 
in the urban areas. Therefore it is important to 
ensure that rural communities continue to be 
vibrant and that interaction is facilitat ed. In 
addition, the more remote rural p arts of the plan 
area are less well -served by public transport, high 
speed broadband and mobile phone coverage. 
Accessing housing in rural areas can also be an 
issue, as house prices are generally higher than in 
the more urban parts of the plan area .  
12.373  The rural areas of the plan area also contain some of the most sensitive and valued environments including 
the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Historic Parks and Gardens and Heritage 
Coast, a long with internationally protected habi tats. The rural areas are valued for their heritage assets, 
with a number of Conservation Areas designated in villages and a wide range of Listed Buildings. These 
areas are also some of the most desirable in which to  live, as evidenced by house price data in the 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) which showed the Suffolk coast, in particular, as having much 
higher house prices than the more urban areas.  The former  Suffolk Coastal District also has a high numbe r 
of second homes, at over 2,500 propert ies compared to under 500 in neighbouring Mid Suffolk. Many of 
the rural parts of the plan area , and the natural and historic environment, are also important as visitor 
destinations. The approach of the Plan is that tourism should be managed in a way which  protects the 
features which make the area attractive as a destination. The vernacular architecture of the Suffolk 
claylands  is well represented by a plethora of early manor houses, moated sites and 16th and 17th tim ber 
framed farmhouses with associated ranges including bakehouses, barns and granaries that were built using 
locally derived materials: hedgerow tree species, clay peg tiles and pantiles, thatch and lime render and 
early examples of brick. Examples of thes e building materials can be found in villages across the District 
complemented by the use of reed thatch in coastal areas.  
12.374  A key part of the strategy for the Local Plan is around sustaining and supporting rural communities. The 
National Planning Policy Fra mework recognises the importance of supporting the retention of local 
services and facilities and locating housing where it will enhance and maintain the vitality o f rural 
communities.  
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  318 12.375  The rural parts of the plan area include a number of  Large and Small V illages (as set out in the Settlement 
Hierarchy) as well as extensive areas of countryside which support smaller communities.  
12.376  The approach for rural areas is to allocate sites in the Large and Small Villages, in particular where this can  
help to support l ocal services, provide opportunities for a range of site sizes to come forward, diversify the 
mix of housing available, particularly for the older population and contribute to provision of affordable 
housing. Alongside this, it is importa nt that growth in rural areas maintains, and enhances where possible, 
the diverse and high quality natural and historic environment of the plan area .  
12.377  Opportunities and constraints to further development vary across the rural parts of the plan area . Those 
rural areas that a re well related to the A12 or to Ipswich present greater opportunities for new 
development to be well connected to other, larger locations. Those places which are more remote are less 
well placed to provide such benefits, although some gr owth in these loca tions can help to support local 
services and communities. Significant further development in the area around the Deben peninsula, which 
is primarily accessed via Melton, is constrained due to issues related to capacity at the crossroads i n 
Melton.  
 
Policy  SCLP12.34: Strategy for the Rural Areas  
The strategy  for the rural areas is to support and enhance the vitality of rural communities and enhance 
the visitor experience whilst protecting and enhancing landscapes, and the natural , built  and historic 
environ ment.  
The strategy for rural areas seeks to deliver:  
a) Opportunities for employment development alongside the protection of existing employment 
uses;  
b) Improvements to connectivity and accessibility, including through continued improvements to 
high speed broa dband and mobile phone coverage;  
c) The provision of new housing which contributes to providing a mix of housing choice in rural areas 
and helps to sustain rural communities, including through allocations in or well related to Large 
Villages  and Small Village s; 
d) Enhancements to the visitor experience;  
e) Protection and enhancement of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, whilst also recognising 
the value of locally important landscapes;  
f) Protection of designated habitats , priority habitats and p rotected species , including managing the 
effects of increased visitor pressure on the European protected sites, and seeking to provide 
enhancements for biodiversity; and  
g) Conservation and enhancement of heritage assets.

Former airfield Debach  
 
12.378  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). Proposals for development relating to this site will also be considered against 
employment policies in Chapter 4.  
12.379  Land at Fo rmer airfield Debach encompasses 10.89ha, development of which is expected to provide B1, B2 
and B8 employment uses.  
12.380  Employment uses on this site are split between two ownerships, Debach Enterprises and Clopton Business 
Park. The developed area is long and  narrow with limited scope for extension or intensification within it. 
The two areas contain a mix of lawful uses in Use Classes B1, B2 and B8. In order to enable the site to 
continue to accommodate churn of tenants over the plan period, the site owners ha ve identified the need 
for limited flexibility to enable existing built units to be re -furbished or replaced to provide an appropriate 
gap between them. This would enable the site to meet modern fire regulation standards.  
12.381  Traffic impact on the local highwa y network remains the key concern in respect of this site. Applications 
for any change of use or other proposals that would result in an intensity of use and associated increase in 
traffic will need to demonstrate that their proposal is acceptable to the H ighway Authority.  
12.382  The Environment Agency have highlighted that the site overlies a Principal Aquifer, with a groundwater 
abstraction licence in place approximately 50m from the site boundary. Whilst this does not affect the

need to be investigated prior to the submission of a planning application.  
12.383  Anglian Water have advised that development of this site may require a new sewage treatment facility. 
This should be discussed between the developer and Anglia Water ahead of any relevant planning 
application being submitted to the Council.  
12.384  Any relevant development proposals should include a desk -based assessment to identify potential impacts 
on heritage a ssets. Archaeological investigation will be required at an appropriate stage in the 
development process, depending on the scale and nature of proposals.  
12.385  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council and  Ipswich 
Borough Council has identified this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for further development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
Policy SCLP12.3 5: Former airfield Debach  
The former ai rfield at Debach as identified on the Policies Map comprises 10.89 hectares of employment 
land. The site is fully occupied and contains lawful uses within Use Classes B1, B2 and B8.  
Planning permission will be granted for new employment provision , through re-development or 
refurbishment of existing buildings or any other change of use proposal that would result in an increased 
level of activity within the site provided that:  
a) The use is restricted to activities falling within Use Classes B1, B2 and  B8; 
b) Where  necessary, a transport statement or transport assessment can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Highway Authority that the scale and type of traffic generated is acceptable in 
terms of impact on the local road network;  
c) Where necessary, inves tigation o f potential contamination at the site has been undertaken prior 
to submission of any relevant planning application;  
d) Where necessary, adequate sewage treatment facilities are provided;  
e) If required measures have been taken to assess and manage an y heritage  assets on the site;   
f) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment is provided for proposals greater than 1ha; and  
g) Where necessary, a drainage strategy is approved and implemented before development 
proceeds.

12.386  This allocation is carri ed forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is allocated for employment uses and proposals for development 
relating to this site will also be considered against employment policies in C hapter 4.  
12.387  Carlton Park is an existing and well established employment site of around 8ha which allows for a range of 
B1 Business, B2 General Industry and B8 Storage and Distribution employment uses. With direct access 
onto Main Road , Kelsale, it is well re lated to the A12 and thereby the main road network for the plan area . 
It is the only significant industrial estate in the Saxmundham locality and is particularly important given the 
amount of new residential development permitted in  and around the town.  
12.388  Approximately 3ha of land within the site, as defined on the Policies Map, remains available for 
development. Whilst the site remains appropriate to a range of employment uses, particular 
encouragement should be given to new uses which have a high employee  to floorspace ratio, given the 
limited opportunities for employment around Saxmundham.  
12.389  The Environment Agency have highlighted that the site overlies a Principal Aquifer and is within 
Groundwater Source Protection Zone 3. Whilst this does not affect the a llocation of the site it may impact 
on future uses or activities. Contamination from previous uses will also need to be investigated prior to the 
submission of a planning application.  
12.390  The Cross Boundary Strategic Flood Risk Assessment between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council 
and former Waveney District Council and the Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former 
Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich Borough Council identify this site as being within Flood Zone 3.

accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.   
12.391  Suffolk County Council have advised that any development proposals should include a desk -based 
assessment and historic assets assessment of the buildings to be affected. Proposals should include 
appropriate treatment of heritage assets. Archaeological investigation will be required at an appropriate 
stage in the development process, depending on the scale and nature of pro posals.  
12.392  Development proposals at Kelsale should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross 
Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity limitations at Benhall Water Recycling Centre. 
Evidence will be required to demonstrate how  capacity will be made available in time to serve the 
proposed development.  
Policy SCLP12.3 6: Carlton Park, Main Road, Kelsale cum Carlton  
Carlton Park as identified on the Policies Map comprises some 8ha of employment land. 3ha of land 
remains vacant. The site contains lawful uses within Use Classes B1, B2 and B8.  
Proposals for development of B1, B2 and B8 uses will be permitted subject to the following criteria:  
 
a) Proposals for further development of the site should be accomp anied by a site-specific Flood Risk 
Assessment;  
b) An investigation into any potential contamination of the site should be undertaken prior to the 
submission of a planning application;  
c) Where appropriate, measures should be taken to assess and manage any heritage assets on the 
site; and 
d) Proposals that generate a significant amount of traffic movements from the site will be required 
to provide a Transport Assessment, assessing the impact of the proposal on the local highway 
network.  
In recognition that it is the largest employment site c lose to Saxmundham and well related to the local 
transport network, encouragement will be given to those uses which have a high employee to floorspace 
ratio.  
Evidence is required  to demonstrate there is adequate Water Recycling Centre capacity or that capa city 
can be made available .

12.393  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is identified for employment uses and proposals for develop ment 
relating to this site will also be considered against the employment policies in Chapter 4.  
12.394  Levington Park is a former agricultural research station, which provides office space for manufacturing, 
logistics and shipping companies. The buildings are se t in large well kept grounds reflecting both its former 
history and sensit ive rural location. The site is surrounded by open countryside which forms part of the 
AONB, is close to the village of Levington but with limited road access which is not suited to HGVs or any 
use which generates significant amounts of traffic.  
12.395  The Envir onment Agency have highlighted that the site overlies a Principal Aquifer. Whilst this does not 
affect the allocation of the site it may impact on future uses or activities. Contamin ation from previous 
uses will also need to be investigated prior to the su bmission of a planning application.  
12.396  Whilst continuing to support the site in its current employment use, it remains the case that the site is not 
suited to an intensification of empl oyment activity.  
12.397  Project level Habitats Regulations Assessment may be requ ired to assess hydrological impacts and any 
effects would need to be adequately mitigated.  
12.398  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council a nd Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for further development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.

Levington Park, as identified on the Policies Map, is an existing low key employment site, some 3.29ha in 
size.  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) In order to  reflect its former use, its sensitive location and poor road acce ss, the Council will 
continue to resist any significant intensification of use which would have a demonstrable adverse 
impact on surrounding uses;   
b) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment will  be required;  
c) Project level Habitats Regulations Assessment will b e required;  
d) An archaeological investigation may be required depending on the nature of the groundworks; 
and

12.399  This allocation is carried forward from th e Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The sites are identified for employment use and proposals for development 
relating to the se sites will also be considered against the employment policies in Chapter 4.  
12.400  This disused former airfield site straddles a number of parishes however the employment element is 
concentrated in two areas as shown on the plan. Across the two areas, employment  uses are restricted to 
Use Classes B1 Business and B2 General Industry use. Previous Local Plan policy encouraged the retention 
of tree and hedgerow planting where it screened buildings and acted as a sound barrier. Encouragement 
was given to replacement of buildings which had fallen into disrepair with limited space for expansion .  
12.401  The sites have evolved over time but the policy approach remains the same. These sites are important 
sources of local employment, but due to their location traffic generation a ssociated with them remains a 
key issue. Any applications for additional floo rspace or an intensification of activity will require a transport 
assessment.  
12.402  Consideration should be given to the need for mitigation to manage the relationship between any new 
employment uses and the existing waste use on the site.  
12.403  The Environment Agen cy have highlighted that the site overlies a Principal Aquifer, the western end of the 
site falls within Environment Agency Groundwater Source Protection Zone SPZ 1, the eastern e nd SPZ3 and 
central section SPZ2. Whilst this does not affect the allocation of the site it may impact on future uses or 
activities. Contamination from previous uses will also need to be investigated prior to the submission of a 
planning application.

Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity wi ll be made available in time to serve the 
proposed development.   
12.405  The Water Cy cle Study also identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, 
any proposals for further development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood  Risk Assessment.  
12.406  The southern portion of land at Silverlace Green sits with in attractive estate farmland and parkland 
landscape of strong and distinctive character. Particular attention will need to be given to the visual impact 
of any development in the  wider landscape.  
12.407  Suffolk County Council Archaeology have confirmed that any development proposals should include a 
desk -based assessment and historic assets assessment of the buildings to be affected, particularly if 
buildings survive relating to military  use. Proposals should include appropriate treatment of heritage 
assets. Arch aeological investigation will be required at an appropriate stage in the development process, 
depending on the scale and nature of proposals.

12.408  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocatio ns and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is identified for employment uses and proposals for development 
relating to this site will also be considered against  the employment policies in  Chapter 4.  
12.409  Land at Bentwaters Park encompasses 390ha, development of which will provide employment uses 
complementary to the existing employment activities on site.  
12.410  This site comprises the former Technical Base at Rendlesham. It  is a large site of approximately 390 
hectares containing over 300 buildings and structures as well as extensive areas of grass. It is estimated to 
employ around 400 people. The site lies wholly within the AONB, adjoins The Sandlings SPA and is in close 
proximity to the Alde -Ore Estuary SPA, SAC and Ramsar site ( European sites). Part of the site abuts 
Wantisden Church a grade 1 listed building.  
12.411  The site, although predominantly within the parish of Rendlesham also crosses into Tunstall and 
Wantisden. The Ren dlesham Neighbourhood Plan confirms that policies relating  to this site will be dealt 
with through the Local Plan.  
12.412  The site is unique within the plan area  for the combination of buildings which remain on site and for the 
wide and very eclectic range of act ivities located here. Activities range from agricultural s torage, to film 
recording as well as more traditional B1, B2 and B8 type uses. It is also subject to an extant planning 
permission for a hotel.

and is connected to the Suffolk Strategic Lorry Route Network via a Zone Distributor Route.  
12.414  As a consequence of its former military role, the site is acknowledged by Historic England to contain a 
range of historical assets including artwork. The cold war m useum housed on the site is a tourist 
attraction.  
12.415  Anglian Water have advised that development of this site may require improvements to the sewerage 
treatment capacity. The extent of any improvements will need to be assessed through discussion between 
the developer and Anglian Water ahead of any relevant planning application being submitted to the 
Council.  
12.416  The Environment Agency have highlighted that the site overlies Principal and Seconda ry Aquifers. Whilst 
this does not affect the allocation of the site i t may impact on future uses or activities. Contamination from 
previous uses will also need to be investigated.  
12.417  Project level Habitats Regulation Assessment may be required and projects wi ll only be approved with 
effective measures to prevent impacts on Eur opean sites. Project level Habitats Regulation Assessment will 
need to consider a range of urbanisation effects such as noise and lighting.  
12.418  In December 2015 the Council granted planning p ermission for a comprehensive scheme for the whole 
site, which regula rises the existing uses, as well as a business plan for its development. The planning 
permission C/10/3239 contains a schedule of uses for each of the buildings and areas within the site and 
an accompanying site plan. The decision notice and unilateral und ertaking include a very comprehensive 
set of conditions designed to address issues of concern, most notably traffic impact on the local road

This detai led information provides the baseline for the following policy and therefore sits as evidence in 
support of the Local Plan. A new footpath/bridleway access from Rendlesham into the adjoin ing 
countryside, opening up access for residents of Rendlesham, is to  be provided alongside these proposals.  
12.419  The following policy is designed to support the planning permission and to support the longer term use of 
the site through the plan period.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
331  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy  SCLP12.4 0: Bentwaters Park, Rendlesham  
Bentwaters Park as identified  on the Policies Map covers an area of some 390 hectares. It contains a wide 
range of traditional and unusual (sui generis) employment uses which make use of the great variety of 
building  sizes and types and infrastructure available on the site. The buildi ng types are reflective of its 
former use as a military airfield.  
The Council is keen to ensure that this site remains a vibrant employment site. Accordingly, the Council will 
permit new  employment uses where they will not breach site, environmental and h ighway constraints 
identified and conditioned in the planning permission C/10/3239 approved 11/12/2015. Outside of those 
limits new employment uses will be permitted where they are suppor ted by robust evidence which 
confirms that their individual and cumul ative impacts are acceptable. In both circumstances, proposals 
should conform to local and national planning policy, particularly with regard to the environmental 
designations on and in c lose proximity to the site.  
Project level Habitats Regulations Asses sment will be required.

12.420  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is identified for empl oyment uses and proposals for development 
relating to this site will also be considered against  the employment policies in Chapter 4.  
12.421  Riverside Industrial Estate is an important local employment site on the edge of Wickham Market with 
permission for a rang e of B1 Business and B2 General Industry type uses. The Council is keen to see it 
retained as a  local employment centre, particularly as a number of smaller former employment sites 
around the village have been lost to other uses.  
12.422  The Environment Agency ha ve highlighted that the site overlies a Principal Aquifer and is within 
Groundwater Source Prot ection Zone 2. Whilst this does not affect the allocation of the site it may impact 
on future uses or activities. Contamination from previous uses will also need  to be investigated prior to the 
submission of a planning application.  
12.423  The Cross Boundary Water  Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for further development must be accompanied by a site -specific Floo d Risk Assessment.  
12.424  Development proposals at Wickham Market should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & 
Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates treatment limitations at Wickham Market 
Water Recycling Centre. Evidence will b e required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in

Policy SCLP12.4 1: Riverside Industrial Estate, Border Cot Lane, Wickham  Market  
Riverside Industrial Estate comprises 2.04ha of land with permission for a mix of B1 and B2 type uses as 
shown on the Policies Map.  
The Council will continue to support proposals for re -development or intensification of B1 and B2 u ses 
within the defined area where it can be demonstrated that schemes are acceptabl e in terms of impact on 
the local highway network, and nearby residential uses. Design will also be an issue given the sites location 
on the edge of the village and the fact  that it is surrounded by countryside of attractive and distinctive 
river valley la ndscape character.  
Planning permission will be granted for new employment provision, including re -development or 
refurbishment of existing buildings  subject to proposals de monstrating : 
 
a) Investigat ion of  potential contamination on the site prior to the sub mission of a planning 
application;  
b) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment  for proposals of 1ha or more ; 
c) Adequate capacity in the foul sewerage network or that capacity can be  made available;

Land to t he E ast of Aldeburgh Road, Aldringham  
 
12.425  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). This site is allocated for residential development of approximately 40 dwellings.  
12.426  Aldringham (2011 pop. 759) is a Small Village in the settle ment hierarchy situated to the south of Leiston 
and approximately 0.6 miles west of Knodishall. The settlement follows the B1122 main road between 
Aldeburgh and Leiston and is also built around the Gr een on Mill Hill. The Grade 2 listed building ‘Parrot 
and Punchbowl Inn’ situated on the crossroads acts as a visual, focal point for the village.  
12.427  1.66 ha of land is identified as suitable for approximately 40 dwellings. The site is centrally located, on t he 
eastern side of the village. The land rises gently to  the north with Aldringham House located at the north 
east corner, with the cross roads situated 130 metres to the south.  
12.428  Due to the prominent location of the site; on sloping ground, on the edge of A ldringham, a key 
consideration is how the development si ts in the surrounding landscape. The development should 
enhance the character of the site and surrounding landscape through high quality design, including 
planting schemes and boundary treatments. Any  loss of native species hedgerow will need to be replace d 
with additional native species hedging.  
12.429  The design will need to be sympathetic to the setting of nearby Listed Buildings and, in particular, the 
Grade II Listed Building Elm Tree Farm House.

12.439  Benhall  (2011 pop. 521) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy, having a range of 
facilities including a primary school, convenience store and village hall. Benhall is located close to the A12, 
and some additional develop ment within the vill age will therefore help to support the Local Plan strategy 
which recognises the A12 corridor as a focus for growth.  
12.440  The site is allocated for development of approximately 50 dwellings. The site is located close to the A12, 
immediately t o the south of site SSP6 which was allocated in the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies 
DPD and has subsequently received planning permission. The main part of the village is to the east of the 
site around Mill Lane and Benhall Green lies further e ast beyond this.  
12.441  The site is well related to the existing built up area of the village and is currently agricultural land.  This 
distinction between developed and undeveloped areas acknowledges a key aspect of local character in 
Benhall and Sternfield, that  of large open green  spaces dispersed throughout the built environment. As the 
site is located within a Source Protection Zone, Suffolk County Council have commented that a larger than 
usual area for SuDS may be required.  
12.442  Reflecting the character of the su rrounding residentia l areas, the site is considered suitable for semi 
detached and terraced properties, particularly in the western part of the site. Also important is that open 
space is well integrated with the built environment to the west, in order to a void the perception of an 
isolated clustered development poorly related to the open space and to facilitate the delivery of a 
walkable and permeable space. The site would also be suitable for housing designed for older people, 
particularly with the enhance d pedestrian connect ivity to Mill Lane.  
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  338 12.443  As the site is located on the approach to Benhall, it will be important that the southern and western 
boundary of the site forms an appropriate ‘edge’ to the village through suitable landscaping. Features and 
elemen ts which define the estate farmland landscape such as its robust structure of hedgerows should be 
protected and enhanced.  
12.444  Public open space should be provided on site to provide a focal point for the development and to provide 
opportunities for people of all ages to be activ e. Provision should reflect local needs and be provided in 
accordance with the national recommended standard of 2.4ha per 1,000 population.  
12.445  As an access is provided on the southern part of the permitted site to the immediate north, the site should 
be acces sed via this to avoid the need for a further access on to the B1121. Opportunities to connect the 
site with the main village of Benhall through pedestrian and cycling links to the east of the site should be 
explored.  
12.446  There is a small a rea of surface water  flooding recorded in the east of the site and development will be 
expected to put appropriate measures in place to ensure that surface water disposal is undertaken in 
accordance with the surface water management hierarchy. There are Gr ade II Listed Buildi ngs to the north 
of the site and development will need to be sympathetic to the setting of these.  
12.447  Development proposals at Benhall should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study whic h indicates capacity  limitations at Benhall Water Recycling Centre. 
Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to serve the 
proposed development.  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this site as being within Floo d Zone 1. As the 
site area is over 1 ha, any proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk 
Assessment.  
12.448  St Mary’s CEVCP School, Benhall, is operating close to capacity and, considering this allocation along with 
education forec asts, would be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period. Therefore a 
contribution towards additional school spaces will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy 
as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework  
12.449  Early yea rs provision in Saxm undham ward is forecast to be over capacity. The South Saxmundham Garden 
Neighbourhood will include land for a new early years setting and therefore a contribution will be required 
through this development towards this provision. Expans ion of existing sett ings in the ward may be 
secured through contributions via the Community Infrastructure Levy.  
12.450  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required in Saxmundham to meet the needs ar ising from new development. A 
contribution will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy for additional floorspace at 
Saxmundham Surgery, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . 
12.451  UK Power Networks have indicate d a need to improve the 11kv network between Benhall primary 
substation and Saxmundham. A financial contribution may be required for this site. The extent of any 
improvements will need to be assessed through discussion between the developer and UK Power 
Networks ahead of any relevant planning application being submitted to the Council.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

12.454  Bucklesham  (2011 pop. 526) is a Small Village which has a modest range of services including a primary 
school and a village hall, albeit that the school is located away from the main built up area of the village. 
Bucklesham is located close to the A14 between Ipswic h and Felixstowe and is therefore better connected 
to larger centres and employment opportuniti es than some of the other settlements in the District.  
12.455  The site is allocated for development of approximately 30 dwellings. The site represents a logical extens ion 
to the settlement, bringing the developed area of the eastern side of Levington Lane as far  south as the 
edge of the developed area on the western side of the road.  
12.456  The site itself has few constraints to development although the hedgerows and trees alo ng the boundaries 
of the site should be retained wherever possible and careful attention will n eed to be paid to boundary 
treatments to the southern edge of the site to minimise any visual impacts on the approach into 
Bucklesham. Development should support  restoration, maintenance and enhancement of the network of 
tree belts and natural features in the area.  
12.457  The residential areas adjoining the site are typically semi detached dwellings. To reflect the character of 
the area, semi detached dwellings should b e provided along the frontage with Levington Lane, with scope 
for lower density properties in t he east of the site.  
12.458  A footway should be provided to connect the site with the existing footpaths along the eastern side of

343  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Land to the S outh of Station Road, Campsea Ashe  
 
12.466  Campsea  Ashe (2011 pop. 375) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy, which has a few 
services including a shop and a village hall. Unlike most villages in the  former Suffolk Coastal  District, it has 
a train station (Wickham Market station) p roviding connections to Ipswich and Lowestoft, which provides 
an opportunity for sustainable travel options associated with development in t he village.  
12.467  The main part of Campsea Ashe is located to the west of the railway line, with the part of the village t o the 
east (within which this site is located) being more dispersed and not historically being identified within the 
settlement limits. Howe ver, the site is well connected to the station and the main part of the village by a 
footpath along the B1078.  
12.468  The site is allocated for development of approximately 12 dwellings. Adjoining the site is frontage 
development to the west and the Grade II Lis ted Old Rectory and Grade II* Listed Church of St John the 
Baptist to the east. The site is bordered by trees to the  east and west. Whilst the development along the 
B1078 in this location is low density and more sporadic than the main part of the village, the development 
of the site would be consistent with the pattern of development along the southern side of the B1078  and 
would not extend further south than the curtilage of The Old Rectory.  
12.469  In order that the development integrates with the surrounding la ndscape, which is characterised by areas 
of woodland and arable fields, the existing hedgerows and trees on the site  should be retained where 
possible. Boundary treatment to the southern edge of the site should reflect the character of the 
surrounding land scape for example through inclusion of trees and/or hedgerows. The development will 
also need to consider effects on  the setting of the Grade II Listed Old Rectory to the east of the site, 
Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

the rural character of the area and to avoid the introduction of suburban feat ures into this landscape.  
12.470  As the site contains a number of areas of mature hedgerows and trees, an ecological survey will be 
required, and any necessary mitigation will be required to be incorporated into the proposals.  
12.471  There is surface water flooding re corded on a small area of the northern part of the site, and development 
of the site will therefore need to ensure that any potential risk o f flooding from surface water is addressed. 
The Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study has also indicated that phosphate 
treatment may be needed at Wickham Market water recycling centre over the plan period.  
12.472  Eyke Primary School is opera ting close to capacity and considering this allocation along with Suffolk County 
Council forecasts, would be over ca pacity during the first five years of the plan period. Therefore a 
contribution towards additional school spaces will be required through th e Community Infrastructure Levy 
as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . Farlingaye High School is curr ently operating 
overcapacity with no immediate opportunities for expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be required 
through the Communit y Infrastructure Levy towards the creation of additional capacity at the proposed 
school at Brightwell Lakes to incr ease secondary education provision in the area.  
12.473  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Orford and Eyke ward. A contributio n through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy towards expansion of existing settings in Orford or Eyke will therefore be 
required as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.474  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated tha t additional primary care

12.479  Charsfield  (2011 pop. 355) is identified as a Small Village, and has a number of local facilities including a 
primary school and village hall. The site is located in the centre of the village , with existing residential 
development to the south, the church and primar y school to the west and playing fields to the east. Land 
to the south of the site has outline planning permission for 20 dwellings and this site would form a further 
phase of devel opment in this part of the village.  
12.480  The site is allocated for development of approximately 20 dwellings. The site slopes gently upwards to the 
east, and is bounded by existing trees and hedgerows on all sides. To integrate with the more rural areas 
to the  north, development proposals should retain these hedgerows and trees. Ther e are records of 
protected species in the vicinity of the site, and the retention of trees and hedgerows which form the 
boundary of the site alongside inclusion of permeable feature s would help to support biodiversity in and 
around the site.   
12.481  The Grade I Listed St. Peter’s Church lies to the west of the site, and development of the site will need to 
consider impacts on its setting, in particular when viewed from the Public Rights of  Way further to the 
west. In this respect, and in order to provide a mix of  housing, it is considered that bungalows may be 
appropriate on the higher parts of the site.  
12.482  Access to the site is expected to be delivered through St Peter’s Close, however shoul d there be an 
opportunity to access the site through the proposed development to the south of the site this may also be

349  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Land to the South of Darsham Station, Darsham  
 
12.490  Darsham  Station is a unique location in that it contains a diverse array of services and facilities, including 
Darsham train station , petrol station, garden centre, and food shop. In this regard, the site has greater 
access to a number of facilities than many set tlements across the  former Suffolk Coastal  District. The site is 
located adjacent to the A12, and its development will theref ore also help to support the Local Plan 
strategy which recognises the A12 corridor as a focus for growth.  
12.491  Land to the south of Dars ham Station is allocated for the provision of approximately 120 dwellings. B1 
employment uses will be supported if compliment ary to a residential led mixed use scheme.  
12.492  The site is situated between the A12 and the railway line and is immediately south of an  existing row of 
dwellings which front the A12. The site is currently in agricultural use, slopes upwards to the north and is  
bounded by hedgerows and trees along most of the perimeter.  
12.493  Development should protect features which contribute to the significa nce of the landscape character. 
Development should resist the planting of horticulture such as Poplar in this landscape to integrate the site 
with the character of the adjacent Parkland . 
12.494  The focus for the development of this site is to reflect the opportunities presented by the proximity of the 
station. Development is therefore expected to be focused in the northern part of the site with open space 
and vehicle access provided in the southe rn part. Due to the presence of the station and surrounding uses, 
being relatively compactly formed around the railway, the site is considered suitable for relatively high 
density development, i ncluding apartments with communal landscaped grounds, in the n orthern part of 
the site. Due to the size of the site, it is also expected that land could be made available for self -build plots.

Yoxford Conservatio n Area are  located on the western side of the A12 opposite the southern part of the 
site. A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment will need to consider the potential impacts on the park. 
The la yout of the development, focusing higher densities to the nort h of the site, will also need to be 
carefully designed to complement the setting of Cockfield Hall Park and the Grade I Listed Cockfield Hall , 
which are within the Yoxford Conservation Area .  
12.496  This site lies on a south facing slope overlooking the River Yox, and has not been subject to systematic 
archaeological investigation. Suffolk County Council have highlighted that assessment should be required 
to inform any planning application to ensure tha t proposals are sensitive to assets of archaeological 
inter est. Suffolk County Council have highlighted that a geophysical survey would be required in the first 
instance.  
12.497  Public open space provision should be in the southern part of the site, and should b e designed to 
complement the nearby Cockfield Hall Park to the east, with ‘green’ links provided through the site to 
connect with pedestrian and cycle access to the station. Provision of open space should reflect local needs 
and be provided in accordance w ith the national recommended standard of 2.4ha per 1,000 po pulation. 
Opportunities for all ages of the population to be active should be provided.  
12.498  Access to the site will need to be from Westleton Road to the south; however improved pedestrian and 
cycle c onnectivity to the station from the northern part of the si te will be expected to be provided. This 
will need to be informed by a Transport Assessment.  
12.499  Surface water flooding is recorded in the northernmost part of the site, and development of the site wi ll 
therefore need to ensure that any potential risk of floo ding from surface water is addressed.  
12.500  The area around Darsham is characterised by a mix of uses, and therefore some employment uses under 
Use Class B1 on the site would be supported provided these were compatible with the proposed and 
existing residential uses.  
12.501  Land to the north of the station, in between the railway line and the A12, is being promoted by EDF Energy 
as a possible site for a Park and Ride facility associated with the proposed Sizewe ll C nuclear power station. 
However this site is also consi dered a suitable location for employment development. Depending on future 
need to support the development of Sizewell C, development for employment uses will be supported.  
12.502  Early years provision in Wenhaston and Westleton Ward is forecast to be over capacit y and therefore a 
contribution will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards expansion of existing 
settings, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.

12.509  Darsham  (2011 pop. 300) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy reflecting its small 
number of facilities including a village hall and a public house. Darsham station is around 0.8 miles to the 
west of the village and provides rail connection s to Ipswich and Lowestoft.  
12.510  The site is allocated for development of approximately 25 dwellings. The site  represents a gap within the 
existing developed area in this part of Darsham, with development of Millfields  immediately to the east of 
the site having recently taken place. Planning permission is also granted for development on land to the 
south east of t he site on the opposite side of The Street which will incorporate provision of a new village 
hall, creating a focal point for this part of the village. The site is bordered by trees and hedgerows to the 
southern, northern and western boundaries and is curr ently in agricultural use.  
12.511  The design and layout of the development is expected to integrate with the Millf ields development to the 
east, and the retention of the hedgerows and trees on the northern boundary will be required to integrate 
the development w ith the surrounding landscape.  
12.512  A number of trees along the southern boundary of the site have Tree Preserva tion Orders, and should be

12.521  This allocation includes Policy SSP8 from t he Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Docu ment (January 2017 ). 
12.522  The site is allocated for development of approximately 35 dwellings. This site is located within Dennington 
(2011 pop. 578), which has been identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy. There is 
pedestrian access into the settlement core and v illage facilities from the site, which are located within 
walking distance of the small site. The built form is generally linear, concentrated along Saxtead Road and 
the junction with Laxfield Road.  
12.523  Development of the site needs to re flect and protect the  quiet rural character of the village and maintain 
the historic feel and the ‘back water’ qualities of the rural area.  
12.524  The central, older part of the village, extending south from the school is a designated Conservation Area. 
The site borders the Conservat ion Area at its southern boundary and two Grade II Listed Buildings (Spring 
Farmhouse and Little Wish) are situated to the south of the site. Careful consideration must be given to 
alleviating any impacts development could have on thes e heritage assets.  This site lies on a valley side, and 
Iron Age and Late Saxon/Medieval features were recorded to the south. The site has not been subject to 
systematic investigation and Suffolk County Council have highlighted that archaeological assessme nt 
should b e required to inform any planning application to ensure that proposals are sensitive to assets of 
archaeological interest.  
12.525  The western part of the site had been allocated in the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies DPD 
(2017). However, as  further la nd to the east is available it is considered appropriate to develop the site 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
357  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n more comprehensively. The larger site area also provides increased opportunity to secure improvements 
to the adjacent primary school.  
12.526  Dennington Primary School is loca ted directl y to the south of the site and has limited capacity to 
accommodate future development. Therefore development of the site will be expected to include land to 
enable future expansion of the school. The allocation in the Site Allocations and Area S pecific Pol icies 
Development Plan Document includes support for the provision of a school drop -off area and, if this is 
considered to be needed and is supported by the school and the Parish Council, this should be provided. 
This could be provided independe ntly of any  future school expansion.  
12.527  The location of the site close to the school, as a focal point of the community, provides an opportunity to 
support dwellings which would suit the older population and create a sense of community.  
12.528  Access to the site wi ll be via L axfield Road. An extension of the footway and crossing point will be required 
to provide a linkage with the village to the south.  
12.529  Open space provision on the site should encourage the population of all ages to be active and should 
promote integ ration with  the surrounding community, and provision of space to the south of the site close 
to existing uses would provide benefits in this respect. Provision of open space should reflect local needs 
and be provided in accordance with the national recomme nded standa rd of 2.4ha per 1,000 population.  
12.530  A feature of the residential character throughout the village is planted green frontages to many of the 
dwellings. In this regard, the western part of the site has potential to support terraced and/or semi 
detac hed housing  set back from Laxfield Road to accommodate the retention and enhancement of the 
hedgerow and provision of a footpath along the road frontage. As a result of the characteristic open 
countryside views to the north and east from the site , proposal s are expec ted to provide a soft edge in 
addition to existing natural screening.  
12.531  Bats have been recorded in the vicinity of the site and therefore a bat survey will be required to identify 
the extent of any bat activity. Bat friendly features may need to b e incorporated into the design of new 
development.  Any environmental survey should assess the ecological receptors which may be present on 
or around the site.  
12.532  Surface water flooding has been recorded along the northern boundary of the site. Any development  in 
this area of the site will need to demonstrate mitigation measures designed to alleviate the potential 
surface water flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in accordance with the surface water 
management hierarchy.  The site is located within  a Source Protection Zone so the treatment of surface 
water and the clearance from any infiltration features is critical.  
12.533  Thomas Mills High School is currently operating overcapacity and this development will contribute to the 
shortfall in places. The Fram lingham Neighbourhood Plan identifies a reserve site for educational uses. The 
development should contribute towards provision of additional spaces through the Community 
Infrastructure Levy as identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

early years provision to be provided through the expansion of existing settings however it is possible that a 
new setting will be required and this may require  0.1ha of land within this allocation to be reserved for

12.539  Eyke  (2011 pop. 362) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy, reflecting the existence of 
a number of facilities including a shop, primary school  and village hall. The village is located approximately 
3 miles from Woodbridge which, as a to wn, provides a wide range of services and facilities.  
12.540  The site is allocated for development of approximately 65 dwellings and land for school expansion. The site 
is located on the south western edge of the village adjacent to the existing primary school an d car park and 
is connected by footpaths along The Street to the rest of the village to the north east. The land is currently 
in agricultural use and is bordered by a small area of woodland to the south.  
12.541  Due to its proximity to the school and connectivity  to other services in the village, the site provides an 
opportunity to secure a variety of house types including housing suitable for older people. The self -build  
register identifies a large proportion of demand in the east of Ipswich and Woodbridge area a nd location 
of the site in this part of the plan area may provide an opportunity to meet some of this demand.  
12.542  Eyke primary school is operating close to capacity and therefore development of the site should set aside 
0.4ha of land adjacent to the school, t o enable provision of one form entry accommodation in the future if 
needed. There is a small parking area to the north of the site and the expansion of this to pr ovide school 
parking / drop -off area would provide further additional benefits to the school a nd community.  
12.543  The site presents an opportunity to set the new housing back from the busy A1152 ‘The Street’ and 
provide an attractive gateway to the village incl uding public open space designed to support community 
interaction. Public open space should pr ovide opportunities for all ages to be active and should reflect 
local needs. The open space should be provided in accordance with the national recommended standa rd 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
361  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n of 2.4ha per 1,000 population. Appropriate planting should distinguish the site from surrou nding 
agricultural fields and reinforce the historic pattern of regular field boundaries.  
12.544  Whilst the site is within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB),  its location provides public 
benefits in terms of enabling the expansion of the school (which  also serves surrounding communities) 
which would not be achieved through development of sites outside of the AONB. The design and layout 
needs to be sensitive to  the location of the site in the AONB, including through appropriate boundary 
treatments and l andscaping to the south western and south eastern boundaries, and appropriate lighting, 
informed through a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. Development wil l also need to respect the 
setting of the Grade II Listed Building, Eyke House, to the west of  the site.  
12.545  The site lies on the edge of the historic settlement core of Eyke, and late Anglo -Saxon and Early Medieval 
artefacts are recorded from the area. The s ite has not been subject to systematic archaeological 
investigation. Suffolk County Council ha ve highlighted that archaeological assessment should be required 
to inform any planning application to ensure that proposals are sensitive to assets of archaeolog ical 
interest.  
12.546  The development will need to incorporate improvements to the existing car park access in order for access 
to be achieved. Improvements to footways to facilitate pedestrian connectivity with the site may also be 
required,  
12.547  The site is located  within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suffolk County Council as the Minerals 
Plan ning Authority. Therefore and planning application should be supported by evidence which assesses 
the quality and quantity of sand and gravel resources on site in  order to help judge whether on -site 
resources should be used on -site during development , as d irected by the Policy . This may help reduce the 
amount of material transported on and off site during development.  
12.548  Farlingaye High School is currently operating overcapacity with no immediate opportunities for expansion. 
A contribution will, therefore, be  required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the 
creation of additional capacity at the proposed school at Brightwell Lakes to increase secondary e ducation 
provision in the area.   
12.549  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Orfo rd and Eyke ward. A contribution through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy towards expansion of existing settings in Orford or Eyke will therefore be 
required as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework. This policy requires land to enable expansio n 
of early years provision should it be needed at Eyke.

range of services and facilities which include a primary school, convenience store, village hall and doctors 
surgery.  
12.556  The site is allocated for the development of ap proximately 70 dwellings. The site is currently in agricultural 
use and is located immediately to the west of the recreation ground in the southern part of the village. It is 
bordered to the north by existing residential development and to the east by Chap el Lane, with shops and 
services, including the primary school, located further to the north.  
12.557  Beyond the southern part of the site the village becomes more rural in nature. The Settlement Sensitivity 
Assessment identifies the site as being within an area i dentified as sensitive to development which extends 
into the wider landscape. Grundisburgh Hal l Park and Garden is located to the south west of the site, and 
the design, layout and landscaping scheme for the site will need to reflect its proximity.  
12.558  Vehicl e access to the site is expected to be onto Park Road, and safe pedestrian access will need to be 
provided, including exploring opportunities to create safe access to Ipswich Road via the recreation 
ground.   
12.559  Priority Species have been identified on land cl ose to the site and therefore an ecological survey, along 
with mitigation if necessary,  will be required as part of any proposal.

12.561  Evidence from the British Geological Survey suggests that the site is likely to be suitable for in filtration of 
surface water, although this will need to be considered through a Flood R isk Assessment and Drainage

12.568  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is allocated for development of approximately 30 dwellings.  
12.569  Kelsale (201 1 pop. 990) is a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy, located just north of Saxmundham 
and with direct access to the A12. It is well related to the neighbouring market town of Saxmundham, and 
the services and facilities the town provides. Facilities within Kelsale include a primary school, general 
employment area, and a church.  
12.570  Land south of Ambleside, Main Road is 1.86 hectares in size with an indicative capacity for 30 residential 
units. It has the potential for more given the varied character and density of development to the west of 
Main Road in compariso n to development on the opposite side of Main Road, and to the north on 
Rosemary Lane. Immediately to the south of the site a single dwelling has recently been constructed.  
12.571  The Parish Council hav e indicated a need for a mix of dwellings across the site to  meet the needs 
particularly of older and younger residents wishing to remain local, and which would be available to buy or 
rent.  
12.572  In terms of physical constraints, the allocation site is not subje ct to any identified constraints. Any 
development scheme wil l be expected to ensure that the management of surface water run off is 
undertaken in accordance with the surface water management hierarchy. There are views across the site 
from the village and a  carefully designed scheme could retain some of those views.

12.581  Kettleburgh  (2011 pop. 231) is categorised as a Small Village as identified in the settlement hierarchy. The 
site currently occupies a gap in the settlement that could be utilised to create a more cohesive and 
connected vil lage. The development of the site will enabl e some small scale growth that is integrated 
amongst the established village community.  
12.582  Land north of The Street encompasses 0.75ha, development of which is expected to provide 16 dwellings 
including affordable h ousing.  
12.583  The site is allocated for developmen t of approximately 16 dwellings. The site is currently in agricultural use 
and occupies a rising topography (to the North) and therefore the development will need to be carefully 
designed to ensure that it comple ments the character of the existing village.  Linear development along the 
frontage, with further development to the rear, would reflect the existing streetscene. Careful 
consideration will need to be given to design and landscaping to reflect the site’s lo cation within a river 
valley landscape, whic h is identified as a more sensitive landscape in the Suffolk Coastal Landscape 
Character Assessment and Settlement Sensitivity Assessment.  
12.584  A Public Right of Way runs along the outside of the western border. The western border is lined by mature 
trees and does not have direct access to the footpath. Any proposals should aim to enhance access to the 
Public Right of Way while maintaining the tree lined boundary. In this regard, the site is bounded on all 
sides by he dgerows and trees which should be retained w herever possible.  
12.585  The Kettleburgh village sign is presently located within the site. Proposals should therefore incorporate the 
village sign as a focal point in the village.

12.593  Kirton (2011 pop. 1,146) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy, having a small range of 
services and facilities including a village hall and a public house. The site i s currently in agricultural use and 
is located in the centre of th e village, to the west of Bucklesham Road.  
12.594  The site is allocated for development of approximately 12 dwellings. Whilst most of the village of Kirton 
extends to the east of Bucklesham Road, this site forms part of a small, well contained area of existing 
dwellings and the public house to the west of the road. The development of this site would provide a 
modest number of homes for the village, whilst retaining open spaces along Bucklesham Road . The site is 
enclosed by existing trees and hedgerows which shoul d be retained in order to minimise impacts on the 
landscape. The layout of the development will need to be designed to protect the amenity of properties on 
the western side of Bucklesham Roa d. Improvements may be needed to the layby to the south of the sit e 
to facilitate access and a pedestrian crossing point will be required.  
12.595  Surface water flooding is recorded in the south east corner of the site. Any development in this area of the 
site wi ll need to demonstrate mitigation measures designed to alleviate t he potential surface water 
flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in accordance with the surface water management 
hierarchy.  
12.596  A project level Habitats Regulations Assessment will n eed to ensure that hydrological impacts are checked 
and adequately  mitigated for if required.

Developmen t of this site will need to contribute to the provision of additional school places as set out in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.598  Felixstowe Academy is operating close to capacity and , considering this allocation along with forecasts, 
would be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period. A contribution will, therefore, be

12.604  Knodishall (2011 pop. 853), a Large Village, benefits from a number of  facilities and good access to the 
nearby Market Town of Leiston, which has a good range of established services and facilities. The site is 
allocated for development of approximately 16 dwellings. The site is currently in agricultural use and is 
situated at the western boundary of the settlement to the south of School Road. Development of the site 
will be contained within the built form of Knodishall, following the linear  pattern of this section of School 
Road and reflecting the continuation of the built e nvironment north of School Road.  
12.605  Consideration will need to be given to design, layout and landscaping to provide an appropriate transition 
between the developed areas t o the east of the site, the more rural character to the west and Knodishall 
Common Cou nty Wildlife Site to the south. Although a substation is situated directly to the east, the 
boundary between these areas is heavily wooded. Design will need to consider t he most appropriate 
layout in order to further enhance vegetated boundary treatment.  
12.606  In relation to archaeology, Suffolk County Council have commented that the site is in a location that is 
topographically favourable for early occupation and has not been s ystematically evaluated for 
archaeological remains. A programme of archaeological work s may therefore be required . 
12.607  Surface water flooding has been recorded in the southern corner of the site and Flood Zones 2 and 3

12.613  Levington (2011 pop. 259) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy and has a small range 
of facilities including a village hall and a public house.  
12.614  The site is allocated for the development of approx imately 20 dwellings. The site is at  the northern end of 
the village with existing residential development opposite to the east of Bridge Road. The site is currently 
used as paddocks, with Red House Farm lying to the east. Overhead cables run close to the northern 
boundary of the site, and d evelopment would need to ensure that appropriate consideration is given to 
these through the layout of the site.  
12.615  Development of the site would represent a logical continuation of the settlement to the east of Bridge 
Road, reflecting the extent of developm ent on the western side. The layout of the development should 
reflect the linear nature of the village.  
12.616  The southern and western boundaries of the site comprise existing hedgerows and trees which should be 
retained othe r than where their removal is requir ed to provide access. Further landscaping on the eastern 
boundary of the site would provide a separation between the site and the farm to the east. The Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty lies to the south and west of the  site and development will therefore  need to 
be sympathetic to the surrounding landscape.  
12.617  The Landscape Character Assessment identifies that it is important to integrate new development using 
linear belts of trees, and replicate local species mixes. It als o recommends planning to improve 
pedestrian/cycle path accessibility across settlements to the AONB to help promote healthy lifestyles. This 
should be taken into account in the development of this site.

12.623  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Polici es Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is allocated for development of approximately 10 dwellings.  
12.624  Orford (2011 pop. 713) is a Large Village in the settlement hierarchy containing a variety of facilities 
including a village school, garage wi th some retail provision, fire station, town hall, church and eateries. It 
is also a tourist hotspot with the castle and access to Orford Ness and Havergate Island and is known for its 
food products. Its high quality built environment and location on the e stuary means it is attractive to 
second home owners who occupy a relatively large proportion of the properties. Whilst it is acknowledged 
that this influx of visitors at the weekend helps to keep facilities viable and provide some useful local 
employment, through the production of the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies DPD the Parish 
Council identified an increasing requirement for some new housing suitable to meet local needs and to 
help retain the village school.  
12.625  The village is entirely containe d within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with much of it also 
designated as Heritage Coast. The older part of the village, the castle and its setting are contained within a 
large Conservation Area designation with many Listed Buildings. Newer develo pme nt is largely confined to 
the northern end of the settlement, close to the allocated site.  
12.626  The site is currently in agricultural use and lies entirely within the AONB but outside of the Heritage Coast 
and Conservation Area. As a gateway into the villag e, there are views through to the castle. The site is 
contained by Ipswich Road to the east and a public footpath to the west. To the south is the small estate 
style development of Mill Close which currently forms the northern boundary to Orford. The north ern

Sudbourne Road.  
12.627  A development similar in layout to Mill Close is considered to make the best use of space. Critical to the 
design and layout wi ll be the creation of a northern boundary which is reflective of its gateway position 
into the village and its position within the AONB. Particular care will also be required in respect of those 
new buildings with elevations viewable from the north to ensu re they provide an attractive entrance to the 
village.  
12.628  Opportunity should also be taken to provide a direct access to the public footpath which runs along the 
western boundary. This gives easy direct access to the school and an alternative access to the c entre of the 
village.  
12.629  Any development scheme will be expected to ensure that the management of surface water run -off is 
undertaken in accordance with the surface water management hierarchy.  
12.630  Suffolk County Council Archaeology note that the site is close t o a possible mound and site of a windmill, 
depicted on a plan of around 1600 and that archaeological finds, particularly of medieval date have been 
recorded in the area. An archaeological investigation will therefore be required at an appropriate stage to 
allow for in -situ preservation if appropriate.  
12.631  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Orford and Eyke ward. A contribution through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy towards expansion of existing settings in Orford or Eyke will therefore be 
required as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.632  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that enhancements may be 
required at Chapman House to meet the needs arising from new development. A contribution throu gh the 
Community Infrastructure Levy will be required, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework .  
12.633  Suffolk County Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and 
under pressure due to the site size and ac cess from the highway. As a result, a contribution will be 
requested t hrough the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the expansion of the centre as identified in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.634  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study between the form er Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.

12.636  Otley (20 11 pop. 676) is identified as a Large Village in the settlement hierarchy due to the existence of a 
range of services and facilities including a primary school, shops, village hall, employment opportun ities 
and a doctors’ surgery.  
12.637  The site is allocated for  development of approximately 60 dwellings. The site is currently in agricultural use 
and comprises a number of farm buildings. The site is located close to the centre of the village, being 
adjacent to  the GP surgery and opposite the primary school and pla y area. To the north and east of the site 
is agricultural land.  
12.638  Due to the range of services and facilities in Otley, and the location of the site, it is considered to represent 
a location which would  be suitable for housing which would meet the needs of older people, including 
bungalows to reflect the character of the surrounding area.  
12.639  The built form of the existing agricultural buildings protrudes from the village into the landscape to the 
east. The layout of the site will need to be considered in relat ion to the requirements of Policy SCLP11.2 
Residential Amenity, acknowledging the potential for continued use of the land to the east for agricultural 
purposes. The development of the site should enabl e the continuation of the built form provided by Vine 
Road and Little Meadows Drive and should maintain the gap in frontage between this part of Otley and the 
built area to the north.  
12.640  Priority Species have been identified on land close to the site and the refore an ecological survey, along 
with mitigation if n ecessary, will be required as part of any proposal.

385  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.641  An area at risk of surface water flooding exists along the western boundary of the site. Any development in 
this area of the site will need to demon strate mitigation measures designed to alleviate the po tential 
surface water flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in accordance with the surface water 
management hierarchy. The site is located  in a Source Protection Zone and  treatment  of surface  water  
for pollutants  prior  to disposal  is vital.  This may require  larger  areas  to be dedicated  for SuDS  than  
standard.  
12.642  Due to the nature of current and previous agricultural uses on the site, a Contaminated Land Assessment 
will be required in order to investigate and address this potential issue.  
12.643  The Cross  Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal Distr ict Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1ha, any proposals 
for development must be accompanied by a site -specifi c Flood Risk Assessment.  
12.644  A Grade II Listed building, ‘The Shrubbery’ , is located 30m from the site on the opposite side of Chapel 
Road and development will therefore need to consider the impact on the setting of the Listed Building. The 
site lies beyond th e edge of the historic core of Otley, centred on a farmstead of unkn own date.  
12.645  Transport modelling undertaken as part of the production of the Local Plan indicates that there will be 
potential capacity issues at the junction of the B1079 and B1078 to the s outh of Otley based upon growth 
within the area. Due to its proximit y a Transport Assessment  will therefore need to consider the impacts of 
development on that junction.  
12.646  The site is located opposite the existing recreation ground and provision of open spa ce may take the form 
of enhancements to the existing recreation grou nd (which would be via the Community Infrastructure 
Levy) and/or on site provision. Provision of open space should reflect local needs and be provided in 
accordance with the national recom mended standard of 2.4ha per 1,000 population. Opportunities for all  
ages of the population to be active should be provided.  
12.647  Otley Primary School is operating close to capacity and, considering this allocation along with education 
forecasts, would be over  capacity during the first five years of the plan period. Therefore a contribution 
towards additional school spaces will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy as detailed 
in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . Farlingaye High School is c urrently operating over capacity with 
no immediate opportunities for  expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be required through the 
Community Infrastructure Levy towards the creation of additional capacity at the proposed school at 
Brightwell Lakes to deliver additional secondary education capacity in the area.  
12.648  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Fynn Valley ward. It is anticipated that a new setting 
would be provided under allocation , Policy  SCLP12.24 Land at Humber Doucy Lane how ever as this 
allocation is to come forward during the later years of  the Plan, a contribution towards expansion of the 
setting in Witnesham will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy in order to increase 
provision in the Fynn Valley ward.

Policy SCLP12 .58: Land adjacent to Swiss Farm, Otley  
1.47ha  of land at Chapel Road, Otley, as shown on the Policies Map, is identified  for the development of 
approximately 60 dwellings.  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) Provision of housing that would meet the needs of older people;  
b) Provision of affordable housing  on site ; 
c) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment;  
d) Provision of open space;  
e) Provi sion of pedestrian connectivity with the services to the north of Chapel Road;  
f) Provision of a Transport Assessment , in particular to assess impacts on the B1078 / B1079 
junction;  
g) Provision of landscaping to the eastern border  of the site to provide an app ropriate  edge in 
relation to the o pen countryside beyond the site;  
h) An ecological survey will be required, along with any identified mitigation measures ; and  
i) Provision of a Contaminated Land Assessment.  
 
Proposals for the site will need to demonstrate that  any continued uses and structures on agricultural land 
to the east of the site would not cause an unacceptable impact on the living conditions of the future 
occupiers of the site , and ensure that the new  development can be integrated effectively with the 
neighbouring agricultural use.

12.652  Peasenhall with part of Sibton  (2011 pop. 521) is identified as a Small Village in the Settlement Hierarchy 
and benefits from a good small scale convenience offer, howe ver, lacks a primary school that would 
otherwise put it in the category of Large Village. Yoxford operates as the near est primary school amongst 
other services and is a short distance from Peasenhall.  
12.653  The site is allocated for development of approximately 14 dwellings. The site is situated on the eastern 
edge of Peasenhall but tightly contained adjacent to the existing bu ilt environment to the south and west. 
Agricultural land occupies the land to the east and is the sole use of the site. The parkland setti ng of Sibton 
Abbey is located directly north, which provides a unique feature within the settlements of Peasenhall and  
Sibton. West of the site lie a number of buildings of contrasting architectural styles, which are 
characteristic of Peasenhall’s variety of high quality vernacular and formal buildings.  
12.654  The aforementioned Parkland setting to the north and high quality di verse built environment to the west 
make an important contribution to the character of the Conservation Area and will therefore need full 
consideration in regard to the design of any development. While the site is outside the Conservation Area 
boundary, po tential impact on the setting of the Conservation Area will need to be considered. 
Development must also be respectful of the important vi ew emanating from the Knoll towards the rural 
Parkland setting of Sibton Abbey.  
12.655  Suffolk County Council Archaeological  Service has identified the site as of archaeological value. 
Development proposals will need to evaluate the archaeological extent of the site through an appropriate

archaeological works may be required.  
12.656  Flood Zone 2 occupies the north east corner of the site, therefore, a site -specific flood risk assessment will 
be required and any mitigation measures identified and implemented. The north east area of the site is 
also the furthest from the built environment and hence most rural. The provision of landscaping and/or 
drainage in this locati on is therefore considered appropriate.  
12.657  Development proposals at Peasenhall should have regard to the findings of the Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich 
Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates capacity and treatment limitations at Yoxford Water 
Recycling C entre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to 
serve the proposed deve lopment.   
12.658  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required in Yoxford / Leiston to meet the needs arising from new development. A 
contribution through the Community Infrastructu re Levy will be required, as detailed in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Framework . 
12.659  Suffolk County Council have indicated that future improvem ents are needed at Leiston household waste

Market)  
 
12.661  Wickham Market (2011 pop. 2,156) is identified as a Large Village in the settlement hierarchy but has a 
much wider range of services than the other Large Villages in the plan area and has a defined Distri ct 
Centre. Wickham Market is also adjacent to the A1 2 and therefore development in the settlement would 
help to deliver the Local Plan strategy of focusing development along the A12 corridor.  
12.662  The site is allocated for the development of approximately 150 dwellings. The site is within Pettistree 
Parish but is physically connected to Wickham Market and is therefore considered in terms of its 
relationship to Wickham Market. A Neighbourhood Plan for Wickham Market is currently being produced 
and is expected to  consider the potential for further site allocations  within Wickham Market recognising its 
role as a Large Village, the range of facilities and services that exist and its proximity to the A12.  
12.663  The site is immediately south of a recent development of 65 d wellings and is bordered to the west by the 
B1438 wh ich joins the A12 to the south, and to the east by Chapel Lane. The site is presently in agricultural 
use and is open to the southern boundary.  
12.664  Due to the range of services in Wickham Market the site sho uld be developed for a mix of dwelling types 
includi ng housing suitable for older people and self -build plots. The provision of apartments would be 
appropriate where this is acceptable in landscape terms, and is likely to be most suitable on the northern 
part of the site. The provision of care home / nursin g home accommodation (under Use Class C2) would 
also be supported in this location.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
391  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.665  An extensive area of the site will be open space to ensure the nature and scale of development provides a 
soft gateway to Wickham Market, a visual buffer to development in side Wickham Market parish and the 
separation of the distinct communities of Pettistree and Wickham Market. The Policy requires a landscape 
buffer to be at least 10 metres in depth, and in the creation of  a ‘soft’ edge to the development it is 
anticipated that in places this will be greater than 10 metres in order that a uniform appearance does not 
result.  Provision of open space should provide opportunities for people of all ages to be active.  
12.666  Access shou ld be to the B1438. Footpath provision is provided a long the B1438 as part of the development 
to the north of the site, and it is expected that pedestrian connections are provided to this. An extension 
to the 30mph speed limit along High Street is likely t o be required.  
12.667  Development needs to be sensitive to  retaining settlement and landscape character and pattern. This 
includes views towards the historic village core and church and across plateau landscape. There are 
opportunities for biodiversity enhanceme nts related to the site’s situation within the wider  agricultural 
landscape.  
12.668  This large site lies to the south of prehistoric and Roman sites excavated prior to development of land 
south of Featherbroom Gardens. It has not been subject to systematic archae ological investigation. Suffolk 
County Council have highlighted that archaeological assessment should be required to inform any planning 
application to ensure that proposals are sensitive to assets of archaeological interest.  
12.669  A small area of surface water  flooding is recorded in the northern part of the si te. Any development in this 
area of the site will need to demonstrate mitigation measures designed to alleviate the potential surface 
water flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in accordance with the surface water management 
hierarchy.  
12.670  The Cro ss Boundary Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposal s for further development must be accompanied by a s ite-specific Flood Risk Assessment. The site 
is also located within a Source Protection Zone and, therefore, the relevant Water Company must be 
consulted in order to avoid water contamination.  
12.671  Development  proposals at Wickham Market and Pettistree should h ave regard to the findings of the 
Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates treatment limitations at 
Wickham Market Water Recycling Centre. Evidence will be required to de monstrate how capacity will be 
made available in tim e to serve the proposed development.   
12.672  The site is located within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suffolk County Council as the Minerals 
Planning Authority. Therefore any planning application sh ould be supported by evidence which assesses 
the qua lity and quantity of sand and gravel resources on site in order to help judge whether on -site 
resources should be used on -site during development , as directed by the Policy . This may help reduce the 
amoun t of material transported on and off site  during development.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

construction of a new setting will therefore be required as set out in the Infrastructur e Delivery 
Framework. This policy allows for a portion of this site to be used for an early years setting, if required.  
12.674  Thomas Mills High School is currently operating over capacity and this development will contribute to the 
shortfall in places. The Fram lingham Neighbourhood Plan identifies a r eserve site for educational uses. The 
development should contribute through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards provision of 
additional spaces as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.675  The East Suf folk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Gro up have indicated that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required at Wickham Market Medical Practice to meet the needs arising from new 
development. A contribution will be required through the Community Inf rastructure Levy towards 
enhancements at Wickham Market Medical Practice, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . 
12.676  Suffolk County Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and 
under pressure due to th e site size and access from the highway. As a result, a contribution will be 
required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the expansion of the centre as identified in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.

12.678  Greater Anglia have highlighted the need for development proposals to contribute to the accessibility of 
rail stati ons and the quality of its ancillary facilities and to enhance the visitor experience. In this respect, a 
contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy relating to Campsea Ashe rail station may be 
required.

Rendlesham  
 
12.679  These alloca tions are  carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017).Land west of Garden Square is allocated for the development of approximately 
50 dwellings and also Land east of Redwald Road is allocate d for the  development of approximately 50 
dwellings.  
12.680  Rendlesham (2011 pop. 3,013) is a Large Village in the settlement hierarchy which is altogether larger, and 
contains a much wider variety of facilities than is common to most other Large Villages in the  plan are a 
given its historic legacy as a former US Airforce base. It also has a ‘made’ Neighbourhood Plan, containing 
policies relating to the promotion of the village centre to continue to develop to meet the needs of 
existing and future residents, and t he provis ion of allotments.  
12.681  The Neighbourhood Plan builds on the work of the earlier masterplan for Rendlesham and seeks to ensure 
that the village continues to develop and function to meet the needs of new and established residents and 
businesses, concen trating o n the provision of services and facilities required to meet the needs of the new 
and growing population. Across the main road from the main residential area, is a large employment site 
containing a mix of uses (the former technical base). A compre hensive d evelopment plan for the whole 
employment site has been granted planning permission which will guide the future provision of 
employment land in this area.  
12.682  Whilst the Neighbourhood Plan does not allocate land for housing, Section 10 of the plan incl udes a 
number of objectives (3 – 3f) in relation to new housing e.g. to density and streetscene. In addition, Policy 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
395  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n RNPP3 requires that new residential or mixed use development makes provision towards the identified 
local need for allotments, orchards and  growing spaces.  
12.683  In the longer term, the village may have capacity to accommodate more than the 100 homes proposed, 
but is limited predominantly by highway factors and the cumulative impact of both residential and 
employment traffic on the local highway n etwork, a nd also by education capacity. Higher levels of growth 
are likely to trigger the need for new education and early years provision. There is a need to maintain a 
clear overview of the cumulative impact of individual developments on the local road n etwork fr om 
Rendlesham through to Melton and the A12. The internal road layout within the village (a consequence of 
its original function as an airbase) means access from the village to the external road network is limited. 
There are also few opportunities  to acces s the adjacent countryside due to lack of public footpaths and the 
presence of a perimeter fence, again a legacy of its former use as an airbase. The provision of a new 
footpath/bridleway is a condition of the recent planning permission for the em ployment site providing 
residents with more direct access to Rendlesham / Tunstall Forest.  
12.684  Two sites are allocated for large scale housing schemes which together can provide approximately 100 
homes. Both sites provide the opportunity for additional communi ty benefi t as envisaged in the 
Neighbourhood Plan.  
12.685  Development proposals for both allocations will need to investigate the cumulative traffic impact on air 
quality at Melton crossroads and the Air Quality Management Area declared in Woodbridge. An Air Qual ity 
Asses sment, together with a mitigation appraisal, will be required.  
12.686  The site allocated as Policy SCLP12.6 1 is the northern of the two sites identified on the plan above. The 
main limiting factors in respect of this site are its proximity to the Water R e-cycling Centre (sewage 
treatment works) which requires the provision of a ‘cordon sanitaire’, and the sewers  that cross the site. 
The minimum distance for the cordon sanitaire will be a matter for discussion with Anglian Water as will 
any layout issues l inked to the alignment of the sewers. The number of homes and the area on which 
development could take place h as therefore been reduced to approximately 50.  
12.687  Anglian Water confirmed that there is likely to be a need for improvements to the foul sewerage ne twork. 
Land not suitable for building does however have the potential to provide for a mix of informal open sp ace 
and allotment provision in accordance with Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan objective 4, Allotments, 
Orchards and Growing Places and Neighbourhoo d Plan Policy RNPP3. Informal open space will provide 
space for daily dog walking and complement existing more  formal green space provision nearby, as an 
alternative to the more sensitive Rendlesham and Tunstall Forests.  
12.688  The Cross Boundary Water Cycle Stu dy between  the former  Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as bei ng within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, any 
proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.   
12.689  The design and layout of the scheme will be expected to have due regard to the housing and transport 
objecti ves set out in the ‘made’ Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

Rendlesham Hall and within the broader landscape, where there is evidence of significant multi -period 
archaeological remains. An archaeological assessment at an appropriate stage in the design of the 
development will be required to allow for in-situ preservation as necessary.  
12.691  Rendlesham  Primary School is operating close to capacity and, considering this allocation along with 
education forecasts, would be  marginally  over capacity during the first five years of the plan period. 
However, the pro vision of a greater proportion of housing designed to meet the needs of the elderly 
population or smaller dwel lings could assist in addressing this. Farlingaye High School is currently operating 
over capacity with no immediate opportunities for expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be required 
through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the creation of additional capacity at the proposed 
school at Brightwell Lakes to increase secondary education provision in the area.  
12.692  Early years provision in Ren dlesham ward is forecast to be over capacity and a contribution is therefore 
required through the Community In frastructure Levy towards expansion of existing provision as set out in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.693  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinica l Commissioning Group have indicated that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required at Rendlesham Me dical Practice to meet the needs arising from new 
development. A contribution will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards 
enhancements at Rendlesham Medical Practice, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . 
12.694  Suffolk Coun ty Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and

5.05ha of land west of Garden Square, Rendlesham, as shown on the Policies  Map, is ide ntified for a mixed 
development of approximately 50 dwellings and greenspace provision .  
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) Ensure that the risk of odour and other amenity impacts from Rendlesham Water Recycling Centre 
is not detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers as set out in Policy SCLP11.2. 
Evidence should be provided to demonstrate that there is no unacce ptable impact on the 
occupiers of the future dwellings, and that the continuous operation of Rendle sham Water 
Recycling Centre is not affected . This will require the provision of a suitable distance from the 
Water Recycling Centre within which new resident ial development is considered acceptable as 
advised by Anglian Water;  
b) Accommodate the sewers that c ross the site;  
c) The design, layout, mix and type of housing proposed is compatible with the housing and 
transport objectives set out in the ‘made’ Rendlesham  Neighbourhood Plan;  
d) Provision of affordable housing;  
e) The remaining greenspace should be used for a  mix of informal open space suitable for daily dog 
walking, allotments or orchards in accordance with Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan policy 
RNPP3;  
f) Provision of a substantial landscape buffer to the northern and western boundaries where it abuts 
open countr yside;  
g) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment is required;  
h) Evidence is required to demonstrate there is adequate provision for treatment at the Water 
Recycl ing Centre or that this can be provided;  
i) An archaeological assessment will be required ; and  
j) Confir mation of adequate capacity in the foul sewerage network or action to upgrade to create 
the required capacity.  
In addition, the air quality impacts of traffic from cumulative development at Melton crossroads and the 
Air Quality Management Area declared in Woodbridge will need to be investigated in the form of an Air 
Quality Assessment, together with a mitigation appraisal.  
 
12.696  Approximately 4.3 ha of land to the east of Redwald Road is identified for residential development for 
approximately 50 units  with acc ess off Redwald Road. The site is contained within established defensible 
boundaries of established woodland with more ext ensive plantation to the north and east of the site. 
Woodbridge and Redwald Roads act as the boundaries to the south and west. The sit e frontage along 
Redwald Road is bounded by a water course and this will need to be accommodated within the design.  
12.697  The s ite is within close proximity of the centre of Rendlesham with pedestrian connectivity using Spencer 
Road. Redwald Road is on a bus ro ute and a bus stop is located within 100m of the site. Currently footways Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

indicated footways on both sides of the road and a pedestrian crossing point may be required.  
12.698  The design, layout, mix and type of housing development will be expected to have due regard to Objective  
3a set out in the Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan. New residential development will be required to make 
provision for allotments, orcha rds and growing spaces in accordance with RNPP3, where a local need is 
identified.  
12.699  Through production of the Site Allocat ions and Area Specific Policies Development Plan Document, Natural 
England highlighted the need to undertake a biodiversity survey of the site and adjoining woodland, and if 
necessary, appropriate mitigation measures will need to be carried out. Developmen t should also respect 
the location adjacent to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a Landscape 
and Vis ual Impact Assessment r equirement should be carried out to inform the design and landscaping of 
the scheme. The trees bord ering the B1069 should be retained.  
12.700  Suffolk County Council Archaeology have indicated that the site should be subject to an archaeolo gical 
assessment at an appropriate pre -application stage in the design of the development. This will allow for 
preservatio n in situ, where appropriate, of any sites of importance that might be defined (and which are 
currently unknown) and to allow archaeol ogical strategies to be designed.  
12.701  In line with priorities identified in the Rendlesham Neighbourhood Plan, developers sho uld explore, in 
conjunction with Rendlesham Parish Council, the potential to provide, as part of the scheme a public 
house or similar licenced venue.  
12.702  The Suffolk Coastal & Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study has indicated that phosphate treatment 
may  be needed at Rendlesham Park water recycling centre over the plan period.  Evidence will be required 
to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to serve the proposed development.  
12.703  Rendlesham Primary School is operating close to capacity and , considering this allocation along with 
education forecasts, would be marginally over capacity during the first five years of the pla n period. 
However, the provision of a greater proportion of housing designed to meet the needs of the elderly 
population o r smaller dwellings could assist in addressing this. Farlingaye High School is currently operating 
overcapacity with no immediate oppo rtunities for expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be required 
through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the  creation of additional capacity at the proposed

12.709  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Docum ent (January 2017). The site is allocated for the development of approximately 10 dwellings and car 
parking.  
12.710  Shottisham (2011 pop. 197) is a settlement identifie d as countryside in the settlement hierarchy. In the 
previous Local Plan (Site Allocations Dev elopment Plan Document, January 2017) it was identified as a local 
service centre and received an allocation which is being carried forward into this Local Plan.  
12.711  The Parish Council in its Housing Survey Analysis 2015 has identified a need for affordable ho using to 
enable young people to remain in the village and for smaller properties to facilitate those wishing to down -
size. The Parish Council also identified on -street parking as an issue. This can result in difficulties for 
through traffic and adversely a ffect the setting of the Conservation Area.  
12.712  The site is centrally located and can provide pedestrian access to the centre of the village via Villa Hill 
avoiding the need to walk along The Street which has no footways at this point.  
12.713  Due to height level ch anges between the site and ‘The Street’, Suffolk County Council Highway Authority 
have indicated that a single point of vehicular access from the highway would be  appropriate. This single 
point would serve as access to the residential development and car p ark. Achieving an appropriately 
designed access and securing acceptable access sight lines will be critical to this scheme and will be subject 
to approval by Suff olk County Council Highway Authority. Pedestrian connectivity should be provided from 
the site  to access Villa Hill.

to undertake a Landscape Visual  Impact Appraisal, and if necessary, provide appropriate mitigation.  
12.715  The site lies in close pr oximity to the Conservation Area and Listed Buildings, with the Grade II Listed Sorrel 
Horse Inn located opposite. As such, development of the site will need to p reserve and enhance the 
character and setting of the Conservation Area and Listed Buildings. T his site lies in an area of 
archaeological potential. Therefore, an archaeological assessment will be required.  
12.716  Anglian Water has indicated a significant off -site sewerage requirement to provide foul water connections. 
Risks posed by septicity of pumped co nnection will also need to be addressed.  
12.717  Hollesley Primary School is forecast to be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period and 
therefore a contribution will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards additional 
school spaces as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery Framework . Farlingaye  High School is currently 
operating overcapacity with no immediate opportunities for expansion. A contribution will, therefore, be 
required through the Community Infrastructure Levy  towards the creation of additional capacity at the 
proposed school at Brig htwell Lakes to increase secondary education capacity in the area.  
12.718  The East Suffolk & Ipswich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that enhancements may be 
required at The Pe ninsula Practice and its branch Chapman House to meet the needs arising fro m new 
development. A contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy will be required, as detailed in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework .  
12.719  Suffolk County Council have indi cated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and

0.42 ha of land oppo site The Sorrel Horse, The Street, Shottisham, as shown on the Policies Map, is 
identified for small scale mixed use development for approximately 10 dwellings and a car park to 
accommodate circa 30 cars.  
Development will be expected to accord with the fo llowing criteria:  
a) The design and layout should be of high quality, responding to the site ’s location in an Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty; and preserving and enhancing the chara cter and setting of the 
Conservation Area, and Listed Buildings;  
b) Provision of smaller open market housing. A financial contribution will be sought towards 
affordable housing provision;  
c) Developers will need to undertake a Landscape Visual Impact Appraisal, and if necessary, provide 
appropriate mitigation  including approp riate lighting ; 
d) Provision of appropriate access arrangements regarding the access point, and securing acceptable

12.721  This allocation is carried forward from the Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan  (January 2017). The site is 
allocated for the development of approximately 36 0 dwellings.  
12.722  Howlett Way provides access from the A14 to the communities of Trimley St Martin (2011 pop. 1,942) and 
Trimley St Mary (pop. 3,665). The site is centrally located to  the villages of Trimley St Martin and Trimley St 
Mary.  
12.723  Land off Howlett Way is a large site within the Felixstowe Peninsula and it is anticipated that over 360 
dwellings could be provided. Public consultation responses highlight a need for dwellings targe ted at the 
retirement market. Housing opportunities for younger people and fa milies will also be expected on the site 
as this will redress the population imbalance across this part of the plan area . 
12.724  The site includes part of the ‘Old Poultry Farm’ with exi sting residential properties to the north and west of 
the site, the A14 to th e east and agricultural fields to the south. Residential development adjacent to this 
site is predominately one or two storeys in height and the Council expects a similar scale of  development 
to come forward on this site.  
12.725  The Council’s Environmental Protec tion Team have advised that an Air Quality Assessment would be 
required alongside any future planning application to assess the cumulative impacts of the developments 
in Trimley S t Martin and Trimley St Mary. The site also shares a boundary with the A14 an d it is essential 
that landscape buffers are provided to reduce the noise impact on this boundary. Currently mature trees 
provide a buffer but it may be appropriate to extend this  buffer to further reduce the impact.  
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
405  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n 12.726  Suffolk County Council as highway auth ority have identified that the access onto Howlett Way needs to be 
considered through a transport assessment as part of any future planning application. No vehicular access 
could be gained from Church Lane as this is only appropriate for walking and cyclin g routes to improve 
connections to the rest of the village and existing communities. Bridleway 5 and Footpaths 23 and 26 serve 
this site and it will be essential that the future d evelopment of this site provides appropriate linkages to 
these established ro utes, thus improving the connectivity of the site with the surrounding areas as well as 
providing opportunity to create circular walks, encouraging access away from the Special Pr otection Areas. 
Surface improvements to the Public Rights of Way and potentia l extensions to link into the wider network 
will be supported.  
12.727  The site is known to be of archaeological interest. Suffolk County Council requires an archaeological 
assessment to be undertaken at an appropriate stage prior to the granting of outline, techn ical details or 
full planning permission. It is a large area to the northeast of the historic settlement core of Trimley (TYN 
060) and includes a rectangular pillbox based on the ‘Suffolk Square’ design (TYN 024). Any new 
development at this site should al low for preservation of archaeological interests in situ where 
appropriate.  
12.728  Open space will need to be provided on site and developers will be required to consider local needs and  
requirements as part of their proposals alongside the nationally published s tandards of 2.4ha per 1000 
population.  
12.729  Anglian Water have identified that a water mains crosses this site and therefore any future development 
will need to ensure that access to this is maintained through an appropriate design and layout.  
12.730  Historic England  has expressed concern about the potential impact of residential development on the 
Grade II listed churches and the Old Rectory, a Grade II Listed Building, situated at the south  of the site. 
They advise that the setting of these buildings should be prote cted and any development in close 
proximity needs to be of a high quality and sympathetic to the character of the area and the existing Listed 
Buildings.  
12.731  Trimley St Martin Primary  School is operating close to capacity and, considering this allocation along  with 
forecasts, would be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period. The proposed site allocation 
at Land adjacent to Reeve Lodge, High Road, Trimley St Martin (Policy SCLP12.6 5) will include provision of 
a primary school with early year s provision, and a contribution will be required from development of this 
site towards primary school provision. Felixstowe Academy currently provides provision for secondary 
educ ation, but over the plan period will require improvements to ensure sufficien t capacity is maintained. 
Contributions will be sought through the Community Infrastructure Levy as set out in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Framework.  
12.732  Early years provision is fore cast to be over capacity in the Felixstowe peninsula and a new setting will 
therefore need to be provided on site.  
12.733  The Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group have advised that additional primary care 
floorspace will be required to meet the needs arising from new development, as detailed in the Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies  
                                                                                                                    www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  406 Infrastructure Deliver y Framework. A contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards 
additional primary care floorspace will be requested. Given the close proximity of this site to the p roposed 
North Felixstowe Garden Neighbourhood, strategic planning in consulta tion with the NHS and Ipswich & 
East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group will also be required.  
12.734  Development proposals at Trimley St Martin should have regard to the findings of t he Suffolk Coastal & 
Ipswich Cross Boundary Water Cycle Study which indicates  capacity  limitations at Felixstowe Water 
Recycling Centre. Evidence will be required to demonstrate how capacity will be made available in time to 
serve the proposed development.   
12.735  The Water Cycle Study also identifies this site as being within Flood Zone 1. As the site area is over 1 ha, 
any proposals for development must be accompanied by a site -specific Flood Risk Assessment.  
12.736  Suffolk County Council have indicated tha t there is no planned expansion of the Felixstowe household 
waste recycling centre; howev er, the development proposed in this area would result in an increase in 
throughput at this site and improvements are therefore required. A contribution will be requir ed through 
the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the improvement of the centre as ide ntified in the

12.738  Trimley  St Martin (2011 pop. 1,942) is identified as a Large Village in the settlement hierarchy due to its 
wide range of facilities including shops, a primary school and a comm unity hall. It is located close to the 
A14 and Felixstowe, providing access to a wider  range of services, facilities and employment opportunities.  
12.739  The site is allocated for the development of approximately 150 dwellings and a primary school. The site is 
located on the southern edge of Trimley St Martin adjacent to a recent residential devel opment of 66 
dwellings at the former Trimley Mushroom Farm site , and straddles the parish boundary with Trimley St 
Mary . The site is arable farmland although currently be ing used as a temporary depot site by Network Rail 
and is bordered on the west to open  countryside with the railway line beyond, and to the east by High 
Road and existing properties. There are opportunities to integrate new development using linear belts o f 
trees, and replicate local species mixes. There are also opportunities to improve pe destrian/cycle path 
access to provide access to the AONB to help promote active healthy lifestyles.  
12.740  The Felixstowe Peninsula Area Action Plan identified the need for a n ew primary school (including an early 
years setting) in the area due to forecast short falls in capacity over the timeframe of the AAP. East Suffolk 
Council has been exploring possibilities with the County Council and this site offers a central location 
relative to the existing and proposed residential allocations with the villages of Trimle y St Martin and 
Trimley St Mary and performs best in terms of accessibility by walking. This site provides an opportunity to 
accommodate a new primary school, and 2.2ha l and will need to be provided as part of the development 
of a new primary school which would have scope to accommodate 2 form entry in the future. The school 
should be located in the western part of the site forming part of a focal point for the community. Potential 
Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
409  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n for community use of school facilities should also be investigated. A new ea rly years setting should be 
located alongside the school.  
12.741  Development of the site should provide for a range of housing types reflecting the position of the site 
being we ll connected to services and facilities. Provision should be made for housing that wou ld help to 
meet the needs of older people, as well as for families, and self -build plots should be made available on 
site. Apartments would be suitable on the site provid ed these are of a scale and design appropriate to the 
landscape and character of the a rea, and are likely to be most suitable in the southern part of the site.  
12.742  The development of the site will need to incorporate open space provision which should form a fo cal point 
on the eastern side of the site, providing opportunities for interaction wit h uses surrounding the site. Open 
space will need to provide opportunities for people of all ages to be active, and will need to meet the 
standards of 2.4ha per 1,000 pop ulation.  
12.743  Landscaping will be required on the boundaries of the site with the countrysi de, to integrate the site with 
the rural character of the area to the west  and to provide for the aim of avoiding the coalescence of 
communities to not be compromised . A Landscape Visual Impact Assessment will be required to inform 
the landscape strategy for the site to minimise impact on the AONB.  
12.744  Suffolk Wildlife Trust have identified potential for species or habitats of nature conservation interest to be 
present on  the site and therefore an ecological survey will be required, and any necessary mitigation 
provided.  
12.745  A small area of Surface Water Flooding is recorded in the centre of the site. Any development in this area 
of the site will need to demonstrate mitigatio n me asures designed to alleviate the potential surface water 
flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in accordance with the surface water management 
hierarchy.  
12.746  The site is in an area  of archaeological potential  and contains  known  archaeological  remai ns. There  is 
cropmark  evidence  for multiperiod  activity  in the eastern  half of the site, which is likely  to be  mainly  
prehistoric.  There  are fewer  recorded  cropmarks  in the western  part, but  this may be due to masking  
factors  such as  soil type  or farming  practices.  Work at  the adjacent  Mushroom  Farm  identified  fairly  dense  
(for the period)  Bronze  Age and Iron Age pits and ditches,  demonstrating  that remains  are likely  to 
continue  beyond  those  showing  in aerial photographs. Suffolk  County  Council have  highli ghted  that 
archaeological  assessment should  be required  to inform the masterplan  to inform  viability  of schemes, 
mitigation  requirements  and conservation  in situ of significant remains.  Any mitigation  should  involve  
outreach proposals.  
12.747  The site is located  within a Minerals Consultation Area as defined by Suffolk County Council as the Minerals 
Planning Authority. Therefore any planning application should be supported by evidence which assesses 
the quality and quantity  of sand and gravel resources on site in  order to help judge whether on -site 
resources should be used on -site during development , as directed by the Policy . This may help reduce the 
amount of material transported on and off site  during development.    Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted Septem ber 2020 | Area Specific Strategies

12.754  Tuddenham (2011 pop. 353) is identified a s Small Village in the settlement hierarchy due to the presence 
of a small range of facilities including a community hall and public house. The site is located in the 
northern part of the village, close to the playing fields and existing residential develo pment at Keightley 
Way.  
12.755  The site is allocated for the development of approximately 25 dwellings. Reflecting the character and 
settlement patterns of the surrounding residential areas it is considered that the site would be suitable for 
development of dwel lings at a relatively high density for a village location, and in particular smaller 
terraced and semi detached properties should be provided in the southern part of the site.  
12.756  The site slopes upwards to th e north and is bordered by existing trees and hedg erows, which should be 
retained in order to preserve the enclosed nature of this part of Tuddenham. The Landscape Character 
Assessment identifies trees along hedges, verges and field boundaries as key featu res and recommends 
enhancements to biodiversity in  the highly agricultural landscape.  
12.757  Development of the site provides an opportunity to create a pedestrian and cycle link to the playing fields 
to the east of the site, from Keightley Way.  
12.758  A small area of surface water flooding is recorded in the north of  the site. Any development in this area of 
the site will need to demonstrate mitigation measures designed to alleviate the potential surface water 
flooding risks. This is required to be undertaken in acc ordance with the surface water management 
hierarchy.

highways network around Ipswich and consideration should be given to cumulative traffic impacts.  
12.760  Rushme re Hall Primary School is operating close to capacity  and, considering this allocation along with 
forecasts, would be over capacity during the first five years of the plan period. Development of this site will 
need to contribute to the provision of additio nal school places or consideration would need to be g iven to 
whether a contribution could be made towards additional primary school spaces at the Ipswich Garden 
Suburb. If the latter is the case, development of the site would need to come forward later in the plan 
period. Northgate High School is expected to  exceed capacity, with new provision due to be made at 
Ipswich Garden Suburb. Between them, these schools should be able to make provision for these pupils, 
although a contribution through the Community Infrastructure Levy would be required towards additio nal 
spaces.  
12.761  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Fynn Valley ward. It is anticipated that a new setting 
would be provided under allocation , Policy  SCLP12.24 Land at Humber Doucy Lane, however, as this

12.766  This allocation is carried forward from the Site Allocations and Area Specific Policies Development Plan 
Document (January 2017). The site is allocated for the development of approximately 20 dwellings.  
12.767  This site south of Lower Road in Westerfield (2011 pop. 442) is the northern of the two sites shown on the 
map. It is 2.45ha in size, well related to the main central crossroads within the vil lage and sits between and 
opposite existing groups of residentia l properties. The site comprises the whole field, which is well defined 
by existing planted boundaries. The mature oak trees along the frontage with Lower Road are subject to a 
Tree Preservati on Order. There is also a drainage ditch along the Lower Road fr ontage.  
12.768  Discussions with the Parish Council confirmed that at least part of the site was previously used as the 
village football pitch but that no longer exists. There is now no focal point f or the village or open space 
available for community events. It is considered that a small, well designed scheme in this location south of 
Lower Road could enable the provision of a new village green as a focal point for the community. The site 
is well loc ated in relation to the main concentration of existing developme nt. The character of this part of 
the village is not limited to frontage development so offers an opportunity to design a scheme of 
approximately 20 dwellings around the provision of a village  green.  
12.769  Suffolk County Council Archaeology note that this site is close to the medieval core of the settlement and 
within the findspot of Roman, Saxon and Iron Age objects. The site should therefore be subject to an 
archaeological assessment at an appropr iate stage in the design process which would allow for 
preservat ion in -situ where appropriate.

12.777  Westleton  (2011 pop. 349) is identified as a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy due to the range of 
services and facilities it has including a shop and a village hall.  The site is allocated for the development of 
approximately 20 dwelli ngs.  
12.778  The site is situ ated on the southern edge of the settlement and is presently in agricultural use. The 
orientation of the site is designed to facilitate development that follows the existing built form of the 
settlement. The relatively prominent locat ion of the site in the  landscape is extenuated by the proximity to 
Westleton Common County Wildlife Site. This provides an opportunity to create an attractive gateway 
development to the village that draws on the high quality design with reference to the We stleton 
Conservation A rea Appraisal. The provision of chalet style dwellings and bungalows would integrate 
positively with the surrounding character. There is a footpath on the eastern side of Reckford Road, and 
pedestrian connectivity with the footpath sh ould be provided as pa rt of the development.  
12.779  Due to the prominent location of the site, landscaping will be required in order to provide a ‘soft’ edge to 
the southern and western boundaries of the site. The southern boundary of the site extending beyond th e 
southernmost dwellin g on the east side of the road, facilitates the provision of a landscape buffer between 
built and natural environments. In relation to heathland to the east on the opposite side of the B1125, it is 
important to consider indirect effec ts resulting from adja cent land use changes such as increases in 
recreational pressure.  
12.780  An area of surface water flooding is recorded along the northern and eastern boundaries of the site. Any 
development in this area of the site will need to demonstrate m itigation measures des igned to alleviate

12.811  Witnesham  (2011 pop. 792) is a Small Village in the settlement hierarchy containing a church, public house 
and primary school. The village comprises a number of parts. The two main elements, Witnesham (Bridge) 
to the south and Witnesham (Chap el) to the north contai n the main residential areas and each has a 
physical limits boundary. To the north between Witnesham (Chapel) and Swilland is a small cluster of 
dwellings, public house and primary school which does not have a physical limits boundar y.  
12.812  This site of 0.7ha comprises a largely disused farm complex on the edge of Witnesham (Bridge). Given the 
exclusion of agricultural buildings on land to the south, the layout of the development will need to give 
consideration to the amenity of future oc cupiers under Policy SC LP11.2.  The farmhouse, a Listed Building, 
is still occupied. Land south of Hall Road and The Street which includes this site, lie s within the River Fynn 
Valley – a landscape of attractive and distinctive character. Suffolk County Cou ncil Archaeology note s that 
due to the site’s  location on the south bank of the River Fynn , an archaeological investigation will be 
required. A small section of the site along its northern boundary where it borders the River Fynn is within 
Flood Zone 3. An y development within Fl ood Zone 3 is to be avoided having the highest potential risk from 
flooding. The Environment Agency have confirmed that a flood risk assessment will be required as part of 
any planning application. Anglian Water have confirm ed they h ave no objection to the  allocation of this 
site. Existing access to the site is narrow and directly onto a bend in the road (B1077). Use of the existing 
access may need to be re -assessed or may otherwise act as a limit to numbers of new dwellings it can 
serve.

interesting residential development given the mix and scale of buildings which are currently present on 
site. The presence of the Listed Buil ding and the flood risk  on the northern part of the site are constraints 
which will need to be considered in any design for the site. Impact on the landscape will be a consideration 
of any development proposal. These elements together with the access issue s may act as a limit to  the 
amount of new development which is ultimately acceptable.  
12.814  Witnesham Primary School is operating close to capacity and, considering this allocation along with 
forecasts, would be marginally over capacity during the first five ye ars of the plan period.  A contribution 
may therefore be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy towards additional spaces. Claydon 
High School is currently forecast to exceed capacity and development is therefore expected to contribute 
through t he Community Infrastruc ture Levy to additional secondary spaces.  
12.815  Early years provision is forecast to be over capacity in Fynn Valley ward. It is anticipated that a new setting 
would be provided under allocation , Policy  SCLP12.24 Land at Humber Doucy Lane , however, as this 
allocation is to come forward during the later years of the Plan, a contribution towards expansion of the 
setting in Witnesham will be required through the Community Infrastructure Levy in order to increase 
provision in the Fynn Valley w ard. 
12.816  The Cross Boundary  Water Cycle Study between the former Suffolk Coastal District Council and Ipswich 
Borough Council identifies this site as being within an area of high tidal or fluvial flood risk. Any proposals 
for further development at this site m ust therefore have rega rd to this issue and be accompanied by a site -
specific Flood Risk Assessment. The site is also located within a Source Protection Zone and, therefore, the 
relevant Water Company must be consulted in order to avoid water contamination . 
12.817  The East Suffolk & Ip swich Clinical Commissioning Group have indicated that additional enhancements will 
be required in Grundisburgh/Otley to meet the needs arising from new development. A contribution will 
be required through the Community Infrastructur e Levy, as detailed in the Infrastructure Delivery 
Framework . 
12.818  Suffolk County Council have indicated that Foxhall household waste recycling centre is overcapacity and 
under pressure due to the site size and access from the highway. As a result, a contributi on will be 
requested th rough the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the expansion of the centre as identified in 
the Infrastructure Delivery Framework.  
12.819  Suffolk County Council have provided information relating to library improvements across the plan ar ea. 
This site falls wit hin the catchment of Ipswich library which has been identified as a library where 
improvements are necessary to enhance provision. A contribution through the Community Infrastructure 
Levy will be requested towards the improvement of library provision as id entified in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Framework.  Area Specific Strategies  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
429  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localpla n Policy SCLP12.7 1: Land at Street Farm, Witnesham (Bridge)  
0.7ha of land at Street Farm, Witnesham, as shown on the Policies Map, is identified for the development 
of approximately 20  dwellings.   
Development will be expected to accord with the following criteria:  
a) A site -specific Flood Risk Assessment;  
b) Impact on the listed farmhouse;  
c) An archaeological investigation will be required;  
d) Provision of affordable housing  on site ; 
e) Provision of footway / pedestrian enhancements;  
f) Design and layout to be sympathetic to the sensitive river valley landscape character , and to have 
regard to former farmyard use ; 
g) Where possible retention of existing trees along the boundaries to the site;  
h) Any developmen t within the area identified as Flood Zone 3 should be avoided to ensure no 
impediments to flows are introduced that could increase the risk of flooding downstream;  
i) Provision of an ecological assessment in relation to potential impact on the River Fynn, a nd 
opportunities should be explored which would improve and enhance the riverside environment in 
this location under the Water Framework Directive ; and  
j) Provision of a Contaminated Land Assessment.  
 
Proposals for the site will need to demonstrate that any c ontinued uses and structures on agricultural land 
to the south of the site would not cause an unacceptable impact on the living conditions of future 
occupiers of the site, and ensure that the new development can be integrated effectively with the 
neighbour ing agricultural use.

Appendix A – Policy Delivery Framework  
Central to the plan making system is the issue of deliverability.  In order to  be effective Local Plans must be 
deliverable.  The success of the Local Plan will be d ependent on the continual engagement and partnership 
working between the Council, developers, infrastructure providers and other interested stakeholders, 
including the pu blic as well as Town and Parish Councils.  Communities undertaking Neighbourhood Plans 
will also have a crucial role in expanding upon and adding to the Local Plan policies and proposals to 
address detailed local circumstances.  
The policies and proposals of  the Local Plan will be delivered primarily through the determination and 
implementati on of planning applications for the development and use of land and buildings over the plan 
period.  Neighbourhood Plans also have a key role to play in the delivery of th e Local Plan policies.  A 
number of Neighbourhood Plans have been ‘made ’ across the for mer Suffolk Coastal  area  and the Council 
will continue to support local communities who undertake these over the plan period.  Where relevant, 
reference to Neighbourhood P lans are made in the framework below.  
The Delivery Framework  has been prepared to deta il the mechanisms by which the policies in the Plan will 
be delivered and to identify, and mitigate, any risks to their delivery . Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Appendix A

                                                                                                                 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  458 Appendix B – Infrastructure Delivery  Framework  
The policies and proposals of the Local Plan will be delivered primarily through the deter mination and 
implementation of planning applications for the development and use of land and buildings. However, the 
success of the Local Plan will be depe ndent on partnership working between the Council, developers, 
infrastructure providers, and other int erested stakeholders, including the public and Parish and Town 
Councils. Neighbourhood Plans will also have a crucial role in expanding upon and adding to the policies 
and proposals of this Local Plan to address detailed local circumstances. In this respec t, any infrastructure 
requirements identified in ‘made’ Neighbourhood Plans will be considered against the policies in this Local 
Plan along with the Neigh bourhood Plan.  
The Infrastructure Delivery Framework sets out in detail all of the infrastructure req uired to support the 
growth outlined in the Local Plan, the timescale for delivery, likely cost and funding options (where 
known). The table categorises in frastructure in accordance with its contribution to supporting 
development in the Local Plan. Please note, this categorisation does not necessarily reflect the importance 
the Council attaches to a particular project corporately. For the purposes of the Loc al Plan, infrastructure is 
categorised according to the following three categories; critical, essenti al and desirable.  
 Critical infrastructure is infrastructure that is needed to unlock development sites allocated in 
the Local Plan (i.e. without the infras tructure the development cannot physically take place).  
 Essential infrastructure is the infrastructure that is necessary to support and mitigate 
development and ensures policy objectives of the Local Plan are met. Development could take 
place without this infrastructure but its sustainability would be undermine d. 
 Desirable infrastructure is infrastructure that could support development in the Local Plan and 
make it more sustainable and help deliver other place -making objectives. However, 
development planned  in the Local Plan could take place sustainably without it. 
Infrastructure identified in the Brightwell Lakes development will be considered separate to this 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework  as part of a wider masterplan for that site.  
Transport Modelling  has been conducted to inform the Local Plan. The modell ing is based upon growth 
planned for in the Local Plan and neighbouring authorities and identifies the projected transport impacts 
of that growth. In consultation with Suffolk County Council and Highw ays England, this transport modelling 
has informed trans port infrastructure requirements for the Infrastructure Delivery Framework. These 
figures are indicative, and specific transport measures will need to be informed through detailed designs 
and Transpor t Assessments.  
Costs in this document are indicative an d are subject to change. For example, specific school expansion 
costs will be estimated as projects progress, based on the particular requirements of the site and the 
project. At present, most costs i n this document are based on estimates of generic per pe rson prices, 
responding only to the proportionate impacts of local plan allocations. In reality, development – via 
obligations or the Community Infrastructure Levy – may be required to fund total proj ect costs, such as Appendix B  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
459  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  where development necessitates the co mpletion of new facilities (where the capacity of existing facilities 
has been reached) like classrooms or junctions where the threshold for such new facilities has been 
reached. This will be governed  by (and subject to) the Community Infrastructure Levy R egulations and the 
Council’s own policies for prioritising CIL spending. Throughout the lifetime of the plan, additional costs or 
projects may also arise which are not detailed within this Infrastruct ure Delivery Framework, based on 
changing circumstances.  Project timescales detailed in this Infrastructure Delivery Framework should be 
considered as indicative based on the information available at the time of writing.  
Provision for Post -16 education is complex, increasingly so as the ways in which Further Ed ucation and 
Sixth Form provision are delivered are changing. Students have a range of institutional options and are 
more likely to travel longer distances than for secondary education.   
In respect of the Local Plan  covering the former Suffolk Coastal area , a new Sixth Form could be delivered 
at Brightwell Lakes all -through school, and additional Sixth Form places can potentially be provided at 
Thomas Mills High School and Felixstowe Academy. New Furthe r Education provision at Alde Valley 
Academy – known as Suffolk New College on the Coast – offers another opportunity for expansion of 
Further Education provision in the District. There would also be an opportunity to discuss the potential for 
offering A L evels at Leiston as part of that model – although it wou ld be subject to demand and the 
agreement of both Alde Valley Academy and Suffolk New College.  
The 2017 Norfolk and Suffolk Further Education Area Review suggests that, based on 2014 ONS Sub 
national population projections, the 16 -18 cohort is expected to fall by 9.3% between 2015 and 2019, and 
then increase by 18.4% between 2019 and 2030. Population growth in the 16 -18 cohort is also expected to 
be slower in the former Suffolk Coastal area than the re st of Norfolk and Suffolk.  
As such, whilst options exist  for providing additional post -16 capacity for students from the former Suffolk 
Coastal  area , further consideration will be given to long term needs for post -16 provision across the 
Ipswich Housing Ma rket Area. This will need to include an assessment of de mand arising from the 
emerging Ipswich, Babergh and Mid Suffolk Local Plans.  
The Habitats Regulations Assessment has identified potential impacts in relation to  both phosphate and 
ammonia related dete rioration in water quality, and potential issues around nitrogen deposition is also 
flagged within the study as a potential concern for European sites.  Timely delivery of required 
infrastructure and treatment capabilities for phosphate, ammonia and nitroge n will be required, and 
specific needs for upgrades are contained in this Infrastructure Delivery Framework.

Monitoring is an important and necessary step in the planning syst em in order to check that strategies and 
policies are having the intended effect.  Monitoring relates both to contextual indicators and also to 
specific planning outcomes.  
Sustainability App raisal, incorporating Strategic Environmental Assessment, has been  carried out as part of 
the production of the Local Plan.  A requirement of Sustainability Appraisal is to monitor the likely 
significant effects of the plan. A monitoring framework and indic ators has been  developed as work on the 
Sustainability Appraisal has progresse d throughout the production of the Local Plan.  Further details around 
monitoring related to Sustainability Appraisal objectives are contained in the Sustainability Appraisal 
Repo rt.  
The Habitats Regulations Assessment has identified a specific  requirement in relation to monitoring 
related to water supply and quality at European sites linked to water treatment. The Council will therefore 
liaise with the water companies, Natural En gland and the Environment Agency, to ensure that water 
related mat ters (both supply and treatment) and required infrastructure needs are continually reviewed 
and resolved to meet the needs arising from growth. The Habitats Regulations Assessment also ident ifies a 
potential risk from  traffic emissions to designated sites with features sensitive to air pollution, and it is 
identified that further data gathering on this would i nform future local plan reviews.   
The Council reports on monitoring and delivery ann ually in its Authority Monitoring Report. In some 
instances it may  be appropriate to alter the indicators being reported, either due to a change in 
information available or to reflect specific issues that emerge.  Appendix C  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020

Best Practice docum ent 
A number of policies in the Local Plan require evidence of marketing prior to allowing the redevelopment 
or change of use of a building of land.  In August 2016, the Council published the “Commercial Property 
Marketing Best Prac tice Guide”.  The best pra ctice guide focuses on what the Council will expect in support 
of planning applications for the change of use of commercial premises and sites.  The details of this guide 
are translated into the Local Plan.  
 
Length of Marketing  
Prior to applying to change t he use of a building protected under relevant policies in the Local Plan the 
property should be marketed for a period of at least 12 months.  Given the importance of tourism to the 
local economy and the importance of community facil ities a 12 month period i s also considered 
appropriate for these uses as well.  
 
Marketing Strategy  
Before marketing begins a strategy should be prepared which sets out how the property will be marketed.  
This should be agreed with the Council prior to the s tart of marketing.  This a greement will ensure the 
strategy is clear, meets expectations and will avoid the need to repeat the marketing exercise should the 
Council deem the marketing not to be appropriate.  
The marketing strategy should contain the followin g detail:  
 Background: why  the property is being marketed.  
 Location: include information on the location of the property, proximity to settlements, links to 
transport networks and site characteristics.  
 Description: should include details on floorspace, prop erty layout, car parking facilities and access 
arrangements.  
 Planning: a summary of the existing planning use, history and restrictions.  
 Marketing recommendations and approach to advertisement to cover:  
o Basis of instruction to agent(s).  
o Method of disposal such as private treaty or  informal/formal bids.  
o Advertisements through sale boards, internet, industry publications, mailing lists etc. 
 
Expenditure on marketing should be proportionate to the anticipated return from the property.  As a guide 
the b udget should be 3% of the anticipa ted return from the property.  The guide price for the property 
should be commensurate with the current market price for similar premises, derived from an expert RICS Appendix E  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
517  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  registered valuer of accredited member of RICS.  The terms of rent should be flexible and t ake into account 
prevailing market conditions.  Length of leases should not be unduly restrictive.  
 
The marketing strategy will need to include a marketing matrix which is similar to the template below:  
 
Marketing I nitiative  Budget  Jan Feb Mar Apr May  Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 
Marketing Board  £xxx              
Marketing 
Particulars  £xxx              
Local Newspaper  £xxx              
 
The extent of marketing initiatives will vary based on the type and premises being advertised.  However, as 
a minimum the fo llowing should be employed for all premises:  
 
 Marketing Board – simple board advertising the property for its current use.  For larger 
commercial units and tourist accommodation, larger boards giving details of properties including 
the guide price should be  considered.  All boards should be placed so they can be seen from the 
main road and access points.  
 Marketing particulars should include the following:  
o Internal and external photographs,  
o Locati on, 
o Description of property,  
o Terms of lease,  
o Guide Price/Rent,  
o Current Planning status,  
o Services and utilities,  
o Energy Performance Certificate,  
o Rateable value and business rates,  
o VAT status,  
o Legal and professional costs,  
o Viewing arrangements,  
o Contact infor mation for the agent.  
 
For larger properties which are more like ly to have a regional or national audience, the particulars should 
be set out in a bespoke brochure including layouts of the building together with professional photos.  The 
advertising materia l should be supported by:  
 Advertisement in the press – advert sh ould be placed and maintained in a local newspaper.  For 
larger properties, specialist publications should be used.  
 Press release to be given to local and regional press.  
 Online advertisements to include publication on agent’s website as well as national co mmercial 
property websites.   Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Appendix E

contacts.  
Marketing Report  
If following the 12 months of marketing there has been no success in selling or letting the unit a repor t on 
the marketing should be prepared and submitted with a planning application for redevelopment or change 
of use.  
The Marketing Report should contain the following:  
 The original marketing strategy and evidence that it was delivered.  
 The duration and date s of the marketing campaign.  
 A full record of enquiries received throughout the course of the marketing campaign.  The report  
should record the date of e nquiry, details of the enquiry, if the property was inspected and details 
why the enquiry was unsuccessf ul. If any offers were rejected, the grounds on which the offers 
were rejected must be provided.  
 If the record of enquiries indicates a lack of interest  during the marketing campaign, the report 
should detail the measures undertaken to alter the strategy a nd to increase interest.  
 
The Marketing Report should set out a clear and recommended marketing strategy to assist with the 
promotion and ultimate dispo sal of a commercial property.  It is considered reasonable that a copy of the 
Marketing Report along with  supporting evidence is submitted to ensure that an appropriate strategy has 
been recommended when considering the type of property in question and that  the guide rent / price is in 
line with comparable market evidence.  Having this information to hand shou ld help in determining 
whether there is genuinely no extant demand to continue in its current planning use.  
 Appendix F  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
519  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  Appendix F – Criteria for I dentification of Non 
Designated Heritage Assets  
A non -designated heritage asset can be a building, monument, site, plac e, area or landscape identified as 
having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions.  
Significance is the val ue of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest 
that can be archaeological, arch itectural, artistic or historic.  
The following criteria are for the use of the Council as local planning authority to establish if any p otential 
non-designated heritage asset that is a building or structure meets the definition in the National Planning 
Policy Framework at an early stage in the process, as advised by the national Planning Practice Guidance. A 
building or structure must meet  two or more of these significance -measuring criteria to be identified by 
the Council as a non -designated heritage asse t.  
Development proposals affecting an identified non -designated heritage asset will be subject to the 
requirements of the National Plann ing Policy Framework at Section 16: Conserving and enhancing the 
historic environment and including paragraphs 197.  
These criteria have been prepared with specific reference to Historic England’s ‘Conservation Principles – 
Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment’; and ‘Good Practice 
Guide for Local Heritage Listing’.

 Social and communal value  
What we mean by these criteria:  
 Recorded in the Suffolk County Historic Environment Record : an above -ground archaeological site 
or historic building recorded in the Suffolk County Council Historic Environm ent Record. 
Identification of archaeological interest will always have to be made in conjunction with the 
Suffolk County Council Archaeologic al Service. Sub -surface archaeological interest is considered 
and advised on separately by the Suffolk County Counc il Archaeological Service.  
 Aesthetic value : the building or structure, through its intrinsic design value derived from local 
styles, materia ls, workmanship or any other distinctive local characteristic, will exhibit a positive 
external appearance in the s treetscene, village or townscape or landscape.  
 Known architect/designer : the building or structure will be the work of an architect or desig ner of 
local, regional or national noteworthiness.  
 Integrity : the building or structure will retain a degree of in tactness and lack of harmful external 
alteration and, if part of a group, will make a contribution to the surviving completeness of that 
grou p.  
 Landmark status : the building or structure by virtue of its design, age, innovation, construction, 
position, us e or communal associations contributes as a landmark within the local scene.  
 Group value : the buildings or structures will have a coherent d esign or historic functional 
relationship as a group.  
 Association : the building or structure will enjoy a signific ant historical association of local or 
national noteworthiness including links to important local figures or events.  
 Rarity : the building or  structure must represent a design, use or other quality that was always 
uncommon or has now become uncommon or exc eptional to the locality, district or wider region.  
 Representativeness : the building or structure will survive as a good quality representat ive of a 
particular historical or architectural trend or settlement pattern; or be part of the legacy of a 
particul ar individual, architect or designer, architectural or artistic movement, company or group 
in the past.  
 Social and communal value : the build ing or structure will be perceived locally as a source of local 
identity (for example, commemorative or symbolic), distinctiveness, social interaction or 
contributing to the collective memory of a place.  
In the former Suffolk Coastal area  the following locally significant uses may provide typologies of buildings 
and structures that can be identified as non -designated heritage assets:  
Agricultural; commemorative; commercial; culture, entertainment and leisure; resort tourism; domestic; 
educational; healt h and welfare; industrial; military; aviation; forestry; water management; landed Estates; 
fishing; brewing; law and local government; park and garden structures; ecclesiastical; transport; maritime 
and coastal defence; utilities, energy and communications ; civil defences; street furniture and historic 
surfaces.  Appendix F  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
521  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  Supporting Statement  
It is the aim of East Suffolk  Council  to protect and enhance the Plan area ’s heritage assets through the 
identification of those of local significance; and through ensuring tha t development is managed in a way 
that sustains or enhances their significance and setting. The effect of a planning application on the 
significance of a non -designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any 
application. In weighing  applications that affect directly or indirectly non -designated heritage assets, a 
balanced judgement will be require d having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of 
the heritage asset.

                                                                                                                 www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  522 Appendix G  – Viability Requirements  
A number of policies in the Local Plan have a test of financial viability requirement. Where an assessment 
of viabi lity is p rovided with an application it should be completed in accordance with the guidance in this 
appendix and guidance included in the National Planning Practice Guidance.  
Confidentiality  
Historically viability assessments submitted with planning applications h ave been treated as confidential as 
they were considered commercially sensitive. However, given that these assessments are used often to 
demonstrate that something, such as affordable housing provision, which is in the public interes t, should 
be reduced it  is important that these assessments are open and transparent. It is important that the public 
and other stakeholders have an opportunity to comment and challenge the findings in the same way they 
may wish to challenge the findings o f other technical studi es which support a planning application.  
In most cases viability assessments should be based on publicly available information which is reflective of 
industry norms rather than the unique circumstances of developers (as planning perm ission runs with the 
land not the developer).  
Given the above, viability assessments submitted with planning applications will not be kept confidential 
and will be published on the planning application file with the other studies, plans and information 
contained within the plan ning application. In exceptional circumstances where the publication of 
information would harm the competitiveness of a business due to the necessity to include commercial 
information unique to that business, the Council will conside r keeping some or all o f the viability 
assessment confidential. The applicant in these scenarios should provide full justification as to why the 
harm caused by publishing the information outweighs the public interest in publishing the information.  
Indepen dent Review  
If there ar e disagreements between the Council and the applicant on the findings of the viability 
assessment, or criticisms of the assessment have been raised by stakeholders or the public, the Council will 
invite the developer to pay a fee to have the assessment ind ependently reviewed. The independent review 
will assess and scrutinise the assumptions and assessment and give a view on whether the assessment is 
robust. If the assessment is not considered robust, the independent review will includ e a revised viability 
assessment in accordance with this guidance.  
Overall Approach  
Viability assessments should be in the form of residual land value appraisals. Where the residual land 
value, obtained from discounting costs and developer profit from the  development value is c ompared to a 
threshold land value to determine whether a scheme is viable.

Value  
 
Residual Land Value  > Threshold Land Value  = Viable  
 
Viability assessments should clearly set out all of  the assumptions and the evidence behind the 
assumptions that go into the appraisal. The assessments should be clearly and transparent ly presented 
including the calculation of residual land value and any cash -flow analysis. There must be no hidden 
calculat ions or assumptions in any model or appraisal.  
Development appraisals should include details of the proposed scheme including site ar ea, residential unit 
numbers, number of habitable rooms, unit size, density and the split between the proposed tenures. 
Floorspace figures should also be provided for residential uses (gross internal area) by tenure, and non -
residential uses in gross inter nal area (GIA) and net internal area (NIA). Information should be provided 
relating to the target market of the developmen t and proposed specification, which should be consistent 
with assumed costs and values.  
Details of the assumed development programme a nd the timing of cost and income inputs should be 
provided.  
Ideally the appraisal will include a spreadsheet version of t he model which can be opened and 
interrogated in Microsoft Excel and similar spreadsheet software applications. Homes England publishe s 
the Development Appraisal Tool81 which is an open sourced spreadsheet which anyone can use. The use of 
this tool is ther efore strongly recommended.

Threshold Land Value  
This assumption is a critical assumption as it set s the benchmark for what the residual land value is tested 
against to determine whether a development is viable. The Nati onal Planning Policy Framework states that 
viability should consider “competitive returns to a willing landowner”. The threshold land v alue therefore 
needs to meet this test. The National Planning Practice Guidance states that a competitive return for the 
landowner is the price at which a reasonable land owner would be willing to sell their land for the 
development. The price will need to  provide an incentive for the land owner to sell in comparison with the 
other options available. Those options may includ e the current use value of the land or its value for a 
realistic alternative use that complies with planning policy. The guidance also states the land value should 
reflect policy requirements and the community infrastructure levy and be based on comparable , market -
based evidence wherever possible. It also states that where transacted bids are significantly above the 
market norm, they shou ld not be used as part of this exercise.  
Given the above the price paid for the land will not be a relevant consideration  in terms of assessing what 
the threshold land value should be.  
Market comparables for land transactions for similar developments can be used to help determine 
threshold land value. However, these can only be considered comparable if the final development  
achieved was policy compliant and was subject to the same level of community infrastructure levy or 
section 106 contributions. Compara bles should also be of similar densities and land types. Therefore, 
where viability assessments rely on market comparable s to establish land value they must include 
information on the final planning permission and development.  
The main approach of assessin g what the threshold land value is to consider what the existing use value of 
the land is. The principle of this approach  is that a landowner should receive at least the value of the land 
in its ‘pre -permission’ use, which would normally be lost when bring ing forward land for development. A 
premium is usually added to provide the landowner with an additional incentive to rel ease the site, having 
regard to site circumstances. Planning appeals across the country have determined that this is an 
acceptable appr oach. Premiums above existing use value are usually 10 -20% for brownfield land and 10 to 
20 times value for agricultural land. For some sites where a number of uses may be permissible by 
planning, the alternative use value of the site may also be a conside ration. In all cases, the threshold land 
value should be no higher than that modelled in the Whole Plan Viability Assessm ent, however, it could be 
lower.  
For schemes which involve enabling development the threshold land value may be the value at which the  
planning gain can be achieved. For example, if a sports field is to be developed to provide a new sports 
field elsewhere , the threshold land value will need to cover the cost of providing the new sports field.  
For affordable housing in the countryside, p ermitted under Policy SCLP5.11, the threshold land value 
should be respective of typical plot values for affordable housing and should be significantly less than Appendix G  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
525  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  threshold land values for normal mixed tenure sche mes on allocated sites and within Settlement  
Boundaries. The threshold land value will still have to be excess of agricultural value.  
Development Value  
This should be based on comparable evidence of transactions of new build properties. Values should 
alwa ys be calculated on a per sqm basis. For res idential, the Land Registry publishes data on the price paid 
for new homes and this should be the starting point. If sufficient transactional data is not available, asking 
prices for new build could be considered  and values for second -hand homes, provided they are adjusted to 
take into account that asking prices may not be achieved and that second -hand homes may not command 
the value premium which new -builds have.  
Affordable housing values should be based on disc ussions with registered providers or average  agreed 
offer prices.  
For commercial developments, consideration should be given to rents and yields being achieved in the 
local markets.  
Build Costs  
Build costs should be based on publically available informat ion such as the RICS Build Cost Information 
Service (BCIS) to ensure transparency and benchmarking. Costs used should normally be median averages 
for the type of development being proposed. Divergence from the median value should always be justified.  
BCIS  costs do not include external structural an d local site works and are based on Gross Internal Area 
(GIA). Preliminary costs are included in the BCIS build costs figures so should not be included as a separate 
cost. External works costs which includes, lan dscaping, garages, roads, sewers and drainag e should be 
identified separately in the appraisal. Sometimes this is expressed as a percentage of build costs, normally 
in the range of 10 -20%. Alternatively, the works can be itemised, but should be based on av erage costs. 
Sources of information could in clude quantity surveyors reports or other published material such as Price 
Books.  
Abnormal Costs  
Abnormal costs are those which are unique to the site in question. This could include contamination, 
archaeology, flood risk and ecological considerations. Th ese should be itemised, be based on industry 
averages and evidenced in the report. They do not need to be based on tender prices which can be 
commercially sensitive. A quantity surveyor report may be helpful in j ustifying these costs or published 
material such as Price Books. The presence of abnormal costs would normally be expected to influence 
land value. The applicant should have had some awareness of abnormal costs prior to purchasing the site, 
therefore the p resence of abnormal costs are assumed to hav e influenced the  level of premium above the 
existing use value a land owner would expect. Thus, it should not be assumed that abnormal costs will be 
offset at the expense of compliance with the Local Plan.  Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Appendix G

Planning, Professional and marketing fees sh ould be justified taking account of the complexity of the 
development and development values. Costs applied on a percentage basis should be realistic when 
considering the monetary value of the assumed cost.  
Fina nce Costs  
Viability assessment should normal ly include a cash flow analysis to calculate the level of finance costs to 
the development. The interest payments should be justified with respect to the latest rates being offered 
by banks. Where the scheme is i n surplus, interest gained from capital in t he bank should be credited 
against the scheme unless otherwise justified.  
Planning Obligations and Community Infrastructure Levy  
These should also be itemised in the assessment and be in accordance with the Loca l Plan and Community 
Infrastructure Levy Cha rging Schedule.  
Contingency  
It is normal to have a level of contingency on build costs. The level of contingency should reflect the risk 
and complexity of the scheme. A starting point is normally 5%, but non -com plex greenfield developments 
could have a sm aller contingency and higher complex brownfield developments might justify a higher 
contingency. In all cases the level of contingency should be justified.  
Developer Profit  
This should be a fixed input figure in a residual appraisal. It could be based as a  proportion of either 
development costs or development value and in line with the National Planning Policy Framework 
represent a competitive return.  
For residential develop ment the starting point should be no higher than 20% on market dwellings and 6% 
on affordable dwellings. However, the appropriate level of profit should be scheme specific. Evidence 
should be provided by applicants to justify proposed rates of profit takin g account of the individual 
characteristics of the scheme, the risks related to the  scheme, and comparable schemes.  
It should be made clear how the profit level has been adjusted taking into account other assumed inputs 
within an appraisal. For example, t he adoption of cautious assumptions such as the inclusion of higher 
contingencies a  may warrant a lower target profit.  
Overage  
If planning policy requirements are reduced in order to ensure a viable scheme, the applicant will be 
required to enter into a s ection 106 planning obligation that includes an overage clause. The clause will 
require a further viability assessment to be undertaken at an agreed point during the development, if sales Appendix G  | Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020  
527  www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ localplan  values or profit levels have increased, improving the viability of t he development the surplus will be 
recouped by the Council up to the amount of cont ribution that was applicable at the time of the 
submission of the latest relevant application.

Nationally Significant Infras tructure Project  
Major infrastructure developments that bypass normal local planning requirements due to their strategi c 
importance and are dealt with at Government level.  They are major infrastructure projects such as new 
harbours, roads, power generating  stations (including offshore wind farms) and electricity transmission 
lines, which require a type of consent known as ‘development consent’. Development consent, where  
granted, is made in the form of a Development Consent Order (DCO). For such a project, the Planning 
Inspectorate examines the application and will make a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State, 
who will make the decision on whether to grant or to refuse development consent.  
Natural Capital  
This is considered as the sum of our ecos ystems, species, freshwater, land, soils, minerals, our air and our 
seas. These are all elements of nature that either directly or indirectly bring value to people and the

wildlife, energy, wood, recreation and protection from hazards.  
Neighbourhood Plans  
Neighbourhood p lanning is a right for communities introduced through the Localism Act 2011 . 
Communities can shape development in their areas through the production of Neighbourhood P lans. The 
local parish or town council lead on neighbourhood  planning in their areas. Where one does not exist then 
a community group known as a neighbourhood forum needs to be established to lead. Neighbourhood Suffolk Coastal Local Plan | Adopted September 2020 | Appendix I
