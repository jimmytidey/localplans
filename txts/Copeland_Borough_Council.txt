 Foreword  
1.1 Context  
1.1.1 Copeland is Open for Business. With our beautiful b eaches, stunning natural 
landscapes, clean air and vibrant communities, Copeland has a lot to offer.  Our 
borough is one of the most affordable and attractive places to live and work in 
the UK, with one of the highest average salaries in Cumbria, supported by a 
thriving nuclear sector, and low average house prices1. 
1.1.2 The Local Plan will help us share this message and will sit alongside and support 
the Copeland Vision 2040, Copeland Corporate Strategy 2020 -2024, Copeland 
Vision and Prospectus 20202 and Copeland Housing Strategy 2018 -2023. It will be 
a key driver for change over the period 2021 -20383 identifying opportunities to 
enhance the borough’s strengths, address the borough’s weaknesses and ensure 
that Copeland is a place where people and bus iness can thrive.

3 The Plan period referred to in the Preferred Options Draft, covered a different period 2017 -2035. This has been amended 
as recommended by the Strategic Housing Market Assessment as the latest housing requirement is based upon more 
recent data and has been extended to ensure it covers a 15 year period post adoption.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

 Introduction  
2.1 Scope  
2.1.1 This is the Publication  Draft of the Local Plan which sets out the Council’s 
preferred policies and sites for allocation for the areas of Copeland that lie 
outside the Lake District National Park. The LDNP area is shown in green in Figure 
2, page 20 . 
2.1.2 Development within the Nation al Park boundary is addressed in the Lake District 
National Park Local Plan. 
2.1.3 The following diagram contains extracts from the Council’s key strategic 
documents which the Local Plan will help deliver.   
Copeland Vision and Prospectus for Growth 2020  
Clean Growth : We will become an exemplar for clean growth by leading the first wave of investmen t and 
innovation in new zero -carbon energy technologies, through a coherent approach to renewables and achieving the 
full energy potential of our natural resources.  
Innovation : We will create jobs and growth by building upon our assets and strengthening ne tworks between our 
major organisations, our supply chains and our universities, commercialising innovation and extending our reach 
across sectors on a global scale.  
Experience Economy : Whitehaven and the Lake District Coast will be at the heart of a higher  value experience 
economy, attracting more visitor spending, making the most of our stunning landscapes and heritage, the Cumbria 
Coast Line, and the C2C cycle route.  
Connecting People : We will connect our residents, innovators and visitors to each other a nd the rest of the world 
through investment in sustainable, high quality transport and state -of-the-art digital infrastructure.  
Great Places : We will grow and diversify the skills in our workforce, promote the health and wellbeing of our 
residents and maxi mise value from our local assets by ensuring our towns are great places to live.

 2.1.4 There are a number of challenges facing our communities, many of which have 
been magnified by Covid -19. We have risen to the challenge by producing a Local 
Plan which is flexible, aspirational and visionary but which is also based upon up -
to-date evidence to ensure it remains sound.  
2.1.5 Covid -19 has reminded us of the importance of our public open spaces4 to health 
and well -being and the importance of digital connectivity to allow flexible 
working and connections with family and friends. It has also highlight ed the fact 
that our retail, leisure and tourism offer will play a key part in our economic 
recovery and we will do all we can to support those sectors and help them 
respond to changing needs and keep our communities vibrant.  
Elements of planning outside of the Copeland Local Plan’s remit  
2.1.6 It needs to be noted that there are some elements of the planning system that 
are outside of Copeland Borough Council’s jurisdiction as the Local Planning 
Authority.  
2.1.7 As approximately two thirds of the borough lies withi n the Lake District National 
Park it is important that our Local Plan supports the Lake District National Park 
Local Plan, particularly as the boundary between the two planning authority areas 
crosses, or comes close to, a number of our settlements. Whilst  we may be 
consulted on particular applications within the National Park (generally those 
close to our boundary), we have no jurisdiction over planning decisions made 
within that area.  
2.1.8 Several other elements of the planning system are outside of Copeland’ s planning 
remit and are dealt with at either a county or national level. These are shown in 
the table below.

Sellafield)  Local Plan 2015 -20306. The Council has considered 
whether any of its allocations will affect any 
mineral safeguarding areas.  
Education  Cumbria County 
Council  Decisions relating to Schools and other 
educational facilities come under the remit of 
Cumbria County Council  
Nationally 
significant 
infrastruct ure 
projects (NSIP)  Planning 
Inspectorate  Applications for NSIPs are submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate’s National Infrastructure 
Directorate and are determined by the Secretary 
of State. More information can be found in below.  
 
2.1.9 It should also be noted that several of our communities have pr oduced Town, 
Parish or Community Plans that identify the aspirations of local residents. Whilst 
such plans are not material planning considerations developers are advised to 
find out whether there is such a plan covering their area of interest and consider  
the kinds of development the communities would like to see.  
The Approach to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects  
2.1.10  Applications for planning consent, known as Development Consent Orders (DCOs) 
for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NS IPs) are submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate’s National Infrastructure Directorate and are determined 
by the Secretary of State who makes the final decision.  
2.1.11  The Government’s National Policy Statement currently identifies two NSIP 
developments within o r affecting the borough, however both are on hold at 
present7. These are:  
• A new nuclear power station at Moorside, close to the Sellafield site ; 
• Electricity connection of  large -scale energy generation at Moorside with the 
wider National Grid network  
2.1.12  Planning policies for NSIPs are set out in National Policy Statements and do not 
form part of the Development Plan. The Council does however have to give them 
consideration when developing the Local Plan.  
2.1.13  When determining Development Consent Order  applications for NSIPs the 
Government will consult the Council. The Council will then prepare a Local Impact 
Report, to which the Planning Act 2008 (Section 104(2)(b) and (d)) states that the 
Secretary of State must have regard to. The Local Plan will inf orm the Local 
Impact Report along with any other evidence and considerations.  The Council will 
also seek a Statement of Common Ground with the developer before an 
application is submitted to the National Infrastructure Directorate.

7 This provides opportunities to consider alternative and/or additional uses at the site, including the creation of a Clean 
Energy Park  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
5 
 2.1.14  The Council will be the  decision maker for any ancillary development linked to the 
NSIP (but not included in the DCO) under its powers as a Local Planning Authority  
to help the effective delivery of the NSIP . Any such development will be 
considered against the Development Plan a nd the National Policy Statement.  
2.1.15  There may also be occasions where supporting or preliminary work for NSIPs is 
required before the DCO work. If this happens any proposals will be considered in 
line with the policies in this Local Plan.  
2.2 Producing the Plan  
2.2.1 Following its adoption, anticipated in early 2023 , the Local Plan will become  a key  
part of the borough’s Development Plan, replacing , and superseding , the current 
Copeland Local Plan 2013 - 2028 Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies , (the Core Strategy), which was adopted in December 2013, and Saved 
Policies.  
2.2.2 Planning decisions must be made in accordance with the Development Plan 
unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Policies within this new Local 
Plan will gain weight in decision making as it progresses through the various draft 
stages, depending on the level of objection the policy receives.  
2.2.3 A number of circumstances have changed since the adoption of the Core Strategy 
in 2013 and producing a new Local Plan allows us to reflect up on the changes and 
plan for development accordingly. Significant changes include the production of:  
• Updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2019 and 2021  
and Planning Practice Guidance (PPG)  
• New Use Class Order 202 0 
• Copeland Vision 2040  
• Copeland  Housing Strategy 2018 -2023  
• Copeland Vision and Prospectus for Growth 2020   
• Copeland  Corporate Plan 2016 -2020  
• Cumbria Local Industrial Strategy 20198  
• Town Improvement Plans for Millom and Cleator Moor  
• Cumbria Strategic Economic Plan (The Four Pronged Attack) 2014 -2024  
• Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus: Five Proposals for Our Nuclear Future 2020  
2.2.4 And other significant changes including:  
• The commitment made by Cumbrian Authorities to have a net zero county by 
2037  
• The pausing of t he new nuclear facility project at Moorside  
• The change in Sellafield’s ‘missions’ and the opportunities this provides, and 
the potential for other nuclear new build   
• The development of proposals for a new Industrial Solutions Hub and Clean 
Energy Park in Copeland

 • The development of proposals for a new Metallurgical Coal Mine in 
Whitehaven  
• Successful bids for Town Deal Funding (Cleator Moor and Millom) and 
Borderlands Community funding (Egremont) by the Council  
• Changes to shopping patterns post Covid -19 and  the need for us to reflect on 
the role and function of our town centres  
• Changes to the way our residents work and access goods and services (flexible

• The development of a new Lake District Coast brand for the borough  
• The inscription of the Lake District as a World Heritage Site in 2017  
• The commitment made by Copeland Borough Council to work with relevant 
bodies to extend the St Bees Heritage Coast towards Whitehaven9 
• The uncer tainty surrounding Brexit  
 
2.3 Timetable for Local Plan Production  
2.3.1 The timetable for taking the Local Plan forward towards adoption can be viewed 
below.  
2.3.2 At the time of writing , the Council is still awaiting confirmation of the need for 
Gypsy and Traveller pitches in the borough  as the Cumbria Gypsy and Traveller 
Study has stalled. Initial indications are that the need is for between 1 and 12 
pitches. Should the higher figure be confirmed the Council would need to identify 
a site of at least 0.5 he ctares in size.  
2.3.3 Once the need is confirmed, the Council will carry out a separate consultation to 
seek comments on the proposed site  (if a site is required)  prior to the submission 
of the Local Plan to the Planning Inspectorate.  
2.3.4 As the dates for the consu ltation have yet to be confirmed this additional stage is 
not shown in Figure  1 below , but it is anticipated to  take place in February/March 
2022 .

2.4 Previou s Drafts  and Consultation  
The Issues and Options Draft  
2.4.1 The Council produced the first draft of the new Local Plan, the Issues and Options 
Draft, in November 2019. The Draft identified key issues facing the borough, 
informed by evidence base documents and a n Integrated Assessment Scoping 
Report, and set out a number of alternative options for addressing them based 
around the following themes.

2.4.2 The Council carried out an 8 -week public consultation on the Local Plan Issues 
and Options Draft between November 2019 and January 2020.  
2.4.3 The purpose of the Issues and Options consultation was to seek views on the 
different options and approaches identified and invite alternative proposals to 
ensu re that all reasonable a lternatives  had been considered and evaluated . This 
process helped  to determine the best way forward for the development and 
prosperity of the borough .  
2.4.4 The Issues and Options Draft was made available on the Council’s website and 
within Council Offices and local libraries. The consultation was advertised in the 
local press and on social media and the Council contacted everyone whose details 
are currently h eld on the Strategic Planning consultation database directly by 
email or letter.  
2.4.5 Respondents were asked to complete a Response Form to enable easier collation 
and consideration of comments submitted. During the 8 -week period , 43 
responses were received. T hese have been compiled into an Issues and Options 
Consultation Response Document which is available on the Council’s website and 
have informed the current draft of the Local Plan which sets out the Council’s 
preferred options for development.  
Preferred O ptions Draft  
2.4.6 The Local Plan  Preferred Options draft was produced in September 2020. This 
built upon the responses to the Issues and Options Draft consultation, alongside 
additional evidence base documents, to develop policies that we considered to be 
robus t, effective and deliverable.  
2.4.7 The Preferred Options  draft contained the initial policies that we re consider ed to 
be important, split into the four themes: economy, communities, places and 
connectivity. The draft also contained a number of potential land a llocations for 
residential and employment use , as well as protected green spaces .  
2.4.8 The Council carried out a 10 -week consultation into the Local Plan Preferred 
Options Draft between September 2020 and November 2020, to seek views from 
key stakeholders and members of the public on the draft policies and allocations.  
2.4.9 Due to the Covid -19 pandemic, a number of traditional consultation methods 
were unsuitable during this time, resulting in the production of a revised 
Statement of Community Involvement. This out lines the methods used, including 
a number of virtual Parish Council and Stakeholder information sessions, and a 
video explaining the plan process and how to get involved. This can be seen on 
the Council’s website.  
2.4.10  During the 10 -week  public  consultation, 256 people and organisations got 
involved, amounting to approximately 1,300 individual comments. These were Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
9 
 received from a variety of stakeholders and members of the public, and were 
submitted via email and letter, as well as the preferred method of a res ponse 
form.  
2.4.11  This Publication Draft builds upon the structure of the Preferred Options, but a 
number of policies have been moved and/or renumbered. Appendix A contains a 
wayfinding document that shows the key differences between the Preferred 
Options Draft  and this version in terms of the format.  
Pre-Publication Consultation  
2.4.12  The Council carried out a focussed public consultation  in September/October 
2021  on a number of significant changes under consideration in light of responses 
made to the Preferred Optio ns Draft.  
2.4.13  The consultation focussed on the following:  
• Changes to the development strategy and settlement hierarchy  
• New policies  
• Deletion of policies  
• Significant changes to policies (e.g. those that created additional 
requirements for developers)  
• Revisions to site allocations (additions and deletions)  
• Revisions to settlement boundaries  
2.4.14  A total of 67 responses were received during the consultation which helped shape 
the Local Plan. A consultation response document has been produced that 
summarises the comments received and sets out how the Council has responded.  
2.5 Evidence Documents  
2.5.1 A number of evidence documents support the Local Plan . These cover a range of 
social, economic and environmental considerations. The following reports have 
been prepared,  or will be prepared,  to inform the emerging policies and 
allocations and ensure the Local Plan  is sound . Those documents that have yet to 
be completed are shown with an asterisk.

2.6 Sustainability Appraisal  
2.6.1 The Local Plan has been informed by a Sustainability Appraisal (SA) incorporating 
a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Health Impact Assessment (HIA).  
2.6.2 The SA and SEA process is required by European and National legislation, with the 
NPPF adding that planning policies should be based on up -to-date evidence about 
the natural environment and  other key characteristics of the area. It is an integral 
part of the plan preparation process that considers all the likely significant effects 
on social, environmental and economic factors and promotes sustainability.  
2.6.3 The purpose of a Health Impact Asse ssment is to ensure that the Local Plan 
minimises negative and maximises positive health impacts. Although a health 
impact assessment is not a requirement under the regulations, the SA process 
allows for consideration of health impacts therefore it is sens ible to combine the 
two.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

 Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report Update 2019  
2.6.4 An SA Scoping Report10 was produced in January 2018 and was updated in 
November 2019 to reflect the production of the Issues and Options Draft and take 
into account feedback from statutory consultees.  
2.6.5 The Scoping Report identified the key social, environmental and economic iss ues 
facing the borough through a review of the latest data and relevant documents 
from European legislation to local strategies.  
2.6.6 The Scoping Report introduced a number of locally specific Sustainability 
Objectives which emerging policies would be assessed against. These are  shown 
in table 4 below  
Table 4: Sustainability Objectives

Sustainability Appraisal Report s 
2.6.7 The SA process is an iterative one and an assessment has been carried out at each 
stage of Local Plan production . Each SA Report is included on the Council’s 
website and shows the changes to the Plan at each stage that the assessment has 
recommended and th e Council has subsequently made.    
2.7 Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA)  
2.7.1 The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
requires that a Habitats Regulations Assessment should be carried out where it is 
likely that the Plan will have significant effects on former Natura 2000 Sites11. 
Following Brexit, Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Areas 
(SPA) are now known as National Site Network Sites.  
2.7.2 A HRA of the policies and proposals in the Local Plan, and previo us versions, has 
been carried out. The first stage of the process, the Screening stage, has 
identified that significant effects are likely and therefore an Appropriate 
Assessment (AA) that considers the scale of the effects in more detail and 
proposes miti gation to overcome the effects has been produced.  
2.7.3 The results of the HRA have been taken into account when considering which 
sites to take forward as allocations, and those which are likely to have significant 
effects on the National Site Network and RAMSA R sites have been avoided where 
possible.  
2.7.4 It has been more difficult to avoid likely effects caused by policies as these are 
required to help achieve our objectives, it is therefore important that the 
mitigation measures identified in the HRA AA document are taken forward and a 
 
11 European habitats and species  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
13 
 further Appropriate Assessment is carried out at planning application stage where 
necessary.  
2.8 Equalities Impact Assessment  
2.8.1 The Council has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 and the Public Sector Equality 
Duty to ensure that the emer ging Local Plan does not lead to direct or indirect 
unlawful discrimination against groups with Protected Characteristics12. An 
Equalities Impact Assessment (EqIA) will be published alongside the Local Plan to 
identify and assess any harm that would be cau sed by the policies or proposals in 
the Local Plan, promote equal opportunities (e.g. by helping to address existing 
discrimination or disadvantage) and foster good relationships.  
2.9 Duty to Co -operate  
2.9.1 The Council has a duty to engage with neighbouring authorities and infrastructure 
providers on issues that cross administrative boundaries. We have continued to 
work with our colleagues in neighbouring districts throughout the Local Plan 
process to ensure that the proposals in our Local Plan avoid harm to, and where 
possible support, their objectives. The Local Plan is accompanied by Statements 
of Common ground which demonstrate s that there has been effective 
cooperation to suitably address cross boundary i ssues.  
2.10 Using the Plan  
2.10.1  The Copeland Local Plan  contains strategic policies ( outlined  in purple) to help 
diversify and strengthen our economy, unlock our town centres and improve 
housing quality and choice. It also contains policies that protect and enhance 
those aspects that make our borough special a nd unique, such as our natural 
spaces and heritage assets, recognising that they are important for the health and 
well-being of our residents as well as attracting visitors to our area.  
2.10.2  The Local Plan also contains a number of 
development management polici es 
(outlined  in green) that are positively 
worded and flexible to help to shape 
rather than stifle development. The 
policies set out clearly and up -front, what 
will be required of developers to help 
maximise the benefits of development to 
our communities.   
2.10.3  The Local Plan is divided into the following 
sections:  
• Vision and Objectives : This sets out what the Local Plan aims to achieve  
 
12 See Glossary for definition  
* R (on the application of  Corbett) v Cornwall Council  [2020] EWCA Civ 508   
The Local Plan must be read as a 
whole. Determining whether a 
proposal is in accordance with the 
Development Plan as a whole is “a 
matter of planning judgement for 
the Council as planning decision -
maker” *.

 Vision &  Objectives  
3.1 Developing the Vision and Objectives  
 
3.1.1 Preparing a new Local Plan has allowed us to redefine what sort of place we want 
Copeland to be in the future. We have developed an exciting and innovative 
vision for the development of Copeland to 2038 that clearly defines and reflects 
our pri orities and the key drivers which will allow us to unlock Copeland’s 
potential. A fundamental part of achieving the vision is to identify a set of 
overarching objectives that define what the Local Plan Policies will achieve and 
how we will address key issu es and challenges within the borough.  
3.1.2 The development of the Vision and Objectives has been informed through 
building upon and improving objectives from the existing Copeland Local Plan 
2013 -2028. These have been considered alongside key corporate documen ts in 
conjunction with the Sustainability Appraisal process to ensure a comprehensive 
and achievable set of ambitions for Copeland. These will be set out in the 
following sections.  
3.2 Vision for Copeland  
 
 
By 2038, Copeland will be a place with a prosperous,  diverse economy that capitalises on 
our strengths and facilitates growth, including the opportunities presented by the digital 
revolution, our thriving nuclear and clean energy sectors, and our target for net zero 
carbon by 2037. We will maximise our tour ism assets, support vibrant town centres with 
a strong retail offer and enhance community facilities, providing opportunities for leisure, 
culture and interaction. We will make the most of our natural and built environment, 
protecting, enhancing and promot ing our magnificent landscapes and coastlines, cultural 
heritage and biodiversity. We will create inclusive and resilient communities, where 
everyone has access to high quality housing, transport, education and employment 
opportunities, improving their qua lity of life, health and happiness.  
 
 
3.3 Strategic Objectives  
3.3.1 In order to achieve our Vision, the Local Plan must achieve the following 
objectives, these are grouped according to the chapters in the Plan.  
3.3.2 Policies that help the Council achieve the economic, community, places and 
connectivity objectives will be identified with the following icons respectively:

 Spatial Portrait  
4.1 Defining Copeland  
4.1.1 Copeland is located on the west coast of Cumbria and is primarily rural in nature. 
It has a population of 68,424 residents13, 25,116 of which live within our largest 
town Whitehaven.  
4.1.2 The borough also contains three market towns, Cleator Moor, Egremont and 
Millom, the  latter of which is located in the south of the borough.  Connectivity 
between the north and south of the borough is poor , with the A595  and the 
Cumbrian Coast Rail Line being the key routes.  
4.1.3 Copeland is renowned for its attractive and varied landscapes whi ch include parts 
of the  Lake District National Park , the only  area of  Heritage Coast  in the north -
west of England  and a number of  picturesque rural villages.  
4.1.4 Copeland has an aging and falling population. T he Local Plan has a key role to play 
in reversing this trend and attracting additional residents into the borough. This is 
important if the economic aspirations of the Council, which include maintaining 
its position at the forefront of the UK’s nuclear and  clean energy sectors,  are to 
be achieved.  
4.1.5 As well as supporting growth within the nuclear and clean energy sectors, the 
Local Plan also aims to support and enhance our tourism , retail  and leisure  
sectors. This will be important in order to diversify the e conomy  and provide 
additional job opportunities for our residents .  
4.1.6 The following Key Diagram provides a summary of the borough at a strategic 
level. Individual maps of each settlement identified within the Local Plan can be 
seen in Appendix B.

 4.2 Longer Term Growth Aspirations   
4.2.1 In the longer term, the Key Diagram  also identifies a number of potential Broad 
Locations where growth could be delivered if at the Local Plan Review stage14 it 
becomes apparent that there are insufficient specific, deliverable sites to deliver 
the Local Plan Strategy. It is highly unlikely that  all potential Broad Locations 
would be required to come forward at any one time and if required a decision will 
be made at that time to ascertain the most suitable area. This will depend on a 
number of factors such as land availability, statutory consulte e comment s and  
whether funding has been identified to bring forward the Whitehaven Relief Road 
etc. 
4.2.2 The Mirehouse South Broad Location , which  is a greenfield site situated in the 
Pow Beck Valley , differs to the others.  The site was identified as an Associa ted 
Development Site to support the construction of Moorside Power Station, 
providing worker accommodation while development was ongoing. The longer  -
term ambition for the site is the delivery of a high  -quality well -being village  given 
its location close to the A595, West Cumberland Hospital, Westlakes Science Park 
and coastal areas. The site  would contain a significant amount of landscaping and 
open space that can be used by residents of the neighbouring Mirehouse Estate. 
The site could also contain speci alist housing such as student accommodation, 
housing for health workers and/or extra care housing.   
4.2.3 The Council has begun producing development principles for the site and these 
will be used to inform discussions regarding any future deve lopment in the are a 
to help inform a masterplan .  
4.2.4 The Hensingham Common Broad Location could be considered as a future, long 
term area of search for employment uses, subject to land being available. It 
would be most suited to this use given its location close to the Whiteha ven Relief 
Road and other the strategic employment sites of Leconfield and Westlakes 
Science Park  
4.2.5 The Relief road remains a priority for the Council. It will reduce pressure on the 
town centre road network improving access for residents and shoppers, reduce 
commuting time, improve connectivity between the borough’s strategic 
employment sites and provide a new physical edge to the town  creating potential 
for new growth area within it .  This is shown in the diagram on the following 
page.

 5.2 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development  
5.2.1 At the core of the Local Plan is a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development. This means that planning applications will be approved where they 
accord with the Development Plan unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise15.  
5.2.2 Sustainable development has three dimensions, which are mutually dependent 
and of equal importance: economic, social and environmental. The Local Plan 
therefore aims to strike a balance between promoting development to meet the 
needs and aspirations of the  borough whilst minimising, and preventing where 
possible, negative impacts, such as waste, pollution and damage to the built and 
natural environment.  
5.2.3 Policy DS1PU demonstrates the Council’s commitment to supporting sustainable 
development and should be r ead alongside the NPPF, which is a material 
consideration when making planning decisions.  
5.2.4 Policy DS1PU also demonstrates the Council’s commitment to early, meaningful 
engagement with develope rs and relevant bodies to improve the quality of 
development. Th is supports paragraph 39  of the NPPF which states that early 
engagement “ has significant potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the planning application system for all parties. Good quality pre -application 
discussion enables better coordi nation between public and private resources and 
improved outcomes for the community ”  
 
Strategic Policy DS1P U: Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development  
 
 
 
The Council will take a positive approach to sustainable development by approving 
applications without delay where they accord with the Development Plan (and where 
relevant, any neighbourhood plan), unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
Wher e there are no Local Plan policies relevant to the application or relevant policies 
most important for determining the application are out of date at the time the decision 
is made, the Council will grant planning permission unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise, taking into account whether:  
 
• the application of policies within the National Planning Policy Framework that 
protect areas or assets of particular importance provide a clear reason for refusing 
the development proposed; or  
 
15 A definition of material considerations can be found in the PPG, paragrap h 008

Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
26 
 • any adverse im pacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the 
benefits, when assessed against policies within the National Planning Policy 
Framework taken as a whole.  
 
The Council will work proactively with developers to highlight any areas where there is 
conflict with the Development Plan, and suggest solutions, at an early stage in the 
application process. Planning conditions will be attached to planning approvals where 
they are necessary, relevant to planning and the development to be perm itted, 
enforceable, precise and reasonable . 
 
 
5.3 Addressing Climate Change  
What is climate change?  
5.3.1 Climate change is one of the most challenging issues facing the world today and 
reducing the impacts of climate change is one of the key drivers behind 
sustainable development.  
5.3.2 While climate change is recognised as a global issue, its consequences will be felt 
at the local level from the associated impacts of increasing temperatures, rising 
sea levels and extreme weather conditions.  Copeland is particular ly vulnerable to 
climate change given its coastal location and the fact that it contains  a number 
of waterbodies. It is therefore vital that planning policy makes a positive 
contribution  towards  helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change for our 
future generations.  
Key Legislation and Policy  
5.3.3 Paragraph 1 52 of the NPPF states the following:  
“The planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a 
changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change. It should 
help to: shape places in ways that contribute to radical reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions, minimise vulnerability and improve resilience; encourage the reuse 
of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings; and support 
renewable a nd low carbon energy and associated infrastructure.”  
5.3.4 The Climate Change Act 2008 sets a legally binding target to reduce the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% in 2050 from 1990 levels.   The Act 
introduced a system of carbon budgets including a target that the annual 
equivalent of the carbon budget for the period including 2020 is at least 34% 
lower than in 1990.   
5.3.5 In May 2019, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) outlined proposals for the 
UK Government to bring forward legislation to reach net -zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by the year 2050. Subsequently, the UK parliament amended the 
Climate Change Act of 2008, committing the UK to becoming “Net Zero Carbon” Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
27 
 by 2050.  The Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership has accelerated this target, 
working toward s an ambitious goal to make Cumbria the first carbon neutral 
county in the UK by 2037 . 
5.3.6 In light of the Government’s strategy for  net zero carbon by 2050, the Clean 
Growth Strategy (updated 2018) sets out a comprehensive set of policies and 
proposals that a im to accelerate the pace of ‘clean growth’  i.e. deliver increased 
economic growth and decreased emissions.16’    
5.3.7 The Government approved changes to Part L of the building regulations in 
October 2019 (the Future Homes Standard) which removes the ability of planning 
authorities to set higher energy efficiency standards than those set out in the 
Building Regulations. The Standard will be introduced by 2025 and will require 
new homes to be “ future proofed with low carbon heating and world -leading 
levels of energy efficiency ”.  
Achieving net zero carbon in Copeland  
5.3.8 In order to help Cumbria meet the target of net zero carbon by 2037, it is 
important that change happens on a number of scales, and Local Planning 
Authorities have a vital role to play with in that.  
5.3.9 In April 2019, all Cumbrian Local Authorities and the Lake District National Park 
Authority (LDNPA) formally adopted the Cumbria Joint Public Health Strategy 
incorporating a pledge for Cumbria, “ to become a ‘carbon neutral’ county and to 
mitigate  the likely impact of existing climate change ”. In order to take meaningful 
action  towards  the County’s net -zero carbon commitment, the Cumbria Climate 
Action Group was formed under the Cumbria Joint Leaders Board and Chief 
Executive’s Group.  
5.3.10  Copeland is at the Centre of Nuclear Excellence (CoNE), and recognised as a key 
player of ‘The Clean Energy Coast’ brand.  The Energy Coast is made up of a  325 
member  strong business cluster.   These are the front runners in clean technology 
solutions and in  pioneering new ways to achieve net zero carbon and overcome 
some of the most complex environmental challenges, developing world leading 
capability in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence.     
5.3.11  In December 2019, the Council agreed a Climate and  Environment Position 
Statement, which highlights Copeland’s low -carbon history, and our corporate 
commitment to changing for the better, to limit damage to the environment and 
to identifying longer -term strategic ambitions to become a low -carbon authority . 
The statement also sets out our ambitions and responsibilities as a leader in the 
community.   
5.3.12  The Council’s Corporate Strategy for 2020 -2024 includes an ambition to, “ lead by 
example in developing a Climate Position Statement to create awareness, making 
meaningful step changes in our operations to reduce both the carbon footprint of 
 
16 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean -growth -strategy/clean -growth -strategy -executive -summary   
 Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
28 
 the Council but also challenge our residents and businesses in the  borough  to do 
likewise ”.  
5.3.13  In December 2020, the Council produced a revised Climate Change Policy (2020 - 
2023 ), which sets out the following objectives:  
• To commit to becoming a truly sustainable organisation, with the ability to 
deliver the quality of services expected of the Council for Copeland’s people 
and communities now and in the future;  
• To take meaningful  action to limit the harmful effects of climate change, and 
to protect and enhance the environment; and  
• To continue our journey towards becoming a low -carbon Council  
 
5.3.14  The Climate Change Policy is accompanied by a Climate Action Plan (2021), which 
is an action -focused document outlining plans to change the way we operate to 
take greater consideration of sustainability and to immediately reduce our 
footprint across the organisation . 
5.3.15  In July 2021, we launched the Peoples Panel on Climate Change alongside th e 
Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership. This is a citizen’s jury panel made up of 
randomly selected Copeland residents to help shape Copeland’s response to 
Climate Change. The role of the panel is to debate and make recommendations to 
the Council and other orga nisations on where their priorities should lie to achieve 
the goal of net zero carbon by 2037. Supporting the People’s Panel is an oversight 
panel made up of local stakeholders from public and private sectors, who will 
guide the panel and actively support the successful implementation of the Panel’s 
recommendations.  
5.3.16  The Council is committed to challenging the causes and impacts of climate change 
by working with partners and developers  to deliver energy efficient 
developments.  The Local Plan has a key role t o play in this by ensuring that new 
development does not increase the emissions responsible for climate change.  
5.3.17  Policy DS2PU sets out measures to reduce carbon emissions that will be 
supported through the development process.  
5.3.18  Where possible, proposals shou ld make use of existing buildings as often the 
restoration, refurbishment and retrofit of existing buildings can have less of a 
carbon impact than new build developments as set out in the development 
standards chapter.  
5.3.19  Where re -use is not an option, there  are a number of measures that can be 
incorporated into new developments to reduce their carbon footprint. These 
include passive design measures (relating to building location and orientation, 
building layout, air tightness and insulation, solar gain and a ccess, thermal mass, 
shading and ventilation) which take into consideration local climate and site 
conditions and responds to this, in order to maximise amenity whilst minimising 
energy usage17.  Other methods, such as directing development away from areas  
 
17 What is Passivhaus? (passivhaustrust.org.uk)  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
29 
 of high flood risk , increasing green infrastructure18 and promoting low carbon 
travel can also be highly beneficial.  
5.3.20  A Design Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) will be produced to give 
guidance to developers on how sustainable development can be achi eved.  
 
Strategic Policy DS2PU: Reducing the impacts of development on Climate Change  
 
 
 
The Council will support development proposals that make a positive contribution 
towards achieving the Cumbria wide goal of net zero carbon by 2037 where they 
accord with the Development Plan. Developers are encouraged to consider the 
following  as part of their proposals :   
 
• High quality design techniques, including the incorporation of Passivehaus principles 
and maximising the design and layout of buildings to improve energy efficiency  
• Measures to avoid fossil fuel usage for transport, heating and power generation and 
offsetting any carbon intensive energy usage over full lifetime of development  
• Infrastructure to support a ctive and low carbon travel option s 
• Increased resilience to the effects of climate change through elements such as 
avoiding d eforestation, providing S uDs and avoiding development in areas with high 
flood risk   
• Sustainable use of resources, energy and water over the full lifecycle – moving higher 
up the materials/waste hierarchy towards circular economy principles  
• Making the  most efficient use of land by building at appropriate densities and 
encouraging the sympathetic reuse and refurbishment of the existing building stock 
and previously developed land  
• Sustainable land use management, forestry and farming practices and enc ouraging 
agri-environmental schemes   
• Environmental benefits, including contributions towards Local Nature Recovery 
Networks, the provision and enhancement of local green spaces, woodland creation 
and preservation, peatland restoration and preservation, provision of green roofs and 
walls, and native species preservation  
• Measures to  exceed the 10% Biodiversity Net Gain requirement  
 
Additional aspects of sustainable design and development which contribute towards a 
reduced carbon footprint will also be lo oked at favourably by the Council.

 5.4 Settlement Hierarchy  
Purpose of a Settlement Hierarchy  
5.4.1 Identifying areas for growth is one of the most important ways the Loc al Plan can 
contribute to sustainable development and mitigate climate change. It forms the 
basis for the Council’s Development Strategy which sets out how much growth 
should go where. The Development Strategy is divided by development type 
(housing, retai l, leisure, tourism and employment) and is set out within each 
relevant chapter . 
5.4.2 Categorising the borough’s settlements recognises their different characters, 
roles and functions and helps distinguish between them and areas of open 
countryside (which inclu des smaller hamlets and clusters of buildings).  
Proposed Settlement Hierarchy  
5.4.3 The settlement hierarchy is identified in Policy DS3PU and the figures  4 and 5. It 
directs the majority of development over the plan period to the four towns, 
Whitehaven, Cleato r Moor, Egremont and Millom. These are the most sustainable 
parts of the borough as they contain a high number and a broad range of services , 
as well as greater infrastructure to support further development . Directing new 
development to the towns will help  improve their offer, increase their 
attractiveness, help support regeneration strategies and reduce the need to 
travel.  
5.4.4 Whilst the towns remain the focus for growth over the Plan period, the hierarchy 
also acknowledges that development is also important i n rural areas, helping to 
increase community resilience, sustain existing services and enable residents to 
stay within their communities as their housing needs change. New development 
can also help reduce social isolation, particularly in places such as Co peland which 
have an ageing population.  
5.4.5 Rural areas have also become more popular since the outbreak of Covid -19 with 
more people now being able to live further from work due to the increase in the 
availability of home -working and more flexible working pa tterns. In 2020 
Rightmove reported that they have seen a 126% increase in the number of 
enquiries from city residents about village homes across June and July compared 
to previous year’s figures19. 
 
19 https://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/articles/property -news/escap e-to-the-country  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
31 
 5.4.6 The hierarchy contains 5 tiers of settlements in total (e xcluding the open 
countryside), compared to only 3 tiers within the adopted Core Strategy. Beneath 
the Principal Town and Key Service Centres are 3 tiers of villages where 
development would be supported in principle: Local Service Centres, Sustainable 
Rura l Villages and Rural Villages . A definition of each is included within policy 
DS3PU.  
5.4.7 As well as an increased number of 
tiers, the hierarchy also allows for 
development in a greater number 
of villages within those tiers than 
the Core Strategy. It identifies 2 420, 
villages (including village clusters) 
compared to the 14 villages 
identified in the Core Strategy.  
5.4.8 Villages clusters are two or more 
settlements that are connec ted by 
safe, accessible walking routes of 
less than a mile21. These are identified in the settlement hierarchy.  
5.4.9 Forming clusters has resulted in some settlements featuring within a higher tier 
than they would have done if the hierarchy was based on service s within that 
village alone. This recognises the fact that settlements do not operate in isolation 
and share services.  
  
 
20 Ennerdale Bridge and Kirkland are considered to be separate settlements under the preferred hierarchy given the poor 
pedestrian links and the distance between them, as are Lowca and Parton. The settlement hierarchy in the Preferred 
Optio ns Draft contained 25 villages, however the village services review has indicated that these no longer have the level 
of services to meet the criteria below.  
21 A mile between the closest edges of each settlement  Cleator and Cleator Moor are an 
example of a settlement cluster. 
Cleator Moor, being one of our towns, 
benefits from a range of services and  
supports  those located in Cleator. The 
two settlements are well linked by safe, 
pedestrian routes meaning that Cleator 
is a good place to direct additional 
housing development to.

 Methodology  
5.4.10  In 2020, the Council produced a Settlement Hierarchy and Development Strategy 
Paper to support the Preferred Options Draft of the Local Plan. This discussed 
how the settlement hierarchy in the Preferred Options Draft was developed and 
explained the reasons  for discounting alternatives.  
5.4.11  An update to this document was produced earlier this year. The methodology 
used in the update differs to the previous version as it takes into account 
comments received during the Preferred Options consultation, the latest v ersion 
of the NPPF produced in July 2021 and the latest village services survey 
undertaken in June 2021. Where a settlement has changed its position in the 
hierarchy between drafts this is noted in Policy DS3PU with an asterisk  
5.4.12  When developing the hierarch y consideration was given to matters such as the 
number and type of services, employment developments and public transport 
provision as well as pedestrian and cycle links between settlements.  
5.4.13  A safe walking route is one that has street lighting and a cont inuous pavement. A 
frequent bus or train service is one that runs from morning to evening and 
provides a number of options for leaving and returning to the village within the 
same day.  
5.4.14  When considering train links, the distance from the station to the mai n 
settlement and the safety of the route was considered. For example, whilst The 
Green benefits from a regular train service to Millom, the station is over a mile 
away from the main settlement and the route to the station is not considered to 
be safe, lack ing a pavement and lighting in parts.   
5.4.15  Settlements within the parts of Copeland in the National Park are dealt with in 
the Lake District National Park Local Plan. The importance of services within such 
villages, for example Gosforth , is however recognised  particularly in terms of how 
they serve residents within the Copeland Local Plan area. When scoring 
settlements that are partly within the Copeland Local Plan area and partly within 
the Lake District National Park Plan area, points were awarded for servic es in the 
village as a whole regardless of planning jurisdiction . The villages, identified in the 
LDNP Local Plan, in closest proximity to the Copeland Local Plan boundary are 
listed at the bottom of Policy DS3PU . 
5.4.16  The Village Services Survey 2021 was used to score and rank settlements within 
the borough using a matrix system. The scores given to each settlement are 
contained within the Settlement Hierarchy and Development Strategy Update 
202122. 
5.4.17  What the hierarchy means in practice in terms of the scale of housing, retail, 
leisure and employment that will be supported within each tier is considered 
under each relevant chapter .

 Impacts of Covid -19 on Services  
5.4.18  The Village services survey was carried out following the removal of most Covid -
19 restrictions. It i s accepted that the pandemic may have resulted in loss of some 
services however when comparing the data from the survey in 2019 to the latest 
one the impact was less than expected. Where a business was closed temporarily 
due to the pandemic this was often notified by a sign on the premises. Where this 
was the case points were still awarded for the service as it was anticipated that 
the business would become operational again in the near future.  
5.4.19  The settlement hierarchy will be reviewed as part of any future  Local Plan Review. 
At present the NPPF requires Local Authorities to review Local Plans at least once 
every 5 years.   
5.4.20  As stated above the Covid -19 pandemic has altered the way we work and shop 
with more people able to do both remotely where an internet co nnection is 
available. However, as the Council has no control over internet provision and 
given that not everyone has the option of working remotely, points have not 
been awarded to a settlement if it has internet provision.  
 
 
Strategic Policy DS3PU: Settlement Hierarchy  
 
  
 
The Council will support development within the settlements specifically listed below. 
Development must be proportionate in terms of nature and scale to the role and function 
of the settlement, unless it has been identif ied within the Plan to meet the strategic 
growth needs of the borough.  
 
The amount of development (housing, retail and leisure, employment) apportioned to 
each tier of the hierarchy is identified within the relevant chapter. Delivery will be closely 
monito red against these figures.

Key Service 
Centres  The borough’s towns are self -sufficient 
providing a wide range of services, including 
convenience and comparison stores, 
employment opportunities, schools and 
healthcare. They also act as service hubs for 
nearby villages.  
 
The focus will be for town centre

village of a similar scale by a frequent public 
transport service and/or safe pedestrian routes 
a mile or less in length.  
 
The focus will be to support the retention and 
small scale growth of existin g services and

 5.5 Settlement Boundaries  
5.5.1 Settlement boundaries are a well utilised planning tool for guiding and identifying 
limits to development for an individual settlement, particularly in rural areas. 
Land outside of the boundaries (including in smaller villages and hamlets not 
listed in the  hierarchy) is defined as open countryside  for planning purposes  
where development is generally restricted.  
5.5.2 Identifying settlement boundaries provides an element of certainty for 
developers and residents and ensures that development is plan -led in accorda nce 
with paragraph 15  of the NPPF. They are also a useful means of preventing 
sprawl, protecting the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside and 
maintaining settlement character and form.  
5.5.3 Settlement boundaries have been defined using the  existin g settlement 
boundaries identified in Core Strategy Hierarchy where these exist  as a starting 
point . Consideration  was then given  to the following :  
• The existing built development form ; 
• whether there were any opportunities to extend the boundary to allow  future  
additional windfall development23 to come forward on suitable sites without 
causing unacceptable harm or intrusion into the open countryside. The 
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) was used as the basis 
for this assessment as it assesses  the availability, suitability and achievability of 
sites within the borough.  When assessing suitability, t he SHLAA consider ed a 
number of evidence documents including the Settlement Landscape Character 
Assessment, ecology assessments, Landscape Ch aracter Assessment, Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment and also comments received from statutory consultees ;  
• whether any extension would cause two or more settlements to merge ; 
• whether there were any sites with extant planning permissions, completed 
developm ents or allocations outside the current Core Strategy boundaries that 
should be brought in ; 
• whether the settlement crossed over the boundary with the National Park 
(meaning part of it would come under the jurisdiction of the LDNPA Local 
Plan) ;  
• the amount of land that would be required to meet housing needs identified in 
each tier of the proposed hierarchy .  
5.5.4 The Council has taken a positive approach to identifying settlement boundaries 
and has considered the suitability and availability of all la nd adjoining the 
settlements listed in the hierarchy through the SHLAA process.  
 
23 Windfall development within an extended boundary would still require a planning  application where it would be judged 
against the Development Plan.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
39 
 5.5.5 Smaller sites on the edge of the settlement have also been considered, even 
though they are excluded from the SHLAA assessment due to their size24, and the 
boundary has been a mended to include such sites where they constitute an 
appropriate rounding off of the settlement or where they are required to provide 
access to a larger housing allocation.  
5.5.6 The review identified that the boundaries of all settlements  identified in the Cor e 
Strategy  should be amended. It also identified a number of  villages that weren’t  
currently in the settlement hierarchy in the Core Strategy where a whole new 
boundary was required.  
5.5.7 The proposed Settlement Boundaries are identified in Appendix B and on th e 
Proposals Map. Boundaries are based on land ownership and/or clearly 
delineated curtilage edges or landscape features (both natural and unnatural) 
such as hedgerows or roads  in most cases .  
5.5.8 Policy DS4PU supports development in principle within the settle ment 
boundaries where it accords with the Development Plan. It also allows for 
suitable windfall developments to take place on sites directly adjoining and well -
connected to towns and Local Service Centres, subject to certain criteria. This 
provides flexib ility, as sites within the boundaries may not always come forward 
as anticipated, whilst ensuring that isolated homes are avoided in line with 
national planning policy. It also ensures that important landscapes and the 
character of settlements are protecte d.  
5.5.9 Development adjoining lower tier settlements will not be permitted, unless it falls 
within one of the exceptions listed in the open countryside section of the policy. 
This is in order to ensure that the needs of these smaller villages are met, without 
undermining the growth and regeneration aspirations in the towns and larger 
villages.  
 
Strategic Policy DS4P U: Settlement Boundaries  
 
 
   
Settlement boundaries are identified for all settlements in the hierarchy and are shown 
on the Local Plan Proposals Map. Development within these boundaries will be 
supported in principle where it accords with the Development Plan unless material 
considera tions indicate otherwise.  
 
To ensure the delivery of allocated sites is not prejudiced, development outside the 
settlement boundaries will only be accepted in the following cases:  
 
1)Where the proposal is for housing and;  
 
24 Sites under 0.25ha are excluded from SHLAA assessment  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
40 
 a) the site is well related to and directly adjoins the settlement boundary of a 
town or Local Service Centre; and  
b) the site is or can be physically connected to the settlement it adjoins by safe 
pedestrian routes; and  
c) the Council is unable to demonstrate a 5 -year supply of deliverable housi ng 
sites; or  
• there has been previous under -delivery of housing against the 
requirement for 3 years or more or 
• the proposal is for a specific type of housing supported by Policies 
H15PU, H16PU or H17 PU. 
 
2) The proposal is for one of the following types of development and a proven need for 
an open countryside location has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council:  
• Nuclear related developments  
• Renewable energy proposals, including wind farms  
• Essential infrastructure to support energy devel opments and other 
infrastructure  
• Agricultural, forestry, farm diversification or tourism proposals which require 
such a location

 6.2 Development and Infrastructure  
6.2.1 When planning for new development it is necessary to understand the 
infrastructure that will be needed to support it. A requirement of the NPPF is for 
Local Plans to set out the contributions expected from development to fund new 
infrastruct ure, as this will give developers some certainty on infrastructure 
requirements at the earliest stage. Such policies should however, not undermine 
the deliverability of the plan.   
6.2.2 To understand infrastructure needs associated with allocated sites and futu re 
windfall developments, the Council have prepared the following evidence base 
documents, all of which are available to view on the Council’s websit e:  
Transport Improvement Study 2021 (TIS)  
6.2.3 The TIS identifies which improvements will be required to the ex isting road 
network to make sure it has the capacity to cope with traffic from new 
development on allocated sites. Improvements identified are sustainable, 
deliverable and proportionate and promote health and access for all.  
Site Access Assessments 2021  
6.2.4 The SAA is complementary to the TIS and is made up of two parts, a phase 1 and 
phase 2 assessment. Phase 1 provides a review of 37 sites considered for 
inclusion within the Local Plan in terms of their ability to provide a suitable 
access.  This considers the deliverability of the sites and identifies any access 
issues which might need to be overcome at application stage. The phase 2 
assessment provides a more detailed view of six sites in terms of outline access 
designs and associated schem e costings.  
Open Space Assessment  2020 (OSA)  
6.2.5 The OSA includes an assessment of 299 open spaces in the borough by typology 
and settlement. It considers the value and quality of each and looks at provision 
against the borough average. The OSA identifies shortages of different types of 
open space within  different settlements.  
A Ten -Year Sports and Physical Activity Strategy 2021  
6.2.6 This document includes an assessment of the supply and demand for indoor and 
outdoor sports and recreation facilities in Copeland.  It comprises a Built Facilities 
Study, Playin g Pitch Strategy and Play Strategy. The PPS element  could not be 
fully completed due to Covid -19 and  is currently being updated and will be 
available in Spring 2022. The Strategy identifies gaps within sporting provision 
across the borough and makes a numb er of recommendations to help address 
those and improve participation rates.  
Housing Needs Study 2020 (HNS) and Strategic Housing Market Assessment  
Update 2021 (SHMA)  
6.2.7 The HNS and SHMA identify the type of housing that will be required within the 
Local Plan  area over the plan period. It also identifies an affordable housing 
requirement as set out within Policy H8PU.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
44 
 Housing Allocations Profiles 2021  
6.2.8 This document identifies any additional known constraints on the proposed 
housing allocations. Mitigating such  constraints  can help inform the design of 
schemes, but  may  also lead to additional costs for developers.  
Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2021  
6.2.9 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) pulls together information from the above 
documents, assesses the current lev el of infrastructure provision across Copeland 
and identifies the level of planned infrastructure required to support new 
development across the plan period. Where growth exceeds capacity, the 
additional infrastructure required is identified, with a broad estimated cost, 
timeframe, funding sources and details of who is responsible for delivery.  
6.2.10  The Council has, and will continue to, engage with infrastructure bodies such as 
Cumbria County Council and National Highways  and utility providers such as 
United U tilities and Electricity North West, to ensure that constraints can be 
overcome and determine any appropriate mitigation. Engagement is also 
important to ensure that their programmes of improvements take into 
consideration projected growth across the borou gh and support the delivery of 
the Local Plan .  
6.2.11  The types of infrastructure that are considered in the IDP are; Coastal change 
management, flood risk and drainage, highways and transport (including walking 
and cycle routes) charging, low carbon vehicle inf rastructure, utilities (gas, 
electricity, water and waste water and broadband), education, health and social 
care, sport and leisure, green infrastructure and open space.  
Developer Contributions  
6.2.12  Developer contributions are essential  to help  deliver the nec essary infrastructure 
to support new development. Contributions are gained through planning 
obligations such as  Section 106 agreements and County Council Section 278 
highways agreements. The  Council currently has  no intention to produce a 
Community Infrast ructure Levy at present  given the viability issues across the 
borough .  
6.2.13  When identifying and collecting contributions the Council will ensure compliance 
with the three tests set out in paragraphs 5 7 of the  NPPF. This means that 
contributions must be:  
• Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms  
• Directly related to the development; and  
• Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development

45 
 highways , social care  and education improvements and drainage/flood reduction 
measures.   
6.3 Viability  
6.3.1 In compliance with national policy, the level of developer contributions required 
through the Local Plan have been subject to viability testing.  The Council’s aim is 
to strike the appropriate balance by negotiating the delivery of i nfrastructure to 
support new development, when the viability of a site allows.  
6.3.2 A Stage One Copeland Economic Viability Assessment was completed in 2017. 
This provided a generic, formula based approach to assess the viability of an 
appropriate spectrum of r epresentative types of development scenario within the 
borough. At this stage the viability modelling identified a mixed picture of viability 
which is not uncommon with neighbouring authorities and the wider region.   
6.3.3 A Stage 2 Viability Assessment was produced in 2021 . In order to ensure the 
Assessment was robust and the assumptions within it were realistic, the views 
gained from the development industry were vital.  
6.3.4 Viability testing through the Local Plan process, removes the need for fu rther 
viability assessment at planning application stage. In rare cases however an 
applicant may wish to demonstrate that particular circumstances have changed 
and this justifies a need for a more up -to-date site specific assessment. In such 
cases, nationa l guidance should be considered and detailed evidence should be 
submitted.  
6.3.5 The Council will publish an Annual Infrastructure Funding Statement summarising 
developer contributions, received through Section 106 and Section 278 planning 
contributions. The st atement provide s detail on how developer contributions are 
supporting new development and local infrastructure.  The statement is available 
on the Council’s website alongside the Local Plan Annual Monitoring Reports.  
6.3.6 Policy DS5PU sets out contributions fo r the enhancement of existing, or the 
provision of new, infrastructure. Applicants are advised to discuss proposals with 
the Council at the earliest stage to determine the exact level of contributions 
required.  
 
Strategic Policy DS5PU: Planning Obligations   
 
The Council will secure the following infrastructure provision/enhancements through 
planning obligations where it is reasonable, necessary and directly related to the 
development:  
 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
46 
 • Transport and Highways improvements (including public transport, 
sustainable transport solutions, footpaths and cycleways)  
• Car parking and Cycle parking/storage  
• Electric vehicle charging points  
• Travel Plans  
• Drainage infrastructure, flood risk mitigation m easures and surface water 
management  
• Digital connectivity  
• Low carbon energy and renewable energy infrastructure  
• Affordable housing  
• Education  and health  facilities  
• Community facilities including social care and sports facilities  
• Green infrastructure inc luding public open space, play areas, and allotments  
• Environmental improvements such as landscaping, tree planting, public art, 
biodiversity net gain, measures to conserve and enhance heritage assets  
• Compensatory habitat  
 
The necessary management and monitoring arrangements must be agreed with the 
Council a nd put in place as early as possible in the development process. Infrastructure 
delivered through obligations must be provided on site unless specific circumstances 
make off -site contributions more appropriate. When determining the nature and scale 
of any planning obligations sought, account will be taken of specific site conditions, th e 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and other material considerations.  
 
Where an applicant considers that the provision of appropriate infrastructure would 
make the development u nviable a viability assessment must be submitted to, and 
agreed by the Council, as early as possible within the planning application process . The 
viability assessment submitted as part of any application must  clearly state why the 
applicant thinks particul ar circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment (e.g. 
setting out if there have been any change in site circumstances since the Plan’s adoption 
or why they consider the Local Plan Viability Study to no longer be up to date) . 
6.4 Design and Constr uction  
6.4.1 High quality design is crucial to promoting sustainable development and ensures 
that the character and appearance of an area is protected and enhanced.  A well -
designed development will enhance the existing built and natural environment, 
be appropri ate to its intended use  and support safer communities , good health 
and well -being. It can also help the borough become a front runner in energy 
efficiency and the digital economy.  
6.4.2 Policy DS6PU provides a summary of the standards expected on new 
development s. The following paragraphs provide some additional information 
regarding some of the key criteria  within the policy.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
47 
 Active Design  
6.4.3 The principles of active design should be considered by developers at the earliest 
opportunity in order to create spaces that allow residents and visitors to lead 
active and healthy lifestyles. Planning applications will be assessed to determine 
whether an d how they take opportunities available to promote active design and 
facilitate sport and physical activity and applicants should set out how their 
designs have embraced active design principles within their Design and Access 
Statements where these are req uired.  
6.4.4 Sport England have produced helpful guidance on Active Design  and further 
details can be found within the Sports, Health and Culture and Connectivity 
Chapters .26  
Inclusive design  
6.4.5 Consideration should be given to how all users will experience and interact with 
the proposed space or building, taking account of ability, language, age, gender, 
culture etc. Developers should look to incorporate principles such as dementia 
friendly princ iples where possible.  
Designing out crime  
6.4.6 When drafting proposals applicants should remove opportunities for crime and in 
doing so reduce the vulnerability of people and property and the fear of crime. 
Simple design measures such as ensuring public spaces are overlooked or 
providing appropriate lighting should be considered early in the planning process. 
Secured by Design have developed a series of guides to help developers design 
out crime27. 
Protecting heritage  
6.4.7 Copeland’s heritage is an important aspect o f the built environment. The Council 
has produced a number of Conservation Area Design Guides that should be 
considered when dealing with sites within Conservation Areas  to help safeguard 
and enhance their character. Further information can be found within  the Built 
Environment chapter.  
Light Pollution  
6.4.8 Copeland’s dark skies are one of its key assets, however this is being eroded 
through inappropriate, artificial lighting which causes light pollution and can have 
serious effects upon health and well -being, biodiversity and our climate. The 
Friends of the Lake District have produced a suite of useful guidance28 which 
developers are encouraged to review when drawing up proposals.  
Reuse of buildings  
6.4.9 One of the ways in which the environmental impacts of developm ent can be 
minimised is through the reuse of existing buildings where possible. The Royal 
Institute of Chartered Surveyors estimates that 35% of the lifecycle carbon from a 
typical office development (increasing to 51% for residential premises) is emitted

48 
 before the building is even opened29. Opportunities for the sympathetic 
restoration and reuse of  buildings, in particular,  historic buildings , should be 
sought where possible. Historic England have produced guidance for developers 
in their Responsible Retr ofit of Traditional Buildings (2015)30 document.  
Sustainable Construction  
6.4.10  Developers are encouraged, and in some cases will be required, to produce 
Sustainable Construction Management Plans to identify how construction will 
avoid, minimise or mitigate adv erse effects on the environment and surrounding 
communities  during construction  and to help ensure that development is 
compliant with environmental regulations and legislation. Such plans should 
identify the biodiversity features  of a site  which will be ma naged to maintain and 
enhance the site’s nature conservation value. They are also a useful way of 
making site personnel aware of the sites biodiversity value and ensure they adapt 
their working practices accordingly (e.g by not laying heavy materials down on a 
root protection zone)  
6.4.11  The Council strongly encourage s developers  to meet high design standards  to 
create quality places . The Council intends to produce a Design Supplementary 
Planning Document (SPD) that will provide more detailed design guidance for 
applicants seeking planning permission and support the policies within the Plan.  
 
Policy DS6PU: Design and Development Standards  
 
 
 
The Council will expect all new development to meet high -quality standards of design. 
This means that developments must:  
 
a) Make use of existing buildings on site wherever practicable and deliverable, unless 
they have a negative impact upon the street  scene ; 
b) Create and enhance locally distinctive places  which are  sympathetic to the 
surrounding context of the built, historic and natural environment and local landscape 
character ; 
c) Use good quality building materials that reflects local character and vernacular, 
sourced locally where possible ; 
d) Contribute towards good health and well -being by incorporating high quality, 
inclusive and useful open spaces and providing high levels of residential amenity ; 
e) Creat e layouts that encourage walking and cycling based on Active Design principles 
and connect the development to exist ing walking and cycling routes where possible ; 
f) Provide safe, accessible and convenient pedestrian routes and allow for the safe 
access and manoeuvring of refuse and recycling vehicles ;

Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
49 
 g) Adopt dementia friendly design principles where possible and take the n eeds of 
people with disabilities into consideration ; 
h) Create opportunities that encourage social interaction ; 
i) Be built to an appropriate density that enables effective use of land, whilst 
maintaining suitable levels of amenity ; 
j) Be of flexible  and adaptable  design ;  
k) Incorporate measures to design out crime and reduce the fear of crime, taking into 
consideration secured by design principles ; 
l) Be laid out in a way that maximises solar gain to internal spaces to promote energy 
efficiency and sustainable solution s; 
m) Uses appropriate levels and types of external lighting that does not create light 
pollution and helps maintain dark skies ; 
n) Mitigates noise pollution through good layout, design and appropriate screening ; and  
o) Addresses land contamination and land stabili ty issues with appropriate remediation 
measures  
 
Applications for major development proposals should produce and include a Sustainable 
Construction Management Plan as part of their applications.  
 
 
6.5 Landscaping  
6.5.1 National policy requires Councils to protect and enhance valued landscapes. A 
Settlement Landscape Character Assessment and Landscape Character 
Assessment have been produced to identify strategic areas of valued landscape in 
the borough. These documents ar e discussed further in the Copeland Places 
chapter.  
6.5.2 In order to maintain and enhance these strategic landscapes, the Council will 
expect a high -quality landscaping scheme to be submitted with all proposals for 
major development. Opportunities should be ta ken to connect areas of landscape 
at a local, site scale to the more strategic areas  of landscape where appropriate.  
6.5.3 Landscaping is comprised of both soft and hard landscaping. Soft landscaping 
comprises the living parts of the landscape such as trees, hedgerows, grass, plants 
etc. Hard landscaping comprises elements such as hard surfacing (e.g. footpaths, 
decked areas, fencing, walls, drainage channels etc .).  
6.5.4 Good quality landscaping can have several benefits providing space for 
biodiversity, improving he alth and well -being and reducing surface water runoff. 
It should not however be used as a means of “hiding” poor quality development 
that is not in keeping with the character of an area.  
6.5.5 Consideration needs to be given to how landscaping features may chan ge over 
time, for example how trees within a front garden will grow and potentially affect 
lighting to a property or visibility from a driveway. Roots and leaves can also Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
50 
 affect SuDS systems in close proximity so this also needs to be taken into account 
when designing a landscaping scheme.  
6.5.6 When developing landscaping schemes, consideration also needs to be given to 
the policies within the natural environment chapter.  
 
Policy DS7PU: Hard and Soft Landscaping  
 
 
Where appropriate a high -quality landscaping scheme should be submitted with all 
proposals for development. This should include:  
   
- A management plan which identifies all existing trees, hedgerows, ponds and 
other wildlife features and demonstrates how they will be integrated within the 
development. Landscaping should be well assimilated into the wider surrounding 
landscape.  
- Details of the position, species and number of new trees, hedgerows and 
landscape features. Species used should be appropriate for the location and 
should be native w here possible with consideration given to future growth rates 
and proximity to buildings. Native species should be used where possible.   
- Details of any trees, hedgerows and landscape features that will be lost or 
replaced  
- Details of any hard landscaping p roposed including materials, levels etc.  
 
Ancient hedgerows or woodlands should only be removed in exceptional circumstances 
in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework.  
 
Consideration should be given to the role landscaping can play in reduc ing surface water 
discharge, for example through the planting of trees, the use of permeable surfacing for 
driveways etc.  
 
Opportunities should be taken to connect new areas of soft landscaping to  existing  
areas of green infrastructure networks where possi ble.  
 
 
6.6 Reducing Flood Risk  
6.6.1 Given its coastal location, parts of the borough are at risk from coastal flooding.  
6.6.2 The North West England and North Wales Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) 
extends from Great Orme’s Head in North Wales to the Scottish Border. The 
document was adopted in 2010 and is currently under review. It provides a high -
level assessment of the risks associated with coastal processes, and includes a 
strategy for coastal flooding and erosion risk management.  The SMP indicates 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
51 
 ‘holdin g the line’ for all major settlements and a ‘managed realignment’ at 
Eskmeals, which entails making sure the road there will be protected until a 
realigned route is provided.  The policy for most of the undeveloped coast in 
Copeland is No Active Interventio n, which means there is no planned investment 
in coastal defences on those stretches.  
6.6.3 The Cumbria Coastal Strategy, produced in April 2020, builds upon the Shoreline 
Management Plan and sets out how Cumbria County Council will manage the 
risks of coastal f looding and erosion in the county.  
6.6.4 As well as being at risk from coastal erosion and flooding, there are also a number 
of waterbodies within the borough that are prone to flooding. The Council’s 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, produced in 2021, identifies  localised flooding 
issues in the South of Copeland, North Whitehaven and Cleator Moor. These 
areas are particularly susceptible to flash flood events.  
6.6.5 The NPPF directs development away from areas at the greatest risk of flooding. 
New development should be  located in flood risk zone 1 where possible. 
Development proposals in flood risk zone 2 and 3 are subject to the sequential 
test to demonstrate there are no sites available at a lower risk of flooding. Only 
where there are no such sites available in flood  risk zones 1 and 2 will 
development be supported in zone 3 subject to the exception test. Further 
information on the sequential and exception tests can be found in the NPPF and 
NPPG.  
6.6.6 The Council will continue to work with partners to manage the risks asso ciated 
with coastal erosion and flooding. When identifying  potential  sites for allocation  
through the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) process , 
consideration was given to flood risk at the earliest stage and housing sites were 
exclude d from the SHLAA  where more than 50% of the site was in Flood Risk Zone 
2 or 331. It is accepted that mitigation can be put into place to allow development 
to come forward on such sites through a planning application, however it is the 
role of the Local Pl an to direct development to those areas at least risk of flooding 
where possible32. 
6.6.7 A number of brownfield Opportunity Sites within Whitehaven town centre are at 
risk of flooding along with parts of the Harbour, Midgey Gill and Pow Beck valleys. 
Such sites  aren’t allocated for a specific use and a site specific Flood Risk 
Assessment will be required as part of any future planning application.  
Nature Based Solutions  
6.6.8 Developers are encouraged to incorporate nature based solutions to reducing 
flood risk within  their proposals, this could include simple measures such as 
including trees within their developments which can play a significant part in 
 
31 Unless the area of the site outside the flood risk zone measured more than 0.25ha  
32 This may not always be possible, for example if development is required to deliver regeneration on a town centre site.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
52 
 reducing surface water run off. The Environment Agency have produced guidance 
on other measures that can be incorpor ated into developments33.   
 
Strategic Policy DS8PU: Reducing Flood Risk  
 
 
 
The Council will ensure that development in the borough is not prejudiced by flood risk 
through:  
 
a) Directing development to allocated sites outside areas of flood risk where 
possible;  
b) Only permitting windfall development in areas of flood risk where applicants 
have carried out the flood risk sequential and exception tests to the satisfaction 
of the Cou ncil and appropriate mitigation is provided;  
c) Ensuring that developments on Opportunity Sites within Whitehaven are 
designed to address the existing levels of flood risk without increasing flood risk 
elsewhere;  
d) Supporting measures to address the constraint s of existing drainage 
infrastructure capacity;  
e) Avoiding development in areas where the existing drainage infrastructure is 
inadequate; unless appropriate mitigation is provided  
f) Supporting new flood defence measures to protect against both tidal and fluvia l 
flooding in the borough, including appropriate land management as part of a 
catchment wide approach;  
g) Ensuring that any development that incorporates flood mitigation strategies 
does not have adverse effects on water quality;  
h) Requiring the provision of su stainable drainage systems  where appropriate ; and 
i) Working with partners to manage the risks associated with coastal erosion and 
flooding and ensure that all new development is located outside areas identified 
as being at risk either now or in future revisi ons of the Shoreline Management 
Plan.  
 
Sustainable Drainage  
6.6.9 The need to minimise future developments vulnerability to climate change is a 
significant factor in the design and construction of new development, particularly 
in terms of reducing flood risk through its location and active management of 
surface water.  S ustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), dependent on site specific 
characteristics, can aid the reduction of the rate and volume of surface water run -

53 
 off and therefore reduce flood risk.  Where possible all new development must 
incorporate SuDs in accordance w ith Policy DS9PU below . 
6.6.10  It is acknowledged that SuDS may not be appropriate in all cases34, for example 
SuDS that incorporate any form of soakaway on contaminated brownfield sites 
may pose a risk to land and groundwater quality through the movement of 
soluble contamination.  
6.6.11  Applications for new development within the surface water or ground water 
catchment area of pollution sensitive N ational Site Networks or Ramsar sites 
must be supported by a project -level Appropriate Assessment . This must  include  
details of  sustainable drainage measures to be employed once operational and 
water quality control measures within construction plans must  be adhered to.  In 
particular , development within the catchment of the River Ehen SAC, its 
tributaries and th e downstream catchment of the SAC  must include stringent 
measures to avoid the risk of pollution.  
 
Policy DS9PU: Sustainable Drainage  
 
 
 
Where appropriate new development must incorporate sustainable drainage systems. 
Drainage systems should be well desi gned with consideration given to the additional 
benefits they can provide as spaces for biodiversity and recreation.  
 
Development on Greenfield sites should seek to achieve pre -development or better 
levels of surface water run-off and on previously develop ed sites, a reduction in surface 
water discharge should be sought. In demonstrating a reduction clear evidence of 
existing connections from the site and associated rates of discharge calculations should 
be provided. In both cases, measures should be put in  place to prevent pollution 
entering watercourses with surface water managed at source.  
 
Where identified on the local validation list applicants should submit a Drainage 
Strategy that shows how foul and surface water will be effectively managed and 
mainta ined.  
 
Surface water should be discharged in the following order of priority:  
 
1. To a suitable soakaway or some other form of infiltration system  
2. An attenuated discharge to a surface water body such as a watercourse giving full 
consideration to the catchment and sub -catchments  
 
34 For example, if the site lies on heavy clay  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
54 
 3. An attenuated discharge to a public surface water sewer, highway drain or another 
discharge system where there is clear evidence, to the satisfaction of the Council, 
that alternative preferred options are not available.  
4. An atte nuated discharge to a public combined sewer where there is clear evidence, 
to the satisfaction of the Council, that alternative preferred options are not 
available . 
 
6.7 Soils , Contamination  and Land Stability  
Soils and Contamination  
6.7.1 Soil has an important role within ecosystems, providing habitats, storing carbon 
and filtering water and is vital for agriculture. Soils are however at risk of 
degradation which involves both the physical loss (erosion) and the reduction in 
quality of tops oil associated with nutrient decline and contamination35.  
6.7.2 Construction activity can have a negative impact upon soils through 
contamination, compaction and by covering soils with impermeable materials. It 
can also have a positive impact through remediatio n, with the use of brownfield 
sites for development presenting a positive opportunity for remediation of 
despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated or unstable land.  
6.7.3 Copeland contains areas of Best and Most Versatile Land. This is land in grades 1, 
2 and 3a of the Agricultural Land Classification and is the most flexible, productive 
and efficient for farming. Such land should be protected from development and 
maintained for agriculture.  
Land stability  
6.7.4 Copeland has a strong mining history and there are a nu mber of recorded mining 
features present at surface and shallow depth which pose a potential risk to land 
stability and public safety. Given this it is important that a risk assessment is 
carried out where necessary.

Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
55 
 In order to reduce soil degradation and surface water run -off developers are required 
to: 
• Use sustainable construction measures as set out in the Construction Code of 
Practice for Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites;  
• Submit a Soil Resource Plan with applications for major development on 
greenfield sites;  
• Provide details of how any a dverse impacts on the soil resource can be avoided 
or mitigated; and  
• Avoid development that results in the loss of best and most versatile agricultural 
land where possible.  
 
Contamination  
 
The Council will proactively work with developers and other partners to identify 
opportunities to remediate contaminated sites.  
 
Development sites likely to have caused detriment to land quality will need to be risk 
assessed. Some sites will be more sensitive due to the location of sensitive 
environmental and human  health receptors e.g. flood risk areas, surface waters, 
vulnerable aquifers, housing, schools, hospitals, children’s play areas.  
 
It is the developer’s responsibility to secure safe development and provide the 
necessary information at the time of the appl ication. The minimum information that 
should be provided by an applicant is the report of a Preliminary Investigation (desk 
study, site reconnaissance and preliminary risk assessment) or Coal Mining Risk 
Assessment, where necessary. The findings of this wi ll determine if further investigation 
is needed.  
 
Where contamination and/or land stability issues are identified, development proposals 
should incorporate appropriate remediation and subsequent management measures to 
remove unacceptable risks. The full im plementation of approved remediation measures 
will normally be required prior to the commencement of, or the occupation of, the 
proposed development of any phase.  
 
 
 
6.8 Air Quality  
6.8.1 One of the Copeland’s key assets is its clean air and the Council’s Environm ental 
Health team will continue to monitor air quality within the borough.  
6.8.2 The Council produced its Air Quality Annual Status Report in 2019. This states that 
air quality in Copeland is typically very good with N O2 levels well below the 
annual mean objective of 40 µg/m3. The quality of air does however vary across 
the borough, with the highest levels of N02 found in central Whitehaven of (24.3 
µg/m3 annual average), compared to the lowest levels (4.0 µg/m3 annual av erage) Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
56 
 in the heart of Wasdale. The main polluter in the borough is road traffic. This is 
likely to increase across the borough, if the Local Plan strategy is successful in 
reversing population decline and attracting growth.  
6.8.3 The Habitats Regulations Assessment supporting the Local Plan has considered 
the impact of policies and allocations on air quality in relation to protected sites. 
Transport movements associated with the allocations have been modelled and 
where increases ar e likely on transport corridors within 200m of sensitive 
designated sites this has been identified in the HRA.  
6.8.4 The Local Plan aims to minimise the impacts of new development on air quality 
by: 
• Focussing new housing development close to key services minimi sing the 
need to travel.  
• Supporting the use of renewable energy and sustainable modes of travel 
(The role sustainable transport can play in improving air quality is 
considered further within the Connectivity chapter).  
• Enhancing the green infrastructure net work  
• Requiring Sustainable Construction Management Plans to be submitted 
alongside applications for major development  
• Locating new development away from sensitive sites such as those 
designated for nature where possible  
6.8.5 Policy DS11PU  states that planning p ermission will only be  granted where 
proposals  will not give rise to unacceptable levels of air pollution. Unacceptable 
levels  include those that would potentially lead to likely significant effects on 
National Site Network and Ramsar sites  where mitigatio n is not possible . Advice 
will be sought from  the Council’s  Environmental Health team as to whether a 
proposal is likely to cause levels that would exceed  relevant  air quality standards 
and cause unacceptable harm to health and the environment.  
Ammonia Emi ssions  
6.8.6 There are several designated sites within the Copeland boundary that are over 
their critical threshold levels for ammonia.  Whilst some of these sites fall outside 
the Copeland Local Plan area there is potential for development within it to have 
addi tional effects.  These are:  
• Duddon Valley Woodlands SSSI , Greendale Mires SSSI , Silver Tarn, Hollas and 
Harnsey Mosses SSSI , Brantrake Moss and Devoke Water SSSI , Ennerdale SSSI , 
Haile Great Wood SSSI , Milkingstead Wood SSSI , Hallsenna Moor SSSI , 
Duddon Estuary SSSI , Pillar and Ennerdale Fells SSSI , Duddon Mosse s SSSI , 
Black Moss SSSI , Wasdale Screes SSSI  
6.8.7 The Council will support landowners who wish to implement ammonia reduction 
measures from farming practices where possible,  such measures were suggested Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
57 
 in the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report as an additional means of reducing 
emissions36.  
6.8.8 Some farming activities such as slurry spreading does not require planning 
permission. However , where permission is required, such  as proposals for new or 
extended farming development and some industrial developments, should 
include details of measures to reduce ammonia measures where appropriate. For 
example, proposals for new animal housing linked to an increase in cattle should 
include provisions for storing and covering manure appropriately.  
 
Policy DS11PU: Protecting Air Quality  
 
 
 
Development proposals will only be granted planning permission where they will not 
give rise to unacceptable levels of air pollution.  The Council w ill continue to monitor 
air quality in the borough and will introduce Air Quality Management Areas as 
necessary.  
 
Applications for new or extended farming developments must include details of 
measures to reduce ammonia emissions where appropriate.

 7.2 Introducing the Chapter  
7.2.1 Copeland’s economy is changing; whether that is changes to the mission at 
Sellafield and the increased role of the supply chain in the site’s environmental 
remediation, opportunities for new cutting edge clean energy generation, or 
changing shopping patter ns and focus for our town centres, there are many 
opportunities that will arise in the coming years and this chapter of the Local Plan 
aims to provide the framework to support these transitions and maximise the 
potential.  
7.2.2 This chapter describes Copeland’s economy in general and the policies and sites 
that will support the growth and transformation of the borough, which include:   
• Changes at the Sellafield site, and opportunities to broaden and grow the 
supply chain  
• Developing an energy business cluster tha t can create a ‘Cumbria advantage’ 
to incentivise clean energy supply chain organisations to locate, grow, export 
and diversify from the region  
• New low carbon energy generation  
• Growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics  
• The transformation of our  town centres and the regeneration sites to support 
this  
7.2.3 Other chapter s following this focus on the rural economy, clean and renewable 
energy, nuclear , retail, leisure and town centres, and the tourism sector.  
7.2.4 Growing Copeland’s economy is a key priority for the Council, which has recently 
published its growth strategy: Copeland Visions 2040 , and also played a major 
role in producing the Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus .  
7.2.5 The policies and allocations within this chapter provide the flexibility to direct and 
realise the short, medium and longer term economic goals and ambitions of the 
Council to ensure that every opportunity is considered and supported where 
appropriate.

 7.3 Defining Copeland’s Economy  
7.3.1 Copeland’s economy is unique. It is a self -contained Functional  Economic Market 
Area (EDNA 2021), with most economic activity shared with neighbouring 
Allerdale.  
7.3.2 Copeland is home to Sellafield Ltd, which has approximately 12,000 people 
working on the Sellafield site, and many thousands more working in the supply 
chain .  It occupies a prominent position on Britain’s Energy Coast’ and is the UK’s 
Centre of Nuclear Excellence.  These bring about specific skills and opportunities 
that can be built upon to apply in other industries and export across the UK and 
world from Co peland.  
7.3.3 Copeland shares many sectors with the rest of Cumbria, albeit often on a slightly 
reduced share, and these cover a number of established and emerging industries.  
It is in the Manufacturing and Construction sectors though that Copeland has a 
strong  sectoral advantage when compared to the rest of the county and England, 
linked to operations at Sellafield, and there is a real opportunity to build on this 
and develop a nuclear business cluster in the borough.   
7.3.4 This business cluster can be based around  a range of transferable skills and 
capabilities in areas such as clean energy, robotics, research and engineering that 
are stimulated from the Sellafield mission, but can then be further developed and 
refined for new sectors and markets.   
7.3.5 Table 5  highlights these specialisms when compared to both Cumbria and 
England.

7.3.6 In terms of occupation type and skills, Copeland has a greater proportion of 
employees working in professional and technical occupations than in Cumbria, 
and north west and Britain, which can largely be attributed to the nuclear and 
research sectors as can  be seen from Table 6 below.

7.3.7 Table 7 demonstrates that Copeland  is home to almost 3,000 businesses (2017) 
the overwhelming majority are considered to be ‘micro’ in size, meaning they 
employ 9 employees or less. Copeland’s businesses are typically smaller than in 
the rest of Cumbria, the North West and UK.

 7.3.8 Figure 6 below identifies  that whilst Copeland has a lower proportion of residents 
with a degree (or equivalent) or higher, it has over three times the proportion of 
residents with a trade apprenticeship than the British average.  The borough 
historically suffers from higher level s of youth unemployment and low levels of 
educational attainment when leaving education.  The higher than average 
proportion of trade apprenticeships is a positive step in rectifying this problem, 
which could in part be attributed to the success of West La kes Academy in 
Egremont and the Sellafield apprenticeship programme.

7.4 Moving Forward – Economic Growth  
7.4.1 Copeland is going through a period of change and transformation, which brings 
with it new opportunities, placing the borough in a key position to provide 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
64 
 existing and new businesses, as well as entrepreneurs and start -ups with the right 
environment to oper ate from. The key drivers for change are:  
• Copeland Vision 204037: which sets out the Council and its partners’ ambitious 
growth strategy for the borough over the next twenty years .  
• Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus38: which outlines how a sector that has 
underpi nned the borough’s economy for more than half a century can develop 
and diversify into more new cutting edge technologies .  
• Cumbria Clean Energy Park and the creation of the Moorside Clean Energy Hub 
as a location, alongside the Sellafield site where the a bove opportunities can 
be located https://www.snclavalin.com/~/media/Files/S/SNC -
Lavalin/download -centre/en/brochure/moorside -clean -energy -hub.pdf   
• New opportunities linked to robotics and Artificial Intelligence, and the 
potential to place Copeland at the forefront of these technologies  
• The change of mission on Sellafield site to environmental clean -up and the 
Programme and Proje ct Partners (PPP) Framework which will increase the 
supply chain in Copeland and the potential to transfer existing skills and 
technologies to  
• The potential to create a business cluster around nuclear and energy expertise 
that already exists in Copeland a nd create a physical location for the Industrial 
Solutions Hub(ISH), which is a cluster of networked public, private and 
academic organisations that can grow, diversify and export nuclear and non -
nuclear products and services from west Cumbria into UK and international 
markets  
• The outstanding environmental quality and relative affordability in the borough 
making it an attractive place to locate/relocate a business  
• Improved digital connectivity, and the potential for a digital grid in Whitehaven  
• A ready -mad e work force with the transferrable skills required to adapt to the 
creation, manufacturing and maintenance of new technology  
• Proposals for a  new metallurgical coal mine to the south of Whitehaven ‘West 
Cumbria Mining’ . If approved, this  will directly crea te 500 new jobs and an 
additional 200 supply chain opportunities, with 80% of jobs being available to 
local communities  
• West Cumberland Hospital and Medical School in Whitehaven and the UCLAN 
centre for excellence in rural medicine  
• Cumbria Local Industria l Strategy  
7.4.2 It is important that the Local Plan provides a positive framework for these 
opportunities to enable them to come to fruition.  To gain a better understanding 
of the implications the Council commissioned an Economic Development Needs 
Assessment ( EDNA), which was produced in 2021 to help quantify the 
opportunity the Local Plan will ned to provide for.

65 
 7.4.3 As much of the growth requirements predicted in the EDNA are from major new 
and transformational projects the Local Plan needs to provide the flexibi lity for 
this step change for the local economy.  
 
 
Strategic Policy E1PU: Economic Growth  
 
 
 
The economy of Copeland Borough will be strengthened and broadened to provide a 
diverse range of employment and economic opportunities that will attract new key 
industries and provide the flexibility to accommodate existing businesses and new 
initiatives by:  
• Maintaining, enhancing, regenerating and where appropriate extending the 
employment base in our towns and settlements in accordance with the 
Development S trategy, and supporting the economies of our rural communities;  
• Developing a positive brand for the area, building on the ‘Energy Coast’ to attract 
inward investment and drive exports;  
• Maximising Copeland’s expertise and innovation in energy, nuclear decom missioning 
and clean growth through innovative businesses, and supporting the clustering of 
such businesses;  
• Prioritising high -quality office provision within Whitehaven and the Key Service 
Centres to meet inward investment needs ; 
• Supporting flexible works pace, collaborative spaces and touch down zones ;  
• Creating a broader based and resilient economy, that encourages a skilled work force 
to remain in or relocate to the borough;  
• Placing digital and data at the heart of Copeland’s economy;  
• Promoting investme nt in the public realm of employment sites and working with 
owners to achieve improvement and regeneration of appropriate sites;  
• Supporting the establishment and success of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 
with the inclusion of provision for starter uni ts, start -up businesses, collaborative 
space for business to grow, live -work units on new and regenerated employment 
sites and offices;  
• Working with learning and training bodies, job centres and higher education 
providers to develop a skilled workforce and  improve employability;  
• Supporting economic development associated with learning and training centres;  
• Helping the economy in rural areas by supporting rural diversification that will 
encourage, tourism, recreation, rural regeneration, and farm diversific ation, and 
complement new appropriate agriculture and forestry development where 
appropriate.

 7.5 Location of Employment  
7.5.1 In supporting the Council’s growth ambitions it is vital to ensure that there is 
enough suitable and flexible employment land for business development 
including manufacturing, warehousing, new initiatives, start - ups and the 
availability of flexible business space town centre offices and other sustainable 
locations for the life -time of the Local Plan. Going forward,  there is likely t o be an 
increased demand for flexible work space and new provisions for flexible 
homeworking community and digital hubs which must also be accommodated 
for.  
7.5.2 In order to have a better understanding of the likely future needs and provisions 
for employment l and, the Council commissioned and Economic Development 
Needs Assessment (EDNA) 2021 to quantify the likely needs arising over the Plan 
period.  The EDNA considered the economic baseline and general forecasts of 
future jobs growth based on market signal, ec onomic trends and forecasting data 
to understand the likely needs for different types of employment floorspace.  In 
addition to this the EDNA modelled the likely additional jobs created from a 
number of major projects and opportunities discussed earlier th at could take 
place by 2038 as a growth scenario.  This could then be used to calculate the 
likely employment land needs associated with each.  
7.5.3 The projects were packaged into five main components as follows:  
• Sellafield Off -Siting  (i.e. the moving of non essential staff and functions off 
the Sellafield site)  
• Sellafield Supply Chain (the growth of the supply chain supporting Sellafield 
Ltd with their mission to remediate the site, together with opportunities for 
these companies to b uild on capabilities developed at Sellafield to diversify, 
expand, grow and move into new markets with skills developed in west 
Cumbria)  
• Clean Energy Park  (this could be large scale nuclear generation at Moorside, 
Advanced Modular Reactors/Small Modular R eactors, Fusion technology and 
hydrogen production)  
• Woodhouse Colliery (jobs created directly and in the wider supply chain)  
• AI Campus (creating centre of excellence in AI and robotics, building on local 
advantage from the nuclear sector)  
7.5.4 The growth scenar io was considered in this way so the implications of one 
element coming forward, or not, could easily be understood and planned for.  
7.5.5 The EDNA found that the likely employment land requirement to support 
economic growth in the borough is 39.9ha.  This is br oken down in Table 9 below . Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

7.5.6 The economic objective , as set out in paragraph 8a of the  NPPF , places an 
emphasis on Local Plans to ensure that there is enough suitable employment land 
in terms of use type, quality and quantity.  The Council carried out a ‘Call for 
Emp loyment Sites’ in early 2020 to ensure that all potentially suitable land was 
considered to meet the needs identified.   
7.5.7 These sites were then independently assessed through the Employment Land 
Availability Study (ELAS) 2021, to consider each of the site’s  suitability, availability 
and deliverability in the Plan period.  The ELAS identified approximately 39 
hectares of available employment land for allocation.  On top of this there are 
some existing employment sites that have small undeveloped areas which m ay 
also provide some suitable land and the town centres can accommodate some 
office (E (g)i) developments.  
  
Strategic Policy E2PU: Location of Employment  
 
 
 
Proposals for employment development (i.e. B2, B8 and E(g) Uses) will be supported 
where they;  
 
• Provide the type and scale of development that is appropriate for its settlement as 
identified in the table below;  
• Are located on allocated employment sites or existing employment land either 
through the reuse or redevelopment of existing premises and where appropriate 
intensification of use s; or

 Where the following impacts occur, development will only be supported where the 
mitigation measures proposed are deemed by the Council to make the development 
acceptable.  
o Transport impact  
o Vulnerability to flooding  
o Impact on residential amenity  
o Impact on the landscape character, settlement character  
o Impact on biodiversity  
 
Applications for economic development in the open countryside must be supported by a 
written statement justifying its r ural location to the satisfaction of the Council.

 Sustainable Rural 
Villages  Small scale economic opportunity linked to:  
• Expansion of existing businesses  
• Re-use of existing buildings  
• Diversification of existing buildings that provide 
economic opportunity suitable to the role of a 
sustainable rural village  
 
7.5.8 The Council has produced a Transport Improvement Study to consider the wider 
impacts of the allocations in the Local Plan, and a Site Access Assessment report 
to demonstrate their deliverability.  These documents, together with the IDP will 
help developers  understand likely requirements to help ensure sufficient 
infrastructure is in place and mitigate the impacts of development.  Any 
requirements for Transport Assessments/Travel Plans is covered by Policy CO4 PU 
7.5.9 Development should also encourage and enable s ustainable and active modes of 
travel.  This can be achieved via cycle to work schemes, secure cycle 
parking/showers etc., walking routes within new developments and can form part 
of Travel Plans.   
7.5.10  This policy also relates to the operation and start -up of  businesses from home in, 
where amenity (such as noise, disturbance or loss of privacy) can be more 
significant.  
7.6 Westlakes Science and Technology Park  
7.6.1 Westlakes Science and Technology Park is a regionally important site, located 
approximately 2 miles from Whitehaven on the A595.  It is a very attractive, low 
density site that currently accommodates around 2,000 personnel in eleven main, 
modern buildings.    
7.6.2 The focus of the site is on research and development, education, sciences and 
high -tech companies, primarily within nuclear, energy and medicine sectors, 
building on the sectors in the area and their technological transfer. Companies 
based at the Park p rovide a range of skills and services including international 
design, engineering and other professional services.  
7.6.3 The existing site also currently has more than 6 hectares of serviced development 
land set over nine plots, and further expansion land alloca ted in the Local Plan 
totalling 9ha (gross).  
7.6.4 Permitted uses on the site are at present restricted to E(g) and F1 use classes with 
the primary focus of science, research and learning associated with the Science 
Park.  It is however recognised that broadenin g the uses on the site may make it 
more attractive to potential occupiers and their staff, and would also bring 
benefits to nearby residents. It is important however that any new ancillary 
businesses do not affect the vitality and viability of nearby town centres.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
70 
 7.6.5 A project -level HRA will be required for development proposals as  there is 
potential for L ikely Significant Effects  on the River Ehen SAC.  
 
Strategic Policy E3PU: Westlakes Science and Technology Park  
 
 
 
The Westlakes Science and Technology Park will continue to be the focus for a 
knowledge campus of international significance.  
 
Uses will be restricted to E(g) and F1 use classes, although ancillary uses may be 
acceptable within the boundaries of the park (e.g. a gymnasium, café, crèche) to support 
the effective functioning of the Science Park and its employees, where a need can be 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council.  
 
Proposals should be in accordance with policies in the development plan and t he Council 
will work with the site’s owners to produce a Masterplan for Westlakes to inform its 
future development.  
 
 
7.7 Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter  
7.7.1 The Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter (CMIQ) is proposed as a Business Cluster, 
which is defined as a geographic concentration of interconnected businesses, 
suppliers, and associated institutions in a particular field, and clustering such 
businesses is considered to increase the productivity with which companies can 
compete nationally and globally.  
7.7.2 A numbe r of Business Clusters already exist across the UK in fields such as 
Creative/Digital, Aerospace, Chemical and Motorsport, giving these areas 
recognition and a competitive edge by concentrating the resources and skills, 
attracting skilled workers at the fo refront of their specialisms, and creating an 
environment for greater collaboration and innovation.  
7.7.3 Copeland is already the UK’s Centre of Nuclear Excellence, pioneering new 
technologies and processes as part of the decommissioning and environmental 
remedi ation of the Sellafield site.  This forms the focus for a wide range and 
number of high tech, cutting edge research and development which can be used 
on the site, and may also have applications in other sectors of the economy.  
Westlakes Science and Techno logy Park is well established and the focus for 
‘white collar’ and research in west Cumbria, and it is intended that the CMIQ will 
play a complementary role alongside the Science Park.  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
71 
 7.7.4 The CMIQ aimed at leveraging the economic growth potential of the Sell afield 
supply chain, through a cluster approach to growing and diversifying the West 
Cumbria economy. Included within this is the creation of an Industrial Solutions 
Hub (“ISH”) which will provide bespoke accommodation that will be a focus for 
collaboratio n, innovation and diversification across the Cumbrian nuclear and 
engineering sectors.  The CMIQ lays the foundations for change, via 
improvements to connectivity, community facilities and creating the Industrial 
Solutions Hub to support businesses to dive rsify beyond nuclear and to grow 
exports.  
7.7.5 The CMIQ will provide opportunities for the supply chain in west Cumbria to grow 
and broaden their markets, exporting skills, processes and technologies 
developed in west Cumbria to the rest of the UK and other wor ld markets.  It will 
also support the key growth aspirations and opportunities for the borough, a 
number of which have been factored into the Local Plan growth scenarios for the 
borough as follows:  
• Relocating Sellafield staff and businesses off-site where this is possible  
• Increased capture of Sellafield’s supply chain within Copeland  
• The development of the Cumbria Clean Energy Park  
7.7.6 Leconfield Industrial Estate in Cleator Moor has recently been acquired by 
Copeland borough Council and will fo rm the focus for the CMIQ.  The Leconfield 
Industrial Estate and adjacent identified land has been identified as the only 
location able to meet the objectives and requirements for the ISH and new 
business cluster.  This is because its core is a large forme r industrial site within 
one of the borough’s Key Service Centres and there is also scope for expansion if 
demand grows from existing businesses and/or new energy related businesses 
want to relocate into the borough.   
7.7.7 It is recognised that the site will r equire some ancillary uses to support its primary 
function, which may include uses such as a café, meeting spaces, skills/training 
space , lecture and film theatre.  These ancillary uses should be clustered together 
in a central hub building for use by all occupiers, and the local community where 
appropriate.  This will provide a focal point for the site, prevent the dilution of the 
primary uses and help to integrate the development within the wider community.   
7.7.8 There are three areas that can form the CMIQ at Leconfield, which are shown in 
Figure 7: 
• Area 1 – Leconfield Industrial Estate (17.6ha)  
• Area 2 – Land to the east towards Heather Bank and Cleator Moor Medical 
Centre (Up to 4ha approx.)  
• Area 3 – Land to the north, located between Bowthorn Road and Birks  Road 
(14ha approx.)  
7.7.9 It is expected that development will be directed towards the Leconfield Industrial 
Estate in the first instance, as it is the established employment area and to meet Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
72 
 Paragraph 119 of the NPPF which promotes the use of previously develo ped land.  
It is also recognised however, that the Leconfield Industrial Estate may not be 
suitable for a particular use, such as student accommodation, will fill up over time 
and may not be able to meet the requirements of the business seeking to locate 
there.   
7.7.10  As such the policy does include criteria which allows consideration of planning 
applications in the Associated Growth Areas if a suitable case can be made by the 
applicant.  
Figure 7: Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter at Lecon field: Areas for Development  
 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
73 
 7.7.11  It is expected that development will be brought forward in accordance with an 
approved masterplan, which will outline matters such as design and sustainability 
requirements, scale and massing, phasing, amenity of neighbouring  residential 
properties, and connections through and to the site to integrate it with the wider 
community.  This will enable a comprehensive and coordinated approach to site 
development, enabling works and infrastructure provision, and ensure that each 
phase of development is sustainable and does not undermine or prejudice the 
delivery of other potential future phases.  
7.7.12  This will ensure that all of the opportunities for the CMIQ are maximised, and that 
key infrastructure and services can be provided, togethe r with structural 
landscaping around the edge of the site, to enable the site to respond positively 
to the range of companies’ needs that it expects to attract to the site.  
7.7.13  It should be noted that when part of Area 3 was assessed in the Employment 
Land Ava ilability Assessment (ELAS) it was considered to be suitable for the future 
growth of the Leconfield Estate.  However it was not promoted in the ELAS as 
necessar y to be an allocation in this Local Plan as the land  was not available at 
that time and the land requirements identified in the EDNA 2021 could be met by 
alternative sites.   
7.7.14  As such, Area 3 has not been subject to the same level of assessment (access, 
ecology, infrastructure etc.) as the Leconfield Industr ial Estate and other 
employment sites, and these matters, together with a transport assessment, will 
need to be comprehensively addressed in the masterplan and future planning 
applications.  The Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment identified part of Ar ea 3 
as being within Flood Zone 3, and development should avoid this part of the site.  
However careful design should manage the flood risk and enable this part of the 
site to make a positive contributions towards sustainable drainage and 
biodiversity net gain on the site .   
7.7.15  A project -level HRA will be required for development proposals as  there is 
potential for L ikely Significant Effects  on the River Ehen SAC.  
 
 
Strategic Policy E4PU: Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter at Leconfield  
 
 
 
Leconfield Industrial Estate and Associated Growth Areas will be redeveloped to create 
the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter as the location to attract new businesses and 
investment, develop new markets and increase collaboration and economic clustering.  
The boundary of the Leconfield Industrial Estate and future Associated Growth Areas are 
outlined in Figure 7. 
 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
74 
 Existing Leconfield Industrial Estate (Area 1)  
 
The primary uses on the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter development will be limited 
to Use Class B2 , Use Class B8 and Use Class E(g) only.  
 
Community infrastructure, community facilities and ancillary uses to support to the 
primary uses on the development will be supported within a single building or small 
cluster of buildings within the development to  act as a focal point for the development 
and local community.  This could include uses such as café/restaurant, meeting spaces 
and education/training spaces (i.e. Use Class es E(b), E(d), E(f), F1(a) and F1(e)).  
 
Any development will be required to demonst rate how it retains and where possible 
enhances existing connections and linkages through the site and to the wider settlement 
of Cleator Moor.  
 
Associated Growth Areas (Areas 2 and 3)  
 
It is expected that development will initially be focussed on the exis ting Leconfield 
Industrial Estate.  However, the development of the Associated Growth Areas as an 
extension of the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter will be supported when one of the 
following can be demonstrated:  
 
• The Leconfield Industrial Estate has been f ully redeveloped; or  
• It can be demonstrated that the requirements of the businesses seeking to 
occupy the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter cannot be met on the Existing 
Leconfield Industrial Estate.  
 
The primary uses on Growth Area 2 will be limited to Use Class E(g) and student 
accommodation linked to the site.  
 
The primary uses on Growth Area 3 will be limited to Use Class B2 , Use Class B8  and Use 
Class E(g) only.  
 
Any development will be required to demonstrate how it links to the redevelopment of 
the ex isting Leconfield Industrial Estate and retains and where possible enhances 
existing connections to the wider settlement of Cleator Moor.  
 
Development will be required to be brought forward in accordance with an approved 
masterplan.  
 
 
7.8 Employment Sites  
7.8.1 In addition to the strategic sites at Westlakes Science Park and the Cleator Moor 
Innovation Quarter, Copeland has a number of existing employment sites of Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
75 
 differing quality, size, and available space that are generally able to meet local  
business needs.  
7.8.2 The continued allocation of these sites will help to ensure that the need for local 
employment space can be met across the borough as appropriate to maintain 
sustainable communities, and not solely be concentrated in a small number key 
locations.  
7.8.3 The Council will continue to support development on existing employment sites 
and allocations where they are in accordance with policies in the Development 
Strategy.   
7.8.4 Proposals for Sui Generis uses on the Employment Sites and Allocations will be 
considered on their merits.  
7.8.5 It should be noted that a p roject -level HRA may  be required for development 
proposals in order to comply with Policy E2PU . 
 
Strategic Policy  E5PU: Employment Sites and Allocations  
 
 
 
Development within the boundaries of the following employment sites and allocations will be 
supported where criteria set out in Policies E1PU and E2PU is met .  Development is restricted to

7.9 Opportunity Sites  
7.9.1 The NPPF , para graph  81c, highlights the need for plans to be flexible enough to 
accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan and allow for new and flexible 
working practices, and to enable a rapid response to changes in economic 
circumstances.  
7.9.2 Paragraphs  119-125 of the NPPFF  promote the effective use of land, and polices 
should give substantial weight to the value of using suitable brownfield land for 
identified needs, and support appropriate opportunities to remediate despoiled, 
degraded, derelict, contaminated or unstable land.   
7.9.3 The Council has identified a number of Opportunity Sites within and on the edge 
of the borough’s towns together with an indication of the range of uses that may 
be appropriate.  This should help to deliver Town Investment Plans, help support 
future inves tment and funding bids, and increase activity and vitality to the 
towns.  
7.9.4 Development on the larger strategic Opportunity Sites is likely to be mixed use 
and the Council will require the use of a Masterplan to ensure the required 
infrastructure and mitigat ion are in place and the site is developed holistically.  
7.9.5 Development proposals should also take account of the Conservation Area Design 
Guide SPD and Whitehaven Town Centre and Harbourside SPD where relevant.  
Also, a p roject -level HRA may  be required for development proposals on 
Opportunity Sites to ensure any potential effects are avoided or mitigated . 
7.9.6 Opportunity Sites will be reviewed as the sites are developed and new potential 
windfall sites become available within the towns.  The Council is considering the 
option of a portfolio of sites that will be made publicly available on the Council’s 
website and kept up to date through the annual monitoring process.  
 
Strategic Policy E6PU:  Opportunity Sites  
 
 
 
The Council will support the development and/or redevelopment of Opportunity Sites in and on 
the edge of the towns of Whitehaven, Cleator Moor, Egremont and Millom as the focus to help 
regenerate these towns. The list of Opportunity Sites and their preferr ed uses is shown in 
Appendix C. 
  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
77 
 A Masterplan will be required for larger Opportunity Sites to ensure a holistic development is 
brought forward.  
 
Development on Opportunity Sites within town centre boundaries must take the opportunities 
available to enha nce the street -scene and improve the vitality and viability of the centre.  
 
 
7.10 Safeguarding Employment Sites  
7.10.1  The employment sites in the borough (both in existing employment use and 
Employment Allocations) will continue to be reviewed to ensure that there i s 
sufficient supply of sites to meet future needs.  Where allocations are no longer 
required for employment uses they may be deallocated or considered for 
alternative uses.  In line with the NPPF the Council will take a positive approach 
for applications f or alternative uses of employment sites in line with 
requirements set out in Policy E7PU.   
 
Policy E7PU: Safeguarding of Employment Sites  
 
 
 
Employment sites will be retained and safeguarded to ensure the Council’s Vision and 
Prospectus for Growth will be achieved.  The requirement of such sites will be monitored 
over the plan period and considered for alternate uses, or deallocated, where there is 
clear evidence that the site is no longer required for use class E(g), B2 and B8 
employment.  
 
Where pr oposals are submitted for non -E(g), B2 and B8’ use classes on employment 
sites, regard will be given to the following:  
• The proposal meets an identified need and to what extent;  
• The lack of suitable, alternative sites being available to meet that need;  
• The supply of employment sites  
• The need to safeguard the integrity of neighbouring uses, including their continued 
use for employment purposes.  
• The impact on the function of the remaining employment land, in meeting the future 
needs in the borough.  
• The need t o protect and enhance the vitality and viability of town centres.  
• Suitable marketing exercise has been carried out for 12 months  
 
Where sites are released to non -employment use consideration should be given to any 
significant benefits to the local area th at would result from its proposed future use.

 8.2 Rural Economy  
8.2.1 Copeland is a predominantly rural borough and is a relatively remote part of the 
North West. However, like much of Cumbria we have a wealth of natural 
resources which have shaped our development and heritage. Agriculture is an 
important component of our lo cal economy as are other rural businesses such as 
those involving forestry or equestrian activities .   
8.3 Agricultural Development  
8.3.1 Whilst supporting rural businesses, the Council is keen to ensure that any such 
development is appropriately managed, so that it  does not result in over intensive 
use of the countryside or erosion of local character.  
 
Policy RE1PU: Agricultural Buildings  
 
 
 
New agricultural buildings requiring planning permission will be supported where:  
a) A demonstrable need for the building in relation to the functional operations of the 
agricultural business is demonstrated;  
b) The building is located within or adjacent to the existing farm complex unless 
justification for an alternative location is demonstrated;  
c) The building is of a s cale, form and design which is appropriate to the location and 
will not result in adverse visual impacts or adverse harm to the landscape character;  
d) The building will not adversely impact upon the amenity of nearby residential 
properties ; and  
e) The building implements measures to reduce ammonia emissions arising from 
farming practices where possible .  
 
 
8.4 Equestrian Development  
8.4.1 The Council will encourage the careful planning, design and management of land 
on which horses are kept. Good design should be informed by local character and 
distinctiveness with particular reference to farm buildings, layouts and materials.  
8.4.2 It is important that equestrian activities have a positive impact on rural areas and 
protect their natural beauty. The Council seeks to encourage owners to adopt a 
positive approach towards managing the land, depending on the breed, size and 
purpose of the horses, which supports their welfare.  
8.4.3 This approach may also be influenced by soil type and natural drainage patterns. 
Consideration s hould be given to drainage at an early stage of drawing up the 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
81 
 proposal. This is because the use of horses on the land and areas of hardsurfacing 
can reduce its permeability and create additional surface water run -off. 
8.4.4 It may be appropriate in some cases f or management plans to be devised and 
submitted to support planning applications to demonstrate how this approach 
will be delivered. Advice should be sought from the Authority at the earliest 
opportunity and prior to submitting an application on whether a management 
plan would be needed.   
 
Policy RE2PU: Equestrian Related Development  
 
 
 
Development proposals for equestrian  related development will only be supported, 
where biodiversity conservation interest would not be harmed as a result, subject to the 
following provisions.  
 
Commercial equestrian development:  
Development of facilities related to the keeping of horses on a commercial basis will be 
supported  in principle  where:  
 
a) They are located on the edge of Principal Town, Key Service Centres, or Local 
Service Centres, where there is adequate road and servicing infrastructure; and  
b) Applicants can demonstrate the re -use o f existing buildings on site for related 
equestrian use is not appropriate before new or replacement buildings are 
considered.  
 
Domestic Equestrian Development:  
Development of facilities related to the keeping of horses on a non -commercial basis 
will onl y be supported where:  
 
• The proposal reuses an existing building; or  
• It is well related to existing buildings and structures and  
• They satisfactorily relate to existing vehicular access and bridleways.  
 
Where this is not practical or appropriate,  buildings in open countryside locations  will 
only be permitted  where they are demonstrably necessary for and designed for welfare 
reasons.  
 
All development must be  of a scale, form and design appropriate to the location and will 
not result in adverse visual impacts or adverse harm to the landscape character. 
Permeable surfacing should be used where possible to reduce surface water run -off. 
 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

 Where necessary, appropri ate planning conditions will be imposed to restrict external 
storage and the installation of associated equipment to help protect the landscape and 
natural environment.  
 
 
 
8.5 Conversion of Rural Buildings to Commercial or Community 
Use 
8.5.1 Policy R E3PU  is releva nt to conversions that require planning permission outside 
of identified settlement boundaries and aims to strike a balance between 
supporting the rural economy whilst protecting the intrinsic character and beauty 
of the open countryside.  
8.5.2 Applications for the conversion of rural buildings may require surveys to assess 
and mitigate the harm on protected species such as bats and owls. This will be 
considered through the application process.  
 
Policy RE3PU : Conversion of rural buildings to commercial or community use  
 
 
 
The conversion and re -use of buildings in the open countryside for commercial or 
community use will be supported where:  
 
a) The building is redundant or disused, is of a traditional design and construction 
and the proposal would not have an adverse effect on the historic environment, 
the character of the local landscape or its setting;  
b) The building is structurally sound and capable of conversion without the need 
for significant extension, alteration or reconstruction;  
c) The development conserves the essential character of the buildings and 
enhances the immediate surroundings;  
d) Safe road access is in place or can be created without damaging the rural 
character of the surrounding area;  
e) The proposed curtilage area is appropriate in scale to  the character of the 
building and will not result in adverse visual impacts ; and 
f) Conversion would not have a significant negative impact on the natural 
environment and appropriate surveys are carried out where necessary.  
 
When granting permission under th is policy the Council will remove permitted 
development rights where necessary to protect the character of the building and 
landscape.

 9.2 Large Scale Renewable Energy Developments  
9.2.1 The Cumbria Renewable Energy Capacity and Deployment Study 2011 provides a 
detailed and localised assessment of the amount of resources available that could 
be used to generate renewable energy u p to 2030 (potential technical capacity). 
It considers wind, biomass, energy from waste, hydropower and solar and heat 
pumps. It then identifies how much of that resource is realistically deployable – 
forecasting that 606MW of renewable energy could be dep loyed within Cumbria 
by 2030. The Local Plan plays an important role in supporting such resources, 
which also have the additional benefit of creating employment opportunities in 
the borough.  
9.2.2 Proposals for large scale renewable energy developments (excludi ng nuclear and 
wind developments) will be assessed against the criteria in Policy CC 1PU.  
Proposals will need to consider issues including impacts on local amenity, the 
environment, landscapes and heritage. Cumulative impacts and impacts during 
the constru ction will also need to be taken into account .   
9.2.3 The Council is keen to support opportunities for energy storage such as battery 
storage and other more general mechanisms for storing energy. Although such 
energies are not classed as clean energy solutions,  they do provide opportunities 
to reduce energy waste. Similar facilities are already in operation at Woodend: 
https://www.energypowersystems.co.uk/ . 
 
 
Policy CC1PU: Large Scale Energy Developments  (excluding nuclear and wind energy 
developments)  
 
 
 
The Council is committed to supporting  the transition to a carbon neutral future and will 
seek to maximise the renewable and carbon neutral energy generated in the borough 
where this energ y generation is compatible with other sustainability objectives.  
 
The Council will support proposals for large scale renewable and carbon neutral energy 
schemes  and other  large scale  energy developments , including (but not limited to) Solar 
Farms, Geothermal, Low -carbon and Decarbonisation, Hydrogen to Electricity Plants,  
battery stores . The following impacts , caused by siting, scale or design , should be 
avoided where possible and should  be considered  individually and cumulatively:  
 
• Landscape character, including Historic Landscape Character  
• Residential amenity  
• Visual amenity  
• Biodiversity  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
86 
 • Geodiversity  
• Flood risk  
• Townscape  
• Coastal change  
• Heritage assets  and their setting  
• Highway safety  
• Aviation and defence navigation systems/communication  
• The amenities of sensitive neighbouring uses (including by virtue of noise, dust, 
odour, air quality, traffic , glare  or visual impact)  
 
Where proposals would result in significant adverse effects  on the above , propo sals will 
only be accepted where this harm  outweighed by the wider environmental, economic, 
social and community benefits and in the case of the historic environment balanced 
against public benefit as per national policy. Where harm is unavoidable, the pla nning 
application must include details of mitigation measures proposed in order to overcome 
or reduce such harm.  
 
Proposals will only be considered suitable where it can be demonstrated that the 
planning impacts identified by local communities during consultation have been fully 
addressed.  
 
Where renewable energy installations become non -operational for a period in e xcess of 
6 months, the facility must be removed and the site fully restored to its original 
condition within one year.  Additionally , a detailed plan that sets out how any impacts 
will be managed during construction and restoration must be submitted to the  
satisfaction of the Council.  
 
 
9.3 Wind Energy Development  
9.3.1 In contributing towards the achievement of renewable energy targets the Council 
has produced  a study t hat identif ies and assess es appropriate land to allocate as 
Areas Suitable for Wind Energy  (Wind Energy Technical Study)40. Full 
consideration must be given to the Study  prior to submitting proposals for wind 
turbines.  
9.3.2 The Study identifies constraints to wind energy including landscape41 and capacity 
constraints and removes these from the area of search, leaving an area where 
wind energy proposals would be supported in principle. This Suitable Area is

 identified in Appendix D. It should be noted  that applications within the suitable 
area are not automatically guaranteed planning permission . 
9.3.3 The document also identifies key considerations which developers should take 
into account when developing proposals for wind energy developments.   
9.3.4 It is important to recognise that landscape character, and thus landscape 
sensitivity, does not change abruptly, there is a gradual transition from one area 
to another. The acceptability of individual proposals within the suitable area will 
be subject to detailed assessment and consideration of effects at a local scale in 
accordance with the development plan.  
9.3.5 It is also recognised that there are existing wind turbines in the borough, outside 
of the suitable area, which may benefit from repowering in the future.  These 
instances will need assessing on a case -by-case basis to determine whether the 
impacts of such de velopment will have a significant detrimental impact, and 
whether planning permission could be granted in principle.  
9.3.6 The Policy CC2PU  will apply to all wind energy developments. The Policy requires 
applicants to demonstrate, in line with footnote 54 of th e NPPF, that the planning 
impacts identified by affected local communities have been fully addressed and 
the proposal has their backing. Applicants are therefore encouraged to engage 
with the Council and local communities at the earliest stage possible pri or to 
submitting an application.  
9.3.7 Please note that proposals for wind energy developments are  highly  likely to 
require a project -level Habitats Regulations Assessment  including details of bird 
species for which relevant SPA and Ramsar sites are designated.  
 
Policy CC2PU : Wind Energy Developments  
 
 
 
Large Turbines  
Wind turbines 50m in height or over must be located in  an Area Suitable for Wind 
Energy as shown on the Local Plan Proposals Map, unless the proposal is for the 
repowering of existing turbines or windfarms or is for a proposal to extend the life of 
an existing turbine.  
  
All Turbines  
The following impacts, caused by siting, scale or design, should be avoided where 
possible and should be considered individually and cumulatively:  
 
• Landscape character including Historic landscape character  
• Residential amenity  
• Visual amenity and sensitive views  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

• Flood risk  
• Townscape  
• Coastal change  
• Heritage assets and their setting  
• Highway safety  
• Aviation and defence navigation systems/communication  
• The amenities of sensitive neighbouring uses (including by virtue of noise, dust, 
odour, shadow flicker, air quality, traffic, visual impact or glare)  
 
Where proposals would result in significant adverse effects, proposals will only be 
accepted where this is outweighed by the wider environmental, economic, social and 
community benefits and in the case of the historic environment balanced against 
public benefit as per national policy. Where harm is unavoidable , the planning 
application must include details of mitigation measures proposed in order to 
overcome or reduce such harm.  
 
Proposals will only be considered suitable where it can be demonstrat ed that the 
planning impacts identified by local communities during consultation have been fully 
addressed.  
 
Where turbines become non -operational for a period in excess of 6 months, the facility 
must be removed and the site will be fully restored to its original condition within 12 
months. A detailed plan that sets out how any impacts will be managed during 
construction and restoration must be submitted to the satisfaction of the Council.  
 
Proposals for the re -powering of turbines in areas which are ident ified as unsuitable in 
principle could potentially be permitted where the impacts of such development, 
including cumulative effect, are considered acceptable. This will be assessed on a case -
by-case basis .

 10.2 Copeland’s Nuclear  Sector  
10.2.1  This section sets out opportunities related to nuclear development in Copeland, 
including:  
• Delivery of the Sellafield mission safely and securely in the interest of the local 
community, and associated supply chain and research activity;  
• Opportunities associated with the Cumbria Clean Energy Park;  
• Deployment of New Nuclear Technologies, including the development of 
Small Modular Reactors (SMR’s) and Advanced Modular Reacto rs (AMR’s)  
• Opportunities associated with new nuclear power generation at Moorside;  
• Opportunities associated with the Industrial Solutions Hub (ISH) in Cleator 
Moor  
 
10.2.2  The ‘ Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus’  sets out a new enterprising and dynamic vision 
for Cumb ria to become the Northern ‘living lab’ for clean energy: decarbonising 
heat, power and transport, and driving Clean Growth as we head towards Net 
Zero. It is the intent that we will be the trailblazer for the UK’s decarbonised 
energy -system, building on l ocal and regional strengths to develop and deploy a 
blend of nuclear new build and advanced nuclear technologies to decarbonise 
heat, power and fuels.  This vision is set out under 5 themes42: 
 
 
 
10.2.3  This vision includes the development of the existing nuclear sector in West 
Cumbria to deliver the Sellafield mission safer, sooner, cheaper, and to build on 
existing strengths to grow and diversify into new nuclear and non -nuclear 
markets. The vision is flexible to incorporate deployment of new nuclear 
tech nologies that are emerging in the UK . 
10.3 Sellafield  
10.3.1  The Sellafield site is one of the most complex industrial sites in the world, and is 
home to over 1,000 buildings. What is now known as the Sellafield site has, over 
 
42 https://www.copeland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/cumbria_nuclear_prospectus.pdf   
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
92 
 many decades, been host to a number of wo rld-first nuclear developments, many 
of them led by the UKAEA – the Windscale Piles, Calder Hall, Windscale Advanced 
Gas-cooled Reactor and the HER0 reactor. As set out in the Cumbria Nuclear 
Prospectus: Energising the Energy Coast , we have ambitions to bu ild on this to 
remain at the forefront of clean energy development.  
10.3.2  The Sellafield site is a de facto technological test bed on which to develop, deploy 
and prove cutting edge decommissioning, waste management and remediation 
technologies. By using digital  innovation, technology and big data to assess and 
masterplan future activities on the site, Sellafield is becoming a test bed for 
globally significant innovation.  
10.3.3  Sellafield provides the pull for world -first innovation in fields such as remote 
handling, r obotics, bespoke advanced manufacturing and specialised construction 
to meet the uniquely complex challenges on the site, and has led to the presence 
of world -leading nuclear and non -nuclear capability in the region, particularly in 
West Cumbria. NNL and t he University of Manchester Dalton Facility conduct 
leading research from locations in West Cumbria and the National College for 
Nuclear and Energus continue to grow the nuclear skills base for the UK - the best 
nuclear minds in the world are here.  
10.3.4  Over ti me, supply chains in the region have become highly attuned to the needs 
of Sellafield, with a heavy focus on engineering and technical activities, 
manufacturing, specialised construction and professional services – mostly 
transferable and exportable capabi lities. The reliance upon Sellafield presents 
both opportunities and challenges - decommissioning is the current major driver 
of the economy, supporting 21,000 jobs in the locality, but will not be so in the 
same way or to the same extent in the future.  
10.3.5  The shifting focus of the Sellafield mission, away from active operations towards 
decommissioning and long -term waste management and disposal in a post -
reprocessing environment presents both a threat and an opportunity for 
Copeland. Without intervention, thi s would trigger a gradual economic decline as 
the Sellafield mission is delivered. But the changing relationship between 
Sellafield and its supply chain is an opportunity to rethink and reshape a more 
resilient, future -facing economic model to:  
1. Facilitate the export and cross -transfer of capabilities gained at Sellafield into 
both nuclear and non -nuclear sectors, in order to diversify the economy, and  
2. Empower supply chain organisations to capture the full benefits of Sellafield 
experience in other markets . 
10.3.6  Partners including NDA, Sellafield Ltd and the Council with support from Cumbria 
LEP are already taking action to intervene, and these interventions will start to 
build the foundations for future economic growth. This is expanded upon in the 
follo wing sections.  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
93 
 10.4 Moorside  
10.4.1  The Moorside site located north of Sellafield is identified National Policy 
Statement for Nuclear Power Generation (EN -6) 2011 as a potential location for a 
new nuclear power station. The NPS is expected to be updated later this ye ar. 
10.4.2  The detailed proposals at Moorside are still to be defined but the latest proposals 
set out in May 2016 are for up to 3.8 GW of new electricity generating capacity. 
This involves supporting infrastructure works, including railway improvements 
between C orkickle and Mirehouse, a Marine Off -Loading Facility, highway 
improvements and worker accommodation.  
10.4.3  The Council believes that the Moorside site is fundamental to the delivery of the 
nation’s energy security and Net Zero Carbon target and will bring pote ntially 
significant economic benefit to the area, including the generation of significant 
employment opportunities. This includes an anticipated peak of 6,500 workers 
during construction, 1,000 permanent staff when operational and additional 
opportunities during maintenance and outage periods.  
10.5 Cumbria Clean Energy Park  
10.5.1  In preparation of achieving the vision of the Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus, a 
significant investment proposal is being designed around a Cumbria Clean Energy 
Park, primarily at the Moorside sit e. If successful the Energy Park could host a 
large nuclear power station, or a mix of large, small and advanced nuclear. This 
could result in 3GW+ of large new build plus a further contribution of low carbon 
power from other technologies on or adjacent to  the site. Part of the site could be 
devoted to testing and deployment of Advanced Nuclear Technologies, to 
produce heat, steam, hydrogen or other low carbon synthetic fuels.  
10.6 Industrial Solutions Hub  
10.6.1  The flagship initiative by these partners, the Industri al Solutions Hub (ISH), seeks 
to address the challenge that current ability to commercialise Sellafield 
experience is constrained and opportunities for wider economic growth and 
diversification are being missed. In line with the NDA Local Social and Econom ic 
Impact Strategy and Copeland Vision 2040, the ISH will leverage the economic 
potential of the Sellafield supply chain through a cluster approach to growing and 
diversifying the West Cumbrian economy.  It will provide a new enterprise 
campus and innovati on hub  (the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter) , facilitating 
the creation of a networked cluster of public, private and academic organisations 
growing, diversifying and exporting products and services from Cumbria into new 
nuclear and non -nuclear markets . 
10.6.2  The ISH concept will maximise the existing and new economic activity in West 
Cumbria, in a way that facilitates:  
• Spillovers and collaboration between industry, supply chain, SMEs, academia 
and public sector organisations, opening up new opportunit ies Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
94 
 • Wider societal outcomes such as town centre regeneration, removal of 
barriers to local job creation, and increasing skills levels and aspirations  
• Effective delivery of new nuclear and clean energy missions  
• More effective, safer, quicker, better value d elivery of the Sellafield mission  
10.7 New Nuclear Technologies  
10.7.1  While new nuclear development is subject to the agreement of a financing model 
for nuclear new build and to the implementation of a UK Policy framework for 
Advanced Nuclear Technologies, this Plan supports the deployment of any of the 
following new nuclear technologies in Copeland in accordance with the criteria 
set out in the nuclear policies below. This includes the following:

Reactors 
(SMR)  SMRs are smaller -scale versions of proven reactor technologies, 
such as light water reactors. Government support for the UK 
SMR project suggests that this will be the first to market in the 
UK, and Copeland is identified as the location for the first of a 
kind deployment. Copeland is also well -placed as the location of 
one of the manufacturing and assembly hubs, expected to 
create up to 2,000 supply chain jobs during manufacture  and 
operations.  Fellside,

10.8 Other Supporting Developments  
RAICo Labs  
10.8.1  Bridging between civil nuclear decommissioning and fusion development, RAICo 
Labs is a Robotics and AI collaboratio n between NDA, Sellafield Ltd, National 
Nuclear Laboratory, UK Atomic Energy Authority and University of Manchester 
that will increase local partnerships with public authorities, anchor institutions 
and private sector businesses to engage more with R&D and  access national and 
international innovation opportunities. Regional benefits include:  
• integration of RAI projects into local planning as a supporter to new policy;  
• marketing for the region as a place to test and develop ideas;  
• creating more inward investment;  
• attracting/retaining talent to/in the region.  
 
10.8.2  RAICo Labs represents an acknowledgement by anchor institutions of the 
importance of innovation in creating wider societal outcomes, importantly in 
driving digital social mobility through the creation of high -value, highly -skilled 
employment and training opportunities for our talented young people.  
10.9 Supporting development of the nuclear sector  
10.9.1  Where proposals for large scale nuclear development are Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects  (NSIP`s) they will fall under the remit of the Planning 
Inspectorate. The Council as both the local Borough Council and the Local 
Planning Authority will be consulted on such applications and our starting 
position will be as set out in the nuclear Policie s where relevant below:  
  Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
96 
  
Strategic Policy N U1PU: Supporting Development of the Nuclear Sector  
 
 
 
The Council will support and encourage the development of the nuclear sector, including   
new nuclear missions, within Copeland where the following criteria  are met;  
 
a) Proposals will be in accordance with relevant National Policy and Government 
Guidance ; 
b) Proposals, where appropriate, will make a demonstrable positive contribution to 
the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies to help 
deliver a net zero carbon future.  
  
Proposals for new nuclear build and associated infrastructure, including small modular 
reactors (SMR), advanced modular reactors (AMR) technologies will be assessed against 
criteria a) and b) above.  
 
Proposals that deliv er the Sellafield mission will be supported where they meet the 
criteria in Policy  NU4PU. 
 
The Council will work proactively with Cumbria County Council and Sellafield site 
operators in the development and management of nuclear and associated 
facilities/infrastructure.    
 
In applying this policy the Council will expect a ll nuclear sector -related development in 
the Borough to make a proportionate and meaningful contribution to local economic, 
social and environmental strategies/priorities.  
 
 
10.10  Nuclear Decommissioning  
10.10.1  Sellafield is home to a number of nationally significant facilities: the Windscale 
Pile Reactors, Windscale Advanced Gas -cooled Reactor, Calder Hall Magnox 
power station, Magnox Reprocessing and Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plants an d 
the UK’s highest hazard facilities, the Legacy Ponds and Silos. This nuclear legacy 
makes Sellafield one of the most complex nuclear decommissioning challenges in 
the world.   
10.10.2  Sellafield Ltd is tasked by the NDA on behalf of UK government (BEIS) with safe ly 
and securely cleaning up the Sellafield site, in the long -term interests of the 
organisation, its employees, the local communities and supply chains. This 
mission includes the following activities:  
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
97 
 • carrying out the environmental clean -up of the UK’s mos t complex and 
hazardous nuclear site, Sellafield  
• decommissioning nuclear facilities  
• receiving, reprocessing and storing used nuclear fuel  
• managing the UK’s special nuclear materials  
• delivering capital projects to support the mission, and asset care and 
maintenance – some of the facilities at Sellafield are more than 70 years old 
so significant investment is required to ensure that they remain operational 
and in a safe state prior to decommissioning; and  
• the safe treatment of low level, intermediate level an d high -level waste  
 
10.10.3  Sellafield is a major developer, and the long -term (100 years +) programme of 
high hazard and risk reduction, decommissioning, remediation and radioactive 
waste management will require a number of major new build and demolition 
projects on the site, supported by a significant programme of procurement 
activity.  
10.10.4  Delivery of the Sellafield mission dominates economic activity and employment in 
Copeland, where Sellafield is the single dominant customer for a developed 
suppl y chain, research and skills infrastructure. It is recognised by the NDA, 
Sellafield Ltd and the Council that there is a mutual desire to maximise value for 
the community from the taxpayer’s investment in Sellafield.  
10.10.5  Sellafield’s changing mission over comi ng years could present a potential threat 
to the local economy, which has become highly attuned to the site’s needs. 
However, this change also presents an opportunity to anchor new nuclear activity 
associated with decommissioning at Sellafield in West Cumb ria, in a way that:  
• Creates a more diverse and resilient local economy, opening up opportunities 
to export nuclear and non -nuclear products and services into domestic and 
international markets  
• Attracts and grows new businesses in West Cumbria as part of an effective 
economic cluster, creating sustainable business and employment 
opportunities  
 
Strategic Policy N U2PU: Maximising opportunities from Nuclear Decommissioning  
 
 
 
The Council will maximise opportunities resulting from nuclear decommissioning to  grow 
and diversify our economy by supporting proposals that accord with the Development 
Plan and:  
 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
98 
 • Strengthen Copeland’s position as the Centre of Nuclear Excellence (CoNE) for 
knowledge and skills utilising Sellafield, the Westlakes Science and Technolog y Park 
and the Cleator Moor Innovation Quarter as centres of research and development . 
• Support  the vision for new nuclear development set out in the Copeland Vision 2040 
and Cumbria Nuclear Prospectus  
• Create new sustainable business and employment opportun ities that respond to 
work force change, providing opportunities to commercialise the world leading skills 
and processes generated at Sellafield for new markets  
• Enable cross sector skills transfer from the nuclear sector to new low -carbon 
advanced technol ogies  
• Provide opportunities to research, build and demonstrate prototype low -carbon 
technologies  
• Maximise opportunities and encourage investment in training and education at 
existing facilities, and new facilities.  
• Attract national and international invest ment for industrial and scientific relocation 
to Copeland  
• Create a strong magnet for people attracted to a new exciting sector at the forefront 
of tackling climate change, and those inspired by technology aiming to protect the 
environment  
• Optimise the relo cation of functions and jobs that do not have to be based on the 
Sellafield site to sustainable locations within Copeland’s towns or other suitable 
locations.  
 
 
10.11  Nuclear Energy Sector Development and Infrastructure  
 
10.11.1  It is recognised that there are a broad range of activities related to the nuclear 
sector, not all of which are directly nuclear development for example activities 
(such as contractors` accommodation and laydown/ storage facilities).  Such 
supporting activities are often required to enable  the work of the nuclear sector 
to be carried out including development on the Sellafield site. Policy N U3PU seeks 
to enable this as well as other general nuclear development.  
 
 
Strategic Policy N U3PU: General Nuclear Energy and Associated Development and  
Infrastructure  
  
 
 
The Council will support nuclear energy sector development and associated  
infrastructure projects by working with potential developers to identify suitable sites for 
Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)  
 
99 
 a range of  nuclear related support activities including, supply chain operations, research 
and development, worker accommodation and other relevant uses.  The development of 
such sites will be supported where the following criteria are met:  
 
a) The development is site d on a designated employment site or on a suitable site s 
within settlement boundaries or otherwise be accompanied by a justifiable exceptional 
need case.   
b) Any new energy infrastructure will minimise potential impacts on the borough’s 
landscape and natu ral environment, and the health and amenity of its community and 
visitors;  
c) Sites must be located , developed and designed, t o minimise any adverse impacts and 
where relevant must be capable of leaving a positive legacy for the borough and its 
communities . 
 
Pre-application advice should be sought with the Council at an early stage of the 
proposal`s development.  
 
Where relevant, proposals should be developed in consultation with the community and 
other key stakeholders.  
 
 
10.12  Development at Sellafield  
 
10.12.1  The borough hosts the Sellafield site where a nationally significant 
decommissioning mission is being delivered in accordance with NDA Strategy 
2021 (as required under the Energy Act 2004). The Council recognises the 
importance of enabling delivery of that miss ion in order to create  a clean and safe  
environment for future generations, and that this mission is carried out within a 
robust framework of safety, security and environmental regulatory controls which 
are placed on the operators of the site by e.g. the O ffice for Nuclear Regulation 
and the Environment Agency. It is recognised that to facilitate decommissioning 
and safely store the waste arisings from these high hazard reduction activities, 
pending a national decision on geological disposal, significant de velopment of the 
Sellafield site is required.  
10.12.2  The Council’s approach to dealing with proposals for nuclear development 
including those related to decommissioning, site remediation and radioactive 
material management in the borough is to work with operator s of the facilities at 
the Sellafield nuclear licensed site and Cumbria County Council to ensure that, so 
far as it is in line with Government policy, regulatory frameworks and the remit of 
the Council in its role as a Local Planning Authority . 
10.12.3  The following policy, N U4PU, is specific to nuclear development at Sellafield and 
recognises the uniqueness of the site. The policy aims to support future 
development at Sellafield and maximise opportunities. The Council will continue 
to work pro -actively with  Sellafield to accommodate their needs whilst Copeland Local Plan 2021 -2038: Publication Draft (January 2022)

Policy N U4PU : Nuclear Development at Sellafield  
 
 
 
The Council’s approach to dealing with proposals for nuclear development including 
those related to decommissioning, site remediation and radioactive material 
management in the Borough is to work wit h operators of the facilities at the Sellafield 
licensed nuclear site and Cumbria County Council to ensure that:  
 
a) All nuclear development (other than monitoring, maintenance and investigatory work 
necessarily done off -site) shall be sited within the existing Sellafield site boundary unless 
Criterio n b) applies.   
b) Where any proposed development is outside the Sellafield site it shall be sited on a 
designated employment site or on suitable sites within settlement boundaries in 
accordance with the pri nciples set out in Policies DS3PO  and DS4PO, or otherwise 
accompanied by a justifiable exceptional need case43.   
c) With the exception of irradiated fuel and nuclear materials, no radioactive material is 
imported for treatment or storage on the Sellafield  licensed site unless the proposal 
represents the best practical environmental option and is an interim proposal pending 
agreement on a national disposal route.   
d) Proposals for any new development include long term management plans setting out 
how operat ions will be co -ordinated to minimise any harmful effects and mitigate or 
compensate for physical environmental impacts.  
e) Proposals include provision for adequate infrastructure to support the new 
development.  
f) Proposals include measures to adequatel y mitigate any adverse effects of the 
proposed development, and enhancement of the site where possible.  
g) Proposals shall include measures for carbon offsetting via off site / other agreed 
compensatory means where it has been demonstrated that they cannot  be achieved on 
site.  
 
 
 
43 A development proposal which is supported by a statement outlining the speci al `site specific` circumstances that 
demonstrate the need / reason for that development on planning grounds to be on that particular site (as opposed to 
elsewhere)  and which justify the proposal in that location as an exception to established planning policies.

 10.13  Nuclear Demolition  
10.13.1  Under the planning legislation, demolition is classed as development for which 
prior notification is required which controls the method of demolition and 
restoration (not the principle), which have to be satisfactory.  The purpose of this 
control is to give  Local Planning Authorities the opportunity to regulate the 
details of demolition in order to minimise the potential impact of that activity on 
local amenity.   
10.13.2  On the Sellafield site the methods of demolition are stringently controlled. The 
majority of th e cleared sites are identified for immediate re -use as they are often 
earmarked for further development as land on site is such a premium.  
Alternatively, they may also be required for interim purposes such as contractors` 
laydown areas.  
10.13.3  There is an active  programme of demolition on the Sellafield site as part of site 
decommissioning and remediation.  Approximately 500 buildings/ structures are 
identified for demolition by 2040 which will free up much valuable land resource 
on the site and from 2033 the rate  of demolition is expected to increase 
significantly which will involve buildings within the Separation Area. As part of the 
strategy for supporting the development of the nuclear sector in Policy N U1PU 
and the wider spatial principles, Policy N U5PU sets o ut the detailed 
considerations for proposals for demolition and development related to the 
nuclear sector.  
 
 
Policy N U5PU: Nuclear demolition  
 
 
 
Demolition of buildings or structures on the Sellafield site shall conform to the following 
principles:  
 
1) Demonstrate an acceptable method of demolition.  
2) Provide full details of a programme of restoration of the site and /or 
redevelopment.  
3) Shall not adversely affect any ecological assets unless it can be demonstrated 
that appropriate mitigation or compensatio n (on or off site) can be provided.  
4) Shall not give rise to other adverse impacts unless it can be demonstrated that 
they can be adequately mitigated .

 11.2 Retail and Leisure in Copeland  
11.2.1  The retail and leisure offer within Copeland is primarily built around the Principal 
Town of Whitehaven and the three Key Service Centres of Cleator Moor and 
Egremont to the north of the borough and Millom to the South. Below the Key 
Service Centres are a range of Local Service Centres and Sustainable Villages that 
offer retail, leisure and service provisions to support the daily needs of local 
communities.  
11.2.2  Copeland’s towns have the potential to deliver high quality town centres that 
meet the needs of the community, encourage more people into our centres, 
promote economic growth and improve health and well -being. It is acknowledged 
that in order to achieve this, some aspects of Copeland’s centres are in need of 
the following:  
• regenerati on,  
•  improved connectivity (digital and active travel routes),  
• diversification of uses to create quality leisure and shopping experiences  
• new and improved flexible built and public open spaces  
• new and improved opportunities for overnight stays and livi ng 
accommodation  
Opportunities and challenges  
11.2.3  There have been a number of recent changes to national planning policy that 
have potential to affect planning for retail and leisure. Recent Government 
relaxations to Permitted Development Rights acknowledge t he importance of 
planning for diverse Town Centres. These changes are important as they can 
contribute to delivering improvements and Opportunities in Town Centres, 
helping to improve their vitality and viability.  
11.2.4  In addition, Amendments to the Town and Co untry Planning (Use Classes) Order 
1987 made on 22nd July 2020, came into force in England on 1st September 2020. 
This was with the aim of supporting high street revival and allowing greater 
flexibility to change uses within town centres without the need f or express 
planning permission . Moving forward, we see the Government reforms to the 
planning system as an opportunity for us to review what use classes should be 
supported and are appropriate in rebooting our town centres.  
11.2.5  Improvements to Town Centres als o relate closely to the Government’s ‘Levelling 
up’ agenda. This is designed to address economic disparities across the UK, with a 
white paper anticipated towards the end of 2021. This aims to develop 
opportunities for improvement in ‘left behind’ areas, h elping to support jobs and 
economic growth, addressing the impact of the pandemic.  
11.2.6  On a local level , in 2018 the Council produced Spatial Frameworks for Whitehaven 
(draft -not yet adopted) and the three Key Service Centres. These provide a 
comprehensive vision for the future development of the four towns . Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
105 
 Developments which help to achieve the ambitions within these documents will 
be supported by the Council.  
11.2.7  The Council is  working to secure funding for the borough to help provide Town 
Cent re improvements. In June 2021, Cleator Moor was offered £22.5 million of 
investment through the  Government’s Towns Fund Scheme  fund. Subsequently,  
in July 2021  a bid for £20.6 million was approved for Millom. This funding will be 
instrumental in encouragin g future economic growth in the two towns and 
contributing towards the Government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda44. The Millom and 
Cleator Moor Town Deal Boards have both produced a Town Investment Plan 
which set out local priorities for investment and help to pr ovide focus for where 
the Towns Fund money will be spent.   
11.2.8  Despite there being a number of strong opportunities for town centres and retail 
in the borough, there are also a number of challenges that need to be overcome. 
In recent years, towns across the c ountry have seen decline, boarded up 
shopfronts and in some cases the liquidation of household retail names.  These 
impacts are a result of several factors, including uncertainties surrounding Brexit, 
changing consumer behaviour patterns and the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic. 
At present , some social distancing restrictions remain in place, and struggling 
town centres are being faced with the loss of many retail, leisure and hospitality 
businesses.   
11.2.9  The full economic impact of the Covid -19 lockdowns remai ns uncertain.  It is 
however widely accepted that wholesale change is needed to reboot our towns 
and make them once again vibrant and successful. This will be achieved through a 
number of interventions, including the Government’s Levelling up Agenda, 
succe ssful funding bids and local community and stakeholder buy in and 
commitment to deliver the local solutions needed. A Covid -19 Supplement of the 
Grimsey Review for town centres, titled ‘Build Back Better’ was published in 2020. 
The report, written by retai l expert Bill Grimsey, sets out what he considers needs 
to be done for town centres and high streets to thrive post Covid -19 and 
rediscover their community purpose45 
11.3 Copeland Retail Study  
11.3.1  The Council  commissioned the joint West Cumbria Retail and Leisure Study with 
Allerdale Borough Council in early 2020. Since the findings of this study, a number 
of national changes have occurred  as outlined at the start of this chapter . This has 
resulted in CBC comm issioning a review of the study in Spring 2021.  
11.3.2  The Retail Study is an important piece of evidence to inform the retail policies 
within the Local Plan and contribute towards making improvements within 
Copeland’s town centres. The study provides town centr e health checks and

 identifies the future need for town centre development, including the 
requirement for convenience and comparison goods and leisure provision.  
11.3.3  A number of key findings arose from the 2020 Retail Study and subsequent 
update. These are as follows46:  
• It is estimated that between 1,700 and 2,000sqm  of additional convenience 
floorspace will be required across the borough up to 2038.  
• Findings of the Study conclude that there is not an additional requirement for 
comparison goods floorspace, an d there is potential for an oversupply by the 
end of the plan period. However, opportunities have been identified for the 
reconfiguration of comparison floorspace to meet future demand, for example, 
by providing larger sized units with parking for the coll ection of large goods.  
• In terms of leisure, findings of the Study suggest that the borough could 
support the addition of 5.8 cinema screens and a 5 lane ten pin bowling venue 
by 2038. It also emphasises the demand for unique and diverse local 
experiences and identifies that flexible sites may be appropriate in the future, 
allowing for activities such as crazy golf, games rooms and escape rooms.  
11.3.4  Local Plan policies support a flexible approach to new retail, leisure and town 
centre development that can adap t to rapid change and support the vitality of the 
town centre. Policy R1PU sets out the strategic approach towards such 
development in town centres and villages set out in the Retail Hierarchy (Policy 
R2PU) and provides the o verarching criteria in supporti ng the vitality and viability 
of the centres.  
 
Strategic Policy R1PU: Vitality and Viability of Town Centres and Villages within the 
Hierarchy  
 
 
 
The Council will seek to enhance the vitality and viability of town centres and villages 
identified in the settlement hierarchy by working with partners and applicants to:  
 
• Support a network of healthy, vibrant and resilient town centres, comprised of a 
diverse range of retail, residential, leisure and other main town centre uses, that 
can eff ectively respond to change  
• Support regeneration projects, refurbishment of buildings and public realm 
improvements within the retail hierarchy

 • Ensure the needs for retail and other main town centre uses are met in full.  
Ensuring that, taking account of commitments as of 1st April 2021 , sufficient 
provision has been made to meet the forecast convenience retail capacity within 
the borough up to 2038  
• Ensur e that proposals for new development are consistent in terms of scale and 
function with the size and role of the centre   
• Support the development of stores for the sale of comparison goods and town 
centre leisure development within identified opportunity si tes where the impact 
threshold and sequential test is met  
• Encourage new national retailers to relocate to Copeland’s towns, and support 
and enhance the independent offer.  
• Broaden the offer of Copeland’s town centres to increase footfall, and encourage 
extended lengths of stay, for both the daytime and evening economy.  
• Support proposals for improved digital connectivity and transport improvements 
in and around the town centre boundaries  
• Support proposals for new and improved public realm, including public o pen 
space, landscaping and other outdoor community areas  
 
The extents of Town centre boundaries are defined at Appendix B. 
 
Where appropriate, development should also accord with the Copeland Conservation Area Design Guide   
https://www.copeland.gov.uk/content/conservation -area -design -guide   
11.4 Hierarchy of Centres  
11.4.1  The NPPF, paragraph 86,  requires Local Plans to define a network and hierarchy 
of town centres and promote their long -term vitality and viability.  The 
development strategy set out in Policy DS3PU directs the main focus of 
development to the most sustainable locations within the borough.  
11.4.2  As Copeland’s Principal Town, Whitehaven provides the main hub of retail, leisure 
and service uses within the borough.  Findings of the 2020 Retail Stu dy health 
check identify Whitehaven as a ‘ vital and viable centre that meets resident’s day 
to day needs, with a strong choice of convenience stores .’ The three Key Service 
Centres of Cleator Moor, Egremont and Millom provide convenience and 
comparison sho pping, and a range of other services to serve the settlement and 
surrounding communities.  
11.4.3  Paragraph  84 of the NPPF  supports a prosperous rural economy. As a largely rural 
borough, we understand the importance of supporting the sustainability of our 
rural c ommunities and in respect to retail and leisure uses, supporting the 
creation and retention of accessible services and facilities to meet the needs of 
local residents.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
108 
 11.4.4  Policy R2PU sets out the role and function including the type of retail, 
residential47, leisure and main town centre development that is appropriate in 
each tier of the settlement hierarchy, in line with policy DS3PU.  
 
Strategic Policy R2PU : Hierarchy of Town Centres  
 
 
 
The Borough Council will support retail, residential, leisure and other main town centre 
development where it is appropriate to its role, function and position within the 
settlement hierarchy as set out in the following table : 
 
Designation  Role and Function  
Principal Town  • Principal focus of new and enhanced retail ,

47 N.B -Residential development requirements are set out in the Housing Chapter.  For town centre development this is 
generally directed at first  floor accommodation above retail units and apartment blocks.   In terms of apartments, the 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) has identified a need for purpose built extra care housing, student and 
keyworker accommodation that would benefit from a  town centre location.    
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021

 11.5 Whitehaven Town Centre  
11.5.1  Whitehaven is the main focus for retail and leisure growth in the borough. 
Whitehaven o ffers a unique experience to its residents and visitors; with a variety 
of attractions including the harbour and marina, Georgian architecture, historic 
buildings and conservation areas, visitor attractions including The Beacon 
Museum , the Rum Story , a cin ema and bingo hall  and a range of independent and 
national retailers, cafes, bars, bistros.  
11.5.2  Findings of the 2020 Whitehaven Health Check (WHC), conclude that current 
vacancy rates are in line with national averages.  The town has fewer national 
retailers t han many towns including the neighbouring town of Workington, and 
offers a good choice of convenience and independent stores and businesses.   
11.5.3  A number of opportunities have been identified through the Whitehaven Health 
Check within the 2020 Retail Study, including:   
• Building on the transient workers trade  
• Building on and improving the quality of the leisure offer  
• Improving pedestrian movements and safety in the centre  
• Building on the town’s independent businesses offer to provide a destination 
which meet s the needs of local residents, transient workers and tourists  
• Building on Whitehaven’s coastal location, tourist offer and regeneration of 
the Georgian architecture  
11.5.4  Local Plan polices support a flexible approach for new development opportunities 
for the t own centre , making it a  destination for people to visit and enjoy.  
11.5.5  Policy R3PU sets out the requirements for development in and on the edge of the 
Whitehaven Town Centre Boundary.  
 
Strategic Policy R3PU: Whitehaven Town Centre  
 
 
 
Development that supports the role of Whitehaven Town Centre as the Principal Town 
will be encouraged and supported where it:  
 
• Appropriately reflects the Whitehaven Town Centre boundary and Primary 
Shopping Area in line with the approach set out in Policy R6PU 48

• Strengthens the historic attributes of the town centre;  
• Incorporates the strategic redevelopment schemes set out in the Whitehaven 
Masterplan  
 
Development on Opportunity  and regeneration sites will be encouraged where 
proposals meet the requirements of the sequential test and impact threshold.   
 
 
11.6 Key Service Centres  
11.6.1  The three Key Service Centres of Egremont, Cleator Moor and Millom offer the 
next level of provision belo w the Principal Town of Whitehaven. Findings of the 
Key Service Centre masterplans and visions identify that all centres need support 
to help diversify their offer and become sustainable centres which attract a 
higher number of visits from residents and to urists.  
11.6.2  The following paragraphs give information surrounding the context of each of the 
Key Service Centres. Table 11 then outlines the key strengths, challenges and 
opportunities faced by the key service centres, which has been informed by the 
2020 Reta il Study and 2021 update, as well as spatial frameworks and Town deal 
funding bid documents.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
111 
 Cleator Moor  
11.6.3  Cleator Moor is closely located to Ennerdale Water (which is a dark skies area) 
and offers a small range of independent stores, public houses and ta keaways and 
a recently built medical centre. It has a town square, with a range of historic 
buildings, of particular note is the former Town Hall and Carnegie Library. Most of 
the town centre falls within a conservation area, surrounded by open spaces and 
woodland.   
11.6.4  The Cleator Moor Spatial Framework (2018) includes a number of cross cutting 
initiatives which can contribute towards improving the town centre experience. 
One of these is an "Experience Cleator Moor" initiative that seeks to improve the 
quality and range of services in the town, facilitating opportunities to improve the 
visitor attractions and existing sport and leisure provision and activating outdoor 
spaces, particularly in the north east of the town linked to Copeland Bowls and 
Sports Centre and King George's Field pitches.   
11.6.5  Cleator Moor has recently been offered investment of £22.5 million as part of the 
Government’s Towns Deal Fund. This will provide financial opportunities for 
improvements to the town that will encourage increased fo otfall and new 
business start ups. Also includes opportunities directed at Low carbon, and 
changed economy for the whole towns with better connections and use of 
spaces.  The projects being funded by the Town Deal Fund are supported by the 
Town Improvement Plan (TIP) (2021), which highlights the strengths of Cleator 
Moor and ambitions for the future.  We will support development that 
contributes towards the delivery of projects outlined in the TIP and spatial 
framework.  
Egremont  
11.6.6  Egremont, dating back to medie val times, is home to the ruins of the Norman 
Egremont Castle and its surrounding grounds, which is a key landmark in the 
town. It has a distinctive historic layout based on a medieval street pattern with a 
large number of buildings from the Georgian perio d and earlier. The retail and 
leisure offer includes a regular market, and a range of local stores, public houses 
and a library.  
11.6.7  The Egremont Spatial Framework (2018) includes an "Experience Egremont" 
initiative and identifies opportunities to improve exis ting sports and leisure 
provision in the town filling identified gaps e.g. Gillfoot Park, football, bowls and 
public play areas. It also aims to improve the quality and range of hotel 
accommodation, provide market, event and exhibition space and seek 
oppor tunities to facilitate new visitor and leisure attractions.  
11.6.8  Egremont is a priority town in Copeland for the Borderlands Places programme 
and has been allocated £2.6 million funding. A Town Plan is currently being 
developed which will identify opportunitie s and projects where the investment 
will be best spent. This could help diversify the economic base of the town, 
resulting in resilience and sustainability.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
112 
 Millom  
11.6.9  The town of Millom is in close proximity to the Hodbarrow Nature Reserve and 
Port Haverigg  Watersports and Wake Park. It has a strong Victorian character, 
housing a distinctive clock tower building and features Millom Castle on its 
outskirts. St George’s Church forms a dramatic land mark, with Millom Park 
creating a significant green area in th e heart of the town. The retail and leisure 
offer includes  Millom Heritage & Arts Centre, Beggars Theatre, Millom Palladium,  
a range of local stores, public houses, library and a national chain convenience 
store that is a key anchor for the town.   
11.6.10  The Millom Spatial Framework (2018) includes an "Experience Millom" initiative 
which involves the promotion of the town's coastal e nvironment for water sports 
and related activities including investment in facilities and events. The Southern 
fringe of the town is identified as an opportunity to create a distinctive leisure, 
recreation or tourism development facilitating adventure spor ts. The framework 
also emphasises the aim to develop programmes to facilitate re -use and 
renovation of vacant and dilapidated buildings for community use and local 
enterprise.   
11.6.11  Millom and Haverigg, have recently been offered investment of £20.6 million as 
part of the Government’s Towns Deal Fund. This will provide financial 
opportunities for improvements to the town including public realm and 
regeneration of buildings. Also includes opportunities directed at low carbon, and 
a changed economy for the town wi th better connections and use of spaces. The 
projects being funded by the Town Deal Fund are supported by the Town 
Improvement Plan (TIP) (2021), which highlights the strengths of Millom and 
Haverigg and ambitions for the future. We will support developmen t that 
contributes towards the delivery of projects outlined in the TIP and spatial 
framework.

Strategic Policy R 4PU: The Key Service Centres   
 
 
 
Development that supports the roles of Cleator Moor, Egremont and Millom as the Key 
Service Centres, strengthens and diversifies their offer and improves vitality and viability 
will be encouraged, particularly where it:    
 
a) Is loc ated within the Town Centre boundaries of the Key Service Centres 
(Appendix B);  
b) Builds upon and addresses the strengths, opportunities and challenges 
associated with each town, as set out in Table 11; 
c) Provides convenience and comparison shopping, or range of other services, 
including leisure provision to serve the settlement and surrounding 
communities ;  
d) Encourages evening and night time uses that contribute to the vibrancy, 
inclusiveness and economic vitality of the centres ;  
e) Diversifies the range of residential accommodation in the key service 
centres, including the re -use of va cant floors over shops;    
f) Strengthens and diversifies the towns offer ;  
g) Provides improvements to public realm and signage ;  
h) Provides enhanced connectivity and town centre coherence, including 
providing active travel links to public transport hubs ;  
i) Provid es or enhances car parking provision where appropriate ;  
j) Promotes the reuse of Brownfield Land ;  
k) Results in the repair and renovation of derelict and historic buildings, 
particularly where they form part of a gateway into the town centre ; 
l) Protects and enha nce the special character and appearance of Conservation 
Areas within town centres designated for their special architectural or 
historic interest.  
 
 
 
11.7 Local Service Centres, Sustainable Villages and Rural 
Villages  
11.7.1  Retail areas beyond Key Service Centre level provide for small scale shopping and 
some local services. The Council encourages the longevity of community services 
and provision necessary to foster sustainable communities.  
11.7.2  Paragraph 85  of the NPPF  recognise s that sites to meet local business and 
community needs in rural areas may have to be found in areas outside of the 
settlement hierarchy, i.e. in the open countryside.  In these circumstances it will 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
115 
 be important to ensure that development is sensitive to its surroundings, does 
not have unacceptable impact on local roads and takes any opportunities 
available to make a location more sustainable. Development in the open 
countryside  must be 150sqm or less, a figure suggested by the consultants who 
produced the  2020 Retail Study and 2021 update. This figure is considered to be 
an adequate size for a modest farm shop or small office development, for 
example.  
11.7.3  Development should be directed to the most sustainable locations.  Policy R5PU 
sets out the criteria to support and encourage provisions such as village shops, 
post offices and public houses and sets out the criteria that will be considered for 
applicants that propose a change of use resulting in a loss of such provision. It 
also outlines the limited circumstances where retail and leisure development may 
be appropriate in an open countryside location.  
 
Policy R5PU : Retail and service provision in rural area s 
 
 
 
 
Local Service Centres, Sustainable Villages and Rural Villages   
Development will be encouraged where it provides small scale retail and service 
provision that will support and strengthen sustainability and local community viability 
and is appropriate in scale to its location . Strong emphasis will be placed on the 
retention of existing provision.  
 
Open Countryside  
 
Small scale farm diversification and retail and leisure schemes of 150sqm or less will be 
considered where:  
 
a) The development r espects the character of its setting and the countryside  
b) The development would not lead to unacceptable harm to biodiversity  assets   
c) It can be robustly justified that there is need for an open countryside location.  
 
Loss of retail and services in rural se ttlements  
The loss of existing village shops, post offices and public houses through new 
development requiring planning permission will only be permitted where it can be 
clearly demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Council, that:  
 
a) Its continued use as a village shop, post office or public house is no longer 
feasible, having had regard to appropriate marketing (over twelve months and 
at a price which reflects its use, condition and local market values), the demand 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
116 
 for the use of the site  or premises, its usability and the identification of a 
potential future occupier; or  
b) Sufficient alternative provision is, or will be as part of the proposal, made 
elsewhere which is equally accessible and of the same quality or better than the 
facility be ing lost.  
 
 
11.8 Whitehaven Town Centre – Primary Shopping Area  
11.8.1  The NPPF , para graph  86b, requires Local Plans to define the extent of town 
centres and primary shopping areas and make clear the range of uses permitted.    
11.8.2  Annex 2 of the NPPF identifies a Primar y Shopping Area (PSA) as the ‘ Defined area 
where retail development is concentrated .’  Conclusions of the Retail Study 
recommend that a Primary Shopping Area is identified in Whitehaven Town 
Centre to include; King Street, Chapel Street, Church Street, Low ther Street, 
Addison Street and New Street. ( See Appendix B)  
11.8.3  The Retail Study and subsequent update do not recommend that Local Plan policy 
imposes a threshold over the proportion of non -retail uses within the PSA, so that 
a level of flexibility is allowed whilst ensuring that the PSA continues to reflect the 
areas main function as Whitehaven’s predominant retail centre.  
11.8.4  Policy R6PU supports a flexible approach to uses within Whitehaven Primary 
Shopping Area to promote the vitality and viability of the town and to encourage 
residents and visitors to identify with Wh itehaven as a destination centre where 
people not only come to shop, but also to spend quality time on a regular basis.  
 
Policy R6PU: Whitehaven Town Centre Primary Shopping Area  
 
 
 
Whitehaven Primary Shopping Area is the focus for retail use in Copeland49. To support 
and promote the vitality and viability of the centre, proposals for other main town uses 
(i.e. non E (a) will be supported within the defined primary shopping area where:  
 
a) The proposal complements the retail function and makes a posi tive contribution 
to the vitality, viability and diversity of the town centre, in terms of maintaining 
well designed active, continuous frontages, appropriate signage and hours of 
opening; and  
 
49 Its boundaries are shown at Appendix B . 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
117 
 b) The proposal would not give rise either alone or cumulatively, to a detrimental 
effect on the character and amenity of the primary shopping area, or cause an 
unacceptable harm to the amenity of town centre residents; and  
c) Ground floor proposals for Hot Food Takeaways  will not lead to more than two 
such uses adjoining e ach other; and  
 
 
11.9 Sequential Test  
11.9.1  The NPPF , paragraph 87, states that ‘Local Planning Authorities should apply a 
sequential test to planning applications for main town centre uses50 which are 
neither in an existing centre nor in accordance with an up -to-date plan.’   
11.9.2  The sequential test requires applicants to satisfactorily demonstrate that the use 
cannot be located in a town centre . If this is not possible , then edge of centre 
sites  may be considered next.  Edge of centre for retail purposes as defined in the 
NPPF glossary is “ a location that is well connected to, and up to 300 metres from 
the primary shopping area.  For all other main town centre uses, a location within 
300 metres o f a town centre boundary . For office development, this includes 
locations outside the town centre but within 500 metres of a public transport 
interchange ”. 
11.9.3  The Local Plan identifies a range of Opportunity Sites within and on the edge of 
Whitehaven which ar e in need of regeneration. These are identified in policy 
E6PU. Such sites should be given consideration when carrying out the sequential 
test. The Retail Study has also identified two broad  Opportunity Areas outside but 
adjoining Whitehaven Town Centre wh ere there are opportunities for 
regeneration and where a mixture of uses would be supported.  
11.9.4  The sequential test will also apply where the proposal is for a conversion or 
removal of goods condition to ensure that any impact to existing businesses 
within th e defined centres is fully assessed.  This criteria has been tested in the 
West Cumbria 2020 Retail Study and 2021 update.  
11.9.5  When carrying out the sequential test, applicants must demonstrate flexibility on 
issues such as format and scale.  
 
  
 
50 See Glossary for definition  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
118 
  
Policy R7PU: Sequential Test  
 
 
 
 
Where an application is for a main town centre use which is neither in a town centre nor 
in accordance with the Development Plan, applicants must submit details to demonstrate 
that they have carried out a sequential test to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance 
with national policy. Locations within a town centre must be considered first, followed by 
edge of centre sites and only if no suitable sites are available will an out -of-town location 
be supported.  
 
In the excepti onal cases where new retail development will be supported in out of town 
locations, where the sequential test has been satisfied, the development must:  
 
• Avoid or mitigate against harm to the natural environment, including  biodiversity 
assets  
• Consider and  respect the existing landscape and built environment  
• Ensure that the highway network is capable of supporting additional traffic linked 
to the use  
 
This policy does not apply to small scale rural development such as offices although it can 
be applied to  proposals to create new unrestricted retail floorspace through conversion or 
the removal of restrictive goods conditions.  
 
 
11.10  Retail and Leisure Impact Assessments  
11.10.1  The NPPF , paragraph 90,  states that when assessing applications for retail and 
leisure development outside town centres, which are not in accordance with an 
up-to-date plan, Local Planning Authorities should require an impact assessment 
if the development is over a proportionate,  locally set floorspace threshold.  
11.10.2  Copeland has not previously set a local threshold and relied on the NPPF default 
threshold of 2,500sqm.  However, findings of the 2020 Retail Study and 2021 
update recommend that a local threshold is set to avoid inappro priate out of 
centre development . The threshold  also appl ies to proposals for a conversion or 
removal of goods condition, as well as proposals for new and extension to retail 
and leisure development including mezzanine floors.  
11.10.3  The locally set impact thres hold(s) will enable the Council to assess the potential 
harmful effect on the overall vitality and viability of a defined centre.  Any 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
119 
 assessment required will be proportionate, in accordance with Policy R8PU and 
should set out the potential trade diversio n impact assumptions.    
 
Policy R8PU: Retail and Leisure Impact Assessments  
 
 
 
An Impact Assessment must be submitted w here retail or leisure development is 
proposed outside of a defined centr e and the proposed floorspace is equal to or above 
the following levels . This applies to new  retail and leisure developments,  those creating  
retail or leisure  mezzanine floorspace and  proposals  that seek  to vary of restrictive 
conditions.  
• Whitehaven Town Centre and borough wide  (excluding the below)  – 500sqm 
(gross)  
• Within 800m of the respect ive Key Service Centre town centre boundary – 
300sqm (gross)  
 
The A ssessment  must be proportionate and  appropriate to the scale and type of retail 
or leisure floorspace proposed.  The assessment should  accord with  national planning 
policy  and the scope should be agreed between the applicant and Council prior to 
submission where possible .  
 
 
11.11  Non -Retail Development in Towns  
11.11.1  The Council recognises the changing dynamics of town centres, and the need to 
provide flexibility in its approach, to the change of use and development of non -
retail uses to ensure the future vitality of centres. Policy R9PU  should be applied 
to non -retail development in all town centres with the exclusion of Whitehaven 
Primary Shopping Areas. Town Centre boundaries are shown in Appendix B. 
 
Policy R9PU: Non -Retail Development in Town Centres  
 
 
 
Proposals for non-retail development in defined Town Centres (outside of Whitehaven 
Primary Shopping Area) will be encouraged where they widen its community, social, 
leisure, entertainment, food and drink, arts, tourism, business/office offer where they 
accord with the Development Plan and:  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
120 
  
a) The proposal complements the retail function and makes a positive 
contribution to the vitality, viability and diversity of the town centres in 
terms of maintaining active continuous well -designed frontages, appropriate 
signage and ho urs of opening;  
b) The proposal would not give rise, either alone or cumulatively, to a 
detrimental effect on the character and amenity of the town centres; and  
c) The proposal would not harm the amenit y of town centre residents . 
 
 
11.12  Hot Food Takeaways  
11.12.1  Healthy lifestyles and clean and tidy towns are supported by the Council. Policy 
R10PU sets out the detailed criteria that will be used to assess proposals for Hot 
Food Takeaways in the borough.  For proposals within the Primary Shopping Area 
please also se e Policy R6PU . 
 
Policy  R10PU : Hot Food Takeaways  
 
 
 
To protect public health and safety interests, local and residential amenity highways 
safety, and support the economic and social vitality and viability of the borough’s 
communities, hot food takeaways  will be permitted where:  
 
a) The proposal would not give rise to unacceptable environmental effects (related 
to matters including odour, fumes, filtration, noise and waste) which cannot be 
overcome; and  
b) The amenity of neighbouring uses and the character and appearance of the 
environment is not adversely affecte d; and  
c) It does not negatively affect the road safety in the local area.  
 
Where external works are required that are necessary to the function of the takeaway 
including ventilation, cooling and filtration systems details should be submitted with the 
proposa l and will be assessed and determined as part of the planning application.  
 
Appropriate conditions may be attached to planning permission to secure any other 
necessary mitigation measures having regard to surrounding uses including accessibility 
and proxi mity to sensitive uses including schools, character of the area and potential 
nuisance disturbances to residential areas, other uses and public health and safety 
interests.  Planning conditions may also include restrictions on the opening hours of 
new prem ises.

 12.2 Copeland’s Tourism Offer  
12.2.1  Since 2010, tourism has been the fastest growing sector in the UK in terms of 
employment51.  Britain is forecast to have a tourism industry worth over £257 
billion by 2025, providing approximately 10% of the UK GDP. This is anticip ated to 
support almost 3.8 million jobs, which is approximately 11%.  
12.2.2  The visitor economy is an important aspect of Copeland’s economy. Copeland 
Vision 2040  has identified around 3.6 million visitors per year  to Copeland , an 
increase of 20% over the past 5 years, and 47 m illion annual visitors to the Lake 
District as a whole.  It is estimated that direct visitor economy spend supports 
approximately 8% of Cumbria’s GVA. The visitor economy is however far from 
evenly spread across Cumbria, with roughly half of all tourism spend occurring in 
the LDNP (CLEP). It is important that opportunities are provides to maximise the 
potential of Copeland’s tourism industry outside of the Lake District National 
Park.  
12.2.3  A Cumbrian Visitor Survey ‘2018 Report for Cumbria n Tourism’ was published in 
October 2018, which compares data with figures from 2009. Key findings for 
Copeland include:  
• An increase of 5.3% in tourism days  
• An increase of 4.6% in tourist numbers  
• An increase of 5.1% in associated tourism revenue  
• Day visito r numbers increased by 4.6%, with the total day visitor spend 
increasing by 7.4%  
• Total revenue of Copeland’s tourism industry was a total of 175.9m, an  
increase of 32.4% since 2009  
 
12.2.4  The Local Plan area has a number of key tourism gateways and hubs that ar e focal 
points for tourism in the borough.  
Tourism Gateways  
12.2.5  Tourist gateways are defined as the key entry points into the borough. They are 
places or settlements through which tourist first visit on their way to a tourism 
experience / attraction or touris m region / destination Tourist gateways may not 
offer significant attractions themselves  but attract a significant level of tourist 
traffic .  
12.2.6  It is important to improve the safety, accessibility and attractiveness of these 
gateways to further encourage vis itors into Copeland. These are as follows:  
• Ennerdale Bridge  
• Coastal Path  
• Heritage Coast  
• A595  – southern entrance to Lake District Coast  
 
51  https://www.visitbritain.org/visitor -economy -facts  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
124 
 • A595  – northern entrance to Lake District Coast  
• A595 – Gosforth junction  
• Points where C2C route (and other national routes) enter the borough  
• Rail stations  
Tourism Hubs  
12.2.7  Tourist hubs are areas that attract a significant number of tourists and residents. 
These are some of the boroughs most attractive locations, where we wish to  
diversify the visitor economy further.  Development of these hubs will be carefully 
managed to avoid harm to the natural environment. Examples of hubs are as 
follows:  
• Hodbarrow Nature Reserve  
• Egremont Castle  
• Whitehaven Harbour and the surrounding area, i ncluding the Candlestick 
monument and Beacon Museum  
• St Bees and Whitehaven Heritage Coast  
• St Bees Beach  
• Seascale Beach  
• Haverigg Beach  
• Whitehaven Town Centre  
12.3 Opportunities and Challenges  
12.3.1  The Council is working on a number of projects and initiatives that a im to 
strengthen the tourism offer in Copeland. One key opportunity is raising the 
borough’s profile as the Lake District Coast, which aims to provide an exciting, 
alternative experience to the National Park. This is anticipated to help encourage 
more peop le to visit and stay in the part of Copeland outside of the National Park.   
12.3.2  The new branding of the ‘Lake District Coast’ will provide opportunities for new 
and improved leisure and tourism provision and entice visitors to the National 
Park to also visit Copeland thus improving the local economy. The brand of 
tourism in West Cumbria is built around 5 unique selling points:  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
125 
  
 
12.3.3  Existing and new markets are being targeted to develop a year round tourism 
product unique to the Lake District Coast that meets de mand, ensures a high 
quality environment and invests in people and business networks.  The Local Plan 
seeks to assist in meeting the Councils objectives.  
12.3.4  There is a great deal of potential for further development of Copeland’s tourism 
offer  both in terms of the holiday market and business tourism.   
12.3.5  The borough has a strong business tourism market with many contractors staying 
in the area during the week and returning home at the weekend. There is the 
potential to boost this further through the provis ion of conference facilities and 
improvements to the evening economy. A high -quality hotel within the centre of 
Whitehaven would also help support the sector  and would increase the number 
of longer stays52.  
12.3.6  A number of tourism opportunities are currently being developed , including:  
• Copeland Coastal Communities Fund Programme, (£1.6m secured through 
Government funding and Sellafield) targeted at growth of the visitor economy 
through developing Cumbria’s Hidden  Coast offer by setting up a Coastal Art 
Trail, a Coastal Challenge Route and a visitor hub complete with café at 
Silecroft beach (in the LDNP).  
• £399,000 Tourism Sector Development Programme, a summary of the 
programme includes: To strengthen the tourism offer along Lake District Coast, 
valleys and towns and increase employment and skills development in the 
tourism sector.  
• The Edge , a £3.6million coastal activities centre, received planning approval in 
2019 is expected to open in 2022. This will offer acco mmodation, cycle storage 
facilities and flexible activity spaces is set to become a spectacular western 
starting point for the world famous C2C cycle route, which is used by an 
average 12,000 cyclists each year.

 • A £300 million investment project at North Shore Harbour that will boost the 
local economy, further regenerate the harbourside and encourage higher levels 
of tourism in and around Whitehaven . Work has already begun on the 
regeneration of North Shore, with the recent transformation of the derelict 
former Bus Station into a flexible office space with a modern bar/ restaurant on 
the ground floor. In addition to this, work is currently underway by the 
Whitehaven harbour Commissioners  to improve the public realm of the 
harbour, with full renovation of th e two lighthouses anticipated to be 
completed in October 2021.   
• Improvements to active and sustainable travel, which can help to boost 
tourism numbers. More details of these schemes can be seen in the 
Connectivity chapter.  
• The Ironline project in Millom identified in the Town Improvement Plan that 
will help raise the areas profile and provide improved walking and cycling 
opportunities that make the most of the area ’s heritage and natural assets.  
12.3.7  Improving the tourism and leisure offer will help  provide ne w opportunities for 
our communities by providing  employment opportunities and leisure facilities for  
residents , encourag ing our young er residents  to stay living in Copeland.  
12.4 Tourism Development  
12.4.1  National planning policy places significant weight on the need  to support 
economic growth and productivity . It supports sustainable rural tourism that 
benefits business in rural areas, communities, visitors and which respects the 
character of the countryside.  
12.4.2  The Council will work positively and proactively with the  Lake District National 
Park Authority, Cumbria Tourism, National Trust, Forestry England and other 
tourism organisations and developers in marketing, co -ordinating and managing 
the development of the borough’s offer and to maximise the ‘Lake District Coas t’ 
brand.  
12.4.3  The Local Plan seeks to direct new tourism development to the most sustainable 
locations in the borough. The Development Strategy and Policy T1PU sets out the 
hierarchy for sustainable development for both visitor attractions and 
accommodation.   
12.4.4  In respect of overnight and longer stay visitor accommodation new build should 
be directed to the towns and Local Service C entres.  The development of 
overnight and long stay visitor accommodation below the Local S ervic e Centre 
tier should be restricted t o the diversification and change of use of existing 
buildings.  A more flexible approach may  be taken for temporary accommodation 
including caravan and campsites, (Policy T3PU) that have less impact on the local 
environment and character of an area .  
12.4.5  Propo sals outside of sustainable settlements that require existing place bound 
assets, such as water based or forest activities or are for a change or 
diversification of existing use will be considered where they provide valuable Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
127 
 economic, social and health ben efits and improve the tourism and life -style offer.   
Proposals will be assessed against their impact on the environment and local 
communities . 
 
Strategic Policy T1PU: Tourism Development  
 
 
 
The Local Plan supports the creation, enhancement and expansion  of tourist attractions, 
new build visitor accommodation and infrastructure in line with the settlement hierarchy.  
 
All tourism development must be of an appropriate scale, located where the environment 
and infrastructure can accommodate the visitor impact, and where it does not result in 
unacceptable harm to environmental assets or the character of the area.  
 
Proposals for tourism development outside of defined settlements will be supported 
where:  
 
• The proposal is for a specific activity or function that requires a location that cannot be 
accommodated for within the Principal Town, Key Service Centres or Local Service 
Centres; or  
• The proposal enhances the borough’s existing place bound assets; or  
• The proposal is for the change of use, or dive rsification of an existing building, to 
provide overnight or longer stay visitor accommodation; or  
• The proposal is for a farm diversification scheme in a rural area that will provide or 
enhance tourist provision.  
 
 
12.4.6  Copeland has a stretch of coastline  that runs along its western edge with views 
out towards the Irish Sea and Scotland.  Much of it is an area of natural beauty, 
home to wildlife and includes the St Bees and Whitehaven  Heritage Coast.  
Criteria for the undeveloped coast is set out in policy  N8PU in the Natural 
Environment Chapter.  Certain types of development that enhance Copeland’s 
tourism offer may be acceptable along  the developed coastline are set out in 
Policy T2PU . 
  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
128 
  
 
Policy T2PU: Coastal Development  along the Developed Coast  
 
 
 
Opportunities for tourist development in close proximity to the coastline (with the 
exception of areas designated as undeveloped coast) of an appropriate type and scale 
will be supported where:  
 
a) The proposal provides improved accessibility to the coastal walkways and cycle 
routes; or  
b) The proposal improves the quality and range of holiday accommodation 
including overnight tourist provision; or  
c) Gateways and/or hubs are enhanced or created; or  
d) Opportunities are provided to enhance  the offer for both onshore and offshore 
visitors, at Whitehaven Harbour including provision for the docking of cruise 
ships;  
e) The proposal provides opportunities to enhance the tourism offer in south 
Copeland, or  
f) The proposal provides enhancement to the L ake District Coast  
 
In all circumstances development should be of an appropriate scale located where the 
environment and infrastructure can accommodate the visitor impact, and where it does 
not result in unacceptable harm to environmental assets. All devel opment should 
ensure local landscape character is maintained and avoid detrimental impacts on setting 
of Heritage Coast  
 
 
12.5 Caravans and Camping Sites for Short -Term Letting  
12.5.1  Policy T3PU sets out a detailed approach for assessing proposals for the provision 
and enhancement of caravan and camping sites. The development of caravan and 
camping sites has potential to enhance the  borough’s  overnight and longer stay 
tourism offer . Policy T3PU provides the relevant development management

Policy T3PU: Caravans and Camping Sites for short -term letting  
 
 
 
Proposals for new static, touring caravan, and camping sites will be supported for short 
term (28 day) holiday letting where:  
 
a) The site is sustainably located within or adjacent to a settlement identified 
within the Settlement Hierarchy; or  
b) Where the proposal is to support the diversification of agricultural or other land -
based rural businesses and public houses or drinking establishments, and it is 
demonstrated that the development wi ll make an ongoing contribution to 
sustain the long -term future of the business that is diversifying.  
 
Proposals for intensifications within, or extensions to existing caravan or camping sites 
for short term holiday letting will be supported where the prop osed development area 
is located on, or immediately adjacent to existing sites.  
 
Proposals for both new sites and intensifications within and extensions to existing sites, 
shall:  
  
i. Be of a scale and design appropriate to the locality;  
ii. Not result in unacce ptable adverse impacts upon landscape character or result in 
unacceptable visual harm;  
iii. Not result in unacceptable biodiversity impacts  
iv. Be effectively screened by existing landform , trees or planting; and,  
v. Not give rise to unacceptable impacts on the high way network or highway 
safety.  
 
Proposals for year -round use or occupancy of caravan and camping sites will be 
supported where they will not materially affect the character, appearance and amenity 
of the locality.  
 
Planning conditions will be utilised to r estrict the use of the accommodation to short 
term holiday letting and prevent occupation as a primary or main residence.

 13.1 Housing: Headlines  
 Strengths
In 2018 Copeland was named the 2nd
happiest place to live in Britain by an Office 
of National Statistics well -being survey.
Copeland is one of the most affordable 
districts to live in the country –with low 
house prices and the 6thhighest average 
wages in UK
Rents in Copeland for all property sizes are 
below the national and regional average
Strong, resilient and 
welcomingcommunities
Existing community projects such as the 
Well Whitehaven project
Challenges
Predominantly rural borough with over 65% 
of residents living within our four towns
Some affordability issues within Rural 
Whitehaven area
High proportion of ageing stock in the 
borough's urban areas
Relatively high proportion of empty homes, 
particularly within the four town 
Need to ensure growth on the edges of 
settlements does not hinder regeneration 
aims
Opportunities
Opportunity to direct more development to 
more rural villages than at present to 
support communities
Opportunity to provide a good range of 
attractive housing allocations and sites to 
meet need, increse choice and support 
economic growth
Opportunity to use developer contributions 
towards bringing empty properties into use 
as affordable housing
Opportunities to attract contractors who 
currently stay in the Borough during the 
week but live elsewhere to relocate here

 13.2 Meeting Copeland’s Housing Needs  
13.2.1  Copeland Borough is a self -contained housing market however there are 
significant differences between different parts of the borough in terms of its 
housing offer.  
13.2.2  The borough has a population of around 68,700 people. It contains four towns, 
Cleator Moor, Egremont, Millom and Whitehaven which, with a population 
approaching 24,000, is the principal town. The population has been falling and 
ageing with the percentage of over 65s increasing by 24% between 2006 and 
2016. The Local Plan has a key role to play in  reversing the trend of population 
loss, particularly the out -migration of younger residents.  
13.2.3  Approximately 35% of Copeland Borough's residents live in rural areas. It is 
therefore important to recognise their needs as well as those of residents who 
live w ithin our towns.  
13.3 Improving the Housing Offer  
13.3.1  Ensuring the borough has a range of attractive, high -quality housing to suit a 
variety of changing needs is essential to provide choice, attract new residents to 
the area and ensure our most vulnerable residents  have access to the specialist 
housing they need to enable them to live healthy, happy lives.  
13.3.2  Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership’s 2020 Annual Report53 recognises the role 
housing can play in supporting economic growth and preventing workforce 
decline, h ighlighting the importance of delivering “ the right product, in the right 
place at the right time .” The single most important reason for people moving into 
Copeland in the past 5 years has been to take up employment in the borough54. 
13.3.3  The Council’s Housing Needs Study (HNS), produced in 2020, states that estate 
agents in the area identify a buoyant housing market and a strong and growing 
lettings market that benefits from a relatively “transient” element of the local 
population based ar ound Sellafield and hospital workers.  
13.3.4  This is supported by the Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2021 that 
identifies, through discussions with key employers in the borough, that a lack of 
suitable housing is impacting upon the recruitment and re tention of workforce.  
13.3.5  Interest from developers has been growing, this presents a real opportunity to 
improve the housing offer. Policy H1PU below sets out how the Council will work 
with developers, other partners and stakeholders, to do this over the Plan  period.

Strategic Policy H1PU: Improving the Housing Offer  
 
The Council will work with stakeholders, partners and communities to make Copeland a 
more attractive place to build homes and live by:  
a) Allocating a range of deliverable and attractive housing sites to meet local needs and 
aspirations and ensuring they are built at a high standard, whilst protecting the amenit y of 
existing residents;  
b) Supporting the renewal and improvement of the borough’s existing housing stock and 
finding innovative ways to bring empty properties back into beneficial use;  
c) Supporting proposals which aid the regeneration of the wider residential environment;  
d) Approving housing development on appropriate windfall sites  within the settlement 
boundaries  where it accords with the Development Plan ; and  
e) Ensuring a consistent supply of deliverable housing sites is identified through an annual 
Five-Year Housing Land Supply Position Statement .  
 
 
13.4 The Housing Requirement  
13.4.1  One of the key aims of the Government is  to significantly boost the supply of 
housing across the UK and the Council will work with the development industry in 
order to help achieve this.  
13.4.2  Under national policy, Local Planning Authorities are required to identify their 
housing  needs over the full plan period through their Local Plans. They are also 
required to identify sufficient deliverable and developable sites to meet such 
needs.  
13.4.3  Once the Local Plan is adopted, the Council is also required to demonstrate a 
rolling 5 -year su pply of deliverable housing sites in order to meet the identified 
needs. If they are unable to do so Local Plan policies relating to the supply of 
housing will be rendered out of date leading to pressure to allow developments in 
less sustainable locations.   
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
134 
 Standard Methodology for Calculating Housing Need  
13.4.4  The Government has produced a standard methodology55 for calculating housing 
need56 at Local Authority level. The NPPF states that planning authorities should 
follow this methodology “ unless circumstances warrant an alternative approach ”.  
13.4.5  The standard methodology uses 2014 based ONS household projections over a 
period of 10 years and ap plies an adjustment for affordability where the 
affordability ratio (earnings to house prices) is above 457. Using the current year 
2021 as a starting point, the standard methodology identifies a housing need for 
only 8 dwellings per year in Copeland58. It must be noted however that these 
projections are based upon past trends and don’t take into consideration policy 
interventions.  
13.4.6  Planning Policy Guidance: Housing and Economic Needs Assessment (PPG) states 
that a Local Plan is considered sound where it me ets this minimum need figure. It 
also states that the Government will support aspirational councils who wish to set 
their housing requirements higher than the standard methodology figure in the 
following circumstances:  
• Where they have growth strategies for  the area that are likely to be 
deliverable, for example where funding is in place to promote and facilitate 
additional growth (e.g. Housing Deals);  
• Where there are strategic infrastructure improvements planned that are likely 
to drive an increase in the h omes needed locally; or  
• If they are an authority agreeing to take on unmet need from neighbouring 
authorities, as set out in a statement of common ground  
 
Previous Delivery  
13.4.7  The PPG notes that  
“There may, occasionally, also be situations where previous lev els of housing 
delivery in an area, or previous assessments of need (such as a recently -produced 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment) are significantly greater than the outcome 
from the standard method. Authorities will need to take this into account when 
considering whether it is appropriate to plan for a higher level of need than the 
standard model suggests .”

inimum_annual_local_housing_need_figure_calculated_using_the_standard_method.pdf  
56 The Government recently consulted on Changes to the Current Planning System document which introduces a new 
methodology for calculating housing need. Its progress will be moni tored and considered as the Local Plan progresses.  
57 The ratio for Copeland identified in the SHMA 2021 is 2.62 therefore no adjustment is required.  
58 Based on the 2014 -based household projections for England which predicts 30934 households in Copeland 2031 and 
30850 households in 2021, equating to 84 additional households over the ten year period or 8.4 per year.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
135 
 13.4.8  In terms of previous levels of housing delivery, this is currently judged against the 
housing requirement in the Core Strategy. The Core Strategy contains a 
requirement for a minimum of 230 dwellings per year to be delivered over the 
first 5 years of the Plan period with an uplift to provide an additional 30% on top 
of the basic requirement, equating to 300 dwellings per annum in the latter 10 
years . This was to support the construction and operation of a new nuclear power 
station at Moorside base on job creation estimates at the time.  
13.4.9  Table 1 2 below shows how many net additional dwellings have been delivered 
annually over the past 10 years against this requirement. The highest number of 
dwellings delivered in a single year was 158 (in 2011/12), the least 98 (2020/21) 
and on average 133 new dwel lings were added to the overall supply each year. 
The number of net additional dwellings increased between 2018/19 and 2019/20, 
it then fell the following year due to a large number of demolitions (58) on a 
single site.  
13.4.10  The number of dwellings delivered o ver the past ten years has never met the 
current housing requirement identified in the Core Strategy. This could be for a 
number of reasons; the target may be too high, the Core Strategy may not have 
allocated sufficient attractive and developable sites or  the economy may not have 
been able to support the delivery of additional houses.  
13.4.11  The average number of homes delivered is however significantly greater than the 
standard methodology need figure and is similar to, but slightly below, to the 
proposed housi ng requirement , identified in the SHMA,  of 146 dwellings per 
annum. This suggests that the requirement is deliverable and by planning for 200 
dwellings per annum, the Council is being aspirational and the Plan is positively 
prepared.

 Strategic Housing Market Assessment  
13.4.12  A SHMA was produced in 2019 to support the Local Plan Preferred Options Draft. 
The SHMA 2019 used an alternative methodology to the standard one for 
calculating housing need and analysed a range of different scenarios based upon 
demographic trends and employment projections. It recommended that 140 
dwellings per annum are delivered across the Plan period 2017-2035 to meet 
housing needs,  but stated that 200 dwellings per annum should be planned for to 
provide choice and support economic growth.  
13.4.13  A SHMA Update was produced earlier this year that takes into account more up -
to-date economic projections from the Employment Development Needs 
Assessment (EDNA). This covers the slightly different Local Plan period 2021 -2038 
and uses a slightly different methodology for identifying need.  
13.4.14  Table 13 shows the level of housing need that would be required under the four 
main scenarios considered in the SHMA 2021. All use the 2014 sub -national 
population projections as a starting point. The document recommends that a 
slightly higher requirement of 146 dwellings is taken forward through the Plan 
and that the growth figure of 200 dwellings per annum continues to be used 
(rounded up from the 191 growth -scenario midpoint).

Source: Figure 1 Strategic Housing Market Assessment Update 2021  
13.4.15  As can be seen from the table above, the SHMA 2021 also identifies a higher 
figure of 278 dwellings per annum. This is the amount of housing that would be 
required if all of the  additional  jobs linked to all of the aspirational, strategic 
economic developm ents identified in the EDNA came forward within the plan 
period. This is highly unlikely to happen, particularly before the Local Plan is 
reviewed, particularly as a number of the projects are dependent upon 
Government funding. This figure has therefore be en discounted as it is not 
considered to be realistic or deliverable (particularly when compared to past Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
137 
 trends).Planning for such a figure may also lead to the flooding of the market 
during the early stages of the plan period to the detriment of the devel opment 
strategy.  
Housing Needs and Aspirations Summary  
13.4.16  The housing need figure produced using the standard methodology does not 
provide a true reflection of housing need in the borough. It is significantly lower 
than the number of homes that have been delivered on average over the past 10 
years, and in each in dividual year. If this 
figure was taken forward as a housing 
requirement in the Local Plan would 
lead to further population loss and 
economic decline as there would be 
insufficient resident population to 
support anticipated jobs growth , or 
even the existin g number of jobs .  
13.4.17  A housing requirement this low would 
also be contrary to the Council’s Growth 
Strategy, Housing Strategy, Corporate 
Strategy and the NPPF which requires 
Local Authorities to be aspirational. 
Responses received to the Local Plan 
Issues an d Options and Preferred 
Options consultations also indicate that 
the development industry would not 
support a housing requirement based upon this figure.  
13.4.18  In terms of the alternative options, the SHMA recommends a housing 
requirement of 146 dwellings per a nnum and supports a growth figure of 200 
dwellings per annum. Any additional housing over and above the 200 figure is 
unlikely to be required over the plan period a nd could only be justified if all of the 
additional aspirational projects identified in the Employment Development Needs 
Assessment came forward which the SHMA notes “ is unlikely to happen during 
the plan period .” 
13.4.19  The figures considered are all shown in Figure 8 below where they can be seen 
against the average number of net additional dwellings o ver the previous 10 
years.  
 
 It is vital that we enable the right 
amount and type of housing in the 
borough  order to reverse the trend 
of population decline and ensure 
that we have a sufficiently sized 
workforce to support loc al 
businesses and create further 
opportunities for education and 
training for our residents. This in 
turn will help create economic 
growth and reduce deprivation 
levels in the borough . 
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
138 
 Figure 8: Housing Figures Compared  
 
 
13.4.20  The figure of 146 dwellings per annum (increased slightly from the 140 dpa in the 
Preferred Options Draft) is therefore considered to be the most appropriate 
representation of housing need and will therefore be used when calculating the 
rolling 5 year hous ing land supply. The housing requirement is not a ceiling 
however and in order to be aspirational and support further economic growth in 
the Borough above the baseline, sufficient land is identified within this Plan to 
provide 200 dwellings per year on ave rage over the Plan period. This is through a 
combination of allocated sites, sites with extant planning permission, housing  
completions since the start of the Plan period and future windfalls60 as identified 
in the Housing Trajectory ( Appendix E). 
 
Strateg ic Policy H2PU: Housing Requirement  
  
 
 
The Housing requirement is for a minimum of 2 ,482 net additional dwellings (an average 
of 146 dwellings per annum) to be provided between 2021 and 2038. This figure will be 
used when calculating the five -year supply of deliverable housing sites in the borough.  
 
In order to plan positively and support employment growth over the Plan period, the 
Plan identifies a range of attractive allocated housing sites, which when combined with

 future windfall developmen t, previous completions and extant permissions, will provide 
a minimum of 3 ,400 dwellings (an average of 200 dwellings per annum) over the Plan 
period.  
 
Housing delivery will be monitored closely and where development is not coming 
forward as anticipated, interventions will be sought as set out in Policy H3PU . 
 
 
13.5 Housing Delivery  
13.5.1  It is important that housing delivery is monitored regularly to ensure sites are 
coming forward as anticipated and housing needs are met. Appendix E contains a 
housing trajectory w hich demonstrates how much housing is anticipated to come 
forward on allocated  sites, sites with planning permission  and windfall sites over 
the plan period  using the 1st April 2021 as a base date . 
13.5.2  The Council will review its 5 -year housing land supply pos ition annually as well as 
reviewing the location and type of housing coming forward through the Annual 
Monitoring Report.  
13.5.3  Policy H3PU below identifies measures that will be put in place if monitoring 
shows that housing is not being delivered as expected, to ensure that any delays 
do not hinder the delivery of the Local Plan as a whole. The measures set out in 
the Policy below align with those identified in national planning policy.  
 
Strategic Policy H3PU: Housing Delivery  
 
 
 
Housing delivery against the trajectory will be monitored closely and where 
development is not coming forward as anticipated, the following interventions will be 
sought.  
 
1) If delivery is not progressing on an individual housing allocation as set out in the 
trajecto ry the Council will engage with the developer to identify the reasons for 
this and potential solutions.  
2) If delivery falls below 95% of the Housing Delivery Test figure then an Action Plan 
will be produced in collaboration with the development industry.  
3) If evidence suggests that, at the end of any monitoring year, housing delivery has 
exceeded expectations within the Sustainable Rural Village and Rural Village tiers 
in the settlement hierarchy which may put the overall Development Strategy at 
risk the Coun cil will consider carrying out a full/partial Local Plan Review.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
140 
 4) At the end of any monitoring year following the Local Plan’s adoption, if the 
Council is unable to demonstrate a 5 -year supply of deliverable housing sites, 
plus the required buffer, the tilt ed balance will be engaged in accordance with 
the NPPF (or any document which replaces it).  
 
 
13.6 Distribution of Housing  
13.6.1  New housing development can help regenerate our towns, support rural services 
and help maintain communities. It is important that new housing development is 
directed to the parts of the borough where people need and want to live, taking 
into account sustai nability objectives.  
13.6.2  The Development Strategy chapter identifies the proposed settlement hierarchy. 
It divides the borough’s four towns and 2 4 of its villages (or village clusters) into 5 
distinct tiers, with the most sustainable settlements located at th e top. The 
hierarchy has changed since the Preferred Options Draft; the reasoning behind 
this is set out in the Development Strategy and Settlement Hierarchy Update 
2021. Where a settlement has moved up or down a tier this is noted in Policy 
H4PU with an a sterisk.  
13.6.3  When determining how much housing development should be directed to each 
tier, consideration was given to the number and type of services they contained 
and their links with neighbouring settlements in terms of pedestrian routes and 
public transpo rt provision. Further information regarding this process can be 
found in the Development Strategy Topic Paper Update 2021.  
13.6.4  Policy H4PU sets out how many dwellings will be sought within each tier of the 
hierarchy in order to meet the baseline housing requir ement of 2 ,482 dwellings 
across the borough over the Plan period. It also sets out how many additional 
dwellings will be required in each tier in order to support the more aspirational 
growth target of 3 ,400 dwellings.  
13.6.5  The majority of housing needed to mee t the baseline requirement and the 
growth figure is directed to Whitehaven, Cleator Moor, Egremont and Millom 
(70% combined), with the additional 30% divided between Local Service Centres, 
Sustainable Rural Villages and Rural Villages .  
13.6.6  The amount of devel opment directed to Whitehaven (40%) is smaller than that 
identified within the Core Strategy (45%). Whilst Whitehaven remains the 
Principal Town, the 5% has been spread over the villages in the lower tiers of the 
hierarchy to support the strategy which aim s to direct more growth to the rural 
villages than under the Core Strategy . It should be noted however that this is only 
a minimum target for Whitehaven and additional development over and above 
the 40% will be supported where it accords with the Developme nt Plan. Given the 
size and structure of the Whitehaven (which includes a number of opportunity 
sites) there is more scope for windfall development within its boundary than the Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
141 
 other settlements within the borough which may result in the 40% target being 
exceeded.  
13.6.7  The targets for Cleator Moor, Egremont and Millom along with the Local Service 
Centres are also minimum figures which can be exceeded where additional 
development accords with the Development Plan.  
 
Strategic Policy H4PU: Distribution of Housing  
 
  
 
The distribution of housing in the Borough will be broadly in line with the settlement 
hierarchy set out below. Additional housing will be supported within settlement 
boundaries of the towns, Key Service Centres and Local Service Centres whe re it accords 
with the Development Plan. The amount of housing identified within the Sustainable 
Villages and Rural Villages , required to support economic growth, is limited to the 
amount shown below.

13.7 Housing Allocations  
13.7.1  It is important that a variety of attractive and deliverable housing sites are 
allocated in the Local Plan to encourage developers and new residents to the 
borough, meet existing residents’ housing needs and aspirations and reverse the 
trend of population decline. Whilst the number of new homes delivered in the 
borough has consistently fallen below the housing requirement in the Core 
Strategy, there is increasing developer interest in the borough and the proposed 
housing requirement  identified in the SHMA U pdate 2021  is considered to be 
achievable.  
13.7.2  The Council has identified a range and choice of sites across the borough to meet 
the housing requirement over the plan period. These will be discussed further in 
the following paragraphs.  
13.7.3  The Strategic Housing La nd Availability (SHLAA) has identified a range of smaller 
deliverable and developable housing sites. The latest SHLAA document61 was 
produced in 2021 . 
13.7.4  Deliverable sites are those which are available now, offer a suitable location for 
development now, and w here development is achievable with a realistic prospect 
 
61 https://www.copeland.gov.uk/content /copeland -local -plan -2021 -2038 -evidence -base  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
143 
 that housing will be delivered on the site within five years. Developable sites are 
those that are in a suitable location for housing development with a reasonable 
prospect that they will be availabl e and could be viably developed at the point 
envisaged.  
13.7.5  When determining which of the deliverable and developable sites should be 
allocated for housing, consideration was given to constraints identified through 
evidence documents and site visits. Speciali st advice from key stakeholders 
including Cumbria Highways, the Lead Local Flood Authority and United Utilities 
was also given. Further details regarding the allocation site selection process can 
be found in the Development Strategy and Settlement Hierarch y Update 2021.  
13.7.6  Where there has been a choice of potential sites within a settlement, those that 
are the least constrained and have developer interest have been brought forward 
as allocations. The reasons for discounting alternative sites is set out in the 
Discounted Sites Document. Discounted sites can be considered when the Local 
Plan is being reviewed if the allocations have not come forward as anticipated.  
13.7.7  There are also a number of sites with extant permission that will also contribute 
to the housing su pply. Such sites are automatically considered to be deliverable 
unless evidence shows otherwise. The full list of sites that will be delivered across 
the Plan period can be found in Appendix E (Housing T rajectory). The Council is 
required to demonstrate th at 10% of its requirement will be met by sites no 
larger than one hectare62; the trajectory shows that this has been achieved . 
13.7.8  There are a number of settlements with no proposed allocations. This is because 
potential sites have not been put forward for ass essment or, where they have, 
there are uncertainties about their deliverability. In some cases , the settlement 
already has sufficient sites with planning permission to meet identified needs 
and/or the settlement boundary has been revised to allow developme nt to take 
place on windfall sites in the future . 
13.7.9  The housing allocations are listed in Policy H5PU below and further details, 
including maps showing their location are included in Appendix F (Housing 
Allocation Profile s). The Housing Allocations Profile d ocument provides general 
information about each site and identifies known constraints. Developers are 
strongly encouraged to give full consideration to the Profiles when developing 
their proposals and seek further advice from the Council and any appropriat e 
statutory consultees where required.  
13.7.10  An indicative yield is also shown in Policy H5PU. This is an estimation of how 
many dwellings are likely to be delivered based upon an assumed density of 
25dph  of the gross site area  to help ensure that the Local Plan’s growth 
aspirations are met. The densities used to calculate indicative yield will not 
necessarily be the density which is best suited to the site – this will be determined 
at planning application stage taking into acco unt issues such as viability, the

13.8 Broad Locations  
13.8.1  The SHLAA has also identified a number of potential Broad Locations, which go 
beyond individual sites and are large areas of land on the edges of settlements 
where potential long -term growth (10 years plus) could be considered. These are 
identified on the Proposals Map. Such Broad Locations will only be considered at 
the Local Plan Review stage if there are insufficient specific deliverable or Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
146 
 developable sites to meet the identified need. At this time, if required, a full 
consultation will take place and c onstraints will be identified to ensure the more 
appropriate location is taken forward.  Most are linked to a growth corridor on the 
edge of Whitehaven that would be created by the construction of the 
Whitehaven Relief Road.  
13.9 New Housing Development  
13.9.1  The aim of Policy H6PU below is to minimise any detrimental impacts of new 
housing development upon existing communities and to ensure development is 
built to a high standard, creating places where people will want to live and stay 
that have positive impac ts upon health and well -being.  
13.9.2  This policy applies to both windfall development and development on allocated 
sites. This policy should not be viewed in isolation and proposals will also need to 
comply with other policies within the Local Plan.  
13.9.3  Developers  should take opportunities to tie their developments into, and support, 
wider regeneration aspirations, for example by creating safe access routes 
between new and existing developments and providing open spaces and facilities 
that the wider area can enjoy where appropriate.  
13.9.4  Developers are also encouraged to create efficient housing that goes beyond the 
minimum energy efficiency standards set out within the Building Regulations 
where possible to reduce the impact of new developments on climate change.  
13.9.5  The Co uncil offers a pre -application advice service and welcomes developers to 
discuss housing schemes with them before applications are submitted. 
Developers should also take the opportunity to discuss proposals with Town and 
Parish Councils at the earliest sta ge so that any potential issues can be identified 
and overcome.  
 
Policy H6PU: New Housing Development  
  
 
 
Planning permission will be granted for housing development on allocated and windfall 
sites in principle providing that the following criteria are m et: 
 
a) The design, layout, scale and appearance of the development is appropriate to the 
locality.  
b) Development proposals clearly demonstrate that consideration has been given to 
surrounding natural, cultural and historical assets and local landscape characte r 
(including the impact upon the setting of the Lake District National Park and the 
Heritage Coast and its setting where appropriate);  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
147 
 c) An acceptable level of amenity is provided for future residents and maintained for 
existing neighbouring residents in te rms of sunlighting and daylighting;  
d) Privacy is protected through distance or good design;  
e) The development will have no unacceptable overbearing impact upon neighbouring 
residents due to its scale, height and/or proximity;  
f) The layout promotes active travel,  linking new development with existing footpaths 
and cycleways, where possible;  
g) Adequate external amenity space is provided, including for the storage of waste and 
recycling bins in a location which does not harm the street  scene, where possible;  
h) Adequate space for parking is provided, with preference given to parking spaces 
behind the building line to reduce street clutter, where possible; and  
i) The proposal does not constitute inappropriate development of a residential garden 
which would harm the character of the area.  
 
 
13.10  Housing Density and Mix  
Density  
13.10.1  The term density refers to the number of dwellings per hectare (dph). If densities 
are too low it can result in an inefficient use of land and where development is 
too spread out this can result in residents becoming isolated within their own 
communities. On the other hand, if densities are too high this can result in 
development cramming which can harm the character and appearance of an area 
and have a negative effect on health and well -being.  
13.10.2  Parag raph 12 4 of the NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should 
support developments that make effective use of land, taking the factors below 
into account:  
• the identified need for different types of housing and other forms of 
development, and the availabi lity of land suitable for accommodating it;  
• local market conditions and viability;  
• the availability and capacity of infrastructure and services – both existing and 
proposed – as well as their potential for further improvement and the scope to 
promote sus tainable travel modes that limit future car use;  
• the desirability of maintaining an area’s prevailing character and setting 
(including residential gardens), or of promoting regeneration and change; and  
• the importance of securing well -designed, attractive  and healthy places.   
13.10.3  Applying policies that are too prescriptive can make it difficult for a developer to 
meet specific identified housing needs e.g. if density requirements are too high 
this could prevent bungalow developments from coming forward as thes e tend to 
have a larger footprint than other house types. Such policies can also hinder Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
148 
 regeneration attempts as developers may limit the amount of space provided for 
public use or landscaping in order to meet the requirement.  
13.10.4  As the borough has a sufficie nt supply of housing sites, the Council is not required 
to include minimum density standards within the Plan64 and feel that the most 
appropriate approach is to allow developers to determine the most appropriate 
density for the site, taking into account th e issues referred to above . 
Housing Mix  
13.10.5  It is important that any new housing built within the borough is of the type, size 
and tenure that our communities need . The CLEP 2020 Annual Report identifies 
that a better and greater variety of housing is one of t he keys to attracting people 
into Cumbria.  
13.10.6  The proportion of housing by type varies across the borough. The part of 
Copeland within the National Park has a large proportion of detached homes 
(51%) whereas Millom has the largest proportion of terraces and f lats. Generally, 
homes in the rural areas of the borough are larger than those in the more urban 
areas, the average number of bedrooms is 2.78 in Whitehaven compared to 3.14 
in the parts of the borough in the National Park (HNS2020).  
13.10.7  The SHMA 202165 identifies the housing mix that is likely to be required over the 
plan period, taking into account the fact that the number of households with 
dependent children is projected to increase and the population is projected to 
age.  
13.10.8  The SHMA 2021 Update advise s that the focus for new market housing over the 
plan period should be 2 -3 bed properties. This is supported by the Housing Need 
Study (HNS). Care, however needs to be taken to ensure that an influx of new 3 
bedroomed properties does not result in an incre ase in the number of empty 3 
bedroomed homes, of which there are already a large proportion.

65 Chapter 9  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
149 
 13.10.9  The SHMA 2021 and HNS also identify a need for more specialised types of 
housing such as executive homes and key worker and student accommodation. 
The HNS notes that “ there is a case for continuing to invest in high -end, larger, 
market homes to appeal to both the highly paid sector mainly involved in the 
Sellafield supply chain and as a suitable offer for those the authority wants to 
attract as part of its strateg y to develop new high value technical and innovative 
industries .”  
13.10.10  The Council’s HNS notes that  key worker and student accommodation needs to 
be purpose built, high quality and furnished, although at present some of that 
identified need is being met throug h Houses in Multiple Occupancy, which are 
discussed further in and Policy  H13PU.  
13.10.11  There are opportunities to address this gap in the housing market by seeking 
funding to enable the development of modern, SMART66 residential 
developments to meet t he needs of  young professionals and post -graduate 
students. Such accommodation could include access to communal leisure and 
workspace. The importance of space where people can work from home has been 
highlighted by the Covid -19 situation and the Council encourages de velopers to 
include “touchdown points” within new housing developments to support 
homeworking where possible.  
13.10.12  The Council will update the SHMA and Housing Needs Study at least every 5 years 
to ensure the evidence underpinning the following policy remains u p-to-date. 
Only in exceptional circumstances will the Council accept any alternative evidence 
of need submitted as part of a planning application.  
 
Policy H7PU: Housing Density and Mix  
 
 
Developments should make the most effective use of land. When determining 
appropriate densities development proposals should clearly demonstrate that 
consideration has been given to the shape and size of the site, the requirement for 
public open space and landscaping, whether the density would help achieve appropriat e 
housing mix and help regeneration aims, the character of the surrounding area and the 
setting of the site.  
 
Applicants must also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Council, how their proposals 
meet local housing needs and aspirations identified in t he latest Strategic Housing 
Market Assessment (SHMA) and Housing Needs Assessment in terms of house type, size 
and tenure. Alternative more up -to-date evidence will be considered only in exceptional

Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
150 
 circumstances where a developer demonstrates to the Counc il’s satisfaction that the 
SHMA and Housing Needs Assessment is out of date.  
 
 
13.11  Affordable Housing  
13.11.1  The Council has made a commitment, through the Housing Strategy, to ensure 
that the housing needs of all of its residents are met by offering a balanced 
housing market and ensuring that any new growth benefits existing communities. 
One way of doing this is  to require developers to provide affordable housing.  
13.11.2  Affordable housing is that which is for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not 
met by the open market. A full definition is contained within the Local Plan 
Glossary. The NPPF requires councils to make sufficient provision for affordable 
housing and this is reflected in Policy H8PU which identifies how this will be 
delivered in the borough.  
13.11.3  Whilst Copeland was considered to be the most affordable borough in England in 
202167, the 2019 and 2021 SHMA  documents identifies a need for additional 
affordable housing. Affordability is calculated by dividing house prices by gross 
annual earnings. House prices, rent and land values are generally low in the 
borough whilst average incomes are relatively high . There is however an issue 
locally regarding access to capital and this limits resident’s ability to provide a 
deposit. The Housing Strategy acknowledges that incomes outside the Sellafield 
environment are low and recent welfare reforms are also likely to ha ve had an 
impact upon people being able to afford larger homes.  
13.11.4  The SHMA 2021, paragraph 31, states that:  
“Analysis does suggest that there are many households in Copeland who are being 
excluded from the owner -occupied sector (as evidenced by reductions in  owners 
with a mortgage and increases in the size of the private rented sector). This 
suggests that a key issue in the Borough is about access to capital (e.g. for 
deposits, stamp duty, legal costs) as well as potentially mortgage restrictions (e.g. 
where employment is temporary) rather than simply the cost of housing to buy.”  
 
13.11.5  A significant amount of the borough’s affordable and low -cost housing stock is 
also of the wrong configuration (e.g. with the main bathrooms off a bedroom), 
may be in poor condition and/or may not contain many of the features which 
attract people to modern housing developments such as gardens and parking 
space.  
 
67 In 2019 the average price paid for properties was estimated to be 2.8 times average annual earnings (Source 
ONS)   
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
151 
 13.11.6  The Housing Needs Study (HNS) supports the above findings. It acknowledges that 
whilst average earnings in Copeland  are the 6th highest in the UK, 21% of people 
who responded to the housing needs survey earned £18,000 or less per annum.  
13.11.7  The HNS notes that:  
“We modelled affordability based on an assumption that a household should not 
have to pay more than 33% gross in come on a mortgage. We found that 46% of 
newly forming households could not afford an average priced dwelling without 
spending more than this proportion and nearly a third could not afford a lower 
quartile home (a home priced in the cheapest quarter of thi s scale). The cheapest 
area, Cleator Moor, saw these figures drop to 25% and 15% respectively and in 
the most expensive area, Whitehaven Rural, they rose to 50% and 35% 
respectively ” 
Affordable Housing Provision  
13.11.8  The SHMA 2021 states that over the plan period 2021 -2038 there is a net deficit 
of up to 99 affordable homes (14 of these are within the National Park area) per 
annum across the whole of Copeland. This figure is slightly higher than the 
affordable housing need identified in the 2019 SHMA and Pre ferred Options Draft 
of the Local Plan. This is due to the fact that the Local Plan periods differ and 
there are small differences in the methodologies used68. 
13.11.9  It should be stressed that 99 affordable homes is not an affordable housing 
target; the amount o f affordable housing delivered is limited to the amount that 
can viably be provided. The evidence does however suggest that affordable 
housing delivery should be maximised where possible and Policy H8PU sets out 
how this will be achieved.

13.11.10  The NPPF, paragraph 65, requires at least 10% of homes within major 
developments (over 10 units) to made available for affordable home ownership 
as part of the overall affordable housing contribution from the site “ unless this 
would exceed the level of affordable housing required in the area, or significantly 
prejudice the ability to meet the identified affordable housing needs of specific 
groups ”. There are additional exemptions noted, including where the site or 
proposed development:  
• provides solely for build to rent homes  
• provides specialist accommodation for a group of people with specific needs 
(such as purpose built accommodation for the elderly, disabled or students 
etc) 
• is proposed to be developed by people who wish to build or commission their 
own homes; or  
• is exclusively for affordable housing, an entry level exception site or a rural 
exception site  
13.11.11  The NPPF also allows the use of a smaller threshold in designated rural a reas such 
as Copeland69. The Council’s Housing Needs Study identifies that housing in the 
Whitehaven Rural sub -area shown on Figure 9 below (which contains Arlecdon, 
Rowrah, Beckermet, Bigrigg, Calderbridge, Distington, Drigg, Holmrook, 
Frizington, Kirklan d, Ennerdale Bridge, Howgate, Lowca, Moresby Parks, Parton,

1985.   Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021

 Seascale, St Bees and Thornhill) is the most expensive in the borough and 
identifies this area as a priority for affordable housing development.

154 
 13.11.12  Given the above, Policy H8PU sets a requirement for 10% affordable homes to be 
provided on sites over 10 units in accordance with the NPPF, unless the site is 
located within the Whitehaven Rural area where the threshold is 5 units.  
13.11.13  Whilst Whitehaven Town is also identified in the Housing Needs Study as a 
priority for affordable housing, reducing the threshold from 10 units to 5 in this 
sub-area is likely to be unviable and could result in even less affordable housing 
coming forward than if the threshold wa s set at 10 units.  
13.11.14  If a site comes forward as two or more separate schemes/phases, of which one or 
more falls below the appropriate threshold, the Council will seek an appropriate 
level of affordable housing on each part to match in total the provision tha t 
would have been required on the site as a whole.  
Viability  
13.11.15  It is acknowledged that policies that require the provision of affordable housing 
can impact upon the viability of developments. The NPPF therefore requires Local 
Planning Authorities to take int o account the impact of such policies at an early 
stage when developing their Local Plans, reducing the need for viability 
assessments to be submitted at planning application stage.  
13.11.16  Paragraph 5 8 of the NPPF states “ Where up -to-date policies have set out t he 
contributions expected from development, planning applications that comply with 
them should be assumed to be viable. It is up to the applicant to demonstrate 
whether particular circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment at the 
application  stage. The weight to be given to a viability assessment is a matter for 
the decision maker, having regard to all the circumstances in the case, including 
whether the plan and the viability evidence underpinning it is up to date, and any 
change in site cir cumstances since the plan was brought into force .” 
13.11.17  The impacts of Policy H8PU, and other policies that require developer 
contributions, have been tested through a Stage 2 Viability Assessment70.  The 
Assessment has been developed through engagement with the development 
industry . 
13.11.18  In accordance with the NPPF, Policy H8PU does allow developers to provide 
alternative levels of affordable housing in exceptional circumstances. In such 
cases, a site specific viability study must be submitted whic h demonstrates that 
circumstances have changed following the adoption of the Local Plan rendering 
the site unviable unless requirements are reduced. Any such viability assessment 
submitted should reflect the recommended approach in national planning 
guidan ce, including standardised inputs, and should be made publicly available.

 Empty Homes  
13.11.19  There are over 1000 empty homes in the borough, over 800 of which are long -
term empty71. The Council has aspirations to reduce the number of empty homes 
and this is hig hlighted in theme 2 of the Housing Strategy, “Housing for Place”. 
The Strategy makes a commitment to:  
• “refresh and deliver the Empty Homes Policy 2016 -2018 and set a new two -
year action plan (2019 -2021) to target future work to strategically align with 
the four town spatial frameworks and levels of housing needed ” and  
• “Identify and secure inward investment, Government grants and contributions 
to provide capital funding to address empty homes ” 
13.11.20  At a national level, there are no restrictions limiting the numb er of developer 
contributions for affordable homes that can be pooled together. This potentially 
provides an opportunity to use contributions towards projects which improves 
the condition of empty properties, bringing them back into use as affordable 
housi ng. Such projects have the following benefits:  
• Reduces the number of empty homes in a settlement, improves the street -
scene and therefore has positive effects on residents’ health and well -being;  
• Increases the number of affordable houses in a settlement;  
• Improving and converting existing stock potentially has less of an 
environment impact than building new homes  
• Providing a contribution has less implications on development viability than 
providing affordable homes on site  
13.11.21  It is recognised howev er that it may not always be possible to adapt some of the 
existing stock to meet modern needs.  
13.11.22  The Council is currently considering the mechanisms involved in collecting 
contributions and how they could be best spent off site taking into account 
experienc e elsewhere. Further details will be set out within a Housing Technical 
Paper that will be produced prior to the Local Plan Submission Draft. Any 
contribution in lieu of on -site affordable housing should be spent in the same 
settlement as the development t o ensure that particular community benefits 
where possible72. 
13.11.23  Whilst the priority remains for affordable housing to be provided on site, in line 
with national planning policy, Policy H8PU allows for off -site provision of 
affordable housing or an appropriat e contribution in lieu, as a commuted sum, 
where this can be robustly justified and where the approach contributes to 
creating mixed and balanced communities . 
 
71 Copeland Housing Strategy  
72 Development must also still meet the three tests set out in the NPPF para 57  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
156 
 Tenure  
13.11.24  The NPPF promotes affordable home ownership over rental options, however it 
does acknowled ge that this could prejudice the ability to meet the identified 
affordable housing needs of specific groups.  Consideration has therefore been 
given to whether requiring all affordable housing to be available for home 
ownership, rather than rental, would h ave detrimental impacts upon the 
Borough.  
13.11.25  Page 96 of the SHMA 2021 notes that:  
“When looking at the need for AHO products, the analysis also suggests a need 
across the Borough, albeit (at 33 dwellings per annum) the need is lower than for 
rented housing. In interpreting this figure, it should however be noted that there 
could be additional supply from resales of market homes (below a lower quartile 
price) which arguably would mean there is a more limited need for AHO.  
 
Analysis does suggest that t here are many households in Copeland who are being 
excluded from the owner -occupied sector (as evidenced by reductions in owners 
with a mortgage and increases in the size of the private rented sector). This 
suggests that a key issue in the Borough is about  access to capital (e.g. for 
deposits, stamp duty, legal costs) as well as potentially mortgage restrictions (e.g. 
where employment is temporary) rather than simply the cost of housing to buy.  
 
The study also considers different types of AHO (notably First  Homes and shared 
ownership) as each could have a role to play. In Copeland, where house values are 
low and new  build prices look to be substantially higher it may be difficult to make 
forms of AHO genuinely affordable and therefore AHO products might be v iewed 
as helping to diversify the market rather than directly meeting an affordable 
need.”  
 
13.11.26  This is supported by the Housing Needs Study which states:  
“The development of a range of different types of affordable accommodation is 
indicated, primarily afford able rented, as suggested by the SHMA, but also forms 
of discounted, sub -market ownership that avoids the need to raise a deposit. 
Shared ownership was not considered appropriate because of low house prices – 
the issue is the deposit .” 
13.11.27  In May 2021 a new PP G73 was published relating to First Homes. This sets out 
that:  
“First Homes are a specific kind of discounted market sale housing and should be 
considered to meet the definition of ‘affordable housing’ for planning purposes. 
Specifically, First Homes are discounted market sale units which:  
a) must be discounted by a minimum of 30% against the market value;  
 
73 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/first -homes  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
157 
 b) are sold to a person or persons meeting the First Homes eligibility criteria (see 
below);  
c) on their first sale, will have a restriction registe red on the title at HM Land 
Registry to ensure this discount (as a percentage of current market value) and 
certain other restrictions are passed on at each subsequent title transfer; and,  
d) after the discount has been applied, the first sale must be at a  price no higher 
than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London).  
 
First Homes are the government’s preferred discounted market tenure and should 
account for at least 25% of all affordable housing units delivered by developers 
through planning obligations.”  
 
13.11.28  The First Homes PPG also provides detail on qualifying criteria (i.e. what makes 
something a First Home) and also a range of issues such as eligibility criteria.  
13.11.29  Policy H8PU strikes a balance between providing affordable home ownership 
options (as require d by the NPPF) and meeting the local demand for affordable 
rental properties. It is acknowledged that demand for intermediate housing (such 
as shared ownership) can vary with market conditions and as a result there may 
be occasions where an increased propo rtion of social rented housing will be 
acceptable. The Policy also accords with the First Homes PPG by requiring a 
proportion of affordable housing to be First Homes.  
 
Strategic Policy H8PU: Affordable housing  
 
 
 
On sites of 10 units or more (or of 0.5ha or more in size), or on sites of 5 units or more 
within the Whitehaven Rural sub -area74, at least 10% of the homes provided should be 
affordable as defined in the NPPF 2021  (or any document that replaces it) unless:  
 
1) this would exceed the level of af fordable housing required in the area as 
identified in the Housing Needs Study; or  
2) The development falls into an exemption category listed in the NPPF  
 
Where the proposal involves the re -use or redevelopment of vacant buildings, a 
proportionate reduction i n the affordable home contribution, equivalent to the existing 
gross floorspace of existing buildings, will be supported.  
 
The following tenure split should be applied to affordable housing developments:  
 
 
74 As identified in the Housing Needs Study 2020  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
158 
 • 40% discounted market sales housing, starter homes or other affordable home 
ownership routes75  (25% of these must meet the definition of First Homes).  
• 60% affordable or social rented.  
 
A financial contribution may be accepted in lieu of on -site affordable housing provision, 
to secure the equivalent provision off site where this is justified and helps create mixed 
and balanced communities. Where the number of empty homes within the settlement 
is above the national average, this contribution may be used to improve the standard of 
empty prope rties within that settlement and bring them back into use as affordable 
housing.  
 
A lower proportion of affordable housing or an alternative tenure split will only be 
accepted in exceptional circumstances. In such cases developers must demonstrate, to 
the Council’s satisfaction, why the current site specific circumstances mean that 
meeting the requirements of this policy would render the development unviable. This 
should be in the form of a clear, bespoke viability assessment.  
 
 
13.12  Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation  
13.12.1  The Council has a responsibility to meet the housing needs of all its residents 
including those who identify as Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
under the Housing and Planning Act 2016. We also have a duty under the 
Planning Policy for Traveller Sites 201576  to ensure a rolling five -year supply of 
deliverable sites for travellers.  
13.12.2  A Cumbria wide Gypsy and Traveller Study is currently being produced. The initial 
findings indicate a need for between 1 and 12 pitches  in th e borough  to 
accommodate a Copeland resident currently living in bricks and mortar housing 
and his extended family.  
13.12.3  A call for sites was carried out in 2021 , however no sites were put forward for 
consideration. The Council will therefore review its own la nd assets against the 
criteria in Policy H10PU below.  
13.12.4  The Council is currently assessing a number of its own sites against the criteria in 
Policy H10PU below and is seeking views from the Lead Local Flood Authority and 
Highways Authority. Potential suitabl e sites will be subject to a 6 -week public 
consultation in early 202 2. The site taken forward will then be identified in Policy 
H9PU below.

159 
 13.12.5  Should a need for any additional or short term/transient pitches arise following 
the Plan’s adoption, applications w ill be dealt with in accordance with Policy 
H10PU below.   
Strategic Policy H9PU: Allocated Site for Gypsies, Traveller and Travelling  Showp eople  
 
 
The following site is allocated for x pitches for gypsy, traveller or travelling show -people 
mobile homes:  
 
 *Site to be identified through a separate consultation in early 2022 once the need for 
pitches has been confirmed*  
 
The site must be retained for this purpose and the site must be desi gned in accordance 
with criteria b -g of Policy H10PU.  
 
 
 
 
Policy H10PU: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople Sites  
 
 
 
Planning applications for the development of new or extension of existing Gypsy and 
Traveller sites will be supported where it accords with the Development Plan and meets 
the following criteria:  
a) There is a demonstrated need;  
b) The site would not lead to the unacceptable loss, or significant adverse impact 
upon landscape character and value, heritage assets and their setting s, nature 
conservation or biodiversity sites;  
c) The site is well related to an existing sustainable settlement, with safe and 
convenient access to the main highway network, and a range of basic and 
everyday community services and facilities including educati on, health, shopping 
facilities and transport provision;  
d) The site would offer a suitable level of residential amenity to any proposed 
occupiers, and will not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of 
nearby residents;  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
160 
 e) The site is capable of b eing designed to ensure that appropriate landscaping and 
planting would provide and maintain visual amenity in perpetuity;  
f) Pitch size, type and parking will be designed in accordance with national 
guidance; and  
g) The site can be adequately drained.  
 
 
13.13  Community -led and Self and Custom Housing  
13.13.1  Community -led housing projects, whether within the National Park boundary or 
outside it, provide local occupancy housing in perpetuity and can be homes to 
rent or buy. The options for community -led housing schemes are wide -ranging 
and include:  
• community -owned housing  
• cooperative and tenant controlled housing  
• individual self -build or projects managed by providers on behalf of community 
groups.  
13.13.2  Self and custom build housing helps increase housing supply and also gi ves 
people the opportunity to build a home which meets their needs whilst learning 
new skills and trades. Definitions of self and custom build can be found in the 
Local Plan Glossary.   
13.13.3  Copeland Council was allocated £251,000 in 2017 funding from the Depar tment 
for Communities and Local Government to co -deliver the project as an area 
where the high number of second -home ownership is affecting housing supply in 
local communities. This funding has helped deliver successful schemes across the 
borough, includin g a recent scheme in Ulpha (within the LDNP planning area).   
13.13.4  The Council is a partner in the Cumbria and Lancaster Community -led housing 
hub77.  
13.13.5  Copeland has a strong history of self -build and the Housing Strategy identifies 
that there is a growing demand  for self and custom build housing in the Borough. 
One of the delivery priorities identified in the Strategy is “ To grow the supply of 
housing to suit the needs of professionals and entrepreneurs seeking to remain in 
or move into the area ” and the promotio n of self and custom build housing is 
recognised as a way of helping deliver this priority.  
13.13.6  The Council keeps a register78 of those seeking to acquire serviced plots in the 
borough for their own self and custom build housing (market or affordable). At 
present there are 20 people on the register but it is accepted that there may be 
 
77 http://www.clhhub.org.uk/  
78 https://www.copeland.gov.uk/content/s elf-build -and-custom -housebuild -register . Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
161 
 additional people are interested in self -build projects who haven’t registered. 
There are also a number of sites currently with planning permission that are 
providing self -build plots.  
 
Policy H11PU: Community -led, Self -build and custom build housing  
 
 
Community -led housing schemes will be supported, particularly those which help bring 
empty homes b ack into beneficial use, where they accord with the Development Plan. 
Applicants must demonstrate how their proposal meets the housing needs identified 
within the Council’s SHMA and Housing Needs Study.  
 
Self and custom build housing will be supported whe re the development accords with 
the Development Plan and make a positive contribution to the street -scene.  A design 
code will be required for all developments over 5 units.  
 
 
13.14  Specialist and Older Persons housing  
13.14.1  The SHMA 2021 identifies that Copeland has an ageing population. In 2019, 22.7% 
of our population was aged over 65, compared to 18.4% across England as a 
whole.  
13.14.2  The Housing Needs Study also identifies that a large section of the borough has a 
disability or long -term illness that limits  their day to day activities, with 22% of 
respondents to the housing needs survey stating that this was the case for at 
least one household member and 12% of respondents indicating that they would 
be interested in extra care housing.  
13.14.3  The Council supports the borough’s most vulnerable residents through working 
with partners to increase the provision of specialist and older persons housing 
and providing disabled facilities grants which help people adapt their homes to 
allow them to live independently. The Ho using Strategy states that we will “ work 
with developers, statutory bodies and third sector partners to increase the supply 
of specialist housing with support for groups with a specific and unmet need ”. The 
Local Plan has a role to play in supporting that priority, in ensuring that any 
specialist housing is directed to the most appropriate locations.  
13.14.4  The NPPF defines older people as “ People over or approaching retirement age, 
including the active, newly retired through to the very frail elderly; and whose 
housing needs can encompass accessible, adaptable general needs housing 
through to the full range of retirement and specialised housing for those with 
support or care needs .”  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
162 
 13.14.5  The provision of extra care housing is one means of helping to meet the needs of  
vulnerable groups, including the elderly.  This is self -contained accommodation 
that allows people to live independently (or in couples where required) in a 
supportive environment. Increasing the numbers of people living in Extra Care 
housing frees up mark et and social housing and reduces the need for other types 
of care home.  
13.14.6  There are currently two Extra Care housing developments within Copeland which 
provide 61 units between them. The first is Duddon Mews in Millom (14 units) 
developed by Home Group, th e second is Monkwray Court in Whitehaven (47 
units) operated by Anchor Trust.  
13.14.7  Cumbria County Council has prepared an Extra Care Housing and Supported Living 
Strategy, which is for the period of 2015 -2025. The aim of the strategy is to 
develop Extra Care h ousing and Supported Living accommodation across 
Cumbria. The County Council also operate a grant funding programme79 for 
potential providers looking to bring forward proposals for extra care/supported 
living schemes.  
13.14.8  Within Copeland, it is predicted that there will be demand for 350 extra care units 
by 2025 resulting in a shortfall of 289 units once the existing scheme s are taken 
into account. Policy H12PU supports the provision of residential establishments, 
including extra care housing, and will ensure that these are located in the right 
places to meet identified needs and enable residents to access key services and 
play an active part in community life.  
13.14.9  The Housing Needs Study identifies that there is also a need for purpose built, 
high quality student and key worker accommodation. At present there are no 
purpose -built student housing schemes in Copeland.  
  
 
79 https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/healthsocialcare/ech/developmentprogramme/grants/default.asp  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
163 
  
Policy H12PU: Residential Establishments, including Specialist, older persons housing 
and purpose -built student and key -worker accommodation  
 
 
 
The Council will work collaboratively with providers and partners to identify sites which 
may be suitable for specialis t or older persons housing, including sheltered 
accommodation, extra care housing, residential nursing care accommodation and 
purpose -built keyworker and student accommodation, taking into account housing 
needs evidence including the latest SHMA and Housin g Needs Study.  
 
Developments should be well -designed (including providing adequate space for mobility 
scooters where appropriate) and well -integrated within the wider community with safe 
access to services and public transport.  
 
Developments should also accord with the criteria in Policy H6PU and should not result 
in any unacceptable harm to the amenit y of neighbours in terms of noise and 
disturbance.  
 
 
13.15  Conversion and Subdivision of Properties  
13.15.1  The conversion and sub -division of larger properties, including residential and 
commercial properties such as former offices, is often a useful way to create 
additional accommodation to meet housing needs, including smaller properties 
such as self -containe d flats or HMOs. The demand for such properties is likely to 
grow as the borough’s economy grows, particularly where there is an influx of 
temporary workers.  
13.15.2  Policy H13PU below relates to the conversion and sub -division of buildings to 
create residential accommodation. The purpose of the policy is to ensure that the 
amenity of future residents of the building and neighbouring residents is 
protected.  
13.15.3  Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) with between 3 and 6 occupants fall into a 
C4 Use Class and do not, at p resent, require planning permission. Larger HMOs 
with 7 or more occupants and comprising of two or more households do require 
planning permission and are classed as Sui Generis uses. HMOs are different from 
self-contained flats as occupiers share basic ame nities such as kitchen and 
bathroom facilities. Certain HMOs, including those which are exempt from 
planning permission, will require a licence which can be obtained from the 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
164 
 Council’s housing department and will need to meet Housing Health and Safety 
Rating System standards, Fire and Building Regulations.  
13.15.4  HMOs provide an important source of housing, which is often available cheaply, 
however the conversion of residential properties to HMOs can lead to problems 
for neighbouring residents, for example where there is insufficient parking and 
refuse storage. The increase in occupiers and comings and goings can also have a 
detrimental impact upon the amenity of neighbours, however this can often be 
minimised through the careful planning of internal layouts and a ccess 
arrangements.  
13.15.5  As well as considering the impact upon neighbours, it is also important to 
consider the amenity, health and well -being of future residents of the HMO. 
Therefore , Policy H13PU ensures that satisfactory access to sunlight and daylight, 
sufficient internal space, privacy and outlook is provided.  
13.15.6  Whilst evidence suggests that such measures are not currently needed in 
Copeland, a number of councils have Article 4 directives in place which remove 
permitted development rights relating to chan ges of use from C3 (dwelling 
houses) to C4 (small HMOs), meaning that anyone who wants to convert their 
property into a small HMO would require planning permission. This enables 
councils to control the number of HMOs in a particular area and ensure any 
detrimental impacts are minimised. As the demand for short term 
accommodation increases in the Borough consideration should be given to the 
provision of an Article 4 Directive in those areas most affected.  
 
Policy H13PU: Conversion and sub -division of buildin gs to residential uses including 
large HMOs  
 
 
 
The subdivision of existing properties within the Borough’s settlement boundaries, 
including those which create Houses in Multiple Occupancy, will be supported providing 
the following criteria are met:  
 
a) The development does not result in unacceptable levels of harm to residential 
amenity ( noise and disturbance) for occupiers of the converted property and/or 
those occupying neighbouring properties;  
b) Future residents have adequate levels of natural lighting and privacy;  
c) The development does not have an adverse impact upon the privacy of neighbouring 
residents through direct overlooking;  
d) Off street parking is provided or sufficient parking is available within close -proximity 
of the site;  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
165 
 e) Adequate external amen ity space is provided, including for waste and recycling bin 
storage without harming the visual amenity of the area where possible;  
f) Cycle space is provided, where possible  
g) Safe access is available from both the front and rear of the property, where possibl e; 
and  
h) The development does not result in an over -concentration of HMOs, taking into 
account the cumulative impacts of HMOs and subdivided properties within the 
vicinity of the site  
 
Consideration will also be given to the loss of the original property an d whether this 
supports the housing strategy informed by the Council’s SHMA and Housing Needs 
Study.  
 
 
13.16  Domestic Extensions and Alterations  
13.16.1  Extensions and alterations to existing properties can be a useful way of meeting 
changing household needs, for example through the creation of an annex to 
provide accommodation for dependent relatives. They can however cause 
detrimental impacts upon both the street -scene and residential amenity where 
they are poorly designed . Policy H14PU seeks to ensure that any p roposals for 
domestic extensions or alterations meet detailed requirements relating to design 
and amenity.  
13.16.2  Where proposals for “granny” annexes are considered acceptable, applicants 
must demonstrate a suitable access between the annexe and the main house a nd 
also the provision of a shared facility with the main house for example a 
bathroom or kitchen. The occupancy of annexes will be controlled through the 
use of a suitably worded planning condition to ensure that they are not used as a 
self-contained resid ential units.  
 
Policy H14PU: Domestic Extensions and Alterations  
  
  
 
Proposals for house extensions and alterations or additional buildings within the 
curtilage of existing properties will be permitted provided that:  
 
a) The scale, design and materials of  the proposed development would not 
adversely alter the character or appearance of the existing building, street scene 
or wider surrounding area;  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
166 
 b) The extension or outbuilding would be subservient to the dwelling and would 
retain an adequate provision of ou tdoor amenity space to serve the property  
c) The extension or outbuilding would not materially harm the amenity of the 
occupiers of the parent property or adjacent dwellings through loss of natural 
light, overlooking, privacy, potential noise nuisance or the overbearing nature of 
the proposal, and;  
d) The operational car parking needs of the property would continue to be met as a 
result of the proposal.  
 
 
13.17  New Housing in the Open Countryside  
13.17.1  Copeland is defined as a designated rural area under Section 157 of the Housing 
Act 1985 and over 35% of our residents live outside of the Borough’s towns. 
Access to good quality housing is important to support rural services and ensure 
the sustainability of rural settlements. It also helps families to stay within the 
same communities which helps avoid social isolation.   
13.17.2  Whilst the NPPF , paragraph 79,  supports rural development, it states that the 
development of isolated homes in the countryside should be avoided unless the 
following circumstances apply:  
• There is an essential need for a rural worker, including those taking majority 
control of a farm business, to live permanently at or near their place of work 
in the countryside;  
• The development would repr esent the optimal viable use of a heritage asset 
or would be appropriate enabling development to secure the future of 
heritage assets;  
• The development would re -use redundant or disused buildings and enhance 
its immediate setting   
• The development would inv olve the subdivision of an existing residential 
dwelling; or  
• The design is of exceptional quality  
13.17.3  Rural Exception sites are “ Small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity 
where sites would not normally be used for housing. Rural exception sites se ek to 
address the needs of the local community by accommodating households who are 
either current residents or have an existing family or employment connection. A 
proportion of market homes may be allowed on the site at the Local Planning 
Authority’s discr etion, for example where essential to enable the delivery of 
affordable units without grant funding .”80 
 
80 NPPF Glossary definition  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
167 
 13.17.4  Homes will be supported on such sites where there is a proven unmet local need 
for affordable housing as evidenced, for example, by the Housing Needs Study. 
Where such development is supported, applicants will be expected to sign a 
Section 106 agreement to  ensure houses remain affordable and available for 
those with a local connection in perpetuity.  
13.17.5  The Council will define what is meant by “local connection” in the Housing 
Technical Paper that will be published prior to the Local Plan Submission Draft. 
This will prioritise residents with the greatest need.  
 
Policy H15PU:  Rural Exception Sites  
 
 
 
Housing development within the open countryside will be permitted on rural exception 
sites, these are small sites where it is demonstrated that affordable housin g is required 
to meet local needs.  
 
Applicants must demonstrate that the development is viable and housing will be 
retained in local, affordable use in perpetuity. An element of market housing will be 
accepted to support the development of local, affordab le housing where:  
 
a) There are excessive development costs due to site constraints; and  
b)  It is demonstrated that the additional revenue created by the development of 
open market housing is essential to enable the delivery of affordable housing on 
the s ite; and  
c) The majority of the homes are affordable and the amount of open market 
housing is the minimum required to achieve site viability.  
 
The development must meet an identified need to the satisfaction of the Council, must 
be well designed and appropriate in terms of size and scale for its location. The 
development must not result in a significant adverse impact on the character of the 
area , the surrounding landscape or biodiversity.  
 
 
13.17.6  The Council supports rural enterprise and recognises that there will be a small 
number of cases where it essential for one or more people engaged in a rural 
enterprise to live at, or very close to, the site of their work. This is to ensure 
workers are on hand day and night to allow for the proper functioning of the 
business.  For example , in case animals or agricultural processes require essential 
care at short notice; or to deal quickly with emergencies  that could otherwise 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
168 
 cause serious loss of crops or products, for example, by frost damage or the 
failure of automatic systems.  
13.17.7  Policy H16PU supports the erection of agricultural, forestry or other essential 
rural workers dwellings, where certain criteria  is met. Consideration will also be 
given to the number of workers needed taking into account the scale and nature 
of enterprise, to ensure the size of dwelling being applied for is appropriate.  
13.17.8  Where such dwellings are approved, occupancy will be retained  for this purpose 
through the use of a planning condition.  
13.17.9  Should there be an identified need for a rural worker to live in temporary 
accommodation on a site within the open countryside (e.g. to manage a newly 
established enterprise) this will be considere d where it complies with Policy 
H21PU.  
 
Policy H16PU:  Essential Dwellings for Rural Workers  
 
 
 
Housing will be permitted within the open countryside where it can be demonstrated 
that the dwelling is essential to allow a rural worker to live permanently at or near their 
place of work.  
The development will only be permitted where:  
 
a) there is a clearly established existing functional need;  
b) the need relates to a full -time worker, or one who is primarily employed in a 
rural business and does not relate to a part -time requirement;  
c) the unit and the rural business concerned have been established for at least 
three years, have been profitable for  at least one of them, are currently 
financially sound, and have a clear prospect of remaining so;  
d) the functional need could not be fulfilled by another existing dwelling on the 
unit, or any other existing accommodation in the area which is suitable and 
available for occupation by the workers concerned; and  
e) other planning requirements, e.g. in relation to access, or impact on landscape 
and biodiversity, are satisfied.  
 
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
169 
 13.18  Conversion of Rural Buildings to Residential Use in the open 
countryside  
13.18.1  Agricultural buildings are currently permitted to change to residential use (C3 use 
class) together with some building operations reasonably necessary to facilitate 
the conversion, subject to the following criteria and Prior Approval being granted:  
• No more  than five separate dwelling houses can be developed under this 
Class  
• Subject to this limit of five dwelling houses, up to three can be ‘larger dwelling 
houses’. (A larger single dwelling house is one with a floor space of more than 
100m2). No more than 46 5m2 of floor space can change use to ‘larger dwelling 
houses’ under this class and no more than 465m2 of residential floor space is 
allowed in larger dwelling houses  
• Within the overall limit of five dwelling houses, up to five can be ‘smaller 
dwelling hous es’. (Smaller dwelling houses each have a floor space of no more 
than 100m2) 
• Development is not permitted if the floor space of any dwelling house 
developed under Class Q having a use falling within Class C3 (dwelling houses) 
exceeds 465 square metres.  
13.18.2  Policy H17PU is relevant to conversions that require planning permission outside 
of identified settlement boundaries and aims to strike a balance between 
supporting the rural economy whilst protecting the intrinsic character and beauty 
of the open countryside.  
13.18.3  It should be noted that a European Protected Species License may be required 
where there is evidence of protected species, for example roosting bats. 
Consideration should also be given to whether the site is located within a Mineral 
Safeguardi ng Area and whether the conversion could sterilise the areas of 
mineral resource.  
 
Policy H17PU: Conversion of Rural Buildings to Residential Use  
 
 
The conversion and re -use of buildings in the open countryside for housing outside of 
settlement boundaries will be supported where:  
a) The building is redundant or disused, is of a traditional design and the proposal 
would not have an adverse effect on the historic environment, the character of the 
local landscape or its setting;  
b) The building is structu rally sound and capable of conversion without the need for 
significant extension, alteration or reconstruction;  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
170 
 c) The development conserves the essential character of the buildings and enhances 
the immediate surroundings;  
d) Safe road access is in place or can  be created without damaging the rural character 
of the surrounding area;  
e) The proposed curtilage area is appropriate in scale to the character of the building 
and will not result in adverse visual impacts or adverse harm to the landscape 
character; and  
f) Appropriate protected species surveys (bat, owl etc) have been carried out and 
details of proposed mitigation to deal with any harm identified have been agreed 
with the Council  
 
When granting permission under this policy the Council will remove permitted 
deve lopment rights where necessary to protect the character of the building and 
landscape.    
 
Proposals must also accord with  the criteria listed in Policy H13PU.  
 
 
13.19  Replacement Dwellings in the Open Countryside  
13.19.1  Whilst the NPPF sets out a presumption against isolated homes in the open 
countryside, replacement dwellings are an exception and can provide a useful 
source of rural housing, allowing residents to stay within their communities and 
making efficient use of land. Inappropriate design can however have a negative 
impact upon the character of the area, particularly when the scale of the new 
dwelling is not proportionate to the size of the plot.  
13.19.2  It is important that the scale and size of the new building matches  the building 
that it replaces as uncontrolled extensions can also result in the loss of smaller 
housing within the rural areas and can therefore make it more difficult for first 
time buyers, or those needing smaller homes, to move into such locations.  
 
Policy H18PU: Replacement Dwellings outside Settlement Boundaries  
 
 
 
The erection of a replacement dwelling outside of identified settlement boundaries will 
be permitted where:  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
171 
 a) the replacement dwelling is to be sited on, or close to the footprint of the existing 
dwelling81 to be replaced;  
b) the replacement dwelling and curtilage development is of a scale, form and design 
appropriate to the location, will enhance its immediate setting and will not result in 
unacceptable impacts on landscape character or unacceptable visual harm;  and 
c) appropria te access and adequate vehicle parking can be achieved;  and 
 
Where necessary, appropriate planning conditions will be imposed to require the 
demolition of the existing dwelling and to remove permitted development rights to 
control the impacts of any replac ement dwelling and curtilage development.  
 
Where it is likely that protected species are present, appropriate surveys must be 
submitted as part of any planning application prior to the demolition of the existing 
building, the contents of which must be agreed with the Council.  
 
 
13.20  Beach Bungalows  
13.20.1  Copeland contains a number of beach bungalows which are focussed around an 
area of coastline between St Bees and Braystones. These bungalows are of 
varying quality and structural soundness, are at risk from coast al erosion and tidal 
flooding and are poorly connected to services within nearby settlements.  
13.20.2  Given their open countryside location and their vulnerability to flooding and 
climate change proposals for rebuilding the bungalows as larger or more 
permanent s tructures will not be supported.  
 
Policy H19PU: Beach Bungalows  
 
 
 
The alteration or replacement of an existing Beach Bungalow will be permitted where:  
 
a) the existing bungalow to be replaced has an existing lawful use;  
b) any replacement bungalow is sited on the footprint of the existing Beach Bungalow 
to be replaced;  
c) the altered or replaced b ungalow is not larger in scale and massing than the existing 
dwelling  to be replaced; and,  
d) the design of the altered or replacement bungalow is appropriate to the location and 
will enhance the immediate setting . 
 
81 Existing dwelling refers to the main dwelling and excludes any out -buildings.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
172 
 e) The erection of new Beach Bungalows and proposals for the change of use to 
permanent dwellings or holiday letting accommodation will not be permitted.  
 
 
13.21  Removal of Occupancy Conditions  
13.21.1  Occupancy conditions are useful to ensure affordable housing, or housing that 
may otherwise be unacceptable such as rural workers dwellings, are retained for 
the intended purpose. There may be cases however where applicants seek to 
remove such conditions t o allow the release of housing onto the general market. 
In such cases, applicants are expected to demonstrate that there is no longer a 
need for the housing to be retained for that purpose. As part of this process, 
applicants will need to submit evidence t o demonstrate that the property has 
been marketed for a reasonable period of time at a reasonable price.   
13.21.2  Where the removal of a condition limiting occupancy to a rural worker is 
supported, the Council may require the dwelling to meet local needs, rather than 
permitting it to be placed straight on the open market. This is particularly 
important in the Whitehaven Rural sub -area identified in the Housing Needs 
Study which is the least affordable part of the Borough where local residents may 
have difficulty a ccessing market housing due to costs.  
13.21.3  A technical note regarding “local occupancy” will be developed prior to the 
production of the submission of the Local Plan to the Planning Inspectorate.  
 
Policy H20PU: Removal of occupancy conditions  
 
 
 
The removal of a planning condition restricting the occupancy of a dwelling in open 
countryside will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the long term 
need for the dwelling has ceased and there is no evidence of a continuing need for 
housing fo r the particular group to which the occupancy condition  relates. Where the 
removal of such conditions is accepted, a local occupancy condition will be attached to 
ensure the dwelling is made available for those with a local connection.  
 
Proposals to remove  local occupancy conditions will only be permitted where an 
independent market assessment has been submitted following unsuccessful attempts to 
sell the property at a realistic price over the previous 12 months.

173 
 13.22  Residential Caravans  
13.22.1  Policy  H21PU is rel evant to those proposals for caravans that require planning 
permission in order to ensure that negative impacts are minimised.  
13.22.2  A caravan is a use of land and not a structure and therefore it is the use that 
requires planning permission under certain circu mstances. For instance , a caravan 
sited within the curtilage of a property and used as a play -room or space ancillary 
to the main house is unlikely to be seen as a material change of use however if 
the caravan is occupied for stand -alone residential purpos es then this is likely to 
require permission.  
13.22.3  Where a caravan is to be sited in close proximity to a designated nature site, 
consideration must be given to impacts from recreational disturbance.  
 
Policy H21PU: Residential Caravans  
 
 
Proposals for new residential caravans (with the exception of Gypsy & Traveller 
caravans) will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances and on a temporary basis, 
where need can be fully demonstrated to the satis faction of the Council and where:  
 
a) the siting of the caravan will not result in adverse impacts upon the landscape or 
biodiversity or cause visual harm;  
b) the siting of the caravan will not result in unacceptable adverse impacts upon the 
amenity of neighbour s through a loss of privacy or sunlighting;  
c) the siting of the caravan does not give rise to unacceptable impacts upon the 
highway network or highway safety; and  
d) the caravan is located within a settlement identified in Policy DS3PU.  
 
Where caravans are permitted, they should be well screened with appropriate 
landscaping where possible.  
 
Proposals will not be required to comply with crit erion  D above where the caravan will 
accommodate a rural worker who is required to live at or near t heir place of work. In 
such cases criteria a ),b) and c ) of Policy H16PU will apply.

 14.2 Health and Well -being  
14.2.1  Copeland faces a number of health and well -being challenges, which have been  
magnified by the Covid -19 pandemic. The issues are summarised on the previous 
page and in the Headline Statistics for Sport and Physical Activity document82 
produced by Active Cumbria in association with Sport England.  
14.2.2  The Borough has lower life expectan cies at birth than the national average: for 
men life expectancy is 78.2 years compared to the national average of 79.6 years 
and for women 81.5years compared to the national average of 83.1years (ONS 
2018). 21.3% of residents consider that their day to da y activities are limited by a 
health problem (ONS Census 2011)  
14.2.3  Physical inactivity contributes to 1 in 6 deaths in the UK83. The Active Lives survey 
2020 shows that 23.4% of people aged over 16 in Copeland are inactive, with the 
level of inactivity increasing with age. Inactivity can also lead to obesity. 73.1% of 
adults in Copeland are overweight or obese compared to 62% in England (PHE 
Public Health Profiles 2017/18).  
14.2.4  Planning has a key role to play in addressing those challenges. It is important that 
the Council enables well -designed developments, such as housing and health and 
educational facilities, to meet the changing needs of our co mmunities and that 
we protect the open spaces and natural environment that are used for 
recreation. Well designed developments include those that create opportunities 
for active travel, reduce opportunities for crime, provide open spaces that are 
accessibl e for all and mitigate impacts of climate change.  
14.2.5  The Local Plan contains a number of planning policies that have been developed 
to improve health and well -being in the borough, including the overarching 
Design Policy within the Development Standards chapt er, policies that protect or 
provide new open spaces and policies that aim to minimise to air and water 
pollution. The Council has  also produced a Health Impact Assessment and an 
Equalities Impact Assessment to support the Local Plan which identifies the 
impacts of the policies within it on health and inequality.  
14.2.6  The following policy sets out a number of actions the Council will take to improve 
health and well -being in Copeland.

Strategic Policy SC1PU: Health and Well -being  
 
 
 
The Council will promote health and well -being in the borough by supporting new 
development that:  
 
• Delivers high quality, safe developments,  
• Enhances our natural environment, through improved air and water quality,  
• Promotes active travel,  
• Protects or delivers  green infrast ructure,  open spaces, sports, cultural and 
community facilities or seek developer contributions for such facilities,  
• Support access to open spaces and the countryside,  
• Improves health, social and cultural well -being  
• Create s spaces for food growing,  
• Opens u p educational facilities for community use and securing such use through 
Community use Agreements84 where appropriate,  
• Create s mixed communities through new or improved developments that are 
located in areas with access to key services to reduce social iso lation and create 
community resilience.  
• Producing a Health Impact Assessment and Equalities Impact Assessment to 
support the Local Plan which identifies the impacts of the policies within it on 
health and inequality;  
• Implement s the policies within the Loca l Plan to help deliver high quality, safe 
developments and enhance our natural environment, improving air and water 
quality;  
• Implement s the policies within the Local Plan that promote active travel and

recreational and community facilities;  
• Support local strategies to improve health, social and cultural well -being;  
• Support local communities to create spaces for food growing;  
• Support the o pening up of educational facilities for community use and securing 
such use through Community Use Agreements where appropriate; and  
• Contribut e to the creation of mixed communities through new or improved 
developments that are located in areas with access t o key services to reduce social 
isolation and create community resilience.

 14.3 Sports and Leisure  
14.3.1  Copeland has a strong sporting heritage which the Council wishes to continue to 
support and develop, recognising the socio -economic benefits sport and leisure 
can bring, as well as the benefits to our resident’s health and wellbeing. In 
addition to this the Council encourages communities to volunteer to support 
sports and physical activity as this helps prevent social isolation85 and builds 
community resilience.  
14.4 Indoor Sports Facilities in Copeland  
14.4.1  Indoor Sports facilities are identified in the Built Facilities Study86 (BFS), produced 
in 2020 . 
14.4.2  The borough contains a number of sporting facilities which are owned by the 
Council and managed by Greenwich Leisure Ltd (GLL), including Copeland Pool 
and Whitehaven Leisure Centre. The recently opened Campus Whitehaven also 
provides a modern sports and physic al activity facility for the Borough.  
14.4.3  The BFS identifies a need for the following:  
• Additional local leisure small swimming pool (15m x 8m) provision by 2035;  
• Retaining existing levels of community accessible (including pay and play) 
sports halls, swimming  pools, and fitness stations as a minimum; and  
• Consideration of enhanced dedicated gymnastics facilities  
14.4.4  It also acknowledges the important role of community centres/halls and other 
informal places that are well suited for sports hall activities. Such loca l spaces 
allow access to those elderly residents, those who do not have access to a car, 
have young children or have a disability. The Local Plan will protect such spaces 
from redevelopment where appropriate.  
14.4.5  The Council was recently allocated Town Deal fu nding, a large proportion of 
which is being spent providing or improving sports facilities in the Borough. Town 
Improvement Plans have been produced for Cleator Moor and Millom/Haverigg 
these identify the following potential projects:  
• The redevelopment of the existing Cleator Moor Centre to create a and the 
development of modern, multi -functional centre including an indoor sports 
hall, flexible studio space, gym and café as well as wider health and well -being 
provision and targeted youth activity. This proj ect sits under the TIP’s Healthy 
Town theme.  
 
85 In 2020, 14.4% of people in Copeland had volunt eered to support sport and physical activity at least twice in the past 
year, compared to 13.4% in England (Active Lives Survey 2020).

 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
179 
 • The provision of a new, leisure size, swimming pool in Millom as part of the 
Activating Community Health project . 
14.5 Outdoor Sports Facilities in Copeland  
14.5.1  The borough also benefits from a number of outdoor sports facilities including a 
running track, multi -use games areas and a range of grass and 3g playing pitches.  
Playing Fields  
14.5.2  Playing pitches are identified in the Playing Pitch Strategy produced in 202187.  
14.5.3  The PPS was produced in the height of the Covid -19 pandemic and therefore 
doesn’t give a full representation of pitch provision and the need for pitches in 
the borough. As consultants were unable to visit and assess summer sport 
pitches, these will be considered through a PPS Update which is currently being 
produced. The PPS Update will also review the winter sport provision to ensure 
the latest evidence is available to base decision making on.  
14.5.4  The PPS Action Plan 2021 identifies supply and demand data for football, rugby 
union and hockey. On page 50  it makes  a number of recommendations, 7 general 
recommendations, 6 for football, 5 for rugby union and 7 for hockey. These will 
be updated as part of the PPS Update. In the meantime, the recommendations 
should be considered fully when decision making.  
Children’s P lay Areas  
14.5.5  Outdoor children’s play areas are considered and assessed through the Council’s 
Play Strategy88. Such spaces contribute significantly to children’s health and 
wellbeing, particularly when the child does not participate in more organised 
sports.  
14.5.6  Table 16, taken from the Play Strategy , identifies provision in the borough. As can 
be seen this is well below the Fields in Trust (FIT) recommended standards for 
equipped/designated play areas of 0.25 hectares per 1,000 population and of 
0.30 hectares per 1,000 population for other outdoor provision (i.e. MUGAs and 
skate parks). The Play Strategy does however recommend that a lower standard is 
used given the rural nature of the Borough, it’s low population density and the 
fact that it offers greater opportu nities for informal play in natural settings. The 
proposed benchmark for children and young person ’s provision  in Copeland is 
therefore set at 0.15 ha/1,000. Provision at present falls below this threshold in 
all three sub -areas in Copeland.

Opportunities for Active Travel  
14.5.7  24.1% of adults in the borough do not walk for 10 minutes at least once a month 
compared to 21.7% in England (DoT Walking and Cycling Statistics (2017/18). 
Increasing walking and cycling is one of the effective and cheap ways to increase 
physical activity.   
14.5.8  Copeland benefits from its location on the C2C, Hadrian’s Wall and Reivers 
national cycle routes and contains an extensive cycle network on former railway 
lines. It is also located on England’s Coastal Path and the Council is pro -actively 
working with pa rtners to complete and improve the stretches of the Path route 
within the borough.   
14.5.9  In recent years external funding has been secured to enhance opportunities for 
physical activity in the borough. Funded projects include Connecting Cumbria’s 
Hidden Coast project; a recreational “challenge” route largely following England’s 
Coastal Path from Whitehaven to Millom, 1.4km of new cycle path, 1.8km of new 
or improved footpaths and links to the Whe els for All Hub.  
14.5.10  There are also proposals to increase opportunities for active travel though 
identified in the Town Improvement Plans for both Cleator Moor and Millom.  
14.5.11  Applicants should seek opportunities for active travel when developing their 
proposals.  This is considered further in the Connectivity Chapter.  
14.6 Provision of new, and protection of existing, sport and 
leisure facilities  
14.6.1  The NPPF, paragraph 9 3 states:   
“To provide the social, recreational and cultural facilities and services the 
community needs, planning policies should;  
a) ‘Plan positively for the provision and use of community facilities’  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
181 
 b) ‘Guard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities and services.’  
e) ‘Ensure an integrated approach to considering the location of ho using, 
economic uses and community facilities and services.’”  
14.6.2  The importance of providing new and protecting existing facilities is also 
reiterated through the PPS, Play Strategy and Built Facilities Study.  The Local Plan 
guards against the loss of valued facilities  and only allows their replacement with 
other uses in a limited number of circumstances as set out in Policy SC2PU and 
SC5PU below.  
14.6.3  Policy SC2PU recognises the importance of basing decisions on the most up -to-
date evidence available. Such eviden ce includes the latest Playing Pitch Strategy, 
Open Space Assessment, Built Facilities Study and Play Strategy.  
14.6.4  Playing pitches are dealt with separately in Policy SC3PU as they are governed by 
specific national guidance89.  
Funding  
14.6.5  Local Plan Policy DS5P U, requires developers to make contributions towards 
additional open spaces and facilities and the impacts of this on development 
viability will be  assessed through the Viability Study.  
14.6.6  Prior to the submission of the Local Plan, the Council will consider t he findings of 
the Open Space Assessment and sports evidence, including the PPS, in order to 
calculate the level of developer contribution that will be required for open spaces 
and sports provision. The Council is unable to identify the requirement at pres ent 
as the Viability Assessment has not yet been completed. Such a provision will be 
put forward as a main modification to the Plan.  
14.6.7  Developer contributions towards new and improved indoor sports and recreation 
facilities can be informed through use of the  Sport England planning tools. The 
Sports Facility Calculator (SFC) can help to estimate the amount of demand for 
key community sports facilities that is created by a given population and covers 
Swimming pools, Sports halls, Artificial Grass Pitches (AGPs)  and Indoor bowls 
centres. The SFC helps with quantifying the demand side of the facility provision 
equation. It helps to answer questions such as, " How much additional demand for 
swimming will the population of a new development area generate, and what 
would the cost be to meet this new demand at today’s values ?". Sport England’s 
Playing Pitch Calculator can also be used to estimate demand that may be 
generated for the use of playing pitches by a new population.  
14.6.8  Sport England also produces a suite of guidance documents on the design and 
cost of sports facilities90 that may be helpful to developers. The cost guidance is 
updated quarterly.  
14.6.9  Funding for new or improved facilities can also be sought from other sources such 
as Government funding (Town Deal fund, Levelling Up fund, Sport England 
 
89 https://www.sportengland.org/how -we-can-help/facilities -and-planning/planning -for-sport

182 
 funding etc .), local funding (Copeland Community Fund, Active Cumbria funding 
etc.), subject to the development meeting the necessary criteria.  
 
Policy SC2PU: Sporting , Leisure and Cultural Facilities (excluding pla ying pitches)  
 
 
 
New Facilities  
 
The Council will support proposals, in principle, for new sports and leisure facilities that 
help residents sustain and lead healthy lives and meet needs identified in the most up 
to date evidence.  
 
New indoor facilities should be accessible to all, should be located according to the 
Settlement Hierarchy  unless the proposal is for a specific activity or function that 
requires a location that cannot be accommodated within a defined settlement , and 
must be informed by the Council’s Built Facilities Study.  
 
Development must:  
• Prioritise brownfield sites where possible  
• Be accessible by sustainable  and act ive transport modes where possible  
• Be of a scale that is appropriate to its surroundings  
• Ensure that adequate parking (including safe cycle storage) is provided  
• Ensure that the development does not cause unacceptable harm on residential 
amenity  
• Ensure that  biodiversity conservation interests would not be harmed as a result 
of the development  
 
Existing Facilities  
 
The Council will seek to protect and enhance existing sport and leisure facilities. 
Proposals resulting in the loss of a sports or leisure facilit y will only be permitted where 
this is fully justified to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and supported by 
the most up to date evidence. Applicants must demonstrate that:  
 
a) The loss is required to in order to provide alternative sport or le isure provision 
and the needs for the new facility clearly outweigh the loss; or  
b) The facility is surplus to requirements; or  
c) The land in question only forms an ancillary use and its loss would not affect 
overall public usage of the facility; or  
d) The facility would be replaced by equivalent or better provision, with equivalent 
or better access and management arrangements within a suitable location.  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
183 
 14.6.10  The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) 
(England) Order 2015 (“the 2015 Order ”) defines a playing field as ‘the whole of a 
site which encompasses at least one playing pitch’. This definition is also provided 
within the glossary to the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework. The 
definition refers to the whole of a site and therefore does not just cover land 
which is currently laid out as pitches.  Even where wider sports facilities fall 
outside the definition of a playing field, they are afforded protection through the 
planning system under the provisions of paragraph 9 9 of the NPPF.  
14.6.11  The 2015 Order defines a playing pitch as ‘a delineated area which, together with 
any run -off area, is of 0.2 hectares or more, and which is used for association 
football, American football, rugby, cricket, hockey, lacrosse, rounders, baseball, 
softball, Australian football, Gaelic football, shinty, hurling, polo or cycle polo.’  
14.6.12  Policy SC3PU aims to protect and where possible enhance pitch provision in the 
borough.  
 
Policy SC3PU: Playing Fields and Pitches  
 
 
 
Proposals that provide new playing fields or ancillary facilities will be supported in 
principle, particularly those which help address deficits identified within the Playing 
Pitch Strategy.  
 
Proposals affecting playing fields will only be permitted where  one of the following 
criteria are met unless one of the exceptions listed below applies:  
 
a) The proposal affects only land incapable of forming part of a playing pitch; or  
b) The proposal does not reduce the size of any playing pitch; or  
c) The proposal does not result in the inability to use any playing pitch (including 
the maintenance of adequate safety margins and run -off areas); or  
d) The proposal does not reduce the sporting capacity of the playing field to 
accommodate playing pitches or the capability to rotate  or reposition playing 
pitches to maintain their quality; or  
e) The proposal does not result in the loss of other sporting provision or ancillary 
facilities on the site; or  
f) The proposal does not prejudice the use of any remaining areas of playing field 
on the  site. 
 
Exceptions  
 
i. The applicant has carried out a robust, up -to-date assessment of need and it is 
clear from this that the playing fields affected are surplus to requirements; or  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
184 
 ii. The Council’s Sports Strategy identifies the playing fields as being surplus to 
requirements; or  
iii. The area of playing field to be lost as a result of the proposed development will 
be replaced, prior to the commencement of the development, by a new area of 
playing field:  
• of equivalent or better quality, and  
• of equivalent or g reater quantity, and  
• in a suitable location, and  
• subject to equivalent or better accessibility and management 
arrangements ; or 
iv. Where the loss of the pitch for one sport will result in better provision for other 
sports which are in greater demand and the lo ss is therefore outweighed by the 
benefits of the proposal ; or 
v. The development proposes an alternative indoor or outdoor sports facility to 
meet a strategic need as set out in the Council’s Playing Pitch Strategy, the 
provision of which would be of suffici ent benefit to the development of sport as 
to outweigh the detriment caused by the loss, or prejudice to the use, of the 
area of playing field ; or 
vi. The proposed development is for ancillary facilities supporting the principal use 
of the site as a playing fi eld, and does not affect the quantity or quality of playing 
pitches or otherwise adversely affect their use.  
 
 
14.6.13  New development, particularly housing, can have a prejudicial impact upon 
existing sport s facilities. Where this is not identified and addressed in advance 
this can lead to statutory nuisance complaints from new residents and the placing 
of unreasonable restrictions on sports clubs (i.e. limitations on usage times, limits 
on lighting etc .). Ap plicants should consider neighbouring sporting facilities at the 
earliest stages and identify appropriate mitigation to prevent any potential issues 
from occurring.  
14.6.14  Where a proposed housing allocation is adjacent to an existing sports facility this 
is ide ntified within the Housing Allocation Profiles document.  
14.6.15  Mitigation could be in the form of acoustic screening, the addition of ball strike 
zones or other safety margins, consideration of existing lighting at sports grounds 
and how this may affect future residents and designing housing schemes to avoid 
glare into habitable room windows etc. The most appropriate measures will 
depend upon the specifics of the development, however mitigation should be 
deliverable and enforceable in accordance with the NPPF.  
  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
185 
  
Policy SC4PU: Impact of new development on sporting facilities  
 
 
 
New development must not prejudice the use of existing sports facilities within the 
vicinity of the development site. Potential impacts such as ball strike, noise and 
disturbance, impacts  upon parking and access must be considered at an early stage 
when drawing up proposals to avoid or minimise complaints from future occupiers of 
the new development.  
 
Where potential harm is identified, mitigation measures must be agreed with the 
Council a nd Sport England. This may be in the form of acoustic fencing, landscaped 
bunds, ball strike zones etc . and the exact measures will be dependent upon the specific 
development.  
 
Where ball strike zones are required opportunities should be taken to create multi -
purpose spaces where appropriate which can act as spaces for biodiversity, drainage 
areas etc.  
 
 
14.7 Community and Cultural Facilities  
14.7.1  Copeland contains a wealth of local community facilities, such as community 
halls, libraries, village halls and  places of worship. These are particularly 
important in our rural areas as they reduce the need to travel and reduce social 
isolation.  
14.7.2  Copeland also offers a large number of cultural facilities, such as the Millom 
Palladium, Gaiety Cinema and Florence Art s Centre, that benefit residents and 
visitors alike. Such facilities, along with the borough’s many heritage assets91, 
help create and maintain civic pride and improve well -being.  
14.7.3  The Council maintains an Assets of Community Value list. These are assets t hat 
are nominated by community groups and parish councils. An asset can be listed if 
it furthers the community’s social well -being or social interests and is likely to do 
so in the future. The Council’s list currently contains four  assets of Community 
Valu e in the borough, two of which are within the Local Plan area.  
14.7.4  Should an owner wish to sell a property on the list, they first have to formally 
notify the Council. A 6 -week period will then commence in which a community 
interest group can request to be tre ated as a potential bidder. If such a request is

 made a 6 -month moratorium is then placed on the sale which gives the group 
time to make a bid92. 
14.7.5  Whilst our aim is to protect and retain these important spaces, it is accepted that 
some are lost because they  are no longer viable and there is no community 
interest to take them forward. Policy SC5PU protects such facilities in the 
Borough but is flexible enough to allow for changes of uses in certain 
circumstances. The Policy does not relate to village shops, p ost offices or public 
houses in rural locations as these are considered in the Retail chapter.  
14.7.6  Policy SC5PU requires evidence that a building has been marketed over a period 
of 12 months regardless of whether it is on the Assets of Community Value list or 
not. This is based on good practice elsewhere and gives the community sufficient 
time to register a property on the list should they wish to do so once it becomes 
available before the 6 -month moratorium commences.  
 
Policy SC5PU: Community and Cultural Facilities  
 
 
 
New Community and Cultural Facilities  
Proposals for new community facilities (Community Halls, Village Halls, libraries and halls 
related to places of worship, arts centres, theatres and cinemas) will be supported in 
principle. Development must:  
 
• Be located within a settlement identified in the hierarchy unless the proposal is for a 
specific activity or function that requires a location that cannot be accommodated 
within a settlement  
• Prioritise bro wnfield sites where possible  
• Be accessible by sustainable transport modes where possible  
• Be of a scale that is appropriate to its surroundings  
• Ensure that adequate parking (including safe cycle storage) is provided  
• Ensure that the development does not caus e unacceptable harm on residential 
amenity  
• Ensure that biodiversity conservation interests would not be harmed as a result  
 
Loss of Existing Community and Cultural Facilities  
The loss of existing community facilities through change of use or new developmen t 
requiring planning permission will only be permitted where it can be clearly 
demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Council, that:  
 
a) Its continued use as a community or cultural facility is no longer feasible, having had 
regard to appropriate marketing. Evidence should be provided to show that the

 building has been marketed over a 12 -month period through recognised agents and 
online platforms appropriate to the nature of the facility at a price which reflects its 
use, condition and local market  values), the demand for the use of the site or 
premises, its usability and the identification of a potential future occupier; or  
b) There is sufficient provision of such facilities in the area; or  
c) That sufficient alternative provision has been, or will be ma de elsewhere which is 
equally accessible and of the same quality or better than the facility being lost; or  
d) The loss or change of use of existing facilities is part of a wider public service estate 
reorganisation, for example to enable healthcare needs to be met.

 15.2 Conserving and Enhancing Biodiversity and Geodiversity  
Defining Biodiversity  
15.2.1  Biodiversity is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as “ the variety of plant and animal 
life in the world or in a particular habitat, a high level of which is usually 
considered to be important and desirable .” It supports life on earth and provides 
the following benefits:  
• Regulates water, carbon and nutrient cycles  
• Improves  air quality  
• Keeps the environment in state of balance  
• Provides resources for consumption e.g. wood, biofuels  
• Helps support economic sectors such as farming, forestry, crafts etc.  
• Leisure and tourism resource  
• Reduces anti -social behaviour  
• Improves mental  and physical health and well -being  
• Cultural/spiritual attachments to natural environment  
• Reduces flooding  
• Important for soil production  
• Open air classroom for learning about and monitoring the environment  
 
15.3 International, National and Regional Designa tions  
European Designations  
15.3.1  Copeland contains a number of sites that are designated at European level for 
their biodiversity importance many of which extend beyond Borough boundaries. 
These are:  
• Ramsar sites are internationally protected wetland areas.  
• Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) provide increased protection to a variety 
of wild animals, plants and habitats.  
• Special Protection Areas (SPA) provide increased protection for rare and 
vulnerable birds and for regularly occurring migratory species.  
15.3.2  SAC and SPA sites were previously referred to as Natura 2000 sites under 
European legislation that no longer applies post -Brexit. They are now known as 
National Site Network (NSN) sites under the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
(Amendment) (E U Exit) Regulations 2019.  
15.3.3  NSN and Ramsar site designations are identified on the Proposals Map and are 
listed in Appendix G. It should be noted that functionally linked land, that is 
functionally connected to an NSN or Ramsar site but is outside its bounda ries has 
the same status as the designations listed below. Supporting habitats outside of 
the designated site boundary (and sometimes a considerable distance away) may 
be used by SPA populations or some individuals of the population for some or all Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
191 
 of the time. These supporting habitats can play an essential role in maintaining 
SPA bird populations, and proposals affecting them may therefore have the 
potential to affect the SPA.  
15.3.4  The Council has carried out a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) of the draf t 
policies and site allocations in the Local Plan and this has considered their effects 
(singularly and cumulatively) on the NSN and Ramsar network.  
15.3.5  The HRA Screening Report identifies that a number of policies and allocations 
may have a likely significan t effect on the NSN and Ramsar Network. The HRA 
Appropriate Assessment considers that all likely significant effects can be 
mitigated.  
National and Local Designations  
15.3.6  Copeland contains a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) listed in 
Appendix G and identified on the Proposals Map. These are England’s most 
important wildlife and geological sites which support many rare and endangered 
species, habitats and natural features. Natural England regularly monitors the 
condition of SSSIs and th e latest data is shown below . 
15.3.7  A number of  our SSSIs are in unfavourable condition93 for a variety of reasons and 
the Council will support  landowners where possible to ensure necessary 
management measures are put in place to enable recovery.  
15.3.8  The borough als o contains two national nature reserves, Hallsenna Moor and 
High Leys, as well as a locally designated nature reserve at Millom Ironworks.  
County Wildlife Sites  
15.3.9  The borough contains a number of locally important County Wildlife Sites which 
are designated as part of the Cumbria Wildlife Trust’s Wildlife Sites Project. These 
are listed in Appendix G. The sites are considered to be of local importance for 
biodiversity, although they do not have statutory designation.  
Protected Species  
15.3.10  The Cumbria Biodiversity  Action Plan 2001 identifies protected species within the 
borough, many of which may be found on sites which are not protected habitats. 
The Action Plan contains 39 Species and Habitat Action Plans covering over 700 
individual actions designed to conserve and / or enhance a range of threatened 
species and habitats of both local and national importance.  
15.3.11  Where there is evidence to suspect the presence of protected species planning 
applications should be accompanied by an appropriate up -to-date survey, carried  
out at the correct time of year, assessing their presence. If present, the proposal 
must be sensitive to, and make provision for, the species’ needs. Ecology reports 
should be undertaken by suitably qualified persons.  
 
93 Where a site is not currently meeting its conse rvation objectives  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
192 
 15.4 Geodiversity  
15.4.1  Geodiversity is the vari ety of rocks, minerals, fossils, soils and landforms, along 
with the natural processes that shape them.  
15.4.2  Copeland has a varied geology and a number of Sites of Scientific Interest in the 
borough are designated specifically for their geological features. The se are listed 
in Appendix G and are shown on the Proposals Map . 
15.4.3  There are also a number of Local Geological Sites (formerly known as Regionally 
Important Geological Sites). These sites can also be seen on the Proposals Map.  
15.5 Impacts of Development on Biodiv ersity and Geodiversity  
15.5.1  Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 places a 
duty on Local Authorities to conserve biodiversity. The proposed Environmental 
Bill will update the Act to require both the conservation and enhancement  of 
biodiversity.  
15.5.2  Development can result in a direct loss of habitats and disturbance to species but 
can also have indirect effects through increasing pollution and accelerating the 
effects of climate change. The impacts of development should therefore be 
considered early in the design process.  
15.5.3  Local Plan policy N1PU contains a mitigation hierarchy which supports the 
conservation of biodiversity and geodiversity. This follows guidance within 
paragraph 1 80 of the NPPF.  It requires that harm is avoided  where  possible, for 
example by developing less sensitive sites, limiting construction hours or noise 
levels, scheduling works around breeding seasons, amending layout or reducing 
lighting to avoid disturbance.  
15.5.4  Where harm cannot be avoided, appropriate mitigation  measures must be 
proposed to remove or reduce the impact, for example by creating replacement 
habitat elsewhere on the site or restoring or enhancing habitat in another 
location. Where mitigation is required in the form of species translocation, the 
Counc il will work with partners to identify suitable sites.  
15.5.5  In the exceptional cases, where mitigation is not appropriate or where residual 
impacts remain following mitigation, compensation  will be accepted as a last 
resort. Compensation is usually carried out off site and will be secured through 
planning conditions or S106 agreements. It will only be accepted where 
independent expert advice demonstrates that there will be a high chance of 
success.  
15.5.6  In accordance with paragraph 1 80 of the NPPF, if significant har m to biodiversity 
resulting from a development cannot be avoided (through locating on an 
alternative site with less harmful impacts), adequately mitigated, or, as a last 
resort, compensated for, then planning permission will be refused.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
193 
 15.6 Impacts  of Developm ent upon Former Natura 2000 Sites  
15.6.1  Developers are also required to carry out a HRA Screening assessment when they 
are preparing proposals that may have a negative impact upon the integrity of 
former Natura 2000 Sites. The HRA must take into account any like ly significant 
effects on such sites within Copeland and within a 20km radius of the borough as 
well as those that are hydrologically linked to the Development Plan area.  
15.6.2  The Screening Report should be submitted alongside the planning application. 
Where t he report identifies that adverse effects on former Natura 2000 Sites are 
likely, it should be followed by an Appropriate Assessment where appropriate.  
15.6.3  Development that would cause harm to a former Natura 2000 site will only be 
accepted in exceptional circ umstances, where it can be demonstrated that there 
are imperative reasons of overriding public interest, given the importance of such 
sites. Where compensation is proposed (as a last resort), the European Habitats 
and Wild Birds Directive requires that all  necessary compensatory measures are 
taken to ensure the overall coherence of the network of European Sites as a 
whole is protected.  
15.7 Construction Environmental Management Plans  
15.7.1  Construction Environmental Management Plans are a means for developers to 
asses s and monitor the impacts of development on the environment. They also 
allow for consideration of impacts such as noise, light disturbance etc on 
residential amenity. Such a document must  be submitted in the following cases, 
however all developers are enco uraged to provide site specific procedures and 
measures to monitor and control environmental impacts throughout the 
construction phase of development.  
• Any development requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or 
Screening Opinion under Schedules 1  and 2 of the Land Planning and 
Development (Environmental Impact Assessment) Ordinance 2007;  
• Significant industrial facilities  
• Larger residential and commercial development projects (e .g. housing 
development of 20+ units of accommodation, office developme nt of more 
than 1000sqm)  
• Any other project deemed by the Council to present an environmental risk 
warranting CEMP  
15.8 Opportunities for Biodiversity Enhancement  
15.8.1  As well as considering the impacts of development opportunities to improve 
biodiversity and geodive rsity should also be sought. Space for biodiversity is often 
easy to provide, for example through the provision of wildflower verges, 
hedgerow boundaries, green walls and roofs, swift and swallow bricks, bat access 
tiles for roofs and tree planting. Sustai nable drainage systems, when designed 
correctly, can also become havens for wildlife.   Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
194 
 15.8.2  In terms of geodiversity, development can provide an opportunity to better 
understand geodiversity features, for example by providing public access and 
interpretation bo ards.  
15.8.3  The Council has committed to producing a Biodiversity Supplementary Planning 
Document, either alone or in combination with neighbouring planning 
authorities, to provide further guidance on how habitats and species can be 
protected and enhanced throug h development. This could provide further 
guidance on how to incorporate biodiversity in developments.  
15.8.4  Policy N1PU sets out the approach that will be taken to development to ensure it 
conserves and enhances biodiversity and geodiversity . 
 
Strategic Policy N1PU: Conserving and Enhancing Biodiversity and Geodiversity  
 
 
 
The Council is committed to conserving the borough’s biodiversity and geodiversity 
including protected species and habitats.  
 
Potential harmful impacts of any development upon biodiversity and geodiversity must 
be identified and considered at the earliest stage  
 
Proposals must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Council, that the following 
mitigation hierarchy must have been undertaken : 
  
Avoidance  – Biodiversity and geodive rsity must be considered when drafting up 
proposals and any potential harmful effects on biodiversity and geodiversity must be 
identified along with appropriate measures that will be taken to avoid these effects   
Mitigation – Where harmful effects cannot be avoided, they must be appropriately 
mitigated in order to overcome or reduce negative impacts.   
Compensation – Where mitigation is not possible or viable or in cases where residual 
harm would remain following mitigation, harmful effects should be compen sated for. 
Where this is in the form of compensatory habitat of an area of equivalent or greater 
biodiversity value should be provided. Compensation is a last resort and will only be 
accepted in exceptional circumstances.  
 
Where harm remains to a National  Site Network or Ramsar site, or functionally linked 
land, development will only be approved where it can be demonstrated that there are 
imperative reasons of overriding public interest. In such cases, compensatory measures 
must ensure the overall coherenc e of the network of European sites as a whole is 
protected.  
 
Planning permission will be refused for any development if significant harm cannot be 
avoided, mitigated or compensated for.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
195 
 A Construction Environmental Management Plan should be submitted where  
appropriate and sustainable construction methods must be used where possible.  
 
Development proposals where the principal objective is to conserve or enhance 
biodiversity and geodiversity interests will be supported in principle.  
 
 
15.9 Local Nature Recovery Networks  
15.9.1  Local Nature Recovery Networks are discussed  in the Environment Act  and are 
priority areas within the county identified within a Local Nature Recovery 
Strategy. They are strategic areas of habitat that extend beyond Local Authority 
boundaries. The area covered by a Local Nature Recovery Network has yet to be 
determined by  the Government but it is anticipated that they will be of a county 
scale. Each network will have its own Strategy which will include a statement that 
identifies priority areas within the network for recovery and enhancement, and a 
local habitat map. The S tatement will include the following:  
• a description of the area and its biodiversity  
• a description of the opportunities for recovering or enhancing biodiversity  
• biodiversity priorities for recovering or enhancing habitats and species (taking 
into account th e contribution that recovering or enhancing biodiversity can 
also make to other environmental beneﬁts e.g. reducing ﬂood risk)  
• proposals as to potential measures relating to the above priorities  
15.9.2  When identifying and designating Local Nature Recovery Networks, consideration 
should also be given to the additional benefits spaces can offer such as reducing 
flood risk and the positive impacts such spaces can have on health and well -being.  
15.9.3  The Council will work with neighbouring authorities to pro duce a Local Nature 
Recovery Strategy. The Strategy will identify a Local Nature Recovery Network for 
Cumbria. This will build upon the positive work carried out by Cumbrian 
authorities during the LNRS pilot scheme94.  
 
Strategic Policy N2PU: Local Nature Recovery Networks  
 
 
The Council will support the identification and implementation of Local Nature Recovery 
Networks that extend beyond the borough ’s boundaries and provide important linkages 
for wildlife within Copeland and beyond.

Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
196 
 Development which pr otects or enhances Local N ature Recovery Networks will be 
supported in principle.  
 
 
15.10  Biodiversity Net Gain  
15.10.1  Biodiversity net gain ensures developments deliver more and/or better quality 
biodiversity than exists at present. Developers must assess what the site currently 
offers in terms of biodiversity, show how any existing nature features will be 
retained/improv ed and what new nature features will be provided.  
15.10.2  In 2018 the Government consulted on proposals to introduce a mandatory 
biodiversity net gain policy. Following consultation the government announced 
that it would mandate net gains for biodiversity in the draft Environment Bill , 
which has since become the Environment Act  after receiving Royal Ascent in 
2021 . Under the Act d evelop ers are required to  demonstrate how they will  
achieve a minimum net gain of 10% biodiversity using the Defra Biodiversity 
Metric model. Defra’s 3.0 metric system calculates net gain by assigning a 
numerical value to each habitat, expressed as “biodiversity units”. Emphasis will 
be on the habitats dis tinctiveness (is it of low, medium or high wildlife value), 
condition (is it a good example of its type) and extent (size).  
15.10.3  The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) in 
partnership with CIRIA and IEMA, have produced a useful document, Biodiversity 
Net Gain – Good Practice Principles for Development , to help guide developers 
looking to provide net gains.  
15.10.4  Any enhancements required will be set out in a planning obligation and must be 
maintained for at least 30 years as set out i n the Environment Act. All net gains 
will be recorded on a public biodiversity gain site register which will include 
details of the work required and who is responsible for carrying it out.  
15.10.5  Policy N3PU proposes a hierarchical approach to providing net gain  as set out 
below, this is to ensure those communities which host the development receive 
and benefit from the net gain in biodiversity where possible:  
1. On site provision;  
2. Oﬀ site provision (in an area identified as a Local Nature Recovery 
Network)  
3. Off site provision (e.g. through a local habitat creation project); or  
4. Developer may purchase biodiversity units/credits where options 1 and 2 
are not available. Investment will be directed to nationally strategic habitats 
where there are no local hab itat creation projects available.  
15.10.6  As stated above, t he Council will work with neighbouring authorities to produce a 
Local Nature Recovery Strategy. The Strategy will identify a Local Nature Recovery Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
197 
 Network for Cumbria. This will build upon the positive wo rk carried out by 
Cumbrian authorities during the LNRS pilot scheme. In the absence of a final, 
approved Strategy developers  should give consideration to the Pilot LNRS and the 
Cumbria Habitat Basem ap95 and Habitat Network Maps, developed as part of the 
Pilot project . 
15.10.7  The Council strongly encourages developers seek opportunities to exceed the 
minimum 10% requirement to help increase levels of biodiversity in the borough 
and reverse the trend of bio diversity loss across the UK96. 
Biodiversity Credits  
15.10.8  Further  details regarding option 4 will be provided once government guidance  
and legislation  has been published  to support the Environment Act . The 
Government  previously  stated in their Environment Bill consultation document 
that “ Projects for investment will be selected on the basis of their additionality, 
their long -term environmental beneﬁts and their contribution to strategic 
ecological networks. Investment will be made transparently and a public record of 
government habitat creation projects maintained for tr ansparency and audit 
purposes .” 
Exceptions  
15.10.9  The Environment Act states that  a condition  must be added to every planning 
permission requiring a  biodiversity gain plan  to be submitted and ag reed by the 
Council. The plan should  set out how the 10% net gain will be achieved . There are 
a small number of developments where this is not required as listed in  Paragraph  
17 of The Act.  
Calculating Net Gain  
15.10.10  In order to ensure consistency, and to aid monitoring, when calculating 
biodiver sity net gain, applicants must use the Government’s Biodiversity Metric 
taking into consideration the habitat’s distinctiveness, condition and extent. Full 
details must be submitted to the Council when an application is submitted or 
earlier.  
15.10.11  It is acknowle dged that there is potential for intentional damage of application 
sites in order to lower their biodiversity value and make it easier to achieve a net 
gain. The Environment Act sets the baseline as the time of application, but if this 
baseline has been in tentionally lowered, the baseline date is to be 30th January 
2020 in order to prevent intentional damage to sites to lower their biodiversity 
value. The following policy takes this even further and states that previous 
ecological records will also be taken  into account when considering biodiversity 
value.  
 
95 The basemap and network maps, produced by the Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre and Cumb ria Local Nature 
Partnership, will form the ecological framework of the Cumbria Nature Recovery Network. The Nature Recovery Strategy 
will provide the strategy underpinning the NRN  
96 Analysis from the Natural History Museum reveals that the UK is one of th e most biodiversity depleted countries in the 
world with only 53% of its biodiversity remaining. https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our -science/data/biodiversity -indicators.html  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
198 
 15.10.12  The Council strongly encourages developers to try and deliver net gain over and 
above the 10% minimum requirement where possible and believes that this can 
lead to better, more attractive and resilient dev elopments.  
 
Strategic Policy N3PU: Biodiversity Net Gain  
 
 
All development, with the exception of that listed in the Environment Act must provide a 
minimum of 10% biodiversity net gain over and above existing site levels, following the 
application of the mitigation hierarchy set out in Policy N1PU above. This is in addition to 
any compensatory habitat provided under Policy N1PU.  
 
Net gain should be delivered on site where possible.  Where on -site provision is not 
appropriate, provision m ust be made elsewhere in order of the following preference:  
1. Off site in an area identified as a Local Nature Recovery Network;  
2. Off site on an alternative suitable site within the borough;  
3. Through the purchase of an appropriate amount of national biodiversi ty 
units/credits.  
 
Planning applications must include a Biodiversity Gain Plan which will identify the 
biodiversity merit of onsite habitats both prior to and after development (using the 
relevant Metric system), set out details to reduce or prevent adver se effects and 
demonstrate how net gains will be obtained.  
 
Sites where net gain is provided (on or off site) must be managed and monitored by the 
applicant or an appropriate body funded by the applicant for a minimum period of 30 
years. Annual monitoring reports detailing the sites condition post -enhancement must 
be submitted to the Council each year over this period.  
 
Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect or damage to any of the habitats on 
development sites in order to reduce its biodiversity val ue their deteriorated condition 
will not be taken into consideration and previous ecological records of the site and/or 
the ecological potential of the site will be used to decide the acceptability of any 
development proposals.  
 
 
15.11  Marine Conservation  
15.11.1  A 27km section of coastline, from the Ravenglass Estuary to south Whitehaven 
was designated as an inshore Marine Conservation Zone in 2013 and updated in 
May 2019. The extent of the MCZ can be seen in Figure 10. It includes the Drigg 
Coast SSS I/SAC and St Bees Head SSSI and further details regarding its designation

15.11.2  Marine Conservation Zones (MCZ) are areas that protect a range of nationally 
important, rare or threatened habitats and species. Where the functions of a 
public authority (including the Council) have the p otential to impact on an MCZ 
the authority has an obligation to carry out its functions “ in a manner that best 
furthers the conservation objectives of the MCZ). ” Where this is not possible, to 
authority “ is required to proceed in the manner that least hind ers the 
achievement of the MCZs conservation objectives97”. 
15.11.3  The Local Plan is supported by a Marine Conservation Zone Assessment98 that 
considers the impacts of the Local Plan allocations and policies in the MCZ.  
15.11.4  The Council will consult Natural England at planning application stage where a 
specific proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the objectives of the MCZ.

The Marine Plan  
15.11.5  In 2020, the draft North West Inshore and Of fshore Marine Plan99 was submitted 
to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for adoption, 
following a public consultation earlier in the year. The Plan  covers the north -west 
inshore area, which extends from Solway Firth border to t he River Dee border 
with Wales and North West offshore area which comprises 2,200 square 
kilometres of sea . 
15.11.6  The Marine Plan covers:  
• the area from mean high water spring tide to 12nm  
•  any area submerged at mean high water spring tide  
•  the waters of any estuary, river or channel, so far as the tide flows at mean 
high water spring tide  
• waters in any area which is closed (permanently or intermittently) by a lock or 
other artificial mean s against the regular action of the tide, but into and from 
which seawater is caused or permitted to flow (continuously or occasionally)

 15.11.7  The Marine Plan identifies areas where particular activities could best take place 
and contains a number of policies that set out requirements that will be placed 
on developments within the above areas.  
15.11.8  The following policy highlights the importance of the Marine Plan, highlighting 
the fact that it is a material consideration when determining planning 
applicatio ns.  
15.11.9  It should also be noted that applicants may also require an appropriate license 
from the Marine Management Organisation.  
 
Strategic Policy N4PU:  Marine Planning   
 
 
Where development has potential to harm (directly or indirectly) the marine 
environment, full consideration will be given to objectives of the Marine Conservation 
Zone and the North West  Marine Plan. Proposals should accord with relevant policies 
within the Marine Plan, taking account of economic, environmental and social 
consider ations, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
 
15.12  Water Resources  
15.12.1  A high quality water environment supports wildlife, provides quality of life 
benefits, and can support local economies, boosting land and property values, 
agriculture, tourism and recreation. Where it is not properly planned for, new 
development can increase pressure on the water environment. Planned 
development can provide opportunities to protect and enhance the water quality. 
Pressures on the water enviro nment arise from point sources such as discharges 
from wastewater treatment, and from diffuse sources such as urban and rural 
water run -off. Development should ensure there is adequate waste water 
treatment infrastructure to ensure no deterioration in wate r quality.  
15.12.2  The current River Basin Management Plan (the North West River Basin 
Management Plan) requires the restoration and enhancement of water bodies to 
prevent deterioration and promote recovery of water bodies. Any development 
should safeguard these i mportant water resources and protect and improve 
water quality with an overall aim of getting water bodies to ‘good’ status as 
defined by the Water Framework Directive.  
15.12.3  Copeland has 4 designated Bathing Water beaches at Haverigg, Silecroft, Seascale 
and St  Bees and all comply with the standards outlined in the Bathing Water 
Directive . 
15.12.4  Silecroft and St Bees are both classed as excellent water quality, Seascale is Good 
and Haverigg is Sufficient. Further investment to improve water quality in the 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
202 
 Duddon catch ment is required to protect Haverigg from the risk of failing future 
assessment.  
15.12.5  Copeland has 2 designated Shellfish Waters on the Duddon estuary and at 
Ravenglass, and microbial water quality has improved to enable them to achieve 
the Water Framework Dire ctive requirement for Shellfish Water Protected Areas.  
15.12.6  There are 30 river waterbodies designated under the Water Framework Directive 
in the area covered by the Plan. The 2019 classification results showed that, of 
these 13 are currently achieving ‘Good’; 1 3 are achieving ‘Moderate’ and 4 are 
classified as ‘Poor’ ecological status/potential.  
15.12.7  Policy N5PU below aims to protect watercourses from further decline. Any new 
discharge into a watercourse (or work with it) may require consent from Cumbria 
County Counc il as the Lead Local Flood Authority or the Environment Agency 
depending on whether it is a main river or not.  
 
Policy N5PU: Protection of  Water Resources  
 
 
 
New development must seek to protect or improve the quality of surface and 
groundwater water resources, including designated coastal Bathing Waters and Shellfish 
Waters downstream. Proposals should follow the hierarchy for wastewater treatment 
with foul drainage connected to mains sewer wherever possible.  New development 
should n ot be operational or occupied until such time as adequate waste water 
infrastructure has been provided . 
 
The possibility of contamination from former uses on any application site and its effects 
on the water environment and human health needs to be conside red and remediated 
where it is present.  
 
Proposals will be required to support the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, 
including the objectives for Protected Areas (such as Bathing Waters and Shellfish 
Waters) as set out in the North West River Ba sin Management Plan.  
 
New development should ensure there is sufficient water resource available to meet 
current and future needs, without putting the environment at risk. Wherever possible 
development should include water efficiency and saving measures.  
 
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
203 
 15.13  Landscape  
Landscape Character  
15.13.1  The borough contains a diverse range of landscapes, including a large area 
covered by the Lake District National Park. The Sandford Principle states that 
“Where irreconcilable conflicts exist between conservation and public enjoyment 
in National Parks then conservation interest should take priority .” It is therefore 
important that full consideration is given to the impact of development in the 
Local Plan area on the setting of the National Park.  
15.13.2  Landsc ape character is defined as the distinct, recognisable and consistent 
pattern of elements in the landscape. The Cumbria Landscape Character 
Assessment (CLCA) Guidance and Toolkit, published in 2011, identifies 13 
different broad landscape character types i n Copeland, and each has up -to 4 sub -
types within it (totalling 20 sub -types). These range from the foothills which 
fringe the Lakeland fells, to the central lowland which occupies a sign ificant  
proportion of the borough outside the National Park, and the coastal margins, 
which provide an edge to the borough along the Irish Sea and Duddon Estuary.  
15.13.3  The CLCA describes the different character of each landscape type and provides 
guidance regarding how to retain their distinctiveness.  
15.13.4  A review of the landscape character types identified in the CCC document has 
been carried out and the findings are included in the Landscape Character 
Assessment (Areas outside Settlements) 2021. Of the 20 sub -areas assessed, 12 
have been identified as having no or limited change s ince 2011 and 8 have 
changed and their sensitivity to development has been reassessed.  
15.13.5  The Council have also published a Settlement Landscape Character Assessment 
(SLCA) which reviews the assessments in the CLCA to ensure it remains up -to-date 
in and arou nd existing settlements. As part of the review process the SLCA also 
considered whether there were any sub -areas within the wider landscape areas 
defined in the county document and a number of additional sub -areas were 
identified.  
15.13.6  The SLCA assessed the se nsitivity of each sub -area and the capacity of each to 
accommodate change. It also : 
• identifies prominent hillsides and areas of strategic green infrastructure  
• proposes areas of green wedges between settlements to prevent them from 
merging and to help reta in their character  
• identifies where development may provide an opportunity to enhance 
landscapes, for example by better defining a settlement edge or reinforcing 
positive landscape characteristics.  
15.13.7  Developers will be expected to consider the LCA and SLCA, and where 
appropriate100 the Lake District National Park Landscape Character Assessment 
 
100 For example where the proposal may affect the setting of the Lake District National Park  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
204 
 and Guidelines document 2018101, when identifying sites for development, giving 
full consideration to the landscape characteristics of their chosen site. 
Development on p rominent hillsides and within strategic green infrastructure and 
green wedges should be avoided where possible.  
15.13.8  Where necessary, development proposals will be required to include landscaping 
schemes that retain any existing landscape features, reinforce local landscape 
character and mitigate against any adverse visual impact. Development specific 
landscape schemes are discussed in the Development Standards chapter.  
 
Strategic Policy N6PU : Landscape Protection  
 
 
 
The borough’s landscapes will be  protected and enhanced by:  
 
a) Supporting proposals which enhance the value of the borough’s landscapes;  
b) Protecting all landscapes from inappropriate change by ensuring that 
development conserves and enhances the distinctive characteristics of that 
particu lar area in a manner commensurate with their statutory status and value;  
c) Ensuring development proposals demonstrate that their location, scale, design 
and materials will conserve and where possible enhance the natural beauty, 
wildlife and cultural heritag e of the Lake District National Park and Heritage 
Coast where proposals could impact on its setting and views into and from the 
National Park or Heritage Coast;  
d) Requiring a Landscape Appraisal, and where appropriate a Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment, to be submitted where development has the potential to 
impact upon landscape character or a protected landscape. Where harm is 
identified the development will only be permitted where the benefits of the 
development outweigh any potential harm a nd mitigation and compensation 
measures must be provided . 
 
Proposals will be assessed according to whether the proposed structures and associated 
landscaping relates well in terms of visual impact, scale, character, amenity value and 
local distinctiveness and the cumulative impact of developments will be taken into 
account as part of this assessment.   
 
Consideration must be given to the Council’s Landscape Character Assessment, 
Settlement Landscape Character Assessment and the Cumbria Landscape Character 
Guidance and Toolkit at the earliest stage.

 Heritage Coast  
15.13.9  The most prominent feature of the undeveloped coast, St Bees Head, is a large 
outcrop of sandstone which provides building materials in the locality. A 6km 
stretch of St Bees Head is a nationally defined  Heritage Coast, the only one of its 
kind in the Nort h West England. Natural England, the Colourful Coast Partnership 
and Copeland Borough Council have made a commitment to extend the Heritage 
Coast northwards towards Whitehaven102. 
15.13.10  The purpose of the Heritage C oast designation is to : 
• “conserve, protect and e nhance:    
o the natural beauty of the coastline  
o their terrestrial, coastal and marine flora and fauna  
o their heritage features  
• encourage and help the public to enjoy, understand and appreciate these 
areas  
• maintain and improve the health of inshore waters affecting heritage coasts 
and their beaches through appropriate environmental management measures  
• take account of the needs of agriculture, forestry and fishing and the 
economic and social needs of the small communities on these coast ”103 
15.13.11  St Bees Head provides important bird habitat and hosts a SSSI/RSPB Reserve 
along the sandstone cliffs. Managing the undeveloped coast for biodiversity 
remains a council priority and the opportunity should be taken to produce a 
Management Plan for the area that protects and enhances the Heritage Coast, 
whilst encouraging residents and visitors to use it for recreation.  
 
Strategic Policy N7PU : St Bees and Whitehaven Heritage Coast  
 
 
 
New development within the vicinity of the Heritage Coast must conserve, protect and 
enhance the Heritage coast and its setting and take opportunities to encourage the 
public to enjoy and understand the area by improving public access and interpretation 
where possible. Developers should demonstrate that they have taken into consideration 
the features that contribute to the special character of the area and the importance of 
its conservation.  
 
Inappropriate development includes that which affects views withi n or towards/from 
the Heritage Coast.   
 
 
102 https://colourfulcoast.org.uk/about/heritage -coast -extension/   
103 Natural England  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
206 
 Major development within the Heritage Coast is unlikely to be appropriate unless it is 
compatible with its special character and will only be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances.  
 
 
15.14  The Undeveloped Coast  
15.14.1  Copeland’ s undeveloped coast is one of its best assets and is shown on the 
Proposals Map. It includes a number of Cumbria’s best bathing beaches, a 
significant number of nature conservation and wildlife sites, and high quality 
landscapes.  
15.14.2  The SLCA  and LCA  acknowle dges that the undeveloped coast, which includes the 
St Bees and Whitehaven  Heritage Coast, is sensitive to change in landscape terms. 
Given the above, development along the undeveloped coast will be resisted, with 
the exception of a limited number of particular types. These are listed within 
Policy N8PU below.  
15.14.3  In exceptional cases, energy developments, particularly those that help the 
country meet identified targets relating to climate change, will be permitted. In 
such cases evidence must be submitted to demonstrate, to the Council’s 
satisfaction, why such a lo cation is required.  
 
Strategic Policy N8PU: The Undeveloped Coast  
 
 
 
The Council will ensure that the landscape character of the undeveloped coast is 
maintained by conserving the intrinsic qualities, natural beauty and open character of 
the undeveloped c oast from inappropriate development. Inappropriate development 
includes that which affects views within or towards/from the St Bees and Whitehaven  
Heritage Coast.  
 
The following types of development will however be supported:  
 
• Development which supports the management of the undeveloped coast for 
biodiversity;  
• Development which provides or improves safe access to and interpretation of 
the undeveloped coast for residents and visitors such as appropriate fencing, 
signage and interpretation boards;  
• Energy ge nerating developments that that require a coastal location along the 
undeveloped coast, provided that the potential impacts on biodiversity, 
landscape and heritage assets are carefully assessed against the benefits.  Where 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
207 
 negative impacts are likely these  must be mitigated against and compensated 
for.  
 
 
15.15  Green Infrastructure (GI)  
15.15.1  The NPPF, paragraph 17 5, states  that plans should take a strategic approach to 
maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green infrastructure.  
15.15.2  Green infrastructure can play an important role in reducing the effects of climate 
change, providing space for recreation and leisure,  providing important habitats 
and having positive impacts upon 
people’s health and well -being.  
15.15.3  Developers should give early 
consideration to how new areas 
of green infrastructure can be 
incorporated into developments 
and how existing areas of green 
infras tructure could be better 
connected, and green links to the 
open countryside improved. 
Developers may be required to 
support green infrastructure 
through contributions relevant to 
their proposal as set out in the Development Standards chapter.  
15.15.4  The Council’s  evidence base documents have identified a number of types of 
green infrastructure within the borough as listed below:  
• Prominent Hillsides : Open, undeveloped hillsides and open skylines that 
contribute to the landscape character of the borough’s towns and villages.  
• Strategic Green Infrastructure : Strong network of GI sites that provide a 
recreational and wildlife resource as well as being important in providing 
structure to the landscape setting of the area’s towns and villages.  
• Green Wedges : Areas that help define and strengthen a sense of pl ace in 
individual settlements and provide separation between settlements and a 
clear distinction between town and country  
• Local Green Spaces: Smaller local green spaces of high quality and value that 
meet the NPPF definition of Local Green Space.   
• Protected Green Spaces: Green spaces that the Open Space Assessment 
identifies as being of high quality and value but do not meet the NPPF 
definition of Local Green Space  
• Open Countryside: Rural areas outside defined settlement boundaries  Green  Infrastructure  
A network of multi -functional green 
space, urban and rural, which is 
capable of delivering a wide range of 
environmental and quality of life 
benefits for local communities.  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
208 
 • Smaller open spac es and private gardens: Private gardens and smaller open 
spaces such as grass verges can contribute to the character of an area, have 
positive impacts upon health and well -being, provide space for biodiversity 
and can help mitigate flooding.  
15.15.5  A Green Infras tructure Strategy will shortly be commissioned to pull each of these 
elements of GI together and provide an overall strategy for their protection and 
enhancement. Consideration will be given to the relationships between the GI 
network and Local Nature Reco very Network. The Council will work proactively 
with partners and the community to maintain and increase the amount of GI 
provision across the borough over the Plan period and development that 
enhances areas of Green Infrastructure will be supported in principle.  
 
Strategic Policy N9PU – Green Infrastructure  
 
 
 
A comprehensive, high quality network of green infrastructure will be identified through 
a Green Infrastructure Strategy for the Copeland Local Plan Area. This network will 
connect our towns and  villages to the more rural parts of the borough and the coastline 
and will be formed of a variety of GI types including open countryside, green wedges, 
protected green spaces, local green spaces, rivers, ponds, grass verges, woodlands and 
trees, private g ardens, green walls and green roofs.  
 
The amount of green infrastructure on the development site should be maximised and 
developers should take opportunities to create new connections, expand networks and 
enhance existing green infrastructure to support th e movement of plants and animals. 
Green infrastructure should be multi -functional where possible and should be 
considered at the start of the design process.  
 
 
Green Wedges  
15.15.6  The SLCA states that “ Much of Copeland is characterised by small, nucleated or 
linear settlements separated from each other by open countryside. These green 
wedges perform a number of important functions. They help to define and 
strengthen a sense of place in individual settlements, providing a clear distinction 
between town and country . They form a connection between areas of different 
landscape character, in particular connecting inland hills to the sea .” 
15.15.7  The SLCA identifies 7 key green wedges across the borough which are shown on 
the Proposals Map. Development within a green wedge will be supported only in 
exceptional circumstances (for example single dwellings), where separation 
between settlements and the open character of the Wedge is maintained and the 
characteristics of the Wedge identified in the SLCA are conserved or en hanced. 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
209 
 When considering the impact upon the open character of a green wedge, the 
impact upon views across the green wedge will be considered.  
 
Strategic Policy N10PU: Green Wedges  
 
 
 
The Local Plan Proposals Map identifies Green Wedges within the borough.  
 
Development will only be permitted within a Green Wedge in the following 
circumstances , unless the economic, environmental or social benefits of the proposal 
significantly and demon strably outweigh any harm:  
 
• where the open character of the Green Wedge and separation between 
settlements is maintained; and  
• where the special characteristics and quality of the landscape are conserved and 
enhanced . 
 
 
Protected Green Spaces  
15.15.8  There are a range of smaller open spaces within the borough which are important 
for recreation, health and well -being and/or biodiversity. The Local Plan is 
supported by an Open Space Assessment (OSA)  and Open Space Assessment 2021 
Addendum  that identifies what open space provision exists in the area based on 
the following typologies.  
15.15.9  The 2021 Addendum was produced to give consideration to  open spaces in 
Kirksanton as these were not included in the ori ginal assessment. This is because 
at the time of the original assessment, Kirksanton was not being considered as a 
settlement within the hierarchy. The update identifies that an additional Local 
Green Space should be included at Kirksanton Village Green.  
15.15.10  The provision of playing fields and pitches is discussed in the Copeland’s Health 
chapter and is considered in the Council’s Playing Pitch Strategy, which forms part 
of the wider Sports and Physical Activity Strategy.  
Table 17: Open S pace Assessment Typologies

areas, MUGAs, skateboard areas and teenage shelters.  
Allotments  Opportunities for those people who wish to do so to grow 
their own produce as part of the long term promotion of 
sustainability, health and social inclusion.  
Cemeteries, churchyards 
and other burial grounds  Burial of the dead and quiet contemplation, often linked to 
wildlife and biodiversity promotion.  
Civic space  Provides a setting for civic buildings, public demonstrations 
and community events  
 
15.15.11  The OSA assesses the quality and value of open spaces in the borough, including 
those that are currently protected in the Core Strategy and identifies whether 
there is a surplus or shortage of open space on a settlement basis, compared to 
the borough average.  
15.15.12  The OSA  identifies where there are shortages identified in  the overall provision of 
open space or in particular typologies by settlement. This will be taken into 
account when determining whether developer contributions will be required to 
address any areas of under -provision as set out in the Strategy and Standar ds 
chapter.  
15.15.13  Large strategic scale open spaces, that serve an area greater than a specific 
settlement e.g. areas of coastline are not taken into account when determining 
settlement provision as they serve a wider area.  
15.15.14  Based on the quality and value assessm ents, the OSA recommends that over 250 
open spaces in the borough’s settlements are protected from development 
where possible; this is almost double the number that are protected within the 
Core Strategy. The proposed protected spaces are identified on the  Council’s 
Proposals Map  and on the settlement maps within Appendix B . 
15.15.15  Policy N11PU does not just protect those spaces recommended in the OSA, but 
also those which may come forward in the future, for example, as part of a new 
development, where there is ev idence that they are of value to the community. 
Evidence of community value may include evidence of community usage.  
 
Strategic Policy N11PU: Protected Green Spaces  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
211 
  
The Local Plan Proposals Map identifies Protected Green spaces which are of a high 
quality and/or value.  
 
Development proposals that enhance Protected Green Spaces will be supported where 
they accord with the Development Plan.  
 
The loss of such Protected  Green Spaces will be resisted unless equivalent replacement 
provision of the same or better quality is provided within the same settlement.  
 
Proposals to develop other green spaces, including play areas and allotments not 
identified on the Proposals Map, should also comply with this policy where there is 
evidence that they are of value to the community . 
 
 
Local Green Spaces (LGS)  
15.15.16  The NPPF allows Local Planning Authorities to apply tighter restrictions on certain 
areas of open space that are particularly i mportant to local communities, by 
designating them as Local Green Spaces. Local Green Spaces should be given the 
same level of protection as Green Belts and are protected under the NPPF 
regardless of whether the Council can identify a 5 -year supply of deli verable 
housing sites or not, whereas standard protected green spaces are more 
vulnerable.  
15.15.17  Paragraph 10 1 of the NPPF states the following:  
“The Local Green Space designation should only be used where the green space is:  
a) in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves;  
b) demonstrably special to a local community and holds a particular local 
significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, recreational 
value (including as a playing field ), tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and  
c) local in character and is not an extensive tract of land .” 
15.15.18  The OSA  Addendum 2021  proposes that 113 sites are designated as Local Green 
Spaces across the borough, 42 of which are in Whitehaven. These site s are 
identified on the Proposals Map  and in Appendi x B. An addendum to the OSA was 
produced in 2021 that considers open spaces in Kirksanton as these were not 
included in the original assessment. This is because at the time of the original 
assessment, Kirksanton was not being considered as a settlement within t he 
hierarchy. The update identifies that an additional Local Green Space should be 
included at Kirksanton Village Green.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
212 
 15.15.19  The Council has produced a Local Green Spaces Evidence Paper provides further 
details regarding each proposed LGS to support their des ignation. This was 
updated in 2021 to include the village green in Kirksanton discussed  above.   
15.15.20  It should be noted that the 2021 Addendum, and earlier Assessment,  
recommended  a Local Green Space in Distington. This comprises a former housing 
site that has now been cleared and is being taken forward through the Plan as a 
housing allocation. The LGS designation on this site recognises the importance of 
retaining a high level (at least 50%) of the site for open space.  
15.15.21  A number of Local Green Spaces contain pla ying pitches. The policy below allows 
development within the LGS that enhances existing sporting uses, such as new 
lighting, subject to certain criteria.  When considering proposals for development 
that may affect playing fields consideration should be give n to the policies SC3PU 
and SC4PU.  
 
Strategic Policy N12PU: Local Green Spaces  
 
 
 
The Local Plan Proposals Map identifies important Local Green Spaces. Development will 
only be permitted within a Local Green Space in the following circumstances, where th e 
open character of the Space and its community value is not compromised:  
 
• Proposals which improve access to/from and within the LGS, or  
• Proposals which provide opportunities for outdoor sport and recreation or the 
enhancement of existing sports use on the site, or  
• Proposals which allow a wider range of uses to take place within the LGS, or  
• Proposals which enhance landscapes and visual amenity, or  
• Proposals which provide/enhance habitats.  
 
Development on sites adjacent to Local Green Spaces should provide an attractive 
frontage, natural surveillance and strong pedestrian connections to the LGS.  
 
 
15.16  Trees , Woodland and Hedgerows  
15.16.1  Trees , woodland  and hedgerows  are an important resource, providing habitat and 
shade, improving the character of the built and natural environment and helping 
to reduce air and noise pollution and surface water run -off. They are also 
important feature s for health and well -being, with woodlands providing 
opportunities for outdoor exercise and social cohesion.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
213 
 15.16.2  Woodland cov er across Copeland is 10.4%, this is lower than the national average 
of 12%. Much of this cover is in the form of large dense green fern plots that are 
not publicly accessible.  
15.16.3  The borough contains a number of ancient woodlands and trees protected by 
Tree Preservation Orders as shown on the Proposals Map. The Council has 
ambitions to increase the amount of tree and woodland cover in the borough and 
is exploring the opportunities available to create a strategic Copeland Forest, 
which could form part of a wid er Cumbria Coastal Community Forest, Policy 
CO6PU discusses the potential for a community forest further.  
15.16.4  Whilst the planting of trees is not classed as development requiring planning 
permission, the Council will support proposals for the creation of new w oodlands 
in principle where they are well connected to established woodlands, landscaped 
areas or open spaces, are accessible to the public; and comprise a mix of locally 
native species.  
15.16.5  The Council also encourages developers to include tree planting as p art of their 
proposals where possible in order to contribute to contribute to an increase in 
cover across the borough.  Hedgerows should be used as boundary treatments 
where appropriate as the can support an abundance of species and enable 
species movement unlike solid walls and fences.  
15.16.6  The NPPF, states in paragraph 1 80 that “development resulting in the loss or 
deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or 
veteran trees) should be refused, unless there are wholly exception al reasons and 
a suitable compensation strategy exists .” Policy N13PU below supports this 
approach.  
 
Policy N13PU: Woodlands, Trees and Hedgerows  
 
 
 
Existing trees and hedgerows which contribute positively to the visual amenity and 
environmental value of their location will be protected. Developers are encouraged to 
incorporate tree planting and hedgerows into new developments where possible and 
appropriate.  
 
Development proposals which are likely to affect any trees within the borou gh will be 
required to:  
1) Include an arboricultural assessment as to whether any of those trees are worthy of 
retention and protection by means of a Tree Preservation Order  
2) Submit proposals to replace or relocate any trees that are to be removed with net 
provision at a minimum ratio of 2:1. Replacement trees should be on site and with 
native species where possible.  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
214 
 Any proposed works to trees within Conservation Areas, or those with Tree Protection 
Orders, will be required to include an arboricultural survey  to justify why works are 
necessary and that the works proposed will, where possible, not adversely affect the 
amenity value of the area.  
 
New development should not result in the loss of or damage to ancient woodland or 
veteran or aged trees outside wood land unless there are wholly exceptional reasons and 
a compensation strategy exists. This could include Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Projects and Orders under the Transport and Works Act.  
 
 
Community Growing Spaces  
15.16.7  Community growing spaces help foster resident’s health and well -being, enable 
social interactions and mitigate against the effects of climate change. Their 
importance in this respect is recognised in Strategic Policy SC1PU (health and 
well-being). They als o provide a learning environment where people can learn 
more about the natural environment and pick up many transferable skills.  
15.16.8  Policy N14PU encourages the creation of community growing spaces such as 
community growing space at William Morris Avenue, Cle ator Moor.  The Local 
Plan also protects existing allotments through Policies N 9 and N11  above.  
15.16.9  Where the site is Council owned the Community Asset Transfer104 process will be 
followed to allow such spaces to be managed and maintained by Town or Parish 
Coun cils or community groups.  
 
104 Further information regarding the process can be found here: https://mycommunity.org.uk/files/downloads/Download -
Understanding -Community -Asset -Transfer.pdf    
Policy N14PU – Community Growing Spaces  
 
 
 
The Council will support opportunities for the creation of community -led growing spaces 
(including allotments and urban orchards) on disused council owned sites where such 
spaces are to be managed and maintained by Town or Parish councils or community 
grou ps where appropriate.  
 
Growing Spaces must not have a detrimental impact upon the street -scene through 
inappropriate fencing or paraphernalia and adequate levels of parking should be available 
in close proximity to the site.

 16.2 Copeland’s Built Environment  
Copeland’s Towns  
16.2.1  Whitehaven was Britain's first post -renaissance planned town, with its town 
centre set out in a grid iron pattern. The oldest streets in the planned town are 
King Street and Chapel Street, which were laid out in the 1640s  
16.2.2  Egremont was founded with its cast le in 1192, and although by the 17th century 
the castle had fallen into ruins, the town continued to use a room there as 
courthouse until the 18th century. Egremont is now an attractive market town.  
16.2.3  Cleator Moor and Millom are former mining towns, with coa l mining in Cleator 
Moor starting in 1788. Development in Millom supported the Hodbarrow iron 
mine, which was developed in the early 1860s and later became ‘the most 
productive haematite mine in the British Isles’. Mining has now ceased in both 
towns but t he landscape and built character of the towns still contains evidence 
of its mining history.  
Copeland’s Rural Areas  
16.2.4  The built form of Copeland’s rural villages is described within the Settlement 
Landscape Character Assessment. This varies from linear villa ges built along a 
main road to more rounded, nucleated villages with a central core.  
16.3 Heritage Assets  
16.3.1  The NPPF,  paragraph 18 9, defines heritage assets as ranging from “ sites and 
buildings of local historic value to those of the highest significance, such as World 
Heritage Sites which are internationally recognised to be of Outstanding Universal 
Value ”. They are important reminders of our past, provide a sense of character 
and place and enhance civic pride.  
16.3.2  Copeland contains a wealth of h eritage assets, including the Lake District National 
Park World Heritage Site (outside but adjoining the Plan area), elements of 
Hadrian’s Wall Frontiers of the Roman Empire  World Heritage Site, 483 listed 
buildings, 120 scheduled ancient monuments (SAMs) and 8 conservation areas. 
Heritage assets are identified on the Proposals Map, with Conservation Areas and 
SAMs also shown in Figure 11 below.  
  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
218 
 Figure 11: Copeland's Heritage Assets  
 
 
16.3.3  The NPPF , paragraph 1 90, states that “ Plans s hould set out a positive strategy for 
the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment ”. Policy  BE1PU does 
this by listing the actions that the Council will take to conserve and enhance the 
borough’s historic environment.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
219 
 16.4 Impacts of Development on Heritage  
16.4.1  The Council has produced a suite of Heritage Impact Assessments which identify 
potential harm to heritage assets caused by future development on allocated 
sites. A number of Conservation Area Appraisals have also be en produced.  
16.4.2  When assessing constraints on the prop osed allocations consideration was also 
given to the Cumbria Historic Landscape Character Assessments105 produced in 
2009 and the associated GIS. These identify features of historic interest such as 
former areas of parl iamentary enclosure and those areas featuring some of the 
county's most ancient farms.  Council officers concluded that the proposed 
allocations were unlikely to cause harm to any such features.  
Heritage Statements  
16.4.3  A Heritage Statement should be submitted a longside any planning application for 
development that affects a heritage asset or its setting. This should include a clear 
description of the significance of the asset which is affected, including any 
contribution made by its setting.  
16.4.4  The Statement shoul d also include:  
• an assessment of how the proposal will impact upon the significance of the 
asset;  
• full justification to demonstrate why the chosen option is the most 
appropriate; and  
• details of how any harm will be mitigated, and where appropriate, 
compens ated for  
16.4.5  The level of detail included within the Statement should be proportionate to the 
asset’s importance.  
 
Strategic Policy BE1PU: Heritage Assets  
 
 
 
Heritage assets and their setting will be conserved and enhanced by:  
• Requiring a heritage impact assessment or heritage statement where the proposal 
would affect a heritage asset  
• Maintaining up -to-date records of the character and significance of Conservation 
Areas through conservation area appraisals and management plans  
• Giving great weight to  the conservation of Copeland’s designated heritage assets 
when decision making  
• Ensuring that new development is sympathetic to local character and history  
 
105 https://cumbria.gov.uk/planning -environment/count ryside/historic -environment/histlandcharacter.asp  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
220 
 • Promoting heritage -led regeneration initiatives in the borough, particularly within 
the town centre s 
• Continuing to identify heritage assets that are “at risk” and work with partners to 
develop strategies for their protection  
• Supporting proposals for the appropriate reuse of vacant historic buildings, 
recognising that putting buildings into viable uses c onsistent with their 
conservation can help sustain and enhance their significance  
• Supporting proposals that increase the enhancement, promotion and 
interpretation of the borough’s architectural and archaeological resources  
• Conserving and enhancing the Out standing the Universal Value of the Frontiers of 
the Roman Empire (Hadrian’s Wall) and English Lake District World Heritage Site 
including their integrity and authenticity. Proposals that may have an impact on the 
World Heritage Sites or their setting shou ld accord with the World Heritage Site 
\Management Plan.  
• Producing a local list of non -statutory but locally important heritage assets which 
are of architectural or historic interest or make a significant contribution to the 
character and/or appearance of the area . 
• Strengthening the distinctive character of the borough’s settlements, through the 
application of high -quality design and architecture that respects this character and 
enhances the setting of heritage assets . 
 
16.5 Designated Heritage Assets  
World Heritage Sites  
16.5.1  Development that conserves and where possible enhances, or better reveals, the 
Outstanding Universal Value of the borough’s two World Heritage Sites (the 
English Lake District and the Frontiers of the Roman Empire Hadrian’s Wall) will 
be supported in principle.  
16.5.2  Proposals which are likely to have an effect upon World Heritage Sites should be 
determined in accordance with Policy BE2P U (Designated Heritage Assets).  
Listed Buildings  
16.5.3  When determining applications relating to listed building s or their setting, the 
Council has a duty under Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and 
Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to have special regard to the desirability of 
preserving  the building  or its setting or any features of special architectural  or 
historic interest  which it has. In this context, preservation does not mean keeping 
it unchanged, but rather keeping the historic interest unharmed.  
16.5.4  The decision in the Barnwell vs East Northamptonshire DC 2014 case made it 
clear that in enacting this duty, Local Planning Au thorities should give 
“considerable importance and weight ” to the desirability of preserving the setting 
of listed buildings’ when carrying out the planning balancing exercise.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
221 
 16.5.5  Policy BE2PU is relevant to proposals affecting listed buildings and their sett ing 
and takes into account the duty and guidance within chapter 16 of the NPPF  
Conservation Areas  
16.5.6  When considering any  planning  application  that affects a conservation area  
special attention must be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the 
character or appearance of that area. Development must be sensitive to its 
surroundings, and make a positive contribution to local character and 
disti nctiveness, with consideration given to the Conservation Area Design Guide 
Supplementary Planning Document, adopted in 2017, and any relevant 
Conservation Area Appraisal.  
16.5.7  When identifying harm consideration should be given to the following factors at 
the earliest stage:  
• the significance of views into and out of the Area and vistas and glimpses 
within the area  
• the positioning, grouping and layout of buildings within the Area  
• the prevalent architectural styles and building materials within the Area  
• the size  and scale of buildings and plots  
• the level and types of enclosure created by buildings and boundary treatments 
and the importance of open spaces between buildings  
• Existing landscaping (both soft and hard) including trees, walls, surfacing etc.  
16.5.8  Policy BE2P U is relevant to proposals within or affecting the setting of the 
borough’s Conservation Areas.   
16.5.9  Policy BE2PU also applies to proposals affecting non -designated heritage assets of 
archaeological interest which are demonstrably of equivalent significance to 
scheduled monuments in accordance with Footnote 63 of the NPPF.  
 
Policy BE2PU: Designated Herit age Assets  
 
 
Development should preserve or enhance designated heritage assets (or an 
archaeological site of national importance) and their setting. The more important the 
asset, the greater weight that will be given to its conservation. Proposals that better 
reveal the significance of heritage assets will be supported in principle.  
 
Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset will require clear 
and convincing justification. Development that will lead to substa ntial harm to, or total 
loss of significance to, a designated heritage asset, will only be accepted where there are 
substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or in such cases listed within National 
Policy.  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
222 
 Substantial harm to, or loss of:  
• grade I I listed buildings, or grade II registered parks or gardens, should be 
exceptional;  
• scheduled monuments, protected wreck sites, registered battlefields, grade I and II* 
listed buildings, grade I and II* registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage 
Sites, should be wholly exceptional  
 
Where a proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a 
designated heritage asset, this harm will be weighed against the public benefits of the 
proposal.  
 
Regardless of the level of harm, where pro posals result in the loss of all or part of a 
heritage asset all reasonable steps must be taken by the developer to ensure that new 
development will proceed after the loss has occurred.  
 
Proposals that preserve or enhance the character or appearance of a Conservation Area, 
especially those elements which have been identified in a Conservation Area Appraisal 
as making a positive contribution to its significance will be supported.  
 
Demolition within a Conservation Area will only be permitted where the buildi ng does 
not make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Area.  
 
 
16.6 Archaeology  
16.6.1  Archaeological remains are important to help us understand the human past. 
Caution must be taken where there are potential archaeological remains on site 
to help ensure they are preserved in the best condition possible.  
16.6.2  Cumbria County Council hold a database containing over 27,000 records of known 
archaeological sites, finds, landscapes, buildings and other aspects of the historic 
environment across Cu mbria. This is known as the Historic Environment 
Record106. 
16.6.3  In accordance with national planning guidance, where an initial assessment 
indicates that the site on which development is proposed includes or has 
potential to include heritage assets with archaeo logical interest, applicants are 
required to submit an appropriate desk -based assessment and, where necessary, 
a field evaluation.  
16.6.4  The NPPF, Footnote 6 8, states that non -designated archaeological sites can be of 
equal significance to a Scheduled Monument a nd where this is the case such sites 
are subject to the same Policies as for a designated heritage asset. In such cases 
the development must comply with the above Policy BE2PU unless material 
 
106 https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/planning -environment/countryside/historic -environment/her.asp  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
223 
 considerations indicate otherwise.  Not all sites of archaeologi cal interest will be 
of national interest , however but this does not mean they are not valuable to our 
understanding of the past.  
 
Policy BE3PU: Archaeology  
 
 
Proposals affecting archaeological sites of less than national importance (or local 
significance) should conserve those elements which contribute to their significance in 
line with the importance of the remains. Where there are potential archaeological 
interests on the site, a desk -based assessment must be submitted alongside the planning  
application and where this identifies that archaeological interests are likely, a field 
evaluation will be required.  
 
Development must protect, and should where possible, reveal and allow public 
interpretation of, any archaeological remains in situ. Where  remains cannot be 
preserved or managed in situ the developer will be required to make suitable provision 
for excavation and recording before and during development. The findings should be 
submitted to the Local Planning Authority and deposited with the Hi storic Environment 
Record.  
 
 
16.7 Non -Designated Heritage Assets  
16.7.1  Non -designated heritage assets are buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or 
landscapes identified as having a degree of heritage significance meriting 
consideration in planning decisions but which do not meet the criteria for 
designated heritage assets.  
16.7.2  The effect of a development on the significance of a non -designated heritage 
asset should be taken into account at an early stage by the applicant and when 
determining the applica tion. The level of detail should be proportionate to the 
asset’s significance. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non -
designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard 
to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.  
16.7.3  Local Authorities and communities are able to produce Local Heritage Lists which 
identify non -designated heritage assets that “ have a degree of significance 
meriting consideration in planning decisions but which  are not formally 
designated ”. Historic England have produced a guidance note, Local Heritage 
Listing Historic England Advice Note 7, for Local Authorities and communities 
creating local lists.  
16.7.4  The Council is currently in the process of producing a Local List, alongside other 
Cumbrian Authorities. In the meantime , non-designated heritage assets will be 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
224 
 identified through Conservation Area appraisals and the development 
management process e.g. following archaeological investigations.  
 
Policy BE4PU: Non -Desi gnated Heritage Assets  
 
 
  
Development should preserve or enhance heritage assets and their setting. Proposals 
that better reveal the significance of heritage assets will be supported in principle.  
 
Proposals affecting non -designated heritage assets or their setting should demonstrate 
that consideration has been given to the significance of any heritage assets affected, 
including any contribution made by their setting. Where the scale of any harm or loss 
and the significance  of the heritage asset outweighs the benefits of the proposal the 
development will be resisted.  
 
Where loss of the whole or part of a non -designated asset is accepted, the developer 
will be required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the new deve lopment will 
proceed after the loss has occurred. The following may also be required:  
 
1) An appropriate level of survey is undertaken and public record made which 
may also include an archaeological excavation;  
2) Provision or replacement of comparable quality and design;  
3) The salvage and reuse of special features within the replacement 
development  
 
 
16.8 Shopfronts  
16.8.1  Shopfronts are a key part of the character of many historic shopping streets and 
conservation areas, but they can be subject to harm through negl ect, removal 
and poor -quality alteration. In light of this the Council ha s prepared a Shop front 
Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) that emphasises the 
importance of these features, maintaining them in good condition, repairing 
them in sensi tive ways, and replacing them appropriately when they have been 
lost in the past.  
  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
225 
  
Policy BE5PU: Shopfronts  
 
 
 
Well designed and appropriate shopfronts, whether original or reproduction, should be 
retained wherever practicable and restored when opportunity arises.  Shopfronts 
should relate in scale, proportion, materials and decorative treatment to the façade of 
the building, Conservation Area and relate well to the upper floors and adjacent 
buildings and/or shopfronts.  
 
Proposals relating to sho pfronts should accord relevant design guidance prepared by 
the Council, including the Shopfront Design Guide SPD.  
 
 
16.9 Advertisements  
16.9.1  The following policy sets out the Councils approach to advertisements both 
within and outside areas of Special Advertisement  Control. The Area of Special 
Advertisement Control is where additional restrictions are placed on the display 
of adverts.  
16.9.2  The Council is currently considering whether to undertake a review of the Area of 
Special Advertisement Control.  
 
Policy BE6PU: Advertisements  
 
 
Applications for consent to display advertisements will be permitted where proposal will 
not have an adverse effect on either amenity or public safety.  
 
Proposals for advertisements and signs will be granted consent where:  
 
a) they do not result in visual clutter in the local area;  
b) they are of a high quality design that is appropriate to their local context in 
terms of materials, size, positioning, styling and method of illumination;  
c) when attached to buildings they respect the building’s scale, proportions and 
architectural features; and  
d) they do not result in unacceptable adverse impacts on public safety.  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
226 
 Proposals for advertisements and signs in the Area  of Special of Control of 
Advertisements and those affecting Heritage Assets and their setting will only be 
granted consent where the following additional criteria are met:  
 
i. they preserve and enhance the special qualities and character appearance of the 
rural landscape, including designated landscapes; Conservation Areas; Listed 
Buildings; other heritage assets and their settings;  
ii. proposals avoid the use of projecting box signs and instead reflect, re -interpret 
or complement traditional hanging sign styles ;  
iii. proposals at development entrances where possible advertise multiple 
businesses to avoid the proliferation of individual signs and clutter; and,  
iv. where illumination is proposed it is considered necessary and is sensitively 
designed for its context, gene rally avoiding internal illumination methods.  
 
Advance directional signs will only be permitted where the additional following criteria 
are met:  
 
1. the need for the sign(s) has been adequately demonstrated, in that the location 
and nature of the premises is such that they cannot reasonably be located 
following normal town or village direction signs; and  
2. the number of signs and their size is limited to the minimum required to 
adequately serve their directional function.

 17.2 Connectivity in Copeland  
17.2.1  Access to goods, services and information, both physically and virtually, is an 
integral part of everyday life, particularly in relation to the isolated geography of 
Copeland.  
17.2.2  In recent years, the demand for innovative solutions to improved connectivity h as 
been on the rise, with improved technology resulting in digitisation of many 
services industries and businesses. This has been catalysed further as a result of 
the Covid -19 pandemic, emphasising the need for more flexible and sustainable 
ways of living and working.  
17.2.3  This need to provide innovative solutions and adapt to a rising demand for digital 
communications technology needs to be combined with high quality, accessible 
transport systems that allow for greater connectivity both within and around 
Copel and.  
17.2.4  Transport systems are vital for economic growth, allowing for the efficient 
movement of goods and services, stimulating business activity and investment 
and attracting and retaining a talented workforce. Building upon our transport 
offer will also im prove the desirability of Copeland as a tourist destination, 
helping to sustain our hospitality industry, support leisure facilities and promote 
our beautiful Lake District and Coastal Location. High levels of accessibility and 
modal choice are also import ant in promoting social inclusion, ensuring that 
everyone has equal access to employment, retail and leisure opportunities. This 
allows for improvements in physical and mental health and wellbeing.  
17.2.5  The following policies set out how Copeland will facilita te innovative and 
aspirational improvements to both digital connectivity and transport 
infrastructure. These factors are equally important and need to be considered as 
a whole in order to fulfil our potential and contribute towards future economic 
growth a nd social resilience.  
17.3 Communications  
17.3.1  Improved digital connectivity is essential for unlocking and supporting economic 
growth as well as improving social wellbeing and resilience within Copeland’s 
communities and workforce.  
17.3.2  Improved digital access also dri ves economic growth through opportunities for 
flexible working patterns. There has been a significant increase in the number of 
people working from home in the last 5 years, with approximately 5% of the 
workforce primarily working from home as of December 2019. As a result of 
Covid -19 restrictions, this figure rose to 49.2% in April 2020 (ONS 2020).  
17.3.3  It is likely that more people will continue to work from home at least on a part 
time basis going forward, with improved opportunities for virtual meetings and  
flexible working patterns becoming an integral part of the working day. This is 
likely to provide a significant number of benefits, including:  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
230 
 • Reducing the need to travel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
decreasing the chance of road traffic accide nts.  
• Freeing up time in the day, meaning workers have more time to engage in 
other activities, relax and spend time with families, which all contribute 
towards mental wellbeing.  
• Opportunities to live away from the workplace, helping to reduce regional 
imbalances (EDNA 2021).  
• Employers can choose to move away from large centralised premises to a 
network of smaller, more affordable premises in rural locations. This is likely 
to encourage people to move away from large cities, potentially in favour of 
attra ctive rural/coastal communities such as Copeland, with less concern for 
physical remoteness.  
• This also allows employers to select the most suitable candidate for a job 
without being restricted by geographical location  
17.3.4  The NPPF , para graph  114, states that:  ‘Planning policies and decisions should 
support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next 
generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections.  
17.3.5  The Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) has a goal to achieve 100% 
coverage of superfast broadband across Cumbria by 2024. According to Think 
Broadband, Copeland had 96.46% coverage of superfast broadband as of May 
2019, which is only slightly lower than the English average.  The Connecting 
Cumbria project  is a partnership between Cumbria County Council and BT. They 
aim to provide as many homes, businesses and visitors with fibre broadband as 
possible. Connecting Cumbria anticipates that to expand fibre broadband services 
to the final proportion of Cumbria’ s population, the project will require additional 
funding.  
17.3.6  The provision of BT Full Fibre technology is currently being trialled at new housing 
developments within the borough. This sends a superfast broadband connection 
directly to the home, offering down load speeds of up to 900Mbps (BT 2020).   In 
addition to this, several broadband providers are currently undertaking trials to 
make broadband provision in new homes without the requirement for a land line. 
This can result in a reduced cost to the individua l by removing the need to pay a 
line rental, contributing to making broadband more accessible to all.  
17.3.7  Copeland is currently exploring the potential for improved digital delivery across 
its towns. Opportunities are currently being explored to create a digi tal grid for 
Whitehaven where people can access secure and free Wi-Fi to support businesses 
in the area and encourage visitors. In addition to this, the Council are working 
with private sector providers to try and secure funding through the Borderlands 
Inclusive Growth Deal. If successful, funding will be provided to adapt Egremont 
Town Centre to allow for the improvement of telecommunications provision, 
enabling better connectivity for homeworkers and businesses.  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
231 
 17.3.8  The NPPF , par agraph 11 5 states that: ‘ the n umber of radio and electronic 
communications masts, and the sites for such installations, should be kept to a 
minimum consistent with the needs of consumers, the efficient operation of the 
network and providing reasonable capacity for future expansion’ .  
‘Local Planning Authorities should not impose a ban on new electronic 
communications development in certain areas, impose blanket Article 4 directions 
over a wide area or a wide range of electronic communications development, or 
insist on minimum distances between new electronic communications development 
and existing development .’ (Para 116)  
 
‘Applications for electronic communications development (including applications 
for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order (GDPO)) should 
be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development  (Para 
117).  
 
Strategic Policy CO1PU: Telecommunications and Digital Connectivity   
 
    
 
The Council will support the continued provision of infrastructure that extends and 
improves digital connectivity across all parts of Copeland, particularly where it provides 
access to 5G and gigabit capable full fibre technology.  
  
New development will b e supported where it enables the enhancement of Copeland’s 
digital infrastructure without harming the existing street scene or amenity. Adverse 
impacts on the successful functioning of existing digital infrastructure should be avoided 
or mitigated where po ssible.   
 
This will be subject to appropriate safeguarding to protect sensitive sites, including those 
protected for their biodiversity value, important landscapes and heritage assets.  
 
 
17.4 Transport networks within and around Copeland  
17.4.1  Providing access to high quality transport systems is a fundamental aspect of 
development as it improves equality, allowing people to access jobs and services, 
enjoy leisure opportunities and spend time with friends and family. This also 
improves the abili ty for businesses to access suppliers, markets and labour, and 
for visitors to appreciate what Copeland has to offer. This is particularly important 
given the rural nature of the borough.  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
232 
 17.4.2  The main highway route through Copeland is the primary A road, the A595, with 
the M6 being located approximately 40 miles from both Whitehaven and Millom. 
The existing strategic road network serving Copeland can be seen in Figure 12. 
Figure 12: Major Road Network  
 
17.4.3  Discussions have been held around the potential for a new Eastern Relief Road for 
Whitehaven.  While the project is not currently included in National Highway’s  
recently published Road Investment Strategy 2, it remains a priority for the 
Council.  It is an ticipated that this will reduce congestion around the town, 
provide greater resilience to the strategic road network, support development 
projects and provide new growth corridor for Whitehaven and the rest of the 
borough. Copeland Borough Council will sup port any future progression towards 
the provision of a relief road. Further information surrounding the Whitehaven 
Relief Road and the benefits it could bring can be found in the Spatial Portrait.  
17.4.4  The Cumbria Coast Line rail route between Carlisle and Barr ow-in-Furness runs 
the length of Copeland, operating approximately once an hour between 6.30am 
and 8.50pm (Mon -Sat), with less frequent services on Sundays. This provides 
access to several smaller settlements along the coast that are otherwise relatively 
remote, although some of these are by demand only. A journey from Whitehaven 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
233 
 to Millom takes approximately 50 minutes by train, from Whitehaven to Carlisle 
approximately 75 minutes and from Millom to Barrow -in-Furness approximately 
35 minutes. The route tak en by the Cumbrian Coast Line can be viewed in Figure 
13 below:  
Figure 13: Cumbrian Coast Rail Route  
 
C/o Scenic Britain 2020  
 
17.4.5  In addition to local services, the West Coast mainline route can be accessed at 
Carlisle station. Whilst outside of Copeland, this line runs from London Euston to 
Edinburgh and Glasgow, providing regular, sustainable access to major cities. 
There are also direct rail links from Carlisle to Newcastle  and Leeds . This 
contributes towards the redu ced reliance of private cars for long distance 
journeys.   
17.4.6  Bus services are relatively frequent in north Copeland, with existing services 
providing access to other north Cumbrian settlements, including Carlisle and 
Workington. The main town in south Copela nd, Millom, is connected to Barrow -
in-Furness by train . However, the rural location of Copeland means that there is  
no regular bus route serving the Millom/ Haverigg area.  
17.5 Planning for transport  
17.5.1  The NPPF , paragraph 104,  states that: “ Transport issues sho uld be considered at 
the earliest stages of plan -making and development proposals ”  
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
234 
 17.5.2  Many issues relating to transport are regulated outside of the remit of Local 
Planning and require input from the Department for Transport (DfT). National 
Highways is respo nsible for the strategic road network whilst Cumbria County 
Council plays the role of the Local Highways Authority, maintaining approximately 
692km of roads within Copeland.  
17.5.3  National Highways Route Strategies and Route Investment Strategies are key 
documen ts that set out their plans for the strategic road network (SRN) and 
determines investment for priority projects is secured.  
17.5.4  Cumbria County Council are in the process of producing a Cumbria Transport 
Infrastructure Plan107 which is currently out to consulta tion. The Plan will set out 
set the policy framework for the role of transport and connectivity in supporting 
sustainable and inclusive growth in Cumbria for the period 2022 -2037.  It will sit 
alongside, and support the Cumbria . 
17.5.5  The Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) is currently focussing on the 
infrastructure investment required to support growth across the full range of 
Cumbria’s strategic networks, including rail, road, cycle ways and public transport 
to improve connec tivity within and to Cumbria. Work is currently underway to 
develop a business case to identify and plan improvements to the Cumbrian Coast 
Rail Line.  This is anticipated to increase the frequency and reliability of trains.   
17.5.6  It is important for Copeland Borough Council to prioritise investment bids to 
ensure that the most appropriate and effective improvements to the road 
network and sustainable public transport are delivered across the borough. The 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP 2021) identifies the C ouncil’s priorities for 
transport, including highway improvements.  
17.5.7  The NPPF , para graph  105, states that “significant development should be focussed 
on locations which are or can be made sustainable through limiting the need to 
travel and offering a genuine  choice of transport modes ”. Copeland Borough 
Council have produced  a Transport Improvement Study with Cumbria County 
Council. This  makes reccommendations on potential public transport, active 
travel and highways improvements that can be made to help deliv er the site 
allocations. The Council  will support proposals where they contribute towards 
delivering these improvements.  
17.5.8  In addition to this, National Highways are in the process of developing a study to 
look at the stretch of the A595 between Mirehouse a nd Egremont , and identify 
where junction improvements may be required to improve safety and capacity in 
these areas . 
17.5.9  A project -level Habitats Regulations Assessment may be required for proposals 
referred to in Policy CO2PU below.  
 
 
107 https://cumbria.gov.uk/planning -environment/infrastructureplanning/strategicplans.asp  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
235 
  
Strategic Policy CO2PU: Priorities for improving  transport networks within Copeland   
 
  
 
The Council will support the allocation and safeguarding of land that facilitates transport 
priorities within the borough. This includes, but is not restricted to, the following:  
 
a) Whitehaven Eastern Relief Road  
b) Improvements to the A595  
c) Improvements to the A5086  
d) Improvements to the A5093  
e) Whitehaven Town Centre Enhancements Scheme  
f) Maintaining and improving the stations, infrastructure and services on the 
Cumbrian Coastal Railway.  
g) Improvements to the local cycle and walking network to encourage active travel.  
 
Transport priorities will be encouraged where they improve road safety and journey times 
within the borough . 
 
Development that is likely to have a detrimental impact on the Highway network will be 
resisted.  
 
 
 
Strategic Policy CO3PU: Priorities for improving transport links to and from the borough   
 
   
 
The Council will support proposals that improve and enhance external transport links. 
This will be with the requirement that the environmental and social impacts associated 
with development are considered and necessary mitigation measures put into place.  
 
In particular, the following improvements will be supported:  
 
a) Proposals that improve road safety and journey times to and from settlements 
within the borough and key regional and national networks, including the M6, 
A66, A590, A595 and A5093  
b) Proposals to increase the number and frequency of public transport services 
serving the rest of Cumbria and further, where possible.   
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
236 
 Proposals that have the potential to compromise improvements to transport links will be 
resisted.  
 
 
17.6 Sustainable Transport  
17.6.1  Sustainable transport is key to achieving the NPPF’s ‘ Presumption in favour of 
sustainable development’ as set out in DS1PU. This includes contributing towards 
a reduction in the number of vehicles on the roads through the provision of safe, 
accessible and efficient public transport systems and active travel routes.  
17.6.2  Transport remains one of the largest emitting sectors in the UK, with greenhouse 
gas emissions from transport making up almost a fifth of the total emissions in 
2017 (ONS 2019). This figure follows an upwards trend, contrary to the national 
trend of reducing emissions overall. A number of national strategies and 
approaches h ave been introduced to address the issues of greenhouse gas 
emissions.  
17.6.3  In 2017, the Government published the Clean Growth Strategy,  which sets out 
ambitions to “ grow our national income while cutting greenhouse gas emissions ”. 
It is in effect, the overarc hing ambition to accelerate decarbonisation of the 
economy and achieve the delivery of the targets identified in the Paris Agreement 
on Climate Change.  
17.6.4  A key method for reducing emissions and improving sustainability within the 
borough is through the promo tion of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV), 
including Electric Vehicles (EVs) Elective vehicle provision is discussed further in 
policy CO7PU.  
17.6.5  A further key method is through improvements to the rail service in the borough. 
Network Rail with support from Cumbria County Council and the Cumbria Local 
Enterprise Partnership are currently developing an Outline Business Case for the 
Cumbrian Coast Railway. As well as potentially reducing the number of vehicles 
on the road such enhancements to connectivity and c apacity can also help 
address many of the socio -economic challenges facing our communities.  
17.6.6  Rail and other public transport improvements are identified within the County 
Council’s Draft Transport Infrastructure Plan 2022 -2037. This is supported by a 
Bus Se rvice Improvement Plan also produced by the County Council that 
identifies areas with limited or no provision and identifies opportunities for 
funding. A lack of bus provision is a particular problem in the South of the County 
where residents find it parti cularly difficult to access facilities and services outside 
the town centre.  
17.6.7  Copeland benefits from high levels of air quality and it is important that we 
protect this. We will continue to support development that provides innovative 
and sustainable modes of transport and contributes towards the further Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
237 
 reduction of Greenhouse gas emissions. This will be in line with Policy DS11PU: 
Protecting Air Quality.  
17.7 Active Travel  
17.7.1  Methods of active travel, including walking and cycling, have the potential to 
replace a  significant number of short car journeys. Promoting these methods of 
transport can also contribute towards improvements to physical and mental 
health and wellbeing as well as providing additional opportunities for the visitor 
economy. Well designed and sa fe routes are integral to this, ensuring that 
walking and cycling are attractive modes of transport.  
17.7.2  In May 2020, The Government released ‘ Gear Change: A bold vision for cycling 
and walking', which sets out plans to revolutionise active travel with a £2 billion 
investment . As part of this, the Government will be working with Local 
Authorities across the country to make it easier for people to get around on bikes. 
This includes measures such as the reallocation of road space for active travel and 
vouchers to enable cycle repairs (Gov 2020).  
17.7.3  On a local scale, Cumbria County Council is in the process of developing Local 
Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIP) for towns within Cumbria, with 
Whitehaven being one of the identified areas for development . LCWIPs provide a 
long term approach to developing local cycling and walking networks over a ten 
year period. This develops an evidence base which determines a prioritised 
programme for future investment, using methodology provided by the 
Department for T ransport. Stakeholder engagement and public consultation has 
already been carried out for the scheme, with the implementation being 
expected from 2021 onwards dependent on funding.  
17.7.4  The Council is committed to supporting the improvement and delivery of safe, 
accessible active travel routes, and will support development where it enables 
the delivery of such routes. Examples of initiatives which the Council will support 
include (but are  not limited to) the following:   
1. Whitehaven Hub : Prioritise and enhance strategic cycle route 
departures/arrivals including the C2C, Hadrian’s Wall108 and Reivers (plus 
emerging coastal) walking and cycling corridors into the town 
centre.   Enhance some exi sting street links to the town centre with improved 
pedestrian and cycle provision so people can walk and cycle into and around 
the town centre more easily, as well as developing Whitehaven as a hub for 
cycle accommodation, retail and leisure.  
2. Village Hub s: Developing coastal villages as hubs for cycle tourism and 
creating links to other settlements along the coast and inland to the valleys 
and fells. This includes schemes such as an improved cycle route from 
 
108 This is a project curren tly being progressed by Cumbria County Council and seeks to develop a strategic cycling and 
walking route to support active travel. The route would primarily follow the existing Hadrian’s Cycleway, offering a low 
traffic multi user route.   Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
238 
 Whitehaven to St Bees, connections between Whit ehaven and Ennerdale via 
Cleator Moor and an Extension of Viking way from Gosforth to Wasdale Head.  
3. A foot and cycle crossing over the Irt Estuary  
4. A foot and cycle crossing over the Esk Estuary  
5. The extension of Route 72 NCN, including routes around Millom and Haverigg 
and links through to Duddon Bridge  
6. The realignment of Route 72 NCN at Sellafield where the route has been 
washed away.  
17.7.5  Additionally, in March 2021, Whitehaven became a pilot area to trial innovative 
Electric scooter technology.  This is to as sess the strengths and issues surrounding 
e-scooter technology. If the pilot scheme is a success, it is anticipated that e-
scooters will become a mainstream form of sustainable transport across the UK, 
offering an innovative active travel alternative to wa lking or cycling . 
17.8 Transport Assessments and Travel Plans  
17.8.1  In terms of assessing impact of large -scale development the NPPF (para 113) 
states ‘All developments that will generate significant amounts of movement 
should be required to provide a Travel Plan, a nd the application should be 
supported by a Transport Statement or Transport Assessment so that the likely 
impacts of the proposal can be assessed.’  
17.8.2  This ensures that the travel demands arising from new large -scale developments 
are considered and that meas ures to promote sustainable and active travel are 
implemented where possible. Guidance surrounding the thresholds for Transport 
Assessments and Travel Plans is provided by the Cumbria Design Guide Annex 3. 
Travel Plans should also accord with Cumbria Count y Council guidance on Travel 
Plans and the Planning Process in Cumbria: Guidance for Developers (2012)109 and 
the County Council’s Planning Obligations Policy (2013)110    
 
 
Strategic Policy CO4PU: Sustainable Travel    
 
 
 
Proposals must include safe and direct connections to routes that promote active travel, 
such as cycling and walking routes where appropriate.

Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
239 
 The Council will also support, in principle, developments which encourages the use of 
sustainable modes of transport, in particular :  
 
a) Prop osals that have safe and direct connections to routes that promote active 
travel, such as walking and cycling, and those that provide access to regular 
public transport services;   
b) Proposals that  enable the sustainable movement of freight;  
c) Proposals that m ake provision for electric vehicles  
d) Proposals for the integration of electric vehicle charging infrastructure into new 
developments. This will have different requirements dependent on the scale of 
development.  
e) Proposals that take opportunities available t o use disused rail track beds to 
widen sustainable transport choices, encourage active travel within the borough 
and provide spaces for biodiversity.  
 
New development that would prejudice the future use of disused railway lines that are 
well connected eit her to settlements, other sustainable travel routes or key tourist 
facilities within the open countryside for this purpose will only be considered in 
exceptional circumstances.  
 
Developments that are likely to generate a large amount of movement will be re quired 
to secure an appropriate Travel Plan and be supported by a Transport Assessment in line 
with the Cumbria Design Guide (or any document that replaces it).  
 
 
17.9 Transport Hierarchy  
17.9.1  The transport hierarchy is an important method for promoting sustainable and 
socially inclusive modes of transport. It is useful in ensuring that the needs of 
certain groups, including pedestrians, cyclists, disabled and vulnerable people and 
those with pu shchairs, are taken into consideration during the decision making 
process. This will help to improve equal opportunities as well as promoting a 
modal shift by making alternative modes of transport more accessible.  
 
Policy CO5PU: Transport Hierarchy   
 
 
 
 
Where appropriate, new developments should promote the following hierarchy of users 
(highest priority first):  
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
240 
 a) Pedestrians  
b) Cyclists  
c) Public and community transport users  
d) Vehicles that facilitate car sharing  
e) All other vehicles   
 
Developments should be designed to maximise the use of transport modes towards the 
top of the hierarchy whilst always ensuring appropriate access for emergency vehicles.  
The needs of disabled people ought to be considered at all stages of the transport 
hierarchy, with appropriate provisions made to improve accessibility.  
 
 
17.10  Countryside Access  
17.10.1  The Council is keen to explore further opportunities for the provision of 
countryside assets. This includes the creation of a community forest or similar 
major countr yside resource which could combine some sustainable woodland 
energy contribution with opportunities for recreation and leisure.   
17.10.2  Existing public rights of way are protected by law and therefore do not need 
policy protection. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced a 
statutory right of access on foot for open air recreation to mountain, moor, 
heath, down and registered common land. Policy CO6PU below seeks to help 
residents and visitors to exercise that right.  
17.10.3  Opportunities should be taken to connect new developments to wider 
countryside access routes where possible, for example by creating new 
pedestrian links and/or providing signage to long distance routes where 
appropriate. It is also important to maximise e qual opportunities to access and 
interact with the natural environment.  
17.10.4  Provision should be made to ensure that wheelchair users, families with 
pushchairs and the visually impaired are able to access Copeland’s abundant 
countryside. Cumbria County Council  have identified several routes that provide 
‘access for all’. In Copeland, these routes include Longlands Lake in Cleator and 
Walkmill Community Woodland at Moresby Parks, Whitehaven. We will continue 
to support the development of routes to provide access  for all.  
  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
241 
  
Strategic Policy CO6PU: Countryside Access  
 
 
 
The Council will support improved access to the countryside for residents and visitors, 
where biodiversity conservation interest would not be harmed as a result, by:  
 
a) Identifying opportunities to provide or improve access on routes and gateways 
from settl ements and to secure the implementation of improvement measures 
with key partners and developers  
b) Investigating opportunities for reclaiming contaminated and derelict land for 
recreation purposes  
c) Identifying potential for the development of a community fo rest and long 
distance walks  
 
Proposals should identify opportunities to improve countryside access through their 
developments, both through improved active travel links and through measures such as 
enhanced signage. Where appropriate, access should make p rovision for those with 
limited mobility.   
 
 
17.11  Parking Standards  
17.11.1  Ensuring that adequate parking is available is vital, both within new residential 
developments and in and around town centres and surrounding key services .  
This ensures that accessibility is improved whilst reducing the amount of traffic 
on the roads. It also improves the street scene and pedestrian safety by reducing 
the number of cars parked on roadsides. In addition, it is vital to provide equal 
opportunities within parking provision, with accessible spaces being of high 
priority.  
17.11.2  A key element of enco uraging sustainable transport within the borough is to 
facilitate the transfer of people from private vehicles into more sustainable 
modes. It is therefore important that appropriate park and ride locations, such as 
the existing scheme that links Sellafiel d to Cleator Moor, are provided to reduce 
the number of vehicles on the roads. This is particularly relevant in the context of 
reducing the number of cars parking at key employment sites and within town 
centres.  
17.11.3  Parking standards are currently informed by Appendix 1 of the 2017 Cumbria 
Design Guide, produced by Cumbria County Council. All development proposals 
will be required to provide accessible and well -designed parking in line with this, 
with provision being made for associated infrastructure such as b ike shelters and 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
242 
 storage wherever possible. It is understood that in exceptional cases such as town 
centre locations, it is not possible to provide on or off -street parking. These will 
be looked at on a case -by-case basis and will be supported in principle  where 
suitable alternatives are available, for example, access to high quality public 
transport provision.  
17.11.4  A Parking Study for Whitehaven has also recently been completed. This sets out 
guidance for managing parking within the borough and for providing a ppropriate 
car parking provision for new developments.   
17.12  Electric Vehicles  
17.12.1  A key method for reducing emissions and improving sustainability within the 
borough is through the promotion of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV), 
including Electric Vehicles (EVs).  
17.12.2  In July 2018, the Road to Zero Strategy set an aspiration for “all new cars and 
vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040”.  The Ten Point Plan fo r a Green 
Industrial Revolution, produced in November 2020, accelerates this to an 
aspiration to stop the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and the sale of 
hybrid vehicles by 2035 , which aligns with the priorities  of the Cumbria Electric 
Vehicle Infrastruct ure Group111.  
17.12.3  Figure 14 below shows the cumulative number of Battery electric vehicles (BEV) 
and Plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) registered in the UK since 2012. This 
shows that as of August 2021, there were over 600,000 electric vehicle s on UK 
roads, making up approximately 18% of market share  of new registrations for the 
year to date . Information surrounding publicly available EV charging points in 
Copeland can be found here: https://www.zap -map.com/ .

243 
 17.12.4  The Automotive Sector Deal was published in 2018 to build upon the 
Government’s long standing relationship with the UK automotive sector. This 
aims to accelerate the transition to zero emission vehicles in order to contribute 
to the delivery of the UK’s In dustrial Strategy. Key initiatives within this include:  
• Expenditure of £1 billion to support the up -take of ultra -low-emission -vehicles 
(ULEVs) so customers can overcome the upfront cost of an electric car;  
• £80 million investment (alongside £15 million fr om National Highways) to 
support charging infrastructure deployment;  
• Introduction of the Automated and Electric Vehicles (AEV) Act of 2018, which 
sets out the legislative requirements for electric charging infrastructure, 
including a requirement for intero perability of systems.  
 
17.12.5  In order to achieve the Cumbria target of net zero carbon emissions by 2037, it is 
vital that development contributes towards the implementation of electric 
vehicle technology. Therefore , developers must be proactive in ensuring that 
appropriate infrastructure is provided to achieve this. Policy CO7PU sets out the 
requirement for all new development to make provision for electric vehicles, 
helping to future proof ready for the elimination of fossil fuel powered vehicles.   
17.12.6  In September 2021, the Department for Transport announced that Electric 
Vehicle charging units in all new residential and office developments is 
anticipated to become mandatory in England . It is anticipated that the new 
legalisation will come into force in 2022. Therefore , policy CO7PU outlines a 
requirement for all new development to provide Electric Vehicle infrastructure.  
 
 
Policy CO7PU: Parking Standards and Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure   
 
 
 
 
Proposals for new development will be required to provide adequate parking provision in 
accordance with the Cumbria Development Design Guide (or any document that replaces 
it) where appropriate. There will also be a requirement for the provision of secure cycle 
parking in all new car parks as well  as accessible parking bays and associated 
development.  
 
Development will be supported where it accords with the Whitehaven Parking Strategy. 
Proposals that provide new or improved Park and Ride Facilities for loca l employment 
and development sites will be supported where they will provide demonstrable benefits 
and will be situated in appropriate locations.    
 
Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
244 
 All new development should integrate new Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure as 
follows:  
 
• For new res idential development, one charging point must be provided per 
dwelling with off street parking. Where off street parking is not provided, a 
commuted sum will be required to provide charging facilities in the immediate 
locality.  
• For non -residential development, at least one charging point must be provided 
per 10 spaces and the infrastructure to enable future installation of charging 
points in every parking bay. Consideration should be given to grouping parking 
bays to optimise provision o f charging infrastructure .

 Monitoring  
 Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
246 
 18.1 Monitoring the Local Plan  
18.1.1  It is important that the impacts of the Local Plan are monitored regularly. This 
helps to assess the effectiveness of the policies and may indicate where policy 
changes may be required.  
18.1.2  Monitoring will take an objective -led approach to the selection of ta rgets and 
indicators, which will help provide a consistent basis for monitoring the 
performance of the strategy against the objectives. Where appropriate, the Local 
Plan will set targets for each policy, and will set out how the policy will be 
implemented and monitored. Specific targets have been included where clear 
outputs may be required. The monitoring criteria should be read alongside the 
relevant plan policy for a full understanding.  
18.1.3  Each year Copeland Borough Council will produce an Annual Monitoring Report 
which contains information on the progress of the implementation of the Local 
Plan and an assessment of the effectiveness of the policies together with any 
future Local Development Documents. This monitoring will indicate progress 
towards targets and show where policies are not working as anticipated. This will 
help to inform any changes to the Plan .Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021

 GLOSSARY  
 
Affordable Housing: Affordable housing should meet the needs of eligible households including 
availability at a cost low enough for them to afford, determined with regard to local incomes and 
local house prices. Affordable housing includes social rented and intermediate housing, provided to 
specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. It should also include a 
provision to ensur e that the housing remains affordable for future eligible households.  
Ancient Woodland: An area that has been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD. It includes 
ancient semi -natural woodland and plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS). (NPPF)  
Best and Most Versatile Agricultural Land: Land in grades 1, 2 and 3a of the Agricultural Land 
Classification (NPPF).  
Biodiversity Net Gain: Biodiversity net gain requires developers to ensure habitats for wildlife are 
enhanced and left in a measurably bette r state than they were pre -development. They must assess 
the type of habitat and its condition before submitting plans, and then demonstrate how they are 
improving biodiversity – such as through the creation of green corridors, planting more trees, or 
form ing local nature spaces (DEFRA).  
Brownfield Land: Land that has been previously developed and is or was occupied by a permanent 
structure (excluding agricultural or forestry buildings), and associated fixed surface infrastructure. 
The definition includes t he curtilage of the development.  The definition is set out in the NPPF.  
Built Environment:  The man -made buildings and structures that make up the environment where 
people live and work.  
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): A CIL charge was introduced by the Planning Act 2008 as a tool 
for Local Authorities to help deliver infrastructure to support the development of an area. Copeland 
does not currently have a CIL charging schedule but there may be potential for this in the future  
Community -led housing: Housing projects run by individual community groups to build the types of 
homes that local people need and want. These are usually developed by a community led 
organisation or enterprise and aim to solve local problems by working with the local community (My  
Community)  
Edge of Centre: For retail purposes, a location that is well connected to, and up to 300 metres from, 
the primary shopping area. For all other main town centre uses, a location within 300 metres of a 
town centre boundary. For office development , this includes locations outside the town centre but 
within 500 metres of a public transport interchange. In determining whether a site falls within the 
definition of edge of centre, account should be taken of local circumstances (NPPF).  
Exception sites: Small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity where sites would not normally 
be used for housing  
Extra Care Housing: housing developments that comprise self -contained homes with design features 
and support services to enable people to self-care and continue to live independently.   Whilst they 
are primarily for older people some may support younger people with disabilities (Cumbria County 
Council).  
Geodiversity:  The range of rocks, minerals, fossils, soils and landforms (NPPF).  Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
265 
 Greenfield land: Land which has never been built on before or where the remains of any structure 
or activity have blended into the landscape over time. This applies to most sites outside of built up 
area boundaries.  
Green Infrastructure:  The green spaces in the borough, new and existing, rural and urban, natural 
and managed, developed as a network of spaces and linking ‘corridors’.  The purpose of green 
infrastructure is to promote biodive rsity as well as supporting the health and quality of life of 
communities.  
Gypsies and Travellers:  Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such 
persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ edu cational or health 
needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of 
travelling showpeople or circus people travelling together as such.  
Habitat: The natural home or environment of a plant or animal  
Habitats  Regulation Assessment : An assessment that promotes avoidance of damage to Natura 
2000 sites through mitigation and compensatory measures. This is required when development may 
have an adverse impact on the integrity of Natura 2000 sites  
Heritage Asset: A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of 
significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest. It includes 
designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local plann ing authority (including local 
listing) (NPPF Glossary).  
Heritage Coast: The NPPF defines the heritage coast as  ‘areas of undeveloped coastline which are 
managed to conserve their natural beauty and, where appropriate, to improve accessibility to 
visitors’ . The only Heritage Coast in Copeland is St Bees Head  which is proposed for extension .  
House in Multiple Occupancy (HMO): HMO’s requiring planning permission are those with more 
than six unrelated occupiers. They comprise two or more households and are di fferent from self -
contained flats as occupiers share basic amenities such as kitchen and bathroom facilities  
Key Service Centre: The boroughs three key service centres of Millom, Egremont and Cleator Moor 
offer the next level of provision below the Princip al Town of Whitehaven. This includes access to key 
services and facilities including schools, shops, community halls and places of worship.  
Listed building:  When buildings are listed they are placed on statutory lists of buildings of ‘special 
architectura l or historic interest’. Listing ensures that the architectural and historic interest of the 
building is carefully considered before any alterations, either outside or inside, are agreed.  
Local Service Centre: There are a total of 17 Local Service Centres across the borough. These are 
settlements that offer a lower provision than the key service centres within the settlement hierarchy 
but provide enough services and facilities to meet every day needs.  
Local Geological Site: Formally known as Region ally Important Geological Sites, these are non - 
statutory sites that have been identified by local geoconservation groups as being of importance  
Long Term Empty Home: A dwelling that has been unoccupied and unfurnished for at least six 
months  
Main town Ce ntre uses: “ Retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet 
centres); leisure, entertainment and more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, 
restaurants, drive -through restaurants, bars and pubs, nightclubs, casinos, healt h and fitness Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
266 
 centres, indoor bowling centres and bingo halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism development 
(including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities )” (NPPF)  
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF ): The NPPF was first published in March 2012 and 
provides guidance surrounding the development of planning policy. This replaces the Planning Policy 
Statements (PPS) and Planning Policy Guidance Notes (PPG)  
Natura 2000 Sites: SACs and SPAs together make u p a European network of sites referred to as 
Natura 2000.  Natura 2000 is the centrepiece of EU nature and biodiversity policy.  
Open Space: All open spaces of public value, including land and water provisions. These can offer 
opportunities for recreation, leisure and visual amenity  
Planning obligations and agreements:  A legal agreement between a planning authority and a 
developer, or offered unilaterally by a developer, ensuring that certain extra works related to a 
development are undertaken. For example t he provision of highways. Sometimes called a "Section 
106" agreement.  
Primary Shopping Area: An area where retail development and use is concentrated  
Ramsar Site: Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance, designated under the Ramsar 
Conventio n. 
Renewable energy: Energy flows that occur naturally and repeatedly in the environment, for 
example from the wind, water flow, tides or the sun.  
Retail impact assessment:  An assessment undertaken for an application for retail use (normally on 
development s over 2,500 square metres gross floorspace, but they may occasionally be necessary 
for smaller developments, such as those likely to have a significant impact on smaller centres) on the 
impact of the proposal on the vitality and viability of existing cent res within the catchment area of 
the proposed development. The assessment includes the likely cumulative effect of recent 
permissions, developments under construction and completed developments (Planning Portal).  
Rural Exception Site: Small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity where sites would not 
normally be used for housing. Rural exception sites seek to address the needs of the local 
community by accommodating households who are either current residents or have an existing 
family or employmen t connection. A proportion of market homes may be allowed on the site at the 
local planning authority’s discretion, for example where essential to enable the delivery of 
affordable units without grant funding (NPPF).  
Section 106: The current method taken by the Council to collect planning obligations from 
developers. This acts as a legal agreement between a planning authority and a developer, ensuring 
that certain extra works related to a development are undertaken such as the provision of highways.   
Self-build and custom build housing: Housing built by an individual, a group of individuals, or 
persons working with or for them, to be occupied by that individual. Such housing can be either 
market or affordable housing. A legal definition, for the purpose of  applying the self -build and 
Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (as amended), is contained in section 1(A1) and (A2) of that Act 
(NPPF).  
Sustainability Appraisal: This is a tool for appraising policies to ensure they reflect sustainable 
development objectives (i.e. social, environmental and economic factors) and required in the Act to 
be undertaken for all Local Development Documents.    Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021  
 
267 
 Settlement Hierarchy:  Settlements are categorised in a hierarchy based on the range of services, 
facilities and employment opp ortunities in the settlement, access to education and non -car access to 
higher -order centres. In this context, the settlement hierarchy refers to the Principal Town, Key 
Service Centre, Local Service Centre , Sustainable Rural Villages, Rural Villages  and the open 
countryside (Areas o utside Settlement Boundaries ).  
Sequential Approach: A planning principle that seeks to identify, allocate or develop certain types or 
locations of land before the consideration of others. For example, brownfield sites before gr eenfield 
sites, or town centre retail sites before out -of-centre sites. In terms of employment a sequential 
approach would favour an employment use over mixed use and mixed use over non -employment 
uses. (NPPF)  
Site of special scientific interest (SSSI): A formal conservation designation for an area that is of 
particular scientific interest due to either rare species of flora and fauna or geological/ physical 
features that may lie within its boundaries (Woodland Trust)  
Special Areas of Conservation (SAC): Areas which have been given special protection under the 
European Union’s Habitats Directive. They provide increased protection to a variety of wild animals, 
plants and habitats and are a vital part of global eff orts to conserve the world’s biodiversity.  
Special Protection Area (SPA):  Sites classified under the European Community Directive on Wild 
Birds to protect internationally important bird species  
Sustainable development: Sustainable development is the core principle underpinning 
contemporary town planning in the UK. At the heart of sustainable development is the ideal of 
ensuring a better quality of life through development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  
Sustainable transport:  Any means of transpo rt that is accessible and efficient whilst having an 
overall low impact on the environment. This can include walking, cycling, public transport modes 
and low emission or electric vehicles.  
Sustainable urban Drainage System (SuDS):  The term Sustainable Dra inage Systems (SuDS) covers 
the whole range of sustainable approaches to surface water drainage management. SuDS aim to 
mimic natural drainage processes and remove pollutants from urban run -off at source. SuDS 
comprise a wide range of techniques, including  green roofs, permeable paving, rainwater harvesting, 
swales, detention basins, ponds and wetlands.  
Town centre:  The Area defined on the local authority’s policies map, including the primary shopping 
area and areas predominantly occupied by main town centr e uses within or adjacent to the primary 
shopping area  
Travelling showpeople: Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding fairs, circuses or 
shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This includes such persons who on the grounds 
of their own or their family’s or dependants’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or health 
needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as defined 
above.  
Windfall sites: Sites not specifica lly identified within the development plan.Copeland Local Plan Publication Draft 2021
