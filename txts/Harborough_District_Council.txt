1.1.1 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2019) requires every local planning
authority to have a succinct, up to date local plan, which will help to deliver sustainable
development, conform to the NPPF, meet development needs, and reflect local
aspirations. Although the Local Plan was examined against the NPPF (2012), in
accordance with the transitional arrangements set out in Annex 1 of the NPPF 2018,
consideration was also given to its conformity with the new NPPF during the examination
process. All references to the NPPF in the Local Plan now refer to the NPPF (2019) unless
otherwise specified. 1 Introduction
1.1 What is the Local Plan?
1.1.2 The Harborough Local Plan provides an important strategy for Harborough District. It
will play a significant role in delivering sustainable development in appropriate locations
and in helping to protect the countryside, important green spaces, and the built and natural
heritage from inappropriate or insensitive development, thus enhancing the quality of life
for people and communities. 
1.1.3 The Local Plan entirely replaces:
•Harborough District Local Development Plan Core Strategy 2006-2028 (adopted in
2011); and
•Harborough District Local Plan 2001 (Retained Policies).
1.1.4 Appendix A  Relationship with adopted Core Strategy, 2011 and Local Plan, 2001
'Saved Policies' sets out how the policies in these plans have been replaced by the
policies in this Local Plan. 
1.1.5 The Local Plan explains how much and what types of development will take place,
where it will be built and how and when it will be delivered. The Local Plan also identifies
any additional infrastructure (such as new roads and schools) which is needed to support
development and explains how this supporting infrastructure will be delivered. 
1.1.6 The Local Plan provides an overall vision for the District, a number of specific
objectives and a detailed set of policies to explain how the vision and objectives will be
achieved, together with a Policies Map which shows where policies apply. 
1.1.7 The Harborough Local Plan, along with 'made' neighbourhood plans and adopted
minerals and waste plans, forms the overall development plan for Harborough District. An
Page 1Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019up to date list and further information concerning these plans can be found in the
Harborough District Local Development Scheme, available on the Council's website (see
Appendix B Supporting evidence ). 
1.1.8 The Local Plan is the starting point for considering whether planning applications
(apart from for minerals and waste development) can be approved. Decisions on planning
applications will be taken in accordance with its policies, unless material considerations
indicate otherwise. The Local Plan covers a range of issues and it is likely that several
policies will be relevant to any given proposed development. It is important therefore
that the plan is read as a whole rather than treating policies in isolation. 
1.2.1 The Harborough Local Plan has been prepared taking account of: 1.2 How has the Local Plan been prepared?
•national planning policy as set out in the NPPF, various planning acts and ministerial
statements, together with related guidance, especially Planning Practice Guidance;
•evidence studies prepared to inform the Local Plan; and
•ongoing and proactive stakeholder engagement throughout the preparation of the Local
Plan, including responses to the following public consultations:
◦Scoping consultation - This first consultation gathered the views of interested
parties on the proposed contents of the new Local Plan. These views were used to
finalise the scope of the Plan and to inform the identification of any further evidence
requirements. The scoping consultation took place in March and April 2013.
◦Options consultation - This consultation sought views on 9 alternative options for
locating housing and employment, together with other proposed policy approaches.
The alternative options consultation took place in September – October 2015.
◦Proposed Submission consultation – This consultation invited representations on
the Proposed Submission version of the Local Plan in accordance with Regulation 19
of the Town and Country Planning (Local Development) (England) Regulations 2012
(as amended). The consultation took place during September – November 2017. 
1.2.2 Further information concerning each of these is available online by following the link
set out in Appendix B Supporting evidence .
1.3.1 The Local Plan relates to the whole of Harborough District as depicted in Fig A.1
below and described in more detail in Appendix D  Spatial Portrait . 1.3 What area does the Local Plan cover?
1.3.2 The Local Plan may be supplemented by more detailed policies and proposals in
neighbourhood plans where these are prepared for parts of the District.

Page 3 1.3 What area does the Local Plan cover?1.4 How does Harborough relate to neighbouring places?
1.4.1 Harborough District cannot be viewed in isolation from adjoining areas. Fig. A.1  
shows the local authorities which neighbour Harborough District. Harborough has a
particularly strong relationship with Leicester and the rest of Leicestershire. It is dependent
on the Leicester urban area not only for the significant amount of employment located
there, but also for higher order health, retail and cultural facilities and services. Therefore,
the regeneration and economic well-being of the Leicester urban area is an important
consideration in any future strategy for the District.
1.4.2 The District lies within the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area (HMA)
and Functional Economic Market Area (FEMA), which both cover the whole of Leicester
and Leicestershire. These have been defined in recognition of the central economic role of
Leicester and the fact that people travel to work and move house across local authority
boundaries within this area. The Leicester and Leicestershire HMA and FEMA are shown
in Fig. A.2  below.
Fig. A.2 Leicester and Leicestershire HMA and FEMA
Page 4Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20191.4.3 The nine Leicestershire local authorities and the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)
have worked together to prepare the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing and Economic
Development Need Assessment (HEDNA) 2017 as part of their Duty to Cooperate
responsibilities (see section 1.5 below). This important study informs the quantity of
housing and employment land provision that the Local Plan provides for. 
1.5.1 The Duty to Cooperate was established in the Localism Act 2011, which amended
the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. It places a legal duty on local planning
authorities, county councils and public bodies to engage constructively, proactively and on
an ongoing basis to ensure that significant issues that affect more than one local authority
area are addressed adequately within plans. This Harborough Local Plan must therefore
consider influences on and the requirements of adjoining areas and how strategic
infrastructure is to be delivered. 1.5 The Duty to Cooperate
1.5.2 It is up to individual local authorities to collaborate in identifying strategic matters
where cooperation might be appropriate (NPPF, paragraph 25). As part of its Duty to
Cooperate, the Council has actively engaged with its strategic partners on an agreed
range of strategic priorities throughout the preparation of the plan. Details of how the
Council has undertaken and met the Duty to Cooperate requirements are set out in a
separate Duty to Cooperate Statement, 2018.
1.5.3 The following strategic priorities for the Local Plan have emerged from liaison with
the prescribed bodies:
SP1: Meeting the housing and employment needs of the Leicester and
Leicestershire housing and economic market areas . 
SP2: Assisting other local authorities to meet their unmet housing need.  
SP3: Meeting regional and national demand for strategic distribution (logistics)
development.
SP4: Meeting the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers. 
SP5: Providing transport and other infrastructure to support new development. 
SP6: Providing for strategic green infrastructure (i.e. Green Wedges).
SP7: Protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geodiversity. 
SP8: Providing for retail needs.
SP9: Minimising flood risk.
Page 5Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019SP10: Safeguarding land needed for minerals and waste.
1.5.4 The councils within Leicester and Leicestershire, with the Leicester and
Leicestershire Local Enterprise Partnership as an observer, have prepared a Leicester and
Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan. This outlines the amount and location of future
growth in Leicester and Leicestershire from 2031 to 2036 and sets out broad aspirations
for growth up to 2050. The Strategic Growth Plan is a non-statutory document in planning
policy terms, but provides the context for future reviews of this Local Plan, as described in
Policy IMR1 Monitoring and review of the Local Plan . Its strategy has been taken into
account in preparing this Local Plan but it does not directly impact on its policies to 2031.
1.6.1 The Government has given local communities new rights to shape their
neighbourhood through the preparation of neighbourhood plans. Once made
neighbourhood plans form part of the Development Plan and have the same status as this
Local Plan in making decisions on planning applications. 1.6 Neighbourhood planning
1.6.2 There has been a high level of community interest and engagement in the
preparation of neighbourhood plans, with almost a third of parish councils across the
District leading on their preparation. The Council anticipates that the coverage of
neighbourhood plans will continue to increase across the District over the plan period. 
1.6.3 The Council is committed to working positively with local communities where they
wish to develop a neighbourhood plan and to supporting them through the statutory
processes. This includes ensuring that neighbourhood plans are in general conformity with
strategic policies, as set out in this Harborough Local Plan, together with minerals and
waste local plans, and helping to avoid duplication of local policies. 
1.6.4 Neighbourhood plans will have an important role in bringing forward local housing
sites as described in Policies SS1 The spatial strategy  and H1 Provision of new housing .
1.6.5 Neighbourhood plans should be in general conformity with the strategic policies in
this Local Plan. National Planning Practice Guidance states that, when reaching a view on
whether a policy is a strategic policy, the following are useful considerations:
•whether the policy sets out an overarching direction or objective;
•whether the policy seeks to shape the broad characteristics of development;
•the scale at which the policy is intended to operate;
•whether the policy sets a framework for decisions on how competing priorities should be
balanced;
•whether the policy sets a standard or other requirement that is essential to achieving the
wider vision and aspirations in the Local Plan;
•in the case of site allocations, whether bringing the site forward is central to achieving
Page 6Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019the vision and aspirations of the Local Plan;
•whether the Local Plan identifies the policy as being strategic.
1.6.6 Having given consideration to these factors, the Council is of the view that almost all
the policies in this Local Plan meet some or all of these criteria and are therefore strategic.
The exceptions to this are:
•GD6: Areas of Separation
•GD9: Minerals Safeguarding Areas
•H3: Rural exception sites
•RT3: Shopfronts and advertisements
•HC2: Community facilities
•HC3: Public houses, post offices and village shops
•GI3: Cemeteries
•GI4: Local Green Space
•CC4: Sustainable drainage.
1.6.7 With the exception of these policies, neighbourhood plans should be in general
conformity with all polices of this Local Plan. 
1.7.1 Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) add further detail to policies in the Local
Plan. They can be used to provide further guidance for development on specific sites or on
particular issues, such as design. SPDs are capable of being a material consideration in
planning decisions but are not part of the Development Plan. 1.7 Supplementary Planning Documents
1.7.2 The Planning Obligations SPD was adopted by the Council in September 2016 and
published in January 2017. It sets out the circumstances in which planning obligations will
be sought to meet additional infrastructure and affordable housing needs arising from new
developments. 
1.7.3 In addition, a number of other SPDs and Supplementary Planning Guidance Notes
have been adopted by the Council, the majority of which are linked to policies in the
previous Local Plan (2001). However, some of the detailed design principles contained
within the documents are still relevant and valuable in giving guidance to applicants and in
the determination of planning applications. As a result, the Council's Executive resolved on
19 December 2011 that existing guidance, where still relevant, should continue to be used
as a material consideration in determining planning applications. 
1.7.4 The Council may also set out proposals for new SPDs in its Local Development
Scheme (see Appendix B  Supporting evidence ).

Page 8Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20192 Vision and objectives
2.1 Local Plan vision
2.1.1 The Local Plan vision explains how the Harborough District will change and develop
over the plan period to 2031. It sets out a collective positive vision for the future of the
area, as required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). 
In 2031, Harborough District will be a vibrant, safe and prosperous place which retains
its identity as a predominantly rural area of villages and market towns where local
communities enjoy a high quality of life. Residents will benefit from increased access
to suitable housing, a wider range of local skilled jobs, and high quality services and
facilities, all of which promote healthy and safe lifestyles. 
The District will have a diverse and thriving economy, with market towns and some
large villages acting as employment and service centres for their surrounding rural
areas. The diversity and quality of Harborough’s countryside, natural and historic
environment will have improved for the benefit of residents and visitors. Air and water
quality will have been improved while the impacts of noise and light pollution will have
been minimised. There will be better access to the countryside and an improved range
of open spaces for local people to enjoy. 
By 2031 the District will have improved resilience to the impacts of climate change,
with new development located in areas of low flood risk and incorporating energy
efficient design and sustainable drainage systems (SuDs) to manage run-off water
sustainably. Low carbon design techniques and technologies, increased provision for
walking and cycling, and improved access to public transport for new development will
have contributed to a reduction in the District’s carbon footprint. 
New development will have been delivered in the most sustainable locations. The
historic market town of Market Harborough will have retained its character and
strengthened its role as the District’s principal town. The impact of heavy goods
vehicles and traffic more generally on noise and air pollution in Lutterworth town
centre will have been reduced and the environmental quality of the town centre
improved, thereby enabling its historic core to be enhanced and appreciated more
fully. 
These two market towns, along with settlements near to the edge of Leicester
(Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby), Broughton Astley and the rural centres, will have
been the main focus for development. Residential development will have been
delivered to meet strategic and local needs and the necessary infrastructure and
community facilities needed to support this growth will have been delivered on time.
Selected rural villages will have seen small-scale, sensitively located development to
Page 9Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019support local objectives, meet local housing needs and sustain village services. In the
wider countryside only very limited development will have taken place to meet
specifically identified housing needs and support long-term rural sustainability. 
The economic base of the District will have been strengthened through the fostering of
new enterprise and the sustainable growth of existing businesses. Supporting
infrastructure will be in place to allow businesses to grow. The District will have full
high speed broadband coverage benefiting businesses and local residents. 
Strategic distribution sites will have adapted to the changing needs of the sector and
maintained their significance to the District and the wider area in terms of employment
provision.
New housing will reflect local needs in terms of type, size and tenure and enable
equality of access to suitable accommodation. Older people will have increased
access to accommodation to suit their changing needs and affordable homes will have
been delivered to enable a new generation of home owners to get onto the housing
ladder and to meet the needs of those unable to afford market housing for sale. New
housing developments will be high quality, well designed, and respectful of their
setting in order to ensure that the character of the District’s towns and villages is
maintained and protected. 
Communities will have access to improved social, recreational, sports, health and
educational facilities. Existing valued community services will have been retained and
necessary new ones delivered to keep pace with development. The design of the
public realm will have responded to the needs of the elderly, young and other
vulnerable sections of the community, thereby assisting in a sense of inclusiveness
and well-being for all residents. 
Communities across the District will have embraced neighbourhood planning,
affording them the opportunity to shape the future of their environment by ensuring
that they have a real stake in the decision making processes that oversee what
development takes place and where.
2.2.1 The following key issues have emerged from the Local Plan Vision, as well as from
evidence studies, strategies and previous consultations, in particular:2.2 Key Issues

development
•determining an appropriate distribution of housing and employment growth that takes
account of strategic growth locations, the settlement hierarchy, and the ability to provide
essential utilities and infrastructure, whilst safeguarding local heritage and sensitive
landscapes.
Key Issue 2: Meeting housing needs
•establishing and meeting the objectively assessed housing needs and land
requirements for the District to 2031 with sufficient flexibility in provision to ensure that
the Government’s 5 year housing land supply requirements can be met in future;
•addressing the problems of high house prices by providing a wider range of housing
types/tenures, including affordable homes and suitable homes to meet the needs of an
ageing population;

housing needs of other authorities within the Leicester and Leicestershire housing
market area;
•identifying suitable, available and deliverable sites which can meet the District’s housing
needs in a sustainable manner that is complementary to the distribution of planned
business development. 
Key issue 3: Facilitating growth in the economy 
•allocating sufficient land for business uses to meet employment growth in the District to
2031 in a way that is complementary to the amount and distribution of planned housing
growth whilst also contributing significantly to wider sub-regional land requirements for
road-based strategic distribution business space;
•reducing the dependence of Harborough's residents on commuting and increasing
wage rates by providing a breadth of employment alternatives, including more
opportunities for Harborough's higher skilled residents, through resisting the loss of ‘fit

centres in the District, so reducing the need to travel, while preserving, and where
possible enhancing, the predominantly rural character of the District;
•sustaining the strength of town centres against the threat of 'leakage' to other centres
and use of on-line shopping, realising rural vitality and making appropriate retail
provision in Market Harborough, the Key Centres and local centres. 
Key issue 8: Transport
•mitigating the highways and transportation impacts of new development within and,
where necessary, beyond the District;
•helping to improve air quality, especially in Air Quality Management Areas, whilst at the
same time encouraging and making provision for sustainable travel choices to reduce
reliance on the private car.

providing suitable accommodation to meet the needs of these communities.
2.3.1 These objectives have been identified as central to the delivery of the vision for the
District and are the guiding principles for the policies set out in the Local Plan. The 14
objectives set out below are intended to address the strategic priorities (paragraph 1.5.3),
deliver the Local Plan Vision (section 2.1) and deal with the key issues (section 2.2).
Appendix E  Local Plan objectives  gives detail regarding which Local Plan policies address
the objectives and the links to relevant key issues and strategic priorities. 2.3 Local Plan objectives
Objective 1. Housing:  Meet the housing requirements of the District in full by
providing a range of market and affordable housing types, tenures and sizes in
appropriate and sustainable locations to meet local needs. Recognise the specific
accommodation requirements of the young and the elderly populations, including
starter homes to help first time buyers, shared ownership and rented housing to help
those who cannot afford to buy, and specialist housing such as sheltered and extra
care accommodation.
Objective 2. Employment:  Promote sustainable economic growth by facilitating the
sustainable growth of businesses, fostering new local enterprise and helping to create
more jobs that meet local employment needs. Contribute to reducing the need for out-
commuting and thereby help to increase the sustainability and self-containment of
communities, while encouraging the development of a vibrant, diverse and sustainable
business community. 
Objective 3. Location of development:  Locate new development in sustainable
locations that respect the environmental capacity of the local area. Encourage the
appropriate and efficient re-use of previously developed land and buildings where
such re-use achieves the objectives of sustainable development.
Objective 4. Infrastructure:  Support local communities and maintain a high quality of
life by ensuring that new development delivers the necessary infrastructure including
that relating to health, education, security, culture, transport, open space, recreation,
Page 13Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019water supply and treatment, power, waste and telecommunications (incorporating high
speed broadband connectivity).
Objective 5. Protection of local services:  Protect, enhance and, where appropriate,
secure the provision of additional accessible community services and local facilities,
supporting innovation in their delivery across the District.
Objective 6. Natural environment:  Protect, maintain, restore and enhance the
quality, diversity, character, local distinctiveness, biodiversity and geodiversity of the
natural environment, creating links between wildlife sites ensuring that open
countryside is protected against insensitive and sporadic development, the
characteristics of the local landscape are respected and the unnecessary loss or
sterilisation of natural resources is prevented.
Objective 7. Historic environment:  Protect and enhance the character,
distinctiveness and historic significance of settlements and their wider landscape and
townscape settings, thereby recognising the important contribution that heritage
assets and their settings make to securing a high quality public realm and supporting
tourism and the economy.
Objective 8. Town/village centres:  Support and enhance the vitality and viability of
market town and larger village centres as places for shopping, leisure, cultural,
commercial and community activities, thereby recognising and embracing their valued
role as the hearts of their communities. This will be achieved by encouraging retail,
leisure and commercial development in appropriate locations and at appropriate
scales.
Objective 9. Design:  Ensure that new development is of high quality and sustainable
design which reflects local character and distinctiveness, provides attractive, healthy
and safe environments, respects residential amenity and promotes sustainable
behaviours including renewable energy technologies, and waste reduction.
Objective 10. Transport:  Provide greater opportunities to reduce car use, thereby
reducing the impacts of road traffic on local communities, the environment and air
quality, by locating development where there is good access to jobs, services and
facilities, and by supporting improvements in public transport, walking and cycling
networks and facilities.
Objective 11. Flood risk:  Locate new development in areas which will not put life or
property at risk of flooding and build associated resilience by requiring the use of
appropriate sustainable drainage systems in new developments and allowing for the
provision of infrastructure associated with minimising flood risk, including in relation to
future risk from climate change.
Page 14Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Objective 12. Environmental impact:  Minimise the environmental impact of
development and its vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, by reducing
pollution and waste as much as possible, maximising water and energy efficiency, and
promoting the use of low carbon, renewable energy, and other alternative
technologies, with sustainable construction methods.
Objective 13. Tourism and Culture: Promote the sustainable growth of tourism,
cultural activities and access to the countryside for the benefit of both residents and
visitors. Enable the interpretation of the cultural assets of the District in order to enrich
people's experiences.
Objective 14: Neighbourhood Planning:  Encourage and support communities to
make decisions at the local level through the preparation of neighbourhood plans and
facilitate this process by setting out a clear strategic framework.

within the East of Lutterworth SDA;
ii.about 10,100 sq.m. gross sales area of comparison shopping (A1), of which
about 8,000 sq.m. should be in Market Harborough and 1,500 sq.m. in
Lutterworth (including within the East of Lutterworth SDA).
3.bring forward strategic development areas at East of Lutterworth and Scraptoft
North and ensure that they become well-planned, high quality living environments
and that they support the maintenance and improvement of employment areas,
shopping centres and community facilities both within them and nearby;
4.ensure that the quantity and location of development within or adjoining the
Leicester Principal Urban Area safeguards the identity of the communities of
Scraptoft and Thurnby/Bushby and supports regeneration and development
objectives in the neighbouring City of Leicester and Oadby and Wigston Borough;
5.consolidate Market Harborough’s role as a focus for development within the District,
subject to traffic and environmental constraints, while promoting its historic function
as a market town and safeguarding its compact and attractive character;
6.maintain and improve the character and environment of the market town of
Lutterworth and develop Broughton Astley, both as Key Centres providing housing,
business, retail, leisure, and community facilities to serve each settlement and its
catchment area;
7.enable Fleckney, Great Glen, and The Kibworths and, to a lesser extent, Billesdon,
Houghton on the Hill, Husbands Bosworth, and Ullesthorpe to operate as Rural
Centres providing housing, business, retail, leisure, and community facilities to
serve their needs and those of surrounding areas;
8.meet local needs in Selected Rural Villages, while protecting the character and
environment of local areas; and
9.strictly control development in the countryside and on designated open space within
all settlements. 
Page 17Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20193.1 SS1 Explanation
3.1.1 The evidence base has identified the need for new housing, employment, and retail
developments over the period up to 2031. Policy SS1 sets out the scale of new
development required to meet the Local Plan Objectives. The policy sets the overall
framework for the rest of the Local Plan, setting out the proposed scale and distribution of
new development by reference to existing and emerging growth plans for the sub-region of
Leicester and Leicestershire and to the existing hierarchy of settlements within the District,
with a focus on those at the higher levels of the hierarchy. Development in these locations
will support identified growth areas and critical economic corridors and help to avoid the
need for unnecessary journeys, thus limiting car usage and carbon emissions, while
possibly enhancing and protecting local services. The main features of the strategy are
illustrated in the Key Diagram (Fig. A.3).
3.1.2 Following revocation of the East Midlands Regional spatial strategy in 2013, strategic
growth in Leicester and Leicestershire, especially infrastructure provision, has been guided
by the Strategic Economic Plan (SEP). The SEP is the key overarching growth strategy
that sets out how the Leicester and Leicestershire Economic Partnership (LEP) intends to
bring together the European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF) Strategy, City Deal
and Growth Deal to build on the region's competitive advantages and tackle the major
risks to its economy. The SEP provides the framework for achieving the LEP's vision by
investing in Place, Businesses and People. It aims to unlock development sites and
improve public realm and connectivity to enable the efficient transport of people and
goods. It defines five growth areas where infrastructure investment will be prioritised,
including the Leicester Urban Area and South West Leicestershire which covers
Lutterworth and the M1 and A5 corridors. The SEP (which runs to 2020) is to be refreshed
but is expected to maintain the same growth areas. Strategic Documents
3.1.3 The Midlands Connect Partnership was established in 2014 and is a pan-Midlands
grouping of local transport authorities, local enterprise partnerships, local business
representatives, and the Department for Transport with its key delivery bodies which now
forms the transport component of the Midlands Engine for Growth. 
3.1.4 Midlands Engine for Growth was published in March 2017, linked to the national
Industrial Strategy. Midlands Engine is a long term investment strategy covering the area
from Shropshire to Lincolnshire the M1 and the M6. Its aim is to promote growth in the
Midlands at the heart of the UK economy. Midlands Engine has a five key themes:
promote the area nationally, support delivery of Midlands Connect, promote innovation,
provide finance for business, and encourage skills.

Page 19Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20193.1.5 The Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan (SGP) builds on the
transport strategy already prepared for the Midlands Engine and Midlands Connect
strategies. It is an overarching plan which sets out the aspirations for delivering growth
(housing, economic and infrastructure) in Leicester and Leicestershire until 2050. The aim
of the Strategic Growth Plan is to help realise the opportunities and manage the risks of
growth and to overcome the challenges experienced by existing communities and create
high quality developments with supporting infrastructure across the LEP area. A
consultation relating to a Strategic Growth Statement was undertaken in Summer 2016 on
the high level plan objectives, options for growth and evidence requirements. Following
further public consultation, the final Leicester and Leicestershire Strategic Growth Plan
was published in December 2018.
3.1.6 The settlement hierarchy identifies the settlements which are most suitable in
sustainability terms to meet the development needs of the District to 2031. It provides the
framework from which the spatial strategy has evolved and sustainable development can
be realised across the District to 2031. This is set out in more detail in Appendix F The
settlement hierarchy . The Settlement Hierarchy
3.1.7 At the top of the hierarchy is the whole built-up area of Leicester, including the City
and parts of adjoining local authority areas that are physically joined to it, known as the
Leicester Principal Urban Area (PUA). Within Harborough District this includes the suburbs
that have been developed over many years centred on the historic villages of Scraptoft,
Thurnby and Bushby. This area enjoys relative ease of access to the range of higher order
health, education, cultural and retail services and employment opportunities available
within Leicester City and is well suited to meet housing needs arising from the City. It
already has almost 960 new housing completions (since 2011) and commitments and is
proposed for a further 1,200 homes.
3.1.8 At the next level in the hierarchy is Market Harborough, a Sub-Regional Centre which
was the focus of growth set out in the 2011 Harborough District Core Strategy to 2028. It is
relatively self-contained with a wide range of services, facilities, shops and employment
opportunities and good public transport links. It is a good location for development but is
already committed to receiving about 1,500 new homes in the Market Harborough
Strategic Development Area to the north-west of the town, with a similar number of
completions (since 2011) and commitments elsewhere in the town. It also has about 9.5
hectares of land permitted for employment uses. Given these commitments, further
development is limited to approximately 1,078 dwellings on three major housing sites, a 13
hectare allocation for employment within the SDA and the completion of employment sites
that have previously been allocated. 
3.1.9 Lutterworth and Broughton Astley are identified as Key Centres. Although similar in
size, Lutterworth has a much wider range of services, facilities, shops and employment
than Broughton Astley, and benefits from direct access to the M1. Magna Park, a large
strategic distribution/logistics development, lies just to the west of the town providing
Page 20Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019employment opportunities in addition to the many within the town itself. Lutterworth is
therefore an appropriate location for significant housing and employment development to
meet a large part of the District's requirement. Policy SS1 proposes that a Strategic
Development Area (SDA) be allocated on land east of Lutterworth to deliver around one
third of the District's requirement for new dwellings as well as further dwellings after the
plan period, between 2031 and 2036. It also proposes 23 hectares of employment land. In
addition to safeguarding existing storage and distribution at Magna Park, Policy SS1 also
enables additional strategic storage and distribution development, including 380,000sq.m
already permitted and a further 320,000sq.m on land north and west of Magna Park. 
3.1.10 Broughton Astley was first identified as a Key Centre in the 2011 Harborough Core
Strategy with the aim of broadening its retail, service and employment provision. A
neighbourhood plan has been made which identified suitable sites and planning consents
are now in place for retail and employment uses. The neighbourhood plan also allocates
more than enough housing land to meet its needs. 
3.1.11 Rural Centres are identified as a focus for rural development, to serve both the
settlements themselves and the surrounding rural area. The size of these settlements, and
level of services and facilities within them varies considerably. Fleckney, The Kibworths
and Great Glen are the largest with significant village centres offering a range of shops
and services. Fleckney has substantial employment provision. The Kibworths benefit from
a secondary school. Great Glen is relatively close to the PUA and its higher order services,
facilities and employment. Billesdon, Houghton on the Hill, Husbands Bosworth and
Ullesthorpe are smaller settlements with a more limited range of services. Focusing rural
development in these villages will help to support existing facilities and provide a focal
point for use by residents of surrounding smaller villages and hamlets. 
3.1.12 Whilst Rural Centres will be the main focus for development in rural areas, villages
with access to at least two of the six key services (as described in Appendix F) have been
identified as Selected Rural Villages. These are sustainable locations for more limited
growth that will help to sustain these villages.
3.1.13 Paragraph 78 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) makes it clear
that development in rural areas should be located where it will enhance or maintain the
vitality of rural communities and this can include development in one village supporting
services in a village nearby. Adopting this approach, the settlement hierarchy has grouped
together neighbouring villages which share a primary school within acceptable, safe
walking distance as composite Selected Rural Villages (Church and East Langton, the
Claybrookes, and Great Easton with Bringhurst). 
3.1.14 Rural villages and other settlements which do not meet the criteria for identification
as Selected Rural Villages are not considered sustainable locations for development and
are at the bottom of the settlement hierarchy. They are considered countryside and
proposals and will be assessed against policies GD3 Development in the Countryside and
GD4 New Housing in the Countryside . 
Page 21Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019NPPF Context
3.1.15 Policy SS1 meets several underlying principles of the NPPF, including:
•being plan-led;
•empowering people through neighbourhood plans;
•creating and enhancing places;
•pro-actively driving and supporting sustainable development;
•promoting the vitality of main urban areas;
•recognising the intrinsic nature of the countryside while supporting rural communities;
•promoting mixed use development; and
•actively managing patterns of growth to focus significant development in locations which
are, or can be made, sustainable. 
3.1.16 Furthermore, in relation to rural areas, the NPPF is clear that, in order to promote
sustainable development, housing should be located where it will enhance or maintain the
vitality of rural communities, that new rural housing should not only address housing
supply and affordability issues but also support the broader sustainability of villages, and
that all settlements can play a role in delivering sustainable development in rural areas. 
3.1.17 The NPPF also states that local plans should meet objectively assessed needs
unless there would be significant adverse impacts. Key evidence to assess housing and
economic development needs has come from the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing
and Economic Development Need Assessment (HEDNA), 2017, the Strategic Housing
Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA), 2016 and the Strategic Employment Land
Availability Assessment (SELAA), 2017.
3.1.18 The distribution of development, particularly in relation to housing, was selected
from a wide range of reasonable alternatives. The Options Consultation Document, 2015
contained 9 different options and combinations of options, although even these were
actually greater since there were two different options for a Strategic Development Area
(SDA) at The Kibworths while the site for a proposed Strategic Development Area in
Scraptoft/Thurnby was amended after the Options Consultation by a further proposal for a
SDA at Scraptoft North. Following consultation on the original 9 options, a comprehensive
analysis of the latest proposals, including the proposed Scraptoft North SDA was
undertaken looking at the available evidence relating to the following factors:How the spatial strategy was arrived at
•Consultation – assessing the key issues raised during the Options Consultation in
relation to each of the 9 Options;
•Deliverability  - comprising evidence on Land Availability, Infrastructure, and Viability;
and
•Planning Principles - comprising an assessment against Sustainability  (using evidence
from the Sustainability Appraisal (SA) Interim Report, September 2015), NPPF (2012)
Core Principles and Local Plan Objectives.
Page 22Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20193.1.19 This resulted in the identification of four Selected Options which were subject to the
collection of further more detailed evidence and to a further assessment based on that
evidence, looking at the following factors: 
•Transport -  including peak hour traffic impacts, network stresses in south-east
Leicester, accessibility by sustainable transport, and transport benefits.
•Deliverability - covering housing land availability, marketability, infrastructure
constraints and costs, viability, ownership issues and longer term potential.
•Environmental factors - flood risk; landscape capacity; Sustainability Appraisal of built
heritage, natural environment, and resource use; and climate change mitigation.
•Socio-economic factors - location in relation to housing need; proximity to and
provision of employment, retail, education and community facilities; Sustainability
Appraisal of effects on housing, economy, health and well-being; open space provision;
Gypsy and Traveller provision; and air quality impacts.
•Planning principles - re-assessment against NPPF (2012) Core Principles. 
3.1.20 The outcome of this was to identify a hybrid option including the East of Lutterworth
SDA and the SDA at Scraptoft North. 
3.1.21 A single approach was adopted for the distribution of general employment
development (Use Classes B1, B2 and non-strategic B8 i.e. individual units below 9,000
square metres) for all 9 options other than for options involving The Kibworths and East of
Lutterworth SDAs which included slightly higher levels of employment, reflecting promoter
proposals. The distribution reflected established centres of economic activity and the
settlement hierarchy as well as the pattern of housing growth under specific options,
developer proposals for SDAs and the availability of land for employment purposes. 
3.1.22 Following the options consultation, which informed the proposed approach to
employment set out in this Local Plan, a comprehensive assessment similar to that
described above was undertaken looking at available evidence and focussing on
deliverability and planning principles factors. The choice in terms of the distribution of
employment, was led by the choice of housing option.

period; and
 4. the monitoring of site/area-specific policies.
Page 24Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194 General development policies
GD1 Achieving sustainable development
1.When considering proposals for development the Council will take a positive
approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development
contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). It will work
proactively and collaboratively with applicants to find joint solutions which mean that
proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure development that
improves the economic, social and environmental condition of the District.
2.Planning applications that accord with the Development Plan (including this Local
Plan) will be approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate
otherwise.
3.Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of
date at the time of making the decision, the Council will grant permission, unless:
a.any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as
a whole; or
b.specific policies in the NPPF indicate that development should be restricted.
4.1.1 This policy sets out the Council's commitment to promoting sustainable development
within the District in line with the 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' in the
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (paragraph 11). This presumption is at the
heart of the NPPF so as to ensure that sustainable development is pursued in a positive
way. Policy GD1 confirms that the presumption will be applied locally and reflects the
NPPF in making it clear that development which is considered sustainable will be
approved without delay. 4.1 GD1 Explanation
4.1.2 The NPPF defines sustainable as 'meeting the needs of the present generation
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. It
emphasises that three dimensions need to be considered in achieving sustainable
development, namely economic, social and environmental. New growth across
Harborough District needs to be 'sustainable' by supporting the local economy, by
providing social benefits, by protecting and enhancing the natural and built environment,
and by reducing the need to travel, particularly by private car. The principles of sustainable
development are reflected in the Local Plan's vision and objectives and are incorporated
into the Plan's policies. 
4.1.3 The 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' does not mean that all
planning applications will be approved as development must accord with the policies of the
Development Plan which reflects the principles of sustainable development. The
Page 25Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Development Plan comprises this Local Plan and any relevant 'made' neighbourhood
plans, together with adopted minerals and waste plans applying to the District that are
prepared by Leicestershire County Council. With regard to planning applications for
development for which there is no relevant policy or where the relevant policy is out of
date, including any time when the Council cannot demonstrate a minimum 5 year housing
land supply, then the decision-taking process set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF, which is
reiterated in Policy GD1, will apply. The NPPF (paragraph 14) sets out special provisions
which may apply in the case of recently ‘made’ neighbourhood plans.
What evidence has
informed this policy? None (other than the provisions of the NPPF) in terms of supporting
the preparation of this Local Plan. This policy seeks to achieve
sustainable development which the NPPF identifies as being the
purpose of planning.
Which Local Plan
objectives will it meet?This policy has links to all the objectives of the Local Plan as it sets out
general principles. 
How will it be
implemented?Through decisions on planning applications. 
How will it be monitored? This policy outlines the decision-making process that will be
undertaken in the determination of planning applications. It is therefore
not necessary to monitor this policy. Table A.2 Supporting Information: Policy GD14.2 GD1 Supporting information
Page 26Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GD2 Settlement development
1.In addition to sites allocated by this Local Plan and neighbourhood plans,
development within the existing or committed built up area of Market Harborough,
Key Centres, the Leicester Principal Urban Area (PUA), Rural Centres and Selected
Rural Villages will be permitted where: 
a.it respects the form and character of the existing settlement and, as far as
possible, it retains existing natural boundaries within and around the site,
particularly trees, hedges and watercourses; or
b.it includes the redevelopment or conversion of redundant or disused buildings, or
previously developed land of low environmental value, and enhances its
immediate setting.
2.In addition to sites allocated in this Local Plan and neighbourhood plans,
development adjoining the existing or committed built up area of Market
Harborough, Key Centres, the Leicester Principal Urban Area (PUA), Rural Centres
and Selected Rural Villages will be permitted where:
a.it does not disproportionately exceed the settlement's minimum housing
requirement in Policy H1, taking into account allocations, completions and
commitments (where there is no residual minimum housing requirement due to
allocations, completions and commitments, only minor additional residential
development will be supported); or
b.it is necessary to meet an identified district-wide housing need, or local housing
need as evidenced through a housing needs survey or a neighbourhood plan; or
c.it comprises the redevelopment or conversion of redundant or disused buildings,
or the development of previously developed land of low environmental value, and
enhances its immediate setting;
d.its scale, individually or cumulatively with existing and committed development,  
reflects the size of the settlement concerned and the level of service provision
within that settlement;
e.it is physically and visually connected to and respects the form and character of
the existing settlement and landscape;
f.it retains as far as possible existing natural boundaries within and around the
site, particularly trees, hedges  and watercourses;
g.it complies with Policies GD6 and GD7. 
4.3.1 This policy applies to all applications for new build development within and on the
edge of settlements identified in the policy (settlements of Selected Rural Village (SRV)
status and above in the settlement hierarchy as set out in Appendix F The settlement
hierarchy ) and replaces limits to development referred to in the Harborough Core Strategy,
November 2011, and the 2001 Local Plan. This policy is needed to ensure that
development is delivered in appropriate locations and that housing development is in line4.3 GD2 Explanation
Page 27Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019with Policy SS1 The spatial strategy and the distribution set out in Policy H1 Provision of
new housing . The focus of the criteria in the policy is to ensure that sites put forward for
development are suitable and sustainable in relation to the settlement concerned. It does
not cover matters related to design, as these are part of Policy GD8 Good design in
development , or to landscape character (covered by Policy GD5 Landscape character ) or
to the historic environment (covered by Policy HC1 Built heritage ). 
4.3.2 As a rural district, Harborough's settlements have varying levels of access to local
services, facilities and public transport. Whist it is important that the settlements identified
in Policy GD2 are allowed to grow appropriately in order to maintain rural vitality, this policy
also ensures that these rural communities retain their identity and distinctiveness, as
reflected in a settlement's size, scale of service provision, form and character. An integral
part of achieving sustainable development is to ensure that growth is sensitive to its
surroundings and this is reflected through the criterion protecting natural boundaries, as
well as in the other policies referred to above. 
4.3.3 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) makes it clear that the planning
system should support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by providing for the
development needs of present and future generations (paragraph 8). The NPPF supports
the delivery of sustainable development in suitable locations with access to services,
facilities and public transport. It also emphasises that housing should be located where it
will enhance or maintain the vitality of rural communities (paragraph 78). 
4.3.4 Delivering housing to meet identified need across the District is a vital element of the
Local Plan and Policy H1 sets out target figures for the most sustainable settlements in
line with Policy SS1. These target figures are linked to ensuring that the District's housing
requirements are met and most development is directed to the most sustainable locations
in the District. Policy GD2 supports the aims of the spatial strategy by ensuring that the
settlement housing targets set out in Policy H1 are followed. Policy GD2 allows for some
flexibility where proposals comply with the criteria and other relevant policies but ensures
the spatial strategy and the plan-led system are not undermined. Once the minimum
housing requirement in Policy H1 has been met (by completions and/or commitments
including allocated sites) only minor additional residential development will be supported
as set out in GD2.2a above.
4.3.5 Delivering sites which are sustainable and suitable for settlements means that the
size, character and existing form of the built up area must be considered. In many cases
there are likely to be areas of undeveloped or open land that make a significant
contribution to a settlement's overall character and form. Whilst some of these areas are
designated as Local Green Space or open space, sport and recreation sites, there are
others which do not benefit from such specific policy protection. Criterion 2(e) of this Policy
will ensure that such sites are appropriately protected if their loss would adversely affect
the character and/or form of the settlement. 
Page 28Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.3.6 Policy GD6 and neighbourhood plans define specific Areas of Separation in locations
where the potential for settlement coalescence is greatest. As such, development
proposals within defined Areas of Separation will be considered in accordance with GD6,
and within defined Green Wedges, in accordance with GD7. 
4.3.7 In the context of providing for the development needs of all settlements across the
District, GD2's criteria-based approach will provide necessary flexibility, will be responsive
to local circumstances and will provide a positive approach to managing development in
conformity with the NPPF's presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Page 29Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GD3 Development in the countryside
1.Outside Market Harborough, Key Centres, the Principal Urban Area (PUA), Rural
Centres and Selected Rural Villages, and land adjoining them, but excluding Green
Wedges, development will be permitted where it is required for the following
purposes: 
a.agriculture, horticulture, woodland management or other similar uses appropriate
to a rural area, including uses which would help to diversify the rural economy,
such as: 
i.local food initiatives, including farm shops and small-scale food and drink
processing,
ii.tourist attractions and facilities that respect the character of the countryside,
iii.tourist accommodation, if it is of a scale that is proportionate to the identified
tourism need and subject to Policies RT2 Town and local centres and RT4
Tourism and leisure ,
iv.equestrian uses; 
b.outdoor sport and recreation and associated buildings;
c.minerals and waste development;
d.renewable energy production;
e.where it is necessary for the continuation of an existing enterprise, facility or
operation that is compatible with its setting in the countryside;
f.rural housing in accordance with Policy GD4 New housing in the countryside ;
g.the conversion or re-use of permanent and substantial buildings, including
proposals for the optimum viable use of a heritage asset;
h.minor extensions to existing dwellings and to other buildings that are subordinate
in scale and appearance to the existing building;
i.facilities to enable the delivery of digital connectivity at speeds and reliability
levels comparable with urban areas;
j.the provision or diversification of a public house, village shop or post office in
accordance with Policy HC3 Public house, post offices and village shops ;
k.other services and facilities that improve the sustainability of settlements; or
l.other uses which justify and are compatible with a countryside location.
4.5.1 It is important that the countryside is protected from unacceptable development
which would harm its intrinsic value and rural character. However, certain forms of
development are necessary to support rural life and maintain or enhance the rural
economy. Policy GD3 strikes a suitable balance between encouraging a thriving rural
economy, maintaining and, where possible, improving the sustainability of smaller rural
settlements, and conserving the character of the District's much valued countryside. 4.5 GD3 Explanation
Page 30Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.5.2 The policy defines the types of development which are acceptable in the countryside,
in appropriate circumstances, to support a thriving rural economy. Developments required
for the extraction, transportation or working of minerals and associated with waste disposal
are determined by Leicestershire County Council. Criterion k refers to services and
facilities such as village shops, libraries, community halls.
4.5.3 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) emphasises that local plan policies
should support a prosperous rural economy. Paragraph 83 sets out that this should be
done through supporting the sustainable growth and expansion of rural business and
enterprise, promoting the development and diversification of agricultural and other land-
based rural businesses, and supporting sustainable rural tourism that respects the
character of the countryside. The NPPF also recognises the intrinsic character and beauty
of the countryside (paragraph 170). 
4.5.4 The re-use of substantial brick or stone buildings which are structurally sound may
be an appropriate way of preserving an important local feature in the landscape or
providing for a rural use which otherwise may have required a new building. Minor
extensions are also acceptable in principle, subject to the provisions of this and other
relevant policies of the Local Plan being met. The conversion of agricultural buildings is
generally permitted development subject to prior notification, and can only be resisted on
limited grounds such as the current use of the building, the proposed floorspace, or if the
building is a listed building or located within a conservation area. Further restrictions
include highways and noise impact resulting from any conversion of an agricultural
building, together with flooding and contamination considerations.

1.Outside Market Harborough, Key Centres, the Principal Urban Area, Rural Centres
and Selected Rural Villages, but excluding Green Wedges, new residential
development will only be permitted either where it is in accordance with Policy GD2,
or where it is for: 
a.Housing on small sites of no more than 4 dwellings which are within or physically
and visually connected to settlements and which meet a local need for housing
of a particular type, including small dwellings for the elderly and starter homes,
providing this has been evidenced through a rural housing needs survey or a
neighbourhood plan;
b.Housing to meet the needs of a rural worker, providing that: 
i.there is an established existing functional need for a full time worker that is
directly related to the commercial enterprise or operation concerned;
ii.the business has been established for at least three years, has been profitable
for at least one of them, is financially sound and has a clear prospect of
remaining so;
iii.the need cannot be met by any existing residential accommodation at the
business or in the locality which is suitable and available to the worker;
iv.there are no available dwellings, or buildings that are suitable for conversion
to dwellings, that have recently been sold separately from the rural business
unit that could address the need;
v.the size of the dwelling is commensurate with the financial need and is not
unusually large in relation to the functional needs of the unit;
vi.its location is suitable to meet the functional need and well-related to any
existing farm buildings, dwellings or other buildings linked to the commercial
enterprise or operation concerned; and
vii.it will be kept available to meet the functional need in perpetuity through being
subject to an appropriate occupancy condition; 
c.the re-use of redundant or disused buildings that results in enhancement to their
immediate setting;
d.the subdivision of an existing dwelling;
e.a design of exceptional quality, in that it is truly outstanding or innovative and
would significantly enhance its immediate setting; or
f.the rebuilding or replacement of an existing dwelling providing that the resultant
dwelling preserves or enhances the character and appearance of the
countryside.
Page 32Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.7 GD4 Explanation
4.7.1 This policy reflects the concentration of housing development in the more
sustainable settlements, while allowing some flexibility to meet demonstrable local needs.
It supports the settlement hierarchy and the overall strategy set out in Policy SS1 The
spatial strategy .
4.7.2 Protecting the countryside is a key part of achieving sustainable development,
preserving valuable agricultural land and protecting the most valued landscapes.
Restricting development in the countryside, where public transport is more limited and
often non-existent, helps to meet the transport objective of this Local Plan as well as
contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions by reducing travel distances and reliance
upon the private car. 
4.7.3 The NPPF makes it clear that housing in rural areas should be located where it
enhances or maintains the vitality of rural communities and that new isolated homes in the
countryside should be avoided. However, it supports, as an exception, isolated new homes
in the countryside in the following categories:
•the essential need for a rural worker to live permanently at or near their place of work;
•a dwelling whose design is of exceptional quality or innovative nature;
•the optimal viable use of a heritage asset or appropriate enabling development to
secure the future of heritage assets;
•the re-use of redundant or disused buildings, leading to an enhancement to the
immediate setting; or
•the sub-division of an existing residential dwelling.
The categories referred to in bullet points 3 and 4 apply to all land uses and are included in
Policy GD3 Development in the countryside . 
4.7.4 Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) emphasises that all settlements can play a part in
delivering sustainable development and therefore blanket policies restricting housing
development in some settlements should be avoided. Policy GD4 reflects this guidance by
allowing for the delivery of small-scale housing development of a type which meets
evidenced local needs. Neighbourhood plans provide an opportunity for even the smallest
communities to cater for specific, identified needs. 
4.7.5 Two alternative approaches to managing housing development in the countryside
were put forward in the Options Consultation Paper, 2015. While both approaches would
have allowed development specified under NPPF (2012), the first would have strictly
controlled development and the second would have allowed limited infill development in
some smaller settlements. Public opinion was finely balanced. The first approach is felt to
be overly restrictive in light of planning guidance. The second approach risks too much
housing development cumulatively taking place in relatively unsustainable settlements.
This was a trend that the Harborough Core Strategy, 2011, and now this Local Plan, has
Page 33Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019been aiming to reverse by locating development in the most sustainable locations. Policy
GD4 sets out a balanced approach to protecting the countryside while allowing for housing
development to meet specific local needs. 
4.7.6 Harborough District is a popular place to live although affordability is a particular
issue. For social, economic or environmental reasons and because of continuing high
demand for rural homes, the Council considers that new isolated homes in the countryside
for occupation by rural workers should fulfil the criteria set out at 1.b in this policy. This
reflects the guidance that was previously set out in national planning policy (Annex A to
former Planning Policy Statement 7: Sustainable Development in Rural Areas), but which
was superseded by the NPPF. It nevertheless remains as a useful and generally accepted
basis for judging the need and justification for agricultural workers' dwellings. 
What evidence has
informed this policy? Responses to Options Consultation Paper, 2015; and
Annual Authority Monitoring Reports setting out the extent of rural
housing in the past.
Which Local Plan
objectives will it meet?1 - Housing
6 - Natural environment

appropriate.

Page 34Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GD5 Landscape character
1.Development should be located and designed in such a way that it is sensitive to its
landscape setting and landscape character area and will be permitted where it:
a.respects and, where possible, enhances local landscape, the landscape setting
of settlements, and settlement distinctiveness;
b.avoids the loss of, or substantial harm to, features of landscape importance;
c.safeguards important public views, skylines and landmarks; and
d.restores or provides equivalent mitigation for damaged features and/or
landscapes that would be damaged or degraded as a result of the development.
4.9.1 Harborough is essentially rural in character and the quality of the landscape has a
key role to play in maintaining the District's identity. The Local Plan provides a framework
for conserving, enhancing and managing the character, distinctiveness and appearance of
landscape alongside providing for development which meets needs and delivers a thriving
rural economy. Policy GD5 ensures that development proposals do not result in
unacceptable harm to the landscape. 4.9 GD5 Explanation

Page 35Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.9.2 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, paragraph 170) encourages
planning policies which contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment
through protecting and enhancing valued landscapes and recognise the intrinsic character
and beauty of the countryside. Landscape is an integral and vital part of the countryside.
Local plans are encouraged to include strategic policies to deliver the conservation and
enhancement of the natural and historic environment, including landscape (NPPF
paragraph 20). The preparation of landscape character assessments is also endorsed by
Planning Practice Guidance.
4.9.3 In order to promote understanding of the local landscape, in 2007 the Council
commissioned The Harborough District Landscape Character Assessment. This defined
five landscape character areas in the District, identified their main characteristics and
assessed their capacity to accommodate development without significant degradation in
their existing landscape character. These character areas are High Leicestershire,
Laughton Hills, Welland Valley, Upper Soar and Lutterworth Lowlands. Figure A.4 above
shows these landscape character areas. 
4.9.4 Complementing the District-wide assessment are several local scale and more
detailed landscape character assessment and landscape character capacity studies.
These studies provide a more fine grained assessment of the landscape around the main
settlements (Market Harborough, Lutterworth, Broughton Astley, Scraptoft/Thurnby/
Bushby and the seven Rural Centres) and provide guidance on the landscape capacity of
specific land parcels to accommodate development. 
4.9.5 In combination, these studies are a source of information about the distinctive
characteristics of the landscape across the District and surrounding the main settlements.
They provide a useful starting point for applicants seeking to assess the landscape
impacts of their proposals.

1.Areas of Separation, shown on the Policies Map, are designated between:
a.Great Bowden and Market Harborough; and
b.Bitteswell, Lutterworth and Magna Park.
2.Development in the Areas of Separation will be permitted where it would not

and distinctiveness of these settlements. 
4.11.1 Areas of Separation are defined where the potential risk of merging is at its
greatest, whether this is between settlements or settlements and nearby employment
areas. The function of these areas is to ensure that development does not harmfully
reduce the separation between settlements or between settlements and employment
areas.4.11 GD6 Explanation
4.11.2 Most settlements in the District are physically separated from each other and there
is little danger of new development resulting in villages or towns merging together.
However, there are some settlements where potential coalescence with neighbouring
settlements or employment areas is of concern. Some of these settlements have
Conservation Area status, meaning that protecting individual settlement character from
neighbouring development has added significance. 
4.11.3 The prevention of coalescence has already seen the designation of Areas of
Separation in 'made' neighbourhood plans. Policy EH2 of the Broughton Astley
Neighbourhood Plan, 2014 prevents the merging of Sutton in the Elms and Broughton
Astley. Policy S7 of the Scraptoft Neighbourhood Plan, 2015 defines an Area of Separation
to ensure Scraptoft retains its identity and prevents coalescence with development to the
south, including Thurnby and Bushby. However, much of this designation is effectively
superseded by policy GD7 Green Wedges  of this Local Plan which identifies a Green
Wedge on most of the Area of Separation. Policy GD7 will take precedence in determining
planning applications within its boundaries, as the most recently adopted part of the
development plan. Outside of the boundaries of the Green Wedge, the Area of Separation
(as defined by the Scraptoft Neighbourhood Plan) will continue to apply. A further Area of
Separation is included in the Lubenham Neighbourhood Plan to retain separation between
Lubenham and Market Harborough. Other Areas of Separation may be added by future
neighbourhood plans.
4.11.4 Policy GD6 focuses on maintaining separation in two areas where there are specific
development pressures and local community concerns over the potential loss of settlement
identity. The Great Bowden/ Market Harborough Area of Separation seeks to retain the
identity of Great Bowden and prevent coalescence with Market Harborough. The other
Page 38Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Area of Separation is between Bitteswell/ Lutterworth/ Magna Park and this aims to protect
the identity of Bitteswell from the growth of nearby Lutterworth, and to maintain separation
of both Lutterworth and Bitteswell from Magna Park. 
4.11.5 In order to provide robust evidence to the support the policy, the Council
commissioned the Area of Separation Review, 2017. This study focused on the Market
Harborough/ Great Bowden and Lutterworth/ Bitteswell/ Magna Park areas and
categorised land into parcels that make a primary, supporting or incidental contribution to
separation. This evidence was important to defining detailed Area of Separation
boundaries. 
4.11.6 Applicants putting forward proposals in these areas will need to show that they have
considered the effect on the degree of separation and suggest mitigation measures to
minimise the impact on separation.

Page 39Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GD7 Green Wedges
1.The Leicester/Scraptoft/ Bushby Green Wedge and Thurnby/Leicester/Oadby
Green Wedge are defined on the Policies Map with the aims of:
a.preventing the merging of settlements;
b.guiding development form;
c.providing access from urban areas into green spaces/open countryside; and
d.providing recreational opportunities.
2.Development within Green Wedges will be permitted where:
a. it relates to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, nature reserves, allotments, burial
grounds, outdoor leisure, sporting or recreation facilities including school playing
fields, cycleways, footpaths or bridleways; 
b. it retains the open and undeveloped character of the Green Wedge;
c. it retains or creates additional green networks between the countryside and open
spaces within the urban areas and benefits biodiversity; 
d. it retains or enhances public access to the Green Wedge, especially for
recreation; and 
e. any built development is small scale and necessary to the operational
requirements of the activity. 
4.13.1 The fringes of Leicester present particular issues in terms of the use and
environmental quality of land adjoining the built-up areas. Whilst Leicester does not have a
green belt, Green Wedges have formed part of planning policy for the Leicester urban area
for almost 30 years. Green Wedges are strategic areas of land, mostly extending from the
City into adjacent local authority areas. They are areas of largely undeveloped open land
between the urban area and the surrounding countryside. They differ from Areas of
Separation in that they are aimed not just at preventing the merging of settlements but also
guiding development form, providing a 'green lung' into urban areas and facilitating
recreational opportunities. 4.13 GD7 Explanation
4.13.2 Harborough's Green Wedges form part of the network of such designations around
the Leicester urban area. The Leicester/Scraptoft/Bushby Green Wedge lies entirely within
Harborough District and the Thurnby/Leicester/Oadby Green Wedge adjoins similar
designations in Leicester City and Oadby & Wigston Borough. Given that the importance
of these areas extends beyond administrative boundaries, Green Wedges have been the
focus of joint working for many years, including the preparation of an agreed joint
methodology for the review of their boundaries in 2009 (updated in 2011), and are now a
significant element of the Duty to Cooperate.
4.13.3 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) states that access to high quality
open spaces and opportunities for sport and recreation can make an important contribution
to the health and well-being of communities (paragraph 96). It also makes clear that
Page 40Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019significant development should be focused in locations which are or can be made
sustainable (paragraph 103). The Local Plan should therefore ensure that both aims are
balanced and achieved. The purpose of Green Wedges is not to restrict the growth of an
urban area but to ensure that, as urban development extends, open land is incorporated
within it. The policy is more restrictive than countryside policies GD3 Development in the
countryside and GD4 New housing in the countryside , which do not apply in Green
Wedges. 
4.13.4 The Core Strategy, 2011 supported the retention of Green Wedges and committed
to a review of their boundaries as part of the Local Plan preparation process. The Green
Wedge Review – Draft Technical Update, 2015 supported the Options Consultation in
September/October 2015. Whilst it recommended that the boundaries remained largely
unchanged from those identified in the 2001 Local Plan, it added that the boundaries put
forward through the Local Plan would need to take into account the scale and distribution
of housing required to meet need up to 2031. More recently the boundaries of the
Leicester/Scraptoft Green Wedge were defined in the Scraptoft Neighbourhood Plan,
2016. 
4.13.5 This Local Plan allocates Scraptoft North SDA for housing with accompanying
infrastructure and community facilities. This results in a reduction in the size of the existing
Green Wedge to the north of the village. 
4.13.6 Policy GD7 defines an area of Green Wedge, comprising grazing paddocks
between Scraptoft village and development within the City of Leicester, together with land
to the south of Scraptoft village, incorporating the Edith Cole Memorial Park and the land
on the upper slopes of the Thurnby Brook valley. The land was previously identified as part
of the Green Wedge and part of the Area of Separation included in the Scraptoft
Neighbourhood Plan, 2016. Policy GD7 will take precedence in determining planning
applications within its boundaries, as the most recently adopted part of the development
plan. Outside of the boundaries of GD7, the Area of Separation (as defined by the
Scraptoft Neighbourhood Plan) will continue to apply. 
4.13.7 The designation of the combined area as Green Wedge recognises that it has an
important role to play in protecting Scraptoft village from merging with other built up areas
to the south and west, thereby guiding future growth in Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby,
allowing opportunities for access to the countryside and providing improvements to
recreational opportunities. Not only does the designation ensure that Scraptoft village, in
particular the Conservation Area, is protected from the adverse impacts of major
development, but it also provides opportunities for the provision of recreational facilities as
part of the new SDA. There is also substantial development committed to the south of
Thurnby Brook in Thurnby and Bushby parish and the Green Wedge allows for strategic
green space and access to the countryside to be incorporated as this growth takes place.
The name of the Green Wedge has been changed to Leicester/Scraptoft/Bushby to reflect
its wider coverage. 
Page 41Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.13.8 The Thurnby/Leicester/Oadby Green Wedge is a more extensive designation. The
outer extent of the wedge south of Thurnby runs south of Bushby Lodge Farm to the edge
of Stoughton Airfield. The village of Stoughton is completely surrounded by the designation
which serves to protect it from coalescence with Leicester City and Oadby. The Green
Wedge penetrates into Leicester City to encompass Evington Golf Course and the
Arboretum. Whilst the boundaries of the Thurnby/Leicester/Oadby Green Wedge remain
similar to those identified in the 2001 Harborough Local Plan, they have been drawn to
exclude built development along Uppingham Road, including that associated with Coles
Nursery, and along Stoughton Lane. 
 4.13.9 The Green Wedges incorporate areas of land of differing agricultural and
environmental quality, which may be suitable for different types of land uses. The only
types of land use that will normally be considered appropriate for these areas are those
where the predominantly open and undeveloped nature of the land is retained. It is
recognised that built development may be required in connection with some of the uses
identified in the policy.

Page 42Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GD8 Good design in development
1.Development will be permitted where it achieves a high standard of design,
including meeting the following criteria:
a.being inspired by, respecting and enhancing both the local character and
distinctiveness of the settlement concerned;
b.where appropriate, being individual and innovative, yet sympathetic to the local
vernacular, including in terms of building materials;
c.in areas with high heritage value (Conservation Areas and in proximity to Listed
Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and other heritage assets and their settings),
reflecting those characteristics that make these places special;
d.respecting the context and characteristics of the individual site, street scene and
the wider local environment to ensure that it is integrated as far as possible into
the existing built form;
e.being designed to minimise impact on the amenity of existing and future
residents by:
i.not having a significant adverse effect on the living conditions of existing and
new residents through loss of privacy, overshadowing and overbearing impact,
and
ii.not generating a level of activity, noise, vibration, pollution or unpleasant odour
emission, which cannot be mitigated to an appropriate standard and so would
have an adverse impact on amenity and living conditions;
f.minimising the amount of water consumption;
g.minimising pollution from glare or spillage of light from external lighting;
h.minimising opportunity for crime and maximising natural surveillance;
i.protecting and enhancing existing landscape features, wildlife habitats and
natural assets (including trees, hedges and watercourses) as an integral part of
the development;
j.enhancing the public realm, including high quality open spaces and links to the
wider green infrastructure network to promote healthy lifestyles;
k.making provision for the needs of specific groups in the community such as the
elderly and those with disabilities;
l.ensuring safe access, adequate parking and servicing areas including for refuse
collection in new residential development;
m.ensuring the safe, efficient and convenient movement of all highway users,
including bus passengers, cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders; and
n.where the site has previously been developed: 
i.identifying the need for any decontamination and implementing this to an
agreed programme; and
ii.ensuring that any contamination is not relocated elsewhere to a location
where it could adversely affect the water environment or other wildlife habitats.
Page 43Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.15 GD8 Explanation
4.15.1 This policy requires all proposals to achieve a high standard of design quality to
ensure that new development is both sustainable and attractive. It aims to safeguard and
improve the character and distinctiveness of the District both now and for future
generations. Well designed places relate well to their environment, are attractive and safe,
and offer an improved quality of life for those that live and work in the District. Crime and
community safety are important factors as part of all new development, and the Council
works with Leicestershire Police and developers to ensure that all new major
developments are secured by design. 
4.15.2 Although set out as a separate design policy, these issues are important threads
that run through all aspects of the Local Plan, including the policies for individual places,
heritage, the countryside, climate change, green infrastructure and town centres. The
Council would encourage applicants for full or reserved matters applications for all major
residential schemes of 10 dwellings and above to submit assessments based on best
practice design tools such as Building for Life 12 (Design Council) and ‘Active Design’
(Sport England, in conjunction with Public Health England) as updated to assist in
complying with relevant criteria of Policy GD8. 
4.15.3 The District is rich in both designated assets, such as Conservation Areas, Listed
Buildings, Registered Parks and Gardens, and Scheduled Monuments, resulting in many
settlements having their own unique identities and character. The Local Plan will support
these characteristics with new development being sympathetic and appropriate to the
character of each settlement. 
4.15.4 Impact on neighbouring amenity resulting from new development is an important
consideration in determining planning applications. An impact on amenity through poor
design may impact on the quality of life of neighbouring occupiers, or result in a
disconnected development that fails to relate to its context. Applications that result in
unacceptable harm to neighbouring amenity, through an overlooking or overbearing
impact, or resulting in noise, odour or light pollution or disturbance will be resisted unless
the harm can be overcome through suitable planning conditions. 
4.15.5 Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) (see Appendix B Supporting evidence )
sets out, and new Supplementary Planning Documents will set out, guidance for new
development including minimum distances between principal windows and guidance for
appropriate design of new dwellings and extensions to dwellings.
4.15.6 Due to the special characteristics of settlements in the District, the Council
encourages neighbourhood plans to develop appropriate design guides, through
incorporation of Countryside Design Summaries, Village Design Statements or specific
policies into the neighbourhood plans. These policies should be justified and provide
additional and location-specific guidance to help inform future planning applications in the
neighbourhood area. Such neighbourhood plan policies will be subject to viability
Page 44Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019considerations and compliance with all Local Plan policies, the National Planning Policy
Framework and Planning Practice Guidance, and any other material considerations.
4.15.7 Land that is affected by contamination can pose a threat to groundwater, surface
water, human health and the wider environment. Consideration of these risks at an early
stage is an important consideration in the regeneration of brownfield land.

Non-exempt development in Minerals Safeguarding Areas will be permitted where the
requirements set out in the minerals safeguarding policies of the Leicestershire
County Council Minerals Local Plan have been met.
4.17.1 In relation to minerals the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) places
requirements on both local planning authorities and mineral planning authorities. The
NPPF identifies that great weight should be given to the benefits of mineral extraction and
local planning authorities should identify Minerals Safeguarding Areas. Leicestershire is a
two-tier area for local government and Leicestershire County Council is the minerals
planning authority. The County Council has identified Minerals Safeguarding Areas and
supporting policies as part of the emerging Leicestershire Minerals and Waste Local Plan
to 2031. 4.17 GD9 Explanation
4.17.2 The County Council will be consulted on non-exempt development proposals in
defined Minerals Consultation Areas covering the resources within the Minerals
Safeguarding Areas. Non-exempt development proposals are those which would lead to
the unnecessary sterilisation of mineral resources within a Minerals Safeguarding Area.
4.17.3 The Leicestershire Minerals and Waste Local Plan to 2031 was submitted in 2018.
Following hearing sessions, modifications to the plan were published in December 2018. 
4.17.4 Policy GD9 sets out the approach that the District Council will take when
determining proposals for non-minerals development within Minerals Safeguarding Areas.
The emerging Leicestershire Minerals and Waste Local Plan identifies Minerals
Safeguarding Areas within Harborough District to which the policy will apply. Proposals for
non-mineral development in these areas would need to meet a number of criteria, as set
out in the Leicestershire Minerals and Waste Local Plan Safeguarding of Mineral
Resources policy.

Page 48Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.1 H1 Explanation
5.1.1 Paragraph 65 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) requires local
planning authorities to ensure sufficient housing land is provided to meet identified needs
across the ‘housing market area’. For Harborough, this means working with the other local
authorities which together form the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area
(HMA). This is a relatively self-contained area, across which people travel to work and
move house and was identified and confirmed by the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing
and Economic Development Needs Assessment (HEDNA), 2017. 
5.1.2 The HEDNA calculated the objectively assessed need in accordance with the
Planning Practice Guidance and used the official demographic projections (2014-based
DCLG household projections, produced in July 2016) as the starting point. These
projections were then adjusted to take account of local factors affecting migration and
household formation rates and employment growth forecasts. An adjustment was made to
take account of market signals and affordable housing needs. The outcome is the
objectively assessed housing need for the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market
Area and for each local authority within it.
5.1.3 The full objectively assessed housing need (OAN) for the Leicester and
Leicestershire HMA is 4,829 dwellings per annum between 2011 and 2031 (96,580 total)
and for Harborough District is 532 dwellings per annum between 2011 and 2031 (HEDNA,
Table 89), giving an OAN for the 20 year plan period of 10,640 dwellings. Taking account
of housing needs arising from growth at Magna Park, the housing requirement is 557 dpa,
or 11,140 for the plan period, as explained in more detail below. This will be the basis for
calculating the five year supply of deliverable housing land. This is a minimum figure. The
Plan provides housing land for a minimum of 12,800 dwellings over the plan period. This
provides for a contingency and is explained in more detail below.
5.1.4 Further to the HEDNA, another study was undertaken to consider the potential
impact on housing requirements of the strategic storage and distribution growth proposed
at Magna Park, in accordance with Policy BE2 Strategic distribution . The Magna Park
Employment Growth Sensitivity Study, 2017 concluded that the HEDNA’s objectively
assessed housing needs (OAN) remain true and robust both for the Leicester and
Leicester HMA and the Harborough District. However, taking account of Objective 2,
particularly reducing the need for out-commuting and thereby helping to increase the
sustainability and self-containment of communities (from 19% currently to 25% in future),
there is a need for a small re-distribution of housing growth across the Leicester and
Leicestershire area. This re-distribution would lead to a modest increase in housing
requirements in Harborough District over and above the OAN, in order to help house the
new workers expected to be employed at Magna Park. The Magna Park Employment
Growth Sensitivity Study identified that the 700,000 sq.m. of strategic storage and
distribution proposed for the plan period within Policy BE2 results in the need for
Page 49Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019approximately 25 more dwellings per annum. This results in an overall housing
requirement for Harborough District of 557 dwellings per annum, which amounts to a total
housing requirement for the plan period of 11,140 dwellings.
5.1.5 Harborough District is able to meet all of its housing requirement within the District,
as evidenced by the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA), 2016.
However, should any local authorities within the Leicester and Leicestershire HMA be
unable to meet their full housing needs, because of either a lack of physical capacity or
significant harm to the principles and policies of the NPPF, there will be a need to consider
whether those needs can be met elsewhere within the HMA. 
5.1.6 Leicester City Council has indicated that there will be unmet housing need within the
City. A letter from Leicester City Council to all the other local planning authorities in the
HMA dated 13th February 2017 stated that ‘the scale of the need [OAN] set out in the
HEDNA is of such magnitude that it is concluded that there will be an unmet need arising
in the city’. An additional letter sent on the same day to the Planning Inspector for the
examination of the North West Leicestershire Local Plan set out ‘our formal declaration of
unmet housing need arising in the city’. The scale of the shortfall in Leicester City will be
established during preparation of their Local Plan. Leicester City Council has indicated a
desire to work with other local authorities within the HMA to ensure the unmet need can be
accommodated within the HMA by ensuring emerging plans are flexible enough to respond
to addressing such needs.
5.1.7 As set out in section 1.5, local authorities have a statutory Duty to Cooperate over
such matters and to identify how any such needs would be met. A Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) is currently being prepared by the 9 local authorities within the HMA.
This document will identify how any unmet housing needs will be accommodated and will
be signed by each authority as a binding agreement. Until the MoU is agreed and the
scale of any unmet need for Harborough to help to meet is identified, Harborough's plan
requirement is 557 dwellings per annum, or 11,140 dwellings in total over the plan period. 
5.1.8 The 557 dwellings per annum housing requirement will also be the basis for
calculating the five year supply of deliverable housing land, in accordance with NPPF,
paragraph 73. Policy H1 will help ensure that the Council is able to demonstrate this
national requirement. Appendix G  Housing trajectory sets out the expected annual housing
delivery throughout the plan period. From 2018/19 and every year throughout the plan
period, the housing trajectory demonstrates at least a five year supply of deliverable
housing land.
5.1.9 The 5 Year Housing Land Supply report, as at 31 March 2018 shows that a 5% buffer
has been applied, moving land forward from later on in the plan period to ensure choice
and competition in the market for land. 
Page 50Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.1.10 Policy H1 provides for delivery of the housing plan requirement, plus an additional
15% contingency in the supply of housing land in order to allow for possible future
circumstances affecting the supply of housing in the District, including:
•a potential need to help meet demonstrable unmet housing need arising from other local
planning authorities within the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area
(HMA);
•a slower delivery than expected on housing allocations and/or the strategic
development areas;
•housing sites gaining planning permission but not delivering completed housing in a
timely manner or at the density originally proposed;
•changing economic circumstances affecting the take-up of housing;
•the non-delivery of housing sites due to site-specific factors; and
•in order to provide flexibility and choice in the local housing market.
5.1.11 Policy H1 therefore makes provision for a minimum of 12,800 dwellings from 2011
to 2031. Of this, about 8,792 dwellings have already been built or committed (through the
granting of planning permission, or through allocation in neighbourhood plans) with a
further 225 anticipated on windfall sites. Policy H1 therefore provides housing land for a
minimum of a further 3,975 dwellings.
5.1.12 Housing land is provided in accordance with the settlement hierarchy and strategic
aims of Policy SS1 The spatial strategy  . The sources of housing land supply are set out at
Table B.1  below. Policy H1 includes slightly rounded figures.

To be delivered on non-allocated sites 307
Assumed contribution from unidentified (windfall) sites 225
Total housing land supply 12,992Table B.1 Sources of Housing Land Supply
5.1.13 Housing land supply includes provision of two Strategic Development Areas (SDAs)
at:
•land to the east of Lutterworth, delivering approximately 1,260 dwellings within the plan
period and a further approximately 1,490 dwellings beyond 2031;
•land to the north of Scraptoft, delivering approximately 1,200 dwellings within the plan
period.
Page 51Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.1.14 The remainder of Harborough's housing land supply is provided in accordance with
the housing distribution strategy used in the 2011 Harborough Core Strategy, which
concentrates housing development in the urban areas. This reflects the generally more
limited services available in rural settlements, and thus contributes to reducing journey
lengths, especially by private car, and associated carbon emissions. 
5.1.15 Policy H1 identifies the approximate number of homes to be provided in or adjoining
each settlement in the settlement hierarchy. These homes will be provided on a range of
sites, including on land specifically allocated for housing within the policy in the larger
settlements. These specific sites are allocated in order to: 
•provide certainty about the location of significant scale development (for local
communities, infrastructure providers and developers);
•aid delivery of the individual sites; and
•ensure delivery of the overall strategy. 
5.1.16 Each allocated site has been assessed through the SHLAA and identified as either
deliverable within the first 5 years of the plan period or developable later within the plan
period. The envisaged start date and duration of construction for each allocation (taking
account of the extent of site preparation and upfront infrastructure provision required,
together with expected overall annual delivery rates) is set out at Appendix G Housing
trajectory . Each allocation is supported by a site-specific policy in Part C Places and Sites .
5.1.17 The scale of new housing to be provided in individual settlements reflects the roles
of different places in the settlement hierarchy (see Policy SS1 The spatial strategy ). These
roles partly reflect the population size of the settlements and their location in respect of
other settlements but also relate to the range of activities and services present and, in
relation to primary schools, their ability to expand to accommodate the needs generated by
new development. In selecting the scale of housing to be provided in each settlement,
account has been taken of fundamental constraints on development, such as flood risk,
and the supply of potential development sites in the Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment (SHLAA). It also included further detailed consideration of villages where the
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) of this Local Plan identified potential sensitivity, or where the
SHLAA sites were considered to conflict with the criteria in Policy GD2 Settlement
development . Each settlement figure is a residual figure (as at 31 March 2018), taking
account of existing commitments and previous completions within the settlement. For this
reason there are relatively few dwellings required to be found in Rural Centres, where a
large number of planning applications have been recently approved. Some settlements
have not been set a minimum housing requirement under Policy H1 because of the
substantial number of completions and/or commitments that had already taken place by 31
March 2018 in proportion to the size of the settlement and the level of service provision.
Policy GD2 allows for some flexibility in the provision of housing, but prevents a level of
growth which could risk overwhelming local character and facilities or distorting the spatial
strategy. 
Page 52Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.1.18 In order to provide choice in the housing market, provide a mix of sites and make
sites available to small and medium size house builders, the Local Plan also makes
provision for smaller housing sites. Provision of smaller sites will be made through: the
delivery of existing small site commitments; 'windfall' sites (as defined in the NPPF
glossary) and small sites identified in the SHLAA that accord with policies GD2 Settlement
development  and GD4 New housing in the countryside ; and housing allocations in
neighbourhood plans. Information on the current status of neighbourhood plans can be
found on the Council's website.
5.1.19 The forecast for windfall delivery takes account of past rates of delivery, in
accordance with NPPF, paragraph 70. The forecast excludes:
•residential gardens;
•sites identified in the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA); and
•sites in rural centres and sustainable rural villages, delivery of which will contribute
towards the provision for the settlement set out in Policy H1.

Page 53Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019H2 Affordable housing
1.40% affordable housing will be required on housing sites:
a.of more than 10 dwellings; or
b.with a combined gross floorspace of more than 1,000 square metres.
2.The tenure split for the affordable housing will be as follows:
a.about 75% affordable or socially rented; and
b.about 25% low cost home ownership products; or
c.a variation on the above mix which is shown to be justified by reference to the
latest assessment of affordable housing need.
3.Where on-site provision is demonstrated to be impractical, off-site commuted sums
of an equivalent value will be made in lieu of on-site provision.
4.Where small housing developments (of 10 or fewer dwellings or with a combined
gross floorspace of 1,000 square metres or less) are proposed within five years of
each other on sites that have a spatial relationship (such as a shared access or
being located adjacent to each other), or on adjacent sites that are (or have been
within the five year period) in the same ownership, affordable housing will be
required where a cumulative total of more than 10 dwellings  or a combined gross
floorspace of more than 1,000 square metres is proposed.
5.Proposals which do not meet the above policy requirements will be acceptable
where it is demonstrated to the Council's satisfaction that a different level or mix of
affordable housing is required to make the development viable and the approach
contributes towards creating mixed and balanced communities. 
5.3.1 Affordable Housing is provided for sale or rent to those whose needs are not met by
the market and includes social rented, affordable rented and low cost home ownership
products. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (paragraph 61) requires local
planning authorities to set policies to meet affordable housing need in order to help create
sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities. 5.3 H2 Explanation
5.3.2 The number of affordable houses needed in the District has been calculated at 179
new affordable homes per annum from 2017 to 2031 (Affordable Housing Need Update,
Appendix 1, Responses to the Inspector’s Initial Questions Q1 – Q23, 2018). This figure
includes an estimate of the backlog of households currently in need and a prediction of
future need. Total need is compared with an estimate of future supply, to give a net figure
for the number of affordable homes needed in the plan period. 
5.3.3 Policy H2 requires housing developments to provide a minimum of 40% of the
dwellings as affordable housing. 
Page 54Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.3.4 The threshold site size of more than 10 dwellings to provide affordable housing
specified in Policy H2 is set by national policy and guidance. 
5.3.5 The affordable housing requirement will be met in partnership with registered
affordable housing providers, such as housing associations, to ensure the amount of
affordable housing required to meet the requirement is delivered. The Council will support
applications from registered providers, housebuilders and other relevant parties to Homes
England for funding through its affordable homes programmes. 
5.3.6 The required affordable housing tenure split reflects evidence of the relative need for
different affordable housing products (HEDNA, Table 43). The relative requirements have
been rounded for ease of implementation. The term 'intermediate housing' used in the
HEDNA has been replaced in the policy with the broader range of products described as
'low cost home ownership products'. The tenure split set out in the policy conforms with
national policy requirements for housing sites to deliver a minimum of 10% affordable
home ownership units. However, Policy H2 allows for a different tenure split to be provided
to reflect the latest evidence of need. Provision of a different tenure split would require
agreement with the Council, following liaison with the relevant registered providers. The
make-up of provision type within these tenures will be determined by the Council on a site-
by-site basis according to the latest evidence of local need.
5.3.7 The Council is keen to ensure that affordable housing is delivered in circumstances
where small housing sites are developed adjacent to each other, or have another spatial
relationship such as a common access or where parts of a site are developed via separate
planning applications within 5 years of each other. In these circumstances the Council will
require provision of affordable housing commensurate with the cumulative total number of
dwellings proposed on the sites to be developed. 
 5.3.8 Sites will be designed to help create mixed and balanced communities, to avoid an
over-concentration of one particular form of housing. Where on-site provision is
demonstrated to be impractical following consultation with registered affordable housing
providers, the developer will provide a commuted sum to the Council at an equivalent
value which recognises the need and cost of future land acquisition, in order to allow for
the provision of affordable housing on a separate site.
 5.3.9 The affordable housing requirements set out in Policy H2 have been assessed in
terms of their potential impact upon the viability of individual housing developments. The
Local Plan Viability Assessment, 2017 demonstrates that both the required percentage of
affordable housing and the mix of tenures are viable across a range of housing
developments in the District and for both the East of Lutterworth and Scraptoft North
Strategic Development Areas. 
5.3.10 However, should an applicant consider that an individual housing proposal is unable
to meet these affordable housing requirements due to particular unusual circumstances,
the applicant will be required to submit a viability assessment to the Council. In such cases
Page 55Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019the Council will commission an independent review of the viability assessment, for which
the applicant will bear the cost. This review should take account of the availability of public
funding. Only where the independent review supports the conclusions of the applicant's
viability assessment will a scheme which does not meet the affordable housing
requirements be considered appropriate. In relation to sheltered housing, it is recognised
that provision of affordable housing may be particularly difficult to achieve in relation to
extra care schemes  and other types of supported living schemes. In such circumstances,
the policy will be implemented on a case by case basis, and the individual viability
assessment and its review will be used to demonstrate an appropriate affordable housing
requirement / commuted sum.
5.3.11 The Planning Practice Guidance enables the provision of starter homes on
industrial and commercial land which is considered under-used or unviable. Applications
for starter homes on such sites will be considered in the context of the need to retain key
employment land for use by local businesses, as set out in Policy BE3  Existing
employment areas . In addition, there will be consideration of whether the site is suitable for
housing use, taking account of such considerations as its location in relation to retail and
community services, and any impacts upon the amenity of the site in question arising from
adjoining uses. 
5.3.12 Policy H3 Rural exception sites includes requirements concerning the development
of affordable housing in rural locations where particular provisions apply.

Page 57Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019H3 Rural exception sites
1.Development proposals for affordable housing on small sites in rural areas that
would not normally be permitted for housing, will be approved as rural exception
sites where:
a.the development would meet clearly evidenced local affordable housing need;
b.the housing remains affordable in perpetuity;
c.the site is proportionate in scale to, closely related to, and in safe and reasonable
walking distance of a rural settlement; and
d.the development respects the character, form and appearance of the immediate
vicinity and surrounding rural area. 
2.Small numbers of market homes may be permitted on rural exception sites where
they:
a.are essential to enable the delivery of affordable units;
b.meet an identified and proven element of local need, such as starter homes or
units to enable ‘downsizing’; and
c.constitute no more than 20% of the number of dwellings proposed, the exact
percentage being determined by the viability of each scheme
5.5.1 The development of rural exception sites is an exceptional circumstance where
affordable housing development may be permitted in the open countryside. 'Affordable
housing' refers to a number of housing products as defined by the National Planning Policy
Framework (NPPF), 2019. Rural exception sites will be considered as an exception to
Policies SS1 The spatial strategy , GD2 Settlement development , GD4 New housing in the
countryside , and H1 Provision of new housing . However, rural exception sites are still
required to comply with all other policies of the Local Plan, together with the NPPF and
national Planning Practice Guidance (PPG).5.5 H3 Explanation
5.5.2 A local connection policy will be agreed per scheme between the relevant Housing
Association and the Council. The Council will ensure that dwellings provided under Policy
H3 meet local affordable housing needs through mechanisms such as lettings and
ownership criteria with the following pattern: 
•A property would usually be released to a household currently living in the Parish who
needs an affordable dwelling. Such a household would usually have lived in the Parish
for a minimum period of time (e.g. 9 out of the previous 12 months).
•If no one who lives in the Parish needs the affordable home, then any person with a
strong local connection to the Parish would be considered. Strong local connections
include a resident:
◦with immediate family living in the Parish;
◦who previously lived in the Parish;
Page 58Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019◦who works in the Parish; or
◦who needs to move to the Parish to provide care or receive care.
5.5.3 In the event that a property cannot be released to a resident who meets the criteria
as above, a cascade mechanism will be put in place to ensure that an affordable dwelling
is not left empty. This will allow for the letting or sale of affordable dwellings delivered on
rural exceptions sites to residents who live outside the Parish and will enable those in
need of an affordable home who live in neighbouring parishes to be considered ahead of
others in need elsewhere in the District. 
5.5.4 All rural exception sites must remain as affordable housing for local people in
perpetuity. This will be secured through a Section 106 legal agreement which is specific to
the site concerned.
5.5.5 Where site or financial viability constraints indicate that cross-subsidy through an
element of market housing provision may be necessary, the need for this must be justified
to the Council. This should include an economic viability assessment to demonstrate the
economic need for inclusion of market housing and clear evidence of local need for the
types of market housing proposed. The Council will need to be satisfied that there are no
other options available (e.g. funding from other sources). It must be evident from the
proposal that the local affordable housing need is the focus of the proposal so market
housing cross-subsidy should be no more than 20% of the overall scheme. This would
enable a small scheme of four affordable units to progress based on cross-subsidy from a
single market house. 
What evidence has
informed this policy?Previous delivery of exception sites in Harborough; Parish housing
need surveys. 
Which Local Plan
objectives will it meet?1 - Housing
How will it be
implemented?Through the identification of rural exception sites in partnership
with parishes, decisions on relevant planning applications and
delivery by housing associations.
How will it be
monitored? Through recording the progress of rural exception site permissions
and development in the annual Authority Monitoring Report. Any
planning permission granted contrary to the criteria in this policy
will be identified in the annual Authority Monitoring Report and the
reasons for it being granted explained. Table B.4 Supporting Information: Policy H35.6 H3 Supporting Information
Page 59Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019H4 Specialist housing
1.The provision of well-designed specialist forms of accommodation in appropriate
locations will be supported, taking into account housing needs.
2.Specialist accommodation development will be: 
a.permitted on sites within existing residential areas;
b.permitted where it is in accordance with Policy GD2;
c.sought as an integral part of all residential developments of over 100 dwellings at
a rate of at least 10% of all dwellings proposed, where:
i.the site offers a suitable location for the provision of specialist housing; and
ii.provision of specialist housing would not have an adverse impact upon the
deliverability and/or viability of the scheme.
3.Any proposal for specialist accommodation development should demonstrate that it:
a.is conveniently situated in relation to local retail and community services; and
b.has a design, layout and access suitable for occupation by the particular
specialist group for whom it is intended.
5.7.1 Specialist housing refers to forms of sheltered or extra care accommodation where
the occupiers receive care and assistance of some kind, but live in self-contained
dwellings and have a degree of independence. It is included in the C3 Use Class –
‘dwelling houses’, rather than Use Class C2 - 'residential institutions', although some
accommodation within C2 can be provided as part of the same development. On-site
communal facilities may be provided and properties can be rented, owned or part owned/
part rented. 5.7 H4 Explanation
5.7.2 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (paragraph 61) requires local
planning authorities to plan for a mix of housing needs, including for older people and
people with disabilities. 
5.7.3 The District's need for specialist housing for older people to 2031 has been
estimated to be 63 dwellings per annum or 1,267 dwellings over the plan period (Leicester
and Leicestershire Housing and Employment Development Needs Assessment (HEDNA),
2017, Table 65). 
5.7.4 The call for sites to be included in the Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment (SHLAA) did not identify any specific specialist housing sites and the Council
has very little land of its own that may be suitable. New provision often arises on
previously unidentified / redevelopment sites. However specialist housing can also be
appropriately located as part of a larger general purpose residential scheme and will be
sought by the Council on sites delivering more than 100 dwellings that offer a suitable
location. Provision of at least 10% of units on sites of 100 or more dwellings would yield
Page 60Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019approximately 280 specialist housing units throughout the plan period. In combination with
the provision of specialist housing on dedicated sites, this requirement will make a
significant contribution to meeting identified needs. This will be in addition to the 154
specialist unit completions since 2011 and the 217 units currently with planning
permission. 
5.7.5 Provision of the remaining approximately 600 units will be encouraged on suitably
located windfall sites in accordance with the spatial strategy and Policy GD2. The
provision of properties suitable for older people in the villages is also important, as many
villages have even higher age profiles. Neighbourhood plans are well placed to identify
local need and include provision in neighbourhood plan policies.
5.7.6 The design of specialist housing should include meeting the needs of those in
wheelchairs. The requirements laid out in Building Regulations Part M4(2) Category 2
include wider doorways, step free access to bathroom facilities and wider parking spaces.

How will it be
implemented?Through decisions on relevant planning applications for approved

Page 61Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019H5 Housing density, mix and standards
1.New housing development will be permitted where it:
a.makes efficient use of land and, while respecting the character of the
surrounding area, maximises the density on sites from where a full range of
services and facilities is accessible by walking, cycling and public transport; and
b.is designed to meet higher water efficiency standards of 110 litres per person per
day as prescribed in Building Regulations, Part G.
2.Major housing development should provide a mix of house types that is informed by
up to date evidence of housing need.
3.Housing development on sites capable of providing 100 dwellings or more, should
meet the accessible and adaptable standards in Building Regulations, Part M4(2)
Category 2, in 4% of dwellings proposed.
4.Proposals for self-build and custom build housing will be supported in any location
suitable for housing, including allocated sites, committed sites, windfall sites and
sites which are in accordance with Policy GD2. Where there is clear evidence of
demand, and where servicing and site arrangements can be made suitable and
attractive for such homes, the Council will seek the provision of land for custom and
self-build housing on housing allocations capable of providing 250 or more
dwellings, as part of an appropriate mix of dwellings.
5.9.1 The density of a residential development is the amount of houses on a given area of
land and is normally expressed in terms of the number of dwellings per hectare. Housing
density should make efficient use of land whilst reflecting local circumstances. 5.9 H5 Explanation
5.9.2 The centres of Market Harborough and Lutterworth in particular have the highest
concentrations of both public transport and access to other services. Higher residential
densities close to these locations makes the best use of such sites, subject to appropriate
design and layout. In more peripheral locations, lower density housing may be more
appropriate. However, rather than applying rigid density standards, the appropriate density
should be a result of good design and layout, in accordance with Policy GD8 Good design
in development  and informed by design reviews where appropriate. 
5.9.3 The European Environment Agency defines water stress as occurring when the
demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period or when poor
quality restricts its use. The review of water resources in 2013 identified that the majority of
the District is considered to be moderately water-stressed, but towards the east of the
District there are areas that are seriously stressed. This means there is pressure on
drinking water resources and implications for water quality, particularly in drought
conditions. 
Page 62Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.9.4 Given the level of growth and the potential impacts of climate change it is vital that
new developments limit their additional demand on water to reduce this pressure. Severn
Trent has identified a risk to long term supply and demand in the strategic grid (covering
Harborough District) from 2020. Developments designed to be more water efficient,
through the installation of water efficient fittings and appliances, can help reduce water
consumption, as can capturing and re-using rain water and grey water (i.e. waste water
generated from households from streams without faecal contamination) on-site.
Residential developments will be expected to meet the requirement in the Building
Regulations, currently 110 litres per person per day, including five litres for external water
use.
5.9.5 In establishing the appropriate mix of dwelling types, account should be taken of the
range of accommodation types required in the local area. This is derived from an
understanding of the size and characteristics of future households over the plan period
and an appreciation of how well suited the existing dwelling stock is to meet those needs.
New housing should complement the existing accommodation and provide the additional
types of housing required. The prescribed mix of house types required in 'major
development' schemes (see Appendix M Glossary ) will be informed by the Leicester and
Leicestershire Housing and Employment Development Needs Assessment (HEDNA),
2017 and other up to date evidence of need, including housing needs assessments,
neighbourhood plans and local needs surveys. 
5.9.6 There are optional Building Regulations standards that apply to housing which is
intended for occupiers who require greater degrees of accessibility and adaptability. The
HEDNA, 2017 has identified a growing unmet need for wheelchair accessible housing.
Meeting this need would require a total of 440 homes over the plan period to be built to the
accessible and adaptable standard as laid out in Building Regulations, Part M4(2):
Category 2 - Accessible and adaptable dwellings. This has informed the requirement for
4% of homes on sites for over 100 homes to be built to the higher standard. The viability
implications of this requirement have been fully tested through the Harborough Local Plan
Viability Assessment. All bungalows are expected to conform to the higher standard. In
assessing whether a site is subject to this criterion, a net density of 35 dwellings per
hectare will be used. 
5.9.7 Through recent legislation, regulations and advice in respect of self-build and custom
build, the Government has made it clear that it wants more people to have the opportunity
to build their own homes. As of 22 May 2017 the Council has 57 individual registrations for
self build on the Council's self-build register. Relevant legislation (Self-build and Custom
Housebuilding Act 2015) places a duty on the Council to have regard to this register in
carrying out its planning function. The HEDNA anticipates most new delivery to be on
small windfall sites but recognises that there is some potential, through policy, to
encourage developers of larger schemes to provide plots for self-build. Policy H5 supports
self-build and custom build housing in any location considered suitable for housing in
accordance with the spatial strategy and the criteria set out in Policy GD2.

Travelling Showpeople sites.
5.Development for new, and extensions/improvements to existing permitted or lawful,
Gypsy and Traveller sites (including transit sites) will be permitted where: 
a.the development is for residential use only;
b.the site is located within safe walking distance to a settlement and has access to
a range of services including health and education provision;
c.the size reflects the scale of the nearest settlement, its local services and
infrastructure;
d.there is suitable and safe highway access;
e.the development provides mitigation measures, such as adequate and
appropriate landscape screening, to prevent adverse impacts on the character
and appearance of the locality and on neighbouring uses;
f.the site conforms to current good practice design guidelines; and
g.the development does not put the health and safety of occupants at risk through:
i.unsafe access;
Page 65Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019ii.unacceptable noise levels or air quality from existing land uses;
iii.unacceptable levels of contaminated land; or
iv.flood risk.
6.Development for new, and extensions/improvements to existing permitted or lawful,
Travelling Showpeople sites will be permitted subject to:
a.the site meeting criteria 5b - 5g above;
b.any commercial use remaining ancillary;
c.any ancillary commercial activity, the movement of vehicles to and from the site
and the maintenance of equipment on the site not creating unacceptable noise or
visual disturbance for occupants of existing land uses within the surrounding
area; and
d.additional traffic movements resulting from commercial uses not being
considered detrimental to highway safety or resulting in the residual cumulative
impact on the road network being severe.
7.Development of rural exception sites will be permitted for affordable Gypsy and
Traveller accommodation subject to the site:
a.providing affordable pitches in perpetuity; and
b.only accommodating households who are either current residents of the District
or have an existing family or employment connection with the District.
8.Provision for Caravan and Boat dwellers will be permitted subject to the proposal
meeting criteria 5a - 5g above. 
5.11.1 Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople have particular accommodation
requirements. Showpeople need space to store and maintain their show ground
equipment, especially over the winter months. All sites need to be located so that the
occupiers can pursue their business interests and access services, whilst not conflicting
with neighbouring land uses. This can lead to the need for sites to be near to employment
sites and settlements and also in countryside locations due to the availability of suitable
sites. 5.11 H6 Explanation
5.11.2 At March 2016 there were 82 residential pitches occupied by Gypsies and
Travellers across Harborough District. In addition, there were 98 plots occupied by
Travelling Showpeople households. The Gypsy and Traveller sites include well established
sites at Greenacres, north of Market Harborough, and Mere Farm, Ullesthorpe, together
with a publicly-owned site at Boneham's Lane, Gilmorton. Existing Travelling Showpeople
provision is largely concentrated south of Lutterworth.
5.11.3 The Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA), 2017 identified a
need for 5 additional pitches, and 26 further Showpeople plots as shown in Table B.7  
below. 
Page 66Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.11.4 A Gypsy and Traveller pitch is normally conditioned through a planning application
to be for up to 2 caravans per pitch, of which no more than 1 will be a static caravan. A
Travelling Showpeople plot is normally conditioned to be for up to 3 caravans per plot, of
which no more than 1 will be a static caravan. Both of the above are based on planning
merit, and are dependent upon the size of the pitch/plot proposed, together with the size of
the wider site and location of the site. Travelling Showpeople sites have significantly larger
plots than Gypsy and Traveller site pitches due to the additional space needed for the
storage, maintenance and servicing of equipment, and therefore an additional caravan will
not have the same visual impact as it would on a Gypsy and Traveller site. Licenses are a
legal requirement for all caravan sites, with licenses required to be obtained from the
Council's Environmental Health Team prior to occupation of sites, and for Travelling
Showpeople sites a Showman Guild license will also be required.

(PPTS), 2015. Policy H6 meets the identified needs of Travellers who accord with the
definition through site allocations and a criteria-based enabling policy. 
5.11.6 For those that do not meet the definition of the PPTS, 2015, the policy sets out
criteria to be applied for the provision of additional sites to meet the needs of those who do
not meet the definition, in accordance with the 2016 draft Communities and Local
Government guidance 'Housing Need for Caravan and Boat Dwellers'. This draft guidance
is concerned with all those who have a need to live in a caravan or houseboat whatever
their race or origin, but do not meet the 2015 PPTS definition through not leading a
nomadic way of life. It includes, but is not restricted to: 
•Bargees;
•Romany Gypsies;
•Irish and Scottish Travellers;
•New-age Travellers; and
•Travelling Showpeople. 
5.11.7 In addition to identifying those who do not meet the PPTS, 2015 definition, the
GTAA, 2017 identifies a need arising from 'unknown' Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling
Showpeople. The unknown need arises from sites where existing occupants were not able
to be interviewed as part of the GTAA fieldwork. The needs of these households are
recognised by the GTAA as there is likely to be future household formation from those that
meet the PPTS definition. For unknown Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople,
Page 67Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019the GTAA uses a national approximation of 10% of households meeting the PPTS
definition, and applies an annual growth rate of 1.5%. Both the need for currently unknown
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople together with those that do not meet the
PPTS definition are shown in Table B.8  below.

5.11.8 Given the itinerant nature of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople, it is
important to take account of any cross boundary considerations with neighbouring
authorities, including outside of the County, as part of the Duty to Cooperate. The outcome
of discussions between the relevant authorities is that it has been agreed that the
Harborough District is able to meet its own needs in full with no dependence on
neighbouring areas. 
5.11.9 The Council has undertaken a Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Site
Identification Study (GTTSIS), 2017 assessing all sites for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling
Showpeople provision. The results of this work have provided the list of deliverable sites,
whilst also providing updated guidance in relation to best practice regarding site
accommodation and layout. 
5.11.10 Deliverable sites are identified as allocations and are expected to help meet need
for Gypsy and Traveller sites within the first 5 years of the plan period, with a further site at
Boneham's Lane, Gilmorton to be identified to assist in meeting future needs. The existing
site at Boneham's Lane, together with the extension site adjacent to the north east are in
public ownership, with the existing site owned and managed by Leicestershire County
Council. 
5.11.11 The GTTSIS did not manage to identify any sites for Travelling Showpeople
despite extensive calls for sites and through assessing existing sites for potential
expansion. A deliverable site at Moorbarns Lane, Lutterworth has been identified to help
meet Travelling Showpeople needs. The site has a lapsed planning consent for 18
Showpeople plots, and is considered to be deliverable within the first 5 years of the plan
period. In addition, a further site of 7 plots as an expansion to an existing site in
Lutterworth will also count towards the identified need. Further provision is expected to be
achieved through the criteria-based enabling policy. 
Page 68Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20195.11.12 In addition to meeting Policy H6 criteria 2 and 4, all Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling
Showpeople sites that come forward through the allocations and enabling policy will be
subject to relevant planning application considerations, including the need for relevant
ecology surveys.

c.comprises well designed new buildings of a size and quality to cater for identified
local needs; and
d.is equipped to meet modern business requirements.
Page 70Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20196.1 BE1 Explanation
6.1.1 Policy BE1 relates to the following as set out in the Town and Country (Use Classes)
Order 1987 (as amended):
•B1a - Offices
•B1b - Research and development
•B1c - Light industry
•B2 - General industry
•B8 - Storage and distribution, where for the purposes of this plan units below 9,000sq.m
gross are considered non-strategic and units in excess of 9,000sq.m gross are
considered strategic.
6.1.2 A key function of the Local Plan is to provide the framework within which the
economic objective of promoting sustainable economic growth and increasing prosperity
for residents can be achieved. Paragraphs 80-82 of the National Planning Policy
Framework (NPPF) require local planning authorities to help achieve economic growth, by
planning pro-actively to ensure sufficient land for employment is provided to meet
identified needs. 
6.1.3 The Local Plan complements Harborough's Economic Development Strategy
'Harnessing Harborough District 2018/2023 (2018)'. This outlines the Council's
commitment to improving the economic prosperity of the District so residents, businesses
and visitors are able to thrive. The strategy sets out economic aspirations, with key
priorities around: 
•physical and digital infrastructure;
•promoting Harborough/strategic championing;
•inward investment;
•promoting and bringing forward sites for development;
•town centres, tourism and culture;
•business support and engagement; and
•skills and learning. 
6.1.4 The Leicester and Leicestershire Housing and Economic Development Needs
Assessment (HEDNA), 2017 calculates future need in accordance with the National
Planning Practice Guidance (PPG). In considering future employment land need its
approach draws together a number of strands of analysis including labour demand and
trend based forecasts. The HEDNA interrogated the economic growth potential of the
Leicester and Leicestershire Functional Economic Market Area (FEMA), the area's
economic structure and past performance. It also assessed baseline forecasts and
overlaid economic drivers and planned investment to derive a planned growth scenario. 
Page 71Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20196.1.5 The planned growth scenario sees both enhanced employment growth and
productivity improvements to 2031. Employment growth is expected across a range of
sectors, with Professional, Scientific and Technical and Administrative and support
services expected to see the highest absolute increases for the FEMA. These sectors in
particular are expected to drive demand for office floorspace. 
6.1.6 Employment growth of 9,500 jobs is expected for Harborough District (2011-31)
representing a percentage growth per annum which exceeds that expected across the
FEMA, region and UK. The HEDNA translates job forecasts for the planned growth
scenario into forecasts of employment land need by relating sectors to B class uses, and
using jobs to floorspace and floorspace to land area ratios. Set alongside this, the
assessment runs projections of need based on past completions for B1, B2 and non-
strategic B8 use, and uses demand forecasts for strategic B8 based on the Leicester &
Leicestershire Strategic Distribution Study: Update, 2016. The strategic distribution sector
is addressed separately and more fully in Policy BE2 Strategic distribution . 
6.1.7 The identified gross need for B Class employment land in Harborough District,
excluding strategic distribution (B8 use in units over 9,000sq.m. gross floorspace), is a
minimum of 51 hectares between 2011 and 2031 (HEDNA, Table 83), as shown in Table
B.10 below.

units <9,000sq.m)Total 
Range 14 to 21 22 8 Range 44 to 51 Table B.10 Gross Land Requirements by Use Class 2011-2031 (Hectares)
6.1.8 In order to ensure delivery of sufficient land to meet the requirement for employment,
Policy BE1 takes the HEDNA future need for different B class uses and factors in the
supply side. BE1 therefore provides for a minimum of 59 hectares of employment land.
This is more than the minimum 51 hectares of gross need, identified by the HEDNA (using
the upper end of the range identified for office use). The additional supply provides for
flexibility in order to: strengthen Market Harborough’s established role as the District’s
primary economic centre; achieve a balance between jobs and areas of housing provision;
provide for a sustainable distribution of sites; and off-set potential future losses of existing
employment sites. This includes the need to replace poorer quality existing employment
floorspace which is expected to be lost during the plan period. Further allowance is made
for economic aspirations, reflecting the ambition of the emerging Harborough EDS, 2017,
the LLEP Strategic Economic Plan (SEP), 2015 and sector growth plans, and taking
account of local circumstances affecting the supply or employment-generating potential of
employment land including: 
•the objective to reduce out-commuting for work;
•provision of greater short term supply and choice in the local market;
Page 72Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•potential non-delivery of committed employment sites due to specific circumstances or
economic factors; and
•employment sites gaining permission but not delivering in a timely manner or at the
density anticipated.
6.1.9 Since the start of the plan period (1 April 2011) a net total of 18.3 hectares has been
built or committed for B1, B2, and non-strategic B8 uses through the granting of planning
permission or through allocation in neighbourhood plans. This results in a residual
requirement for a minimum of 32.7 hectares based on the upper end of the range for
offices. As illustrated in Table B.11  below, the Plan allocates sites in excess of this
minimum figure for the reasons outlined in para 6.1.8 above.

NB Totals may not add exactly due to rounding
6.1.10 Policy BE1 provides for a supply of employment land in accordance with the
settlement hierarchy and strategic aims of Policy SS1 The spatial strategy . The preferred
strategy is to focus development at Market Harborough and Lutterworth (particularly within
the SDAs) as the District's main economic centres, and at Rural Centres all of which are
well located, served by infrastructure and are accessible by sustainable modes of travel. In
order to support the delivery of allocated sites in the District's main economic centres,
outside these areas further employment delivery would only be supported in accordance
with Policy BE1.2. Policy L1 allocates part of the East of Lutterworth SDA for B8 storage
and distribution use in order to support the viability of the wider Strategic Development
Area. 
6.1.11 Policy BE1 identifies a minimum amount of land to be provided in or adjoining
particular settlements, together with site allocations. These specific sites are allocated in
order to:
Page 73Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•provide certainty about the location of significant scale development (for local resident
and business communities, infrastructure providers and developers);
•aid delivery of the individual sites; and
•to ensure delivery of the overall strategy and the minimum requirement for employment
land and different types of B class use. 
6.1.12 The assessment of potential employment allocations considered the following
factors: 
•fundamental constraints on development (such as flood risk);
•their suitability, availability, and deliverability as evidenced by the Strategic Employment
Land Availability Assessment (SELAA 2017);
•the Sustainability Appraisal; and
•the criteria in Policy GD2 Settlement development .
6.1.13 Each allocation is supported by a site specific policy in Part C of this Local Plan and
is shown on the Policies Map. Several sites with the benefit of outline planning consent are
identified as allocations, as should consent lapse for any reason they still need to be relied
upon to meet the land requirement to 2031. These are not included in the Net
Commitments figures in Table B.11 above. In addition further land for employment use may
be allocated in neighbourhood plans and is expected to come forward for development
through the usual development management process to supplement the planned provision
in Policy BE1. 
6.1.14 Some of the sites allocated are new undeveloped sites, whilst others are partially
developed and were allocations in the previously adopted Harborough District Local Plan
2001. The site areas stated in Policy BE1 relate to the land area that remains available for
development. 
6.1.15 The site capacity (in terms of floorspace) of each allocation is based on its most
likely B Class use/s and plot densities as set out in the HEDNA, unless the characteristics
of the site and/or its location suit a higher or lower density. The Council encourages
development proposals that provide a variety of unit sizes ranging from approximately 50 -
500sq.m. to cater for the requirements of both starter businesses and expanding or
relocating companies.

Page 77Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20196.3 BE2 Explanation
6.3.1 The NPPF 2019 requires planning policies to recognise and address specific
locational requirements of different sectors, including provision for storage and distribution
operations at a variety of scales and in suitably accessible locations. Policy BE2 therefore
sets out the amount of additional development that should be provided, directs
development towards sites adjoining Magna Park that best meet the locational
requirements of the sector, and allocates a site in this location which can provide strategic
distribution operations at a variety of scales.
6.3.2 This policy contributes towards meeting the requirement for land to support the
strategic distribution sector, specifically non rail-served provision. It does so without
compromising the overall objective of sustainable development and the protection of the
quality and diversity of the District’s natural and historic environment. 
6.3.3 The need for further strategic distribution facilities was identified in the Leicester and
Leicestershire Strategic Distribution Sector Study (L&L SDSS) 2014, which was updated in
2016. The study considered all existing and planned sites within Leicestershire and the
East Midlands. These were as follows: 
•East Midlands Distribution Centre, Castle Donnington, Leicestershire.
•East Midlands Gateway, Lockington, Leicestershire.
•East Midlands Intermodal Park, Etwall, Derbyshire.
•Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT) Phase 3, Lilbourne,
Northamptonshire.
•South Northants, Milton Malsor, Northamptonshire.
•Corby Eurohub, Corby, Northamptonshire.
•Corby International Rail Freight Terminal, Corby, Northamptonshire.
6.3.4 The sector and industry is global in its nature and economic drivers and cross-
boundary in its effects. The study identified minimum gross land requirements for strategic
B8 development across the HMA, including provision for non rail-served sites of 152
hectares by 2031.
6.3.5 Harborough District has been a focus of strategic distribution since Magna Park was
developed in the early 1990s. Magna Park is a 223 hectare strategic warehousing and
distribution park located to the west of Lutterworth. It is located in an area of land bounded
by the M1, M6, and M69 motorways; known as the 'Golden Triangle' for its logistically
favourable location. 
6.3.6 Magna Park is the largest single employment centre in the District in terms of land
and the number of jobs. It is significant in economic terms at a district and sub-regional
level and as a nationally recognised distribution centre. The site is occupied by blue chip
multi-national companies who operate their national and regional distribution centres from
there. 
Page 78Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20196.3.7 Magna Park is a first generation specialist distribution park, which meets the criteria
for a commercially attractive strategic distribution site and will serve the needs of a modern
logistics and distribution industry throughout the plan period. Policy BE2.1 therefore
maintains and safeguards the existing Magna Park as a leading regional and national
distribution hub by limiting future development to Class B8 uses only with a minimum
floorspace of 9,000 sq.m (this part of the policy will also apply to the committed and
allocated sites once they have been developed). Plots should be re-developed for new
strategic distribution buildings once existing units have become either physically or
functionally obsolete. 
6.3.8 The M1 corridor in Harborough District is a key area of opportunity for Leicester and
Leicestershire as identified in the L&L SDSS Update, 2016 and is of regional and national
significance to the strategic distribution sector. The forecasts of land in the SDSS are
minimum levels of provision and there is a strong case that Harborough should continue to
make a substantial contribution to long term non-rail served strategic warehouse, logistics
and distribution development in Leicester and Leicestershire. There is a need to meet the
further requirements for non rail-served B8 strategic distribution by supporting additional
development at Magna Park to help maintain and expand the established competitive
advantage which Leicester and Leicestershire has in accommodating the sector. 
6.3.9 Additional development of 380,000 sq.m is already committed through two planning
permissions (as shown on the proposals map) in the Magna Park area which can help
deliver this objective (planning application references 15/00919/FUL and 15/00865/OUT).
Policy BE2 therefore allocates land to accommodate an additional 320,000 sq.m of
strategic distribution floorspace on a site North and West of Magna Park meeting the
700,000 sq.m limit when added to these commitments. The limit on the amount of
development to be permitted in the District balances the strategic distribution floorspace
with the capacity of the housing provision. Development above this amount would impact
upon the distribution of housing in the wider area.
6.3.10 This figure is based on the Magna Park Employment Growth Sensitivity Study
2017, as already described in paragraph 5.1.4. This looked at the jobs growth associated
with three floorspace scenarios for strategic distribution (100,000 sq.m., 400,000 sq. m.
and 700,000 sq.m.) and at three levels of 'self-containment' of the workforce (19%
commuting within Harborough District as in the 2011 census, 25% and 35%) . It concluded
that the highest growth scenario, accompanied by a 25% self-containment target, could be
accommodated within the flexibility in housing numbers already being allowed for in the
Local Plan and that there would only be a very small increase in housing requirement in
two other local authorities (Daventry and Oadby and Wigston), both of which are within the
margin of error for the study. 
6.3.11 In combination with other plan policies, including but not limited to the General
Development, Infrastructure, and Climate Change policies, BE2 seeks to minimise and
Page 79Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019mitigate the environmental, community and landscape impacts of strategic distribution
development and improve local economic benefits - by achieving the highest possible
standards of design, environmental sustainability and performance in operation. 
6.3.12 An Environmental Impact Assessment for additional development will be required to
address impacts for the immediate locality and wider surrounding area, the scope of which
is to be agreed with the Council at the outset. Development proposals are likely to have
significant job creation potential and will be expected prepare an Employment and Training
Strategy to demonstrate how the employment and training requirements will be addressed
and supported, in addition to meeting the requirements of Policy IN2 Sustainable
Transport . This will be agreed by the Council and secured via planning obligation.

1.In Key Employment Areas, as identified on the Policies Map, development will only
be permitted where it: 
a.is for business use (Use Classes B1, B2, B8); or
b.is for small-scale uses providing services to support the business use; and
c.would not be detrimental to the quality and attractiveness of the Key Employment
Area. 
2.In General Employment Areas, as identified on the Policies Map, development will
be permitted where it: 
a.is for business use (Use Classes B1, B2, B8) or non-B class economic
development uses subject to Policy RT2; or
b.is for small scale uses providing services to support the business or non-B class
economic development use; and
c.would not prejudice the wider redevelopment or regeneration of the area;
d.would not result in any significant loss in employment;
e.would, where possible, enhance the quality and attractiveness of the General
Employment Area; and
f.would not, alone or cumulatively, result in the General Employment Area ceasing
to be predominantly in B class use. 
3.Development of starter homes on industrial and commercial land that is considered
under-used or unviable for future commercial uses and suitable for housing will be
permitted providing that:
a.any such provision does not prejudice the use of other well-used or viable
employment land or premises; and
b.the development would not result in unsatisfactory residential amenity for future
residents.  
6.5.1 Policy BE3 supports the provision of new jobs in the District to 2031 by guiding the
type of development that will be permitted in existing employment areas. It reflects the
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) by planning to meet the development needs
of business and supporting sustainable economic growth. 6.5 BE3 Explanation
6.5.2 Harborough District contains a wide variety of established employment areas in a
range of locations which provide a diverse stock of commercial buildings in terms of size,
type, quality and condition. These areas play a significant role in the local economy and
provide job opportunities that already help to meet local employment needs. The Leicester
and Leicestershire Housing and Employment Development Needs Assessment (HEDNA),
2017 forecasts the demand for employment land and floorspace over the plan period, but
Page 81Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019does not take account of the quality of existing stock or demand arising from its renewal.
Protecting identified employment areas and encouraging their renewal, where appropriate,
therefore reduces the need for new employment allocations. 
6.5.3 Protecting employment areas that are both suitable and viable for continued
employment use is also important to help prevent the incremental loss of land to other
more valuable or profitable land uses and to support economic growth. It also helps to
promote a sustainable pattern of employment across the District and maintain the vitality of
Rural Centres, particularly where an existing employment area is the last or only one in a
settlement.
6.5.4 The HDC Existing Employment Areas Review (EEAR), 2012 assessed the District's
main existing employment areas against a comprehensive set of criteria and categorised
them as follows:
•Key Employment Areas (KEA) – sites of significance for existing and future business
use;
•General Employment Areas (GEA) – sites generally fit for purpose for business use but
may benefit from upgrade or renewal; and
•Lower Quality Employment Areas – sites that do not warrant retention for business use.
6.5.5 KEAs are therefore protected for continued business use. GEAs remain important
but, in order to continue to be attractive to the market and achieve high levels of
occupancy, may benefit from: 
•physical enhancement;
•improvement through intensification; or
•redevelopment for business or other economic development uses. 
6.5.6 Economic development provides job opportunities, generates wealth or an economic
output or product. The types of non B Class economic development uses that may be
considered appropriate within GEAs under this policy include certain C and D class uses
(e.g. education and training facilities, childcare facilities) and certain sui generis uses that
have characteristics similar to B1, B2 and B8 class uses. Proposals for trade counters,
bulky goods retail, hotel and leisure facilities, together with proposals for Use Class B1a
and other main town centre uses, will be considered on a case by case basis with regard
to the scale and nature of the operation and its potential retail, town centre and transport
impacts, including assessment under Policy RT2 Town and local centres .
6.5.7 Proposals for development within KEAs and GEAs, other than for B class uses, must
be supported by sufficient information to determine their economic implications and
impact. These areas function better if they remain only or predominantly in B class use as
this reinforces commercial investment confidence, facilitates trading between like
businesses and avoids conflicting activities. Policy BE3 provides a framework within which
business investment decisions can be made. 
Page 82Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20196.5.8 Those areas identified as KEA and GEA, as shown on the Policies Map, are listed in
Table B.14 below. They will be subject to periodic review. Once employment allocations
identified in Policy BE1 Provision of new business development are fully developed they
will be deemed to be KEAs.

1.Within the area of Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground as defined on the Policies Map,
development will be permitted where: 
a.the proposed use is for an authorised use, including the proving and testing of
motor vehicles, vehicle storage, the aircraft museum and related tourism activity,
car auctions, and aircraft recycling, maintenance and storage; or
b.it is associated with the operation of the site by vehicles for corporate
entertainment, in accordance with the 2009 unilateral undertaking and under the
terms of the associated Operational Plan.
c.it will conform with the controls set out in the noise limits of the Operational Plan,
and noise monitoring system set out in the Noise Management Plan and the
2009 unilateral undertaking;
d.the design, materials, massing and bulk of new development would have no
unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area;
e.the development would be assimilated into the landscape setting by retaining,
replacing and/or enhancing existing perimeter tree planting;
f.traffic to be generated by the development would not result in an unacceptable
impact on highway safety or severe residual cumulative impacts on the road
network; and
g.highway mitigation is provided where necessary taking into account total traffic to
be generated by existing and proposed development within the Proving Ground
and the Industrial Estate, with all access taken via the main gate to Bath Lane.
2.Within the area of Bruntingthorpe Industrial Estate, as defined on the Policies Map,
development for Class B1b, B1c, B2 and B8 uses only will be permitted if: 
a.the design, materials, massing and bulk of new development would have no
unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area;
b.traffic generated by the development would not result in an unacceptable impact
on highway safety or severe residual cumulative impacts on the road network;
c.it is subject to the approval and implementation of a Travel Plan seeking to
reduce reliance on access by private car and highway mitigation is provided
where necessary, taking into account total traffic to be generated by existing and
proposed development in the Industrial Estate and the Proving Ground and with
all access taken via the main gate to Bath Lane; and
d.any individual unit for Class B8 use does not exceed 500sq.m in gross
floorspace.
6.7.1 The vehicle proving ground use of this former airfield dates back to the early 1970s.
Since then, the 265 hectare site has been used for a variety of other purposes including
open storage (mainly of vehicles), car auctions and an aircraft museum, as well as limited6.7 BE4 Explanation
Page 85Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019flying. There are three large hangar buildings on the site along with other former airfield
structures. An extensive hard standing area sits on the north side of the runway and is
used for the storage of new vehicles awaiting sale. Adjacent to the site to the south east is
Bruntingthorpe Industrial Estate, an industrial area providing space for a range of small to
medium-sized businesses in a variety of new and old, former military, buildings. It presents
a generally untidy and unattractive appearance especially when viewed from Mere Road. 
6.7.2 The proving ground site is located in a rural area to the north east of Lutterworth so
is quite remote from any substantial settlement. The main entrance is at Bath Lane. From
here commercial traffic serving the site, including vehicle transporters and heavy goods
vehicles, is routed eastwards to the A5199. A well established tree planted belt surrounds
nearly the whole site, providing a good ground level screen from bordering rural lanes,
nearby villages and isolated farmsteads. There is poor access to facilities and sustainable
modes of transport.
6.7.3 This is a large site which is capable of being used for a variety of purposes.
However, because of its rural location and limited accessibility, the range of uses needs to
be closely controlled. The site and its operation for corporate entertainment is subject to a
2009 unilateral undertaking between the Council and the owner. Permitted event activity
involves: the demonstration and testing of motor vehicles (including emergency service
vehicles or equipment) and related driver instruction, hospitality, vehicle maintenance and
repair, cycling and Go-karting in accordance with the Unilateral Undertaking. 
6.7.4 Restricting the range of permitted uses will help avoid both disturbance to nearby
residents and any wider impacts on the rural character of the area. Also, there is a risk that
uses that are dependent on road access here could lead to inappropriate types and
volumes of traffic. This could pose a serious risk to highway safety, given the limitations on
carriageway width and alignment. It would also reinforce unsustainable travel patterns. Any
additional development at either the Proving Ground or the Industrial Estate will be
required to use the main gate to Bath Lane for access, with a Travel Plan required to
support additional proposals at the Industrial Estate to minimise additional private vehicle
trips. Highway mitigation for the surrounding road network will be required where
necessary and in consultation with the County Highway Authority.
6.7.5 The policy recognises the scope of the Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground site to
accommodate specialist uses whilst managing the impact on the rural area. It also
recognises the opportunity to comprehensively redevelop Bruntingthorpe Industrial Estate
to improve premises and provide wider transport and environmental benefits. 
6.7.6 Policy BE4 relates specifically to Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground and Industrial
Estate and provides an exception to Policy GD3 Development in the countryside , but
should be read in conjunction with other general development policies in Chapter 4 of this
plan.

1.Within the area of Leicester Airport, as defined on the Policies Map, development
will be permitted where:
a.it is required for the operational use of the airfield, including improvements to the
existing control tower and runway;
b.it is for aviation uses or is ancillary to an existing aviation use; or
c.it involves the conversion or re-use of an existing permanent building on site.
2.Within the complex to the North of Gartree Road, as defined on the Policies Map,
additional development or the re-use of existing buildings for Class B1b, B1c, B2 or
B8 will be permitted where: 
a.the proposed use does not conflict with safety requirements of existing uses at
the airfield;
b.it is necessary for the continuation of an existing enterprise, facility or operation
compatible with the operational use of the airfield;
c.the design, materials, and massing of new development would not have an
unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area;
d.traffic generated by the development is capable of being accommodated on the
highway network and will not have a significant adverse impact on the amenity of
local residents;
e.a Travel Plan is approved and implemented to increase access to the site by
modes other than the private car; and
f.any individual unit for Class B8 use does not exceed 500sq.m in gross
floorspace.
6.9.1 This is the site of a former Second World War airfield situated on the eastern edge of
Leicester and just to the south of the small village of Stoughton. Now known as Leicester
Airport, it is used for the flying of light aircraft and helicopters and is home to the
Leicestershire Aero Club. There is also a small commercial area, a karting circuit and paint
ball centre. However the bulk of the airfield site that is not used for runway and apron
purposes is farmed. Although part of the former runway is disused there are no extensive
areas of open commercial storage. Although the site is close to the urban area of Leicester
it is served only by local roads with its entrance off Gartree Road, and has poor access to
sustainable modes of transport.6.9 BE5 Explanation
6.9.2 Although the site is not remote from facilities and potential employees, it is situated in
the countryside with relatively poor rural road access. Despite being modest in scale, there
is the risk that its near-urban location could be attractive to numerous business ventures
creating road traffic and disturbance that would harm the character of the immediately
Page 88Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019surrounding area. Clearly the airfield serves a need for light aircraft flights and there is
potential for commercial uses with aviation links. These should be limited in scale and type
of activity to avoid inappropriate adverse impacts.

RT1 Provision of new retail uses
1.During the plan period additional retail provision will be made for a minimum of
4,300 sq.m (gross) of convenience floorspace and a minimum of 10,100 sq.m
(gross) of comparison floorspace.
2.Retail or mixed use developments contributing to the delivery of the following
settlement-specific retail floorspace targets to 2031 will be permitted provided they
are in accordance with Policy RT2:
a.Market Harborough: 3,100 sq.m (gross) convenience and 8,000 sq.m (gross)
comparison;
b.Lutterworth: 1,000 sq.m (gross) convenience and 1,500 sq.m (gross)
comparison; and
c.Broughton Astley: 200 sq.m (gross) convenience and 200 sq.m (gross)
comparison. 
3.Market Harborough Allocations
a.The Commons Car Park and adjoining retail unit as shown on the Policies Map is
allocated for retail and town centre uses. Development will be permitted where it:
i.delivers a mixed use development including a net increase in retail floorspace
of at least 1,500 sq.m (gross);
ii.delivers a sensitively designed comprehensive scheme which conserves and
enhances the Conservation Area and complements the character of the town
centre in terms of scale, height, mass, design, materials and layout;
iii.provides safe, attractive pedestrian linkages within the site and to the wider
town centre;
iv.results in no net loss of public car parking spaces either on site or through
additional equivalent provision elsewhere; and
v.is sensitive to the River Welland and its role as a wildlife corridor.
b.Land off High Street as shown on the Policies Map is allocated for retail and town
centre uses. Development will be permitted where it:
i.delivers a mixed use development including a net increase in retail floorspace
of at least 2,000 sq.m (gross);
ii.delivers a sensitively designed comprehensive scheme which conserves and
enhances the Conservation Area and complements the character of the town
centre in terms of scale, height, mass, design, materials and layout, including
a significant improvement to the appearance of the frontage onto High Street;
and
iii.ensures any development to the rear of frontage properties has suitable,
prominent, safe and attractive pedestrian access from High Street.
Page 90Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20194.East of Lutterworth SDA Allocation  
a.Of the target in 2.b. above, about 1,000 sq.m (gross) of convenience floorspace
and about 500 sq.m (gross) of comparison floorspace shall be provided as a
neighbourhood centre within the East of Lutterworth SDA in accordance with
Policy L1 to meet the needs of the expanding community. 
7.1.1 Policy RT1 supports retail growth in the District by setting out the appropriate retail
floorspace provision figures over the plan period and by allocating sites in appropriate
locations to contribute to meeting identified need. 7.1 RT1 Explanation
7.1.2 When planning for growth in their town centres, local planning authorities are
encouraged to allocate suitable sites to meet the scale and type of retail development
likely to be needed, looking at least 10 years ahead (NPPF, paragraph 85). It is important
that the needs for retail and other main town centre uses are met in full and not
compromised by limited site availability. 
7.1.3 The Harborough Retail Study Update, 2017 provides an update of the District wide
needs assessment for retail floorspace in Harborough which was first carried out in 2013
through the Harborough Retail Study. The Update is based on population projections
assuming the 12,800 housing provision over the plan period. The findings for convenience
(mainly food) and comparison (non-food) goods retail floorspace are set out in Table B.18  
and Table B.19  respectively below.

7.1.4 The Retail Study Update, 2017 stresses that long term floorspace capacity forecasts
beyond 2026 are susceptible to change due to unforeseen circumstances including
changes in population growth, growth in expenditure per capita and growth in turnover
efficiencies. Small variations in recommended growth rates can lead to large variations in
floorspace capacity where projected over a long period. Therefore the Retail Update, 2017
recommends that long term projections (beyond 2026) should be treated with caution. In
view of this advice, the Council will keep projections for the period 2026-31 under review. 
7.1.5 Whilst the re-use of vacant shop units will absorb an element of the identified retail
floorspace need, the Harborough Retail Study, 2013 identified a number of sites in Market
Harborough and Lutterworth with potential to accommodate additional floorspace
requirements. Subsequently, the Local Plan Options Consultation, 2015 put forward four
sites in Market Harborough and one site in Lutterworth for allocation. 
7.1.6 Springfield Retail Car Park in Market Harborough has been discounted as an option
as the location of the site is outside the primary shopping area and could dilute the
shopping offer of the town centre and encourage car-based shopping. The redevelopment
could also involve a car park deck which would have an adverse impact on the Grade II
listed Settling Rooms at the centre of the site. 
7.1.7 The Commons Car Park site in Market Harborough is included as an allocation for
mixed use retail development. The site lies partially within the town's primary shopping
area and within the town centre boundary. It is ideally located to contribute to future retail
need. However, any development scheme would need to be sensitive to its location within
the town's Conservation Area and riverside frontage and should be guided by a
development brief. The allocation includes existing retail floorspace (Tesco) along with the
Council owned Commons Car Park. Current frontage onto The Square (Tesco building) is
poorly designed. A comprehensive redevelopment of the allocated site provides the
opportunity to enhance the Conservation Area. Development proposals would need to
ensure that there would be no net loss of car parking in the town centre. 
Page 92Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20197.1.8 The second allocation (Land off High Street) is a site which also has the potential to
enhance the Conservation Area. High Street forms the backbone of the town's
Conservation Area and the frontages included in the allocation currently detract from the
rhythm and cohesiveness of the streetscape. The redevelopment of these properties offers
the opportunity to open up land to the rear which would be well related to the primary
shopping area and support its vitality. Any development scheme would need to be
sensitive to its location within the town's Conservation Area and should be guided by a
development brief. Given that this site is likely to be more complicated to deliver, being in
multiple ownership, it is envisaged that this site would come forward later in the plan
period. 
7.1.9 Both allocations are ideally located to support Market Harborough's retail floorspace
needs and maintain vitality and viability over the coming decade. Development briefs will
be prepared, in conjunction with the owners/ developers, to bring these sites forward.
There will also be additional convenience retail floorspace provision as part of the
committed schemes forming the North West Market Harborough Strategic Development
Area. The precise scale of this provision is as yet unknown but will be delivered in two
local centres that will serve the proposed development to the north west of the town. 
7.1.10 With regard to Lutterworth, the Strategic Development Area to the east of the M1
will be required to provide a local centre with retail provision of up to 1,000 sq.m of
convenience floorspace and up to 500 sq.m of comparison floorspace. This will help to
reduce the number of car trips and improve sustainability. Whilst no sites have been
allocated in the town centre, it is expected that vacant units will absorb some of the
identified need. Proposals for new retail floorspace will be assessed in accordance with
Policy RT2 Town and local centres . 
7.1.11 As recommended by the Retail Study Update, 2017, longer term retail needs
(beyond 2026) for both Market Harborough and Lutterworth Town Centres will be
monitored through regular floorspace requirement updates that take into account any
changing assumptions.

Page 94Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019RT2 Town and local centres
1.The vitality and viability of the following retail hierarchy of city, town, district and
local centres will be maintained and enhanced:
Town centres: Market Harborough, Lutterworth;
District centre: Broughton Astley;
Local centres: Fleckney, Great Glen, Kibworth Beauchamp. 
Town centres and primary shopping area
2.Within the town centres of Market Harborough and Lutterworth, as defined on the
Policies Map, development proposals for main town centre uses and residential
uses will be permitted providing their scale and design reflects the role, function,
distinctive qualities and historic/architectural heritage of the town centre.
Development that would harm the vitality and viability of either town centre will not
be permitted.
3.Market Harborough primary shopping area, as defined on the Policies Map, will be
the focus for retail uses. Development which helps maintain the existing retail
function of the area, and does not lead to a concentration of non-retail uses which
would undermine the vitality and viability of the area's primarily retail role, will be
permitted.
4.Sequential test
Development, including extensions to existing facilities, for main town centre uses
should be located in the defined Town Centres, then in edge of centre locations and
only outside defined town centres if a sequential test shows that the development,
having demonstrated appropriate flexibility in form and scale, cannot be
accommodated within a suitable and available centre or edge of centre location.
5.Impact assessment
Development of main town centre uses outside the defined town centres, or of retail
uses within Market Harborough town centre but outside the primary shopping area,
will only be permitted if an impact assessment demonstrates that the proposal
would not have a significant adverse impact on the vitality and/or viability of existing
centres. An impact assessment will be required for development of, or in excess of:
a. 1,500 square metres gross in Market Harborough; and

6.Local centres
Within the local centres of Fleckney, Great Glen and Kibworth Beauchamp, as
defined on the Policies Map, proposals for shopping and business uses, including
mixed development with residential accommodation, will be permitted provided
development proposals do not detract from the character of the area in terms of
design, mass, material, height or location and the amenity of neighbouring residents
is not adversely affected. Proposals outside the defined local centre will need to
apply the sequential test and carry out an impact assessment in accordance with
the threshold set out above. 
Page 95Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20197.3 RT2 Explanation
7.3.1 Town and village centres are at the heart of local communities and are valued as
places in which to meet, eat, shop, relax and work. Policy RT2 is concerned with
supporting the retail hierarchy and promoting the continued vitality and viability of the
District's town and local centres, with particular emphasis on Market Harborough and
Lutterworth, both of which are market towns with Conservation Areas covering their
centres. 
7.3.2 The way in which town centres are used is continually evolving and the National
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) emphasises that local plans should plan positively for
the growth, management and adaptation of town centres to support the role they play at
the heart of local communities. It also makes clear that the Local Plan should define a
network and hierarchy of centres and promote their long-term vitality and viability. Table
B.21, below, sets out the hierarchy of retail centres in Harborough District and shows some
centres outside the District boundary which potentially have a functional relationship with
the District.

City centre The highest level of centre identified
in development plans. In terms of
hierarchies, it will often be a regional
centre and will serve a large
catchment. The centre may be very
large embracing a wide range of
activities and may be distinguished by
areas which may perform different
main functions.Leicester, Northampton.
Town
centresUsually the second level of centres
after city centres, in many cases they
will be the principal centre in a Local
Authority's area. In rural areas they
are likely to be market towns and
other centres of similar size and role
which function as important service
centres, providing a range of facilities
and services for extensive rural
catchment areas. In planning for the
future of town centres, local planning
authorities should consider the
function of different parts of the centre
and how these contribute to its overall
vitality and viability.Market

7.3.3 The NPPF emphasises that local plan policies should allow for growth and
diversification in response to rapid changes in the retail and leisure industries, promote a
suitable mix of uses (including housing) and promote the individuality and distinctive
characters of town centres. It sets out two key tests that should be applied when
considering proposals for main town centre uses which are not in an existing town centre
and which are not in accord with an up to date local plan, namely the sequential test and
the impact assessment. Both are designed to ensure that development does not
undermine the health of existing town centres. 
7.3.4 Policy RT2 allows both a sequential test and an impact assessment to be applied
taking into account local criteria and thresholds. The sequential test is considered first as it
may identify more preferable sites in the town centre, referred to as a 'town centre first'
approach. If no such sites are found, then the development is subject to the impact test to
determine the likely adverse impacts of locating the development outside the town centre.
Main town centre uses are defined in the NPPF and comprise retail, office, leisure,
entertainment, arts, culture, and tourism development. 
7.3.5 Market Harborough is the largest and most vibrant shopping centre in the District,
benefiting from an historic, attractive environment. Given its size and role in the retail
hierarchy, and in order to ensure that retail development and other town centre uses are
directed to the most appropriate locations, both a town centre boundary and a primary
shopping area are defined in line with the findings of the Harborough Retail Study, 2013. 
7.3.6 The policy approach aims to guide most retail development to the primary shopping
area, in order to support the existing retail function of the area, maintain the vitality and
Page 97Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019viability of the centre as a whole, keep its shopping offer within easy walking distance and
avoid it being diluted by too many non-retail uses. It also ensures that other main town
centre uses, such as leisure, hotels and offices, and secondary shopping take place within
the wider town centre boundary where a greater variety of uses co-exist, or as a last resort
in an edge of centre location. Edge of centre is defined by the NPPF as locations within
300 metres of the town centre boundary, or for retail development in Market Harborough
within 300 metres of the Primary Shopping Area boundary. 
7.3.7 Lutterworth's town centre is much smaller than Market Harborough's with a more
limited choice of comparison shops, with residents looking primarily to nearby Leicester
and Rugby for higher order stores. Whilst the town centre is a Conservation Area, the
shopping environment is impacted by heavy through-traffic. The town centre boundary has
been identified for Lutterworth as the preferred location for retail and other town centre
uses. 
7.3.8 Policy RT2 sets local floorspace thresholds for the preparation of Impact
Assessments. These thresholds follow the recommendations set out in the Harborough
Retail Study Update, 2017 and reflect the fact that the NPPF default threshold of 2,500
square metres represents a significant proportion of the overall projected retail needs for
the District. Developments of less than 2,500 square metres could have a significant
adverse impact on centres within Harborough. The thresholds represent a more
reasonable and locally specific approach which reflects the scale of identified need and the
modest size of town and local centres across the District. 
7.3.9 In promoting thriving town centres, it is essential that both the historic and
architectural context is taken into account in the design of development. Both Market
Harborough and Lutterworth Town Centres have Conservation Area status and the historic
environment provides an irreplaceable and distinctive backdrop to the activities that take
place. The policy ensures that new development respects its setting in scale and design. 
7.3.10 Broughton Astley, identified as a district centre in the retail hierarchy, has a
Neighbourhood Plan that was 'made' in 2014. This sets out retail policy for the village,
including a defined Shopping and Business Area and an allocation for additional retail
provision beyond the centre to improve the village's sustainability. Therefore Policy RT2
does not refer to Broughton Astley. 
7.3.11 So far as the local centres are concerned, Fleckney, Great Glen and both Kibworth
parish councils are all leading on the preparation of neighbourhood plans which are likely
to set out policies for their local centres. However, Policy RT2 sets out the policy approach
and defines Local Centre boundaries for these settlements to guide those emerging
neighbourhood plans. The policy also recognises that these centres have an important role
to play in supporting and servicing local communities to the benefit of the sustainability of
these settlements.

Page 99Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019RT3 Shop fronts and advertisements
1.New shop fronts will be permitted where they relate well in scale, proportion,
material and decorative treatment to the façade of the building and its neighbours.
In Conservation Areas changes to shop fronts will only be permitted where they
contribute to the conservation and enhancement of the area's character or
appearance.
2.Advertisement designs should respect the character and architectural details of the
buildings on which they are proposed and their surroundings, in terms of scale,
siting, materials, colour and lettering and method and intensity of illumination.
3.New shop fronts should, where possible, improve accessibility and make provision
for the needs of specific groups in the community such as the elderly and those with
disabilities.
7.5.1 The Council is committed to maintaining and improving the District’s shopping streets
and centres. It recognises that shop fronts play a key role in creating attractive and vibrant
areas which people want to live in and visit. Well designed shop fronts and adverts can
benefit areas in a variety of ways including adding visual interest to the street scene,
attracting customers and improving the townscape. However, when poorly designed or
positioned, they can be harmful and result in visual clutter, obstructions and even hazards. 7.5 RT3 Explanation
7.5.2 Securing high quality design and a good standard of amenity is one of the underlying
principles of the NPPF. It recognises that poorly placed advertisements can have a
negative impact on the quality and character of places. 
7.5.3 Whilst the principal function of any shop front and associated signage is to advertise
and display the goods and services provided within the building, the secondary, less
obvious, role is to influence or improve the overall appearance and attractiveness of the
street scene, public realm and accessibility to the community. Policy RT3 has been
included to ensure that this secondary role is appreciated and taken into account in the
design of shop fronts and advertisements which are sympathetic to their immediate and
wider surroundings. 
7.5.4 Both of the District's town centres, and many of the village centres, have
Conservation Area status and contain numerous listed buildings and other buildings of
local interest. In such areas it is essential that shop fronts are sensitively designed to
complement architectural details and historic features. In order to achieve this, internally
illuminated signs and advertisements will be resisted in the Conservation Areas of Market
Harborough, Lutterworth, and Kibworth Beauchamp, or in any other Conservation Area.

Page 101Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019RT4 Tourism and leisure
1.The potential of tourism in the District will be maximised and tourism and leisure
opportunities for visitors and residents will be increased by: 
a.supporting the retention, enhancement and expansion of existing tourism and
leisure attractions and tourist accommodation;
b.permitting development of tourism and leisure attractions and tourist
accommodation that are well connected to other leisure destinations and
amenities, particularly by public transport, walking and cycling;
c.encouraging enhancement of the environment and local distinctiveness,
including heritage and landscapes, which will increase the attractiveness of the
District to visitors and increase tourism. 
2.New tourist accommodation, attractions and other tourism-related development will
be directed to Market Harborough town centre, Key Centres and Rural Centres in
accordance with the settlement hierarchy, except where: 
a.an initiative requires a countryside location or setting or it is directly related to a
specific tourist destination and, where possible, it re-uses previously developed
land and existing buildings; or
b.it involves the diversification of agricultural uses or otherwise benefits rural
businesses and communities; and
c.its scale and appearance respects the character of the countryside, the local
landscape and the surrounding environment; and
d.it does not adversely affect the local transport infrastructure. 
3.Land off St Mary's Road as shown on the Policies Map is allocated for leisure,
entertainment and tourism uses. Development will be permitted where it:
a.delivers a mixed use scheme of at least 3,000sq.m (gross) including some or all
of the following uses: A3-A5 food and beverage, C1 hotel, D2 assembly and
leisure; and
b.delivers a sensitively designed comprehensive scheme which protects the Listed
Buildings at 91-93 St. Mary's Road and their setting.
4.The Council will support the promotion and management of Foxton Locks and the
Grand Union Canal in line with the ambition for the area to be a regional tourist
attraction. 
7.7.1 As a district which benefits from a number of tourist attractions, the tourist industry
forms an important part of the local economy and can support the provision of local
services and facilities.7.7 RT4 Explanation
7.7.2 The value of tourism in Harborough has been increasing steadily since 2009. The
economic impact of tourism has increased by 27% between 2009 and 2015 whilst visitor
Page 102Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019numbers have remained roughly the same (rising by 0.76%). This would indicate that
those visitors in 2015 were contributing more to the economy with a higher spend per visit
than those in 2009. 
7.7.3 This increased value per visit appears to be attributed to a growing staying visitor
trend and the associated additional spend related to this (cost of hotels, evening meals
and spend over at least two days instead of one). Between 2009 and 2015 the amount of
staying visitors has increased by 9.1% whilst day visitors have gone down by 0.1%. 
7.7.4 The East Leicestershire Tourism Accommodation Study, January 2015, identified that
two thirds of east Leicestershire's tourist accommodation is located within Harborough
District. The Tourism Accommodation Study identified strong demand for all forms of tourist
accommodation to support increasing trends in domestic short breaks, a growth in leisure
trips linked to visiting friends and relatives, trends for family get together breaks away, and
a growing market for high quality distinctive contemporary accommodation. Harborough’s
central location in the country means it is well placed to capitalise on the growth of
accommodation needs and increase tourism. The study highlights the following benefits of
tourism for Harborough:
•Providing opportunities to boost the incomes of farming and rural land-based
businesses;
•Generating income for rural shops, pubs, restaurants, and food producers;
•Creating new jobs, both directly and indirectly as customer and accommodation
business spending permeates through the local economy. 
7.7.5 A further benefit would be to support the vitality and viability of town centres, in
particular the night-time economy of Market Harborough whose historic town centre, with
its collection of attractive independent shops and its restaurants and bars, is an attraction
in its own right. 
7.7.6 The Local Plan Options Consultation, 2015, included a potential development area
for retail/town centre uses north of St. Mary's Road, Market Harborough. The review of
commercial and leisure uses undertaken by the Retail Study Update, 2017, identified a
need for food and beverage uses, as set out in Table B.24  below, and other commercial
leisure facilities (including a small cinema and health and fitness facilities).

7.7.7 Developing the St Mary's Road site for retail would extend shopping provision
outside the Primary Shopping Area and dilute the retail offer of the town centre. However
the site has the potential to increase the commercial leisure and tourism offer within the
town, in particular to provide a new hotel, a health and fitness centre and associated public
house, bar or restaurant facilities. An element of residential and office development would
be acceptable on the site providing it is small scale and complementary to the allocated
uses (leisure, entertainment and tourism) and secures the viability of the overall
redevelopment scheme. The site is in a single ownership. It is occupied by various
industrial and sui generis uses which would need to be relocated. These include the
Market Harborough Brewery which could be relocated within the development as part of
the tourism offer. It also includes two Listed Buildings (91-93 St. Mary's Road) and any
development would need to retain these and be sensitively designed to avoid any impact
on their setting. 
7.7.8 The Council will continue to work with other organisations to best promote tourism
that is on offer in the District. Additional development which can help develop links to other
sectors including food and drink, outdoor pursuits and the arts and cultural sector will also
be supported. The Council will also work in partnership with key stakeholders to maximise
growth in tourism for Harborough District.
7.7.9 The Council’s Economic Development Strategy, Harnessing Harborough District
2018/2023 (2018), identifies tourism as a key sector for the District which is growing year
on year, contributing over £125m into the local economy every year and providing 1,717
Full Time Equivalent jobs in the area. The Council believes there is significant opportunity
to increase tourism and the value of tourism to the District and will be working with
partners to achieve this over the lifetime of the strategy.
7.7.10 Foxton Locks provides an asset both to the local community and also the wider
population beyond the District. Foxton Locks includes nationally important designated
heritage assets and collectively the locks and the inclined plane form the focus of a 30
acre country park with an estimated 300,000 visitors annually. As an established local and
regional visitor attraction, the Locks have the potential to contribute significantly to the
local economy of the Harborough District.
Page 104Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20197.7.11 The Canal and River Trust, as owner and operator of Foxton Locks, is working to
identify how best to manage the area as a regional tourist destination in the future. Foxton
Locks is identified as one of four projects in the Leicester and Leicestershire Canal and
Rivers Investment Programme, part of the Leicester & Leicestershire Economic
Partnership's Strategic Economic Plan (2014-2020). Appropriate sensitive, sustainable
development to enhance future visitor experience of Foxton Locks will be supported by the
Council, providing that this maintains and enhances the heritage asset in accordance with
Policy HC1.

1.Development affecting heritage assets and their settings will:
a.be appraised in accordance with national policy; and
b.be permitted where it protects, conserves or enhances the significance,
character, appearance and setting of the asset, including where possible better
revealing the significance of the asset and enabling its interpretation. 
2.Where the proposed development would lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of
significance of) a designated heritage asset and/or its setting, planning permission
will not be granted unless:
a.The proposed development demonstrates that the substantial harm or total loss
is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or
loss; or
b.The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and
c.No viable use of the heritage asset can be found in the medium term through
appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and
d.Conservation by grant-funding or some form of charitable or public ownership is
demonstrably not possible; and
e.The harm or loss is outweighed by the public benefits of bringing the site back
into use.
Where the proposed development would lead to less than substantial harm to the
significance of a designated heritage asset and/or its setting, this harm will be weighed
against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its
optimum viable use. 
3. Development within or affecting a Conservation Area will be permitted where it
preserves or enhances the character or appearance of the Conservation Area,
including local design and materials.
4. Development affecting the significance of a non-designated heritage asset and/or
its setting will have regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the
non-designated heritage asset.
5. Development which enhances the local and regional role of Foxton Locks and the
former inclined plane as a tourism and recreational facility and which maintains and
enhances the value, importance and integrity of these heritage assets will be
permitted.
Page 106Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20198.1 HC1 Explanation
8.1.1 The character, quality and diversity of the District's extensive historic environment will
be taken fully into account with a view to its conservation and enhancement in the context
of the sustainable development of the District.
8.1.2 Heritage assets are parts of the environment that are valued for their architectural,
historic, archaeological and artistic interest. The District has a significant number of
heritage assets, both designated and non-designated, which are a key part of its character.
They comprise both designated assets (such as Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings,
Scheduled Monuments and Registered Parks and Gardens) and non-designated assets
(including, for example, archaeological sites). 
8.1.3 The setting of a designated heritage asset often makes an important contribution to
its character. Proposals for development should be carefully assessed to ensure that
important features and vistas that make a positive contribution to the significance of the
asset are preserved. Lists of heritage assets and links to them can be found at Appendix H
Heritage assets list . 
8.1.4 The survival of most historic buildings depends upon their continued, viable use and
this may, among other things, require alterations to improve access. All proposals will be
expected to describe the significance of the asset, identify the impact of works on the
special character of the asset and provide a clear justification for the work, including,
where relevant, identification of public benefits. To enable planning decisions to be based
on a full understanding of the significance of the heritage asset, the Council will expect the
following assessment to have been carried out:Promoting sustainable uses
•an analysis of the asset to establish its significance both as a whole and specific parts
affected by the proposal;
•an assessment, where appropriate, of the contribution made by the setting of the asset
to its significance; and
•explanation of how the assessment has informed the proposed development, including
how the proposed detailed design, scale, layout, materials and architectural or historical
features would be appropriate and sympathetic.
8.1.5 The harm to, or loss of part or the whole of, a heritage asset will need to be justified.
Where the proposal would result in harm or loss of a heritage asset, the Council will
require evidence that there are considerable public benefits to justify its loss or that there
are no other mechanisms for supporting the retention of the asset. Any mitigation
measures proposed are not considered to be public benefits. 
Page 107Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20198.1.6 Where planning permission is granted, appropriate conditions may be applied and/or
planning obligations may be secured to ensure that heritage assets are appropriately
conserved and, where possible, enhanced. This may include provision for the recording of
assets prior to commencement of any work.
Listing Assets
8.1.7 The Council will continue to work with Neighbourhood Plan Groups, the local
community and interest groups to identify and, where appropriate, support proposals for
local listing of buildings, where it can be demonstrated that the buildings meet the criteria
for such listing.
8.1.8 There are currently 62 Conservation Areas within the District which will be kept under
review. The Council is committed to improving the management of the Conservation Areas
in the District through the preparation of Conservation Area appraisals and management
plans, its development management procedures and the use of Article 4 Directions, as
appropriate and resources permit. Conservation Areas
8.1.9 In conjunction with partner organisations, the Council will:
•undertake reviews of existing Conservation Area Statements and develop these into
management plans;
•prioritise for review any Conservation Area Statements and associated management
plans relating to settlements where proposals are anticipated and the settlement is
considered to be sensitive to development; and
•appraise opportunities to designate new Conservation Areas and support local listing or
statutory listing of appropriate buildings.
8.1.10 Assets at risk are those at risk of being lost as a result of neglect, decay or
inappropriate development. Where heritage assets are found to be ‘at risk’, i.e. they are on
Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register or on a local register covering Grade II and
locally listed heritage assets, or where they are in danger of falling into this category, the
Council may support the development of creative and sustainable measures to secure the
future of such assets, in a manner appropriate to their significance. The Council may give
particular weight to proposals which promote public and economic benefits such as
tourism or enhanced public access. Assets at Risk
8.1.11 Alternative use of a heritage asset may be considered where this would retain the
viability of the asset, providing it would not result in the loss of its significance. Should the
harm or loss be agreed, the Council will require a clear indication that the development will
be implemented and that the loss of the asset was justified. Where the loss of a heritage
asset is agreed, the Council will need to be satisfied that there are approved and detailed
plans and delivery mechanisms in place for the implementation of the approved proposal.
Page 108Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20198.1.12 In the context of the historic environment, enabling development is development
that would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms if it were not for the fact that it
would bring heritage benefits sufficient to justify it being carried out and which could not
otherwise be achieved. A typical example would be the construction of houses where
planning policy would normally prohibit, but where the profits from that development would
fund essential repairs to the particular heritage asset. Such proposals will only be
considered acceptable subject to:
•them not resulting in harm to the heritage asset or its setting;
•them ensuring unified management of the place;
•securing the long-term future of the place and, where applicable, its continued use for a
purpose sympathetic to its context and history;
•no other suitable funding being available; and
•clear demonstration that the amount of enabling development is the minimum
necessary to secure the future of the place, and that its form minimises harm to other
public interests.
8.1.13 The heritage benefits of any proposed enabling development should demonstrably
outweigh the dis-benefits of departing from either the development plan or national
planning policy. Moreover, in accordance with national planning policy, where there is
evidence of deliberate neglect of, or damage to, a heritage asset, the deteriorated state of
the asset would not be taken into account in any planning decision, nor any purchase price
paid or the circumstances of the owner. Such enabling development permitted will be
secured through suitable planning conditions and planning obligations through section 106
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended. 
Foxton Locks
8.1.14 The policy sets out the Council’s support for appropriate development of heritage
assets for sustainable alternative uses, including for tourism and recreation. Foxton Locks
is a nationally significant heritage asset within the District. It includes the Grade II* flight of
locks and other listed buildings associated with the Grand Union Canal and the Inclined
Plane Scheduled Monument. The canal is also a Conservation Area. The Council has
worked with the Canal and River Trust and its partners to deliver the first phase of
improvements to the area. Further development must be suitably located and of an
appropriate scale and design to ensure the protection of Foxton Locks as a nationally
significant heritage asset.

importance of community facilities and the need to sustain existing facilities and place new
facilities at the heart of new development.8.3 HC2 Explanation
8.3.2 Community facilities (for example, places of worship, town and village halls,
community centres, indoor sports facilities, schools, doctors' surgeries and libraries) play
an important role at the heart of communities, providing hubs for recreation, congregation
and interaction through which social networks can be maintained, while minimising the
need to travel.
8.3.3 Existing community facilities require protection from change of use or
redevelopment. In addition to protection through this policy, communities have powers
through the Community Right to Bid to protect assets that are important to them. 
8.3.4 Existing community facilities may also require upgrading over time as the needs of
the community change. The flexible use of existing and proposed facilities is supported,
including proposals for use by religious communities. This is important to ensure the long
term sustainability of the facilities.

1.Development involving the loss of an existing public house, post office or village
shop selling primarily convenience goods will be permitted where: 
a.reasonable efforts have been made to preserve the facility (including exploring
diversification options) but it would not be economically viable to retain the
building or site for its existing use; and
b.the public house, post office or village shop has been proactively marketed at a
reasonable price for a minimum of 12 months for its current use, free of tie and
restrictive covenant and there has been no definite interest in either the freehold
or leasehold.
2.Development at public houses will be permitted in order to assist in their
diversification, including:
a.extensions and alterations to provide kitchen and restaurant facilities;
b.improvements to the external environment, including children's facilities;
c.conversions or extensions to provide bed & breakfast or other guest
accommodation;
d.a micro-brewery or similar enterprise related to the public house use;
e.alterations to enable take-away food and off-licence services; and
f.use of part of the premises for a local shop, post office, library, or other
community function unrelated to the public house use.
3.Development at village shops and post offices will be permitted in order to assist in
their diversification where this would help to sustain the future of the facility.
4.Development of new public houses, post offices and shops will be permitted where
they are within easy and safe walking distance of the majority of the community
they will serve.
8.5.1 Public houses, post offices and village shops selling primarily convenience goods are
all identified as key services, in recognition of the valuable contribution they make to
meeting the day-to-day needs of local communities and therefore supporting their
sustainable growth. 8.5 HC3 Explanation
8.5.2 The Council supports the retention of public houses, post offices and village shops
and will not approve proposals involving their loss other than in the circumstances set out
in the policy criteria. Applications for change of use or redevelopment will therefore be
resisted unless evidence to the satisfaction of the Council is provided to show that the
premises have been marketed at a reasonable price for a minimum of 12 months. The
marketing strategy, along with the price at which the property will be marketed, should be
agreed with the Council prior to commencement of the marketing exercise. In relation to
public houses, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Public House Viability Test, 2015
provides a useful tool to assess the viability of the business.
Page 113Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20198.5.3 Business diversification is an important consideration when considering the viability

GI1 Green infrastructure networks
1.Development which supports the potential of the following strategic green
infrastructure assets to contribute to the wider green infrastructure network will be
permitted:
a.Welland, Sence, Soar, Swift and Avon river corridors;
b.Grand Union Canal;
c.dismantled railway lines;
d.Saddington, Stanford and Eyebrook reservoirs; and
e.traffic free cycle routes, and long-distance recreational paths and bridleways.
2.The green infrastructure assets listed above will be safeguarded and, where
possible, enhanced by ensuring that:
a.development does not compromise their integrity or value;
b.development contributes wherever appropriate to improvements in their quality,
use and multi-functionality; and
c.opportunities to add to or improve their contribution to the green infrastructure
network are maximised through partnership working.
9.1.1 Green Infrastructure (GI) as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework
(NPPF) is a network of multi-functional green space, urban and rural, which is capable of
delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities.
Green infrastructure promotes recreation, tourism, biodiversity, geodiversity and water
management. Promoting new green space and protecting existing green assets also helps
mitigate against climate change. 9.1 GI1 Explanation
9.1.2 Policy GI1 recognises that there are certain assets within Harborough District which
are strategic in their importance and potential impact. The policy will be implemented by
the Council, public sector partners (neighbouring local authorities, and environmental
protection groups) and private sector developers delivering development. Where
appropriate, developer contributions will be sought to secure links or improvements to
green infrastructure assets. The partner organisations are, amongst others:
•Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust,
•Canal and River Trust,
•Welland Rivers Trust and Welland Valley Partnership,
•Woodland Trust,
•Leicestershire and Leicester Access Forum,
•County and district local authorities.
Page 115Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20199.1.3 In areas identified as being of strategic GI importance, the Council will work with
these partners, and developers, to take advantage of opportunities to protect, enhance
and enable the following: 
•access and movement, creating linkages, promoting walking/cycling;
•biodiversity value;
•natural processes including flood management;
•cultural heritage through interpretation and accessibility to key heritage assets; and
•landscape character protection and enhancement. 
9.1.4 The NPPF states that planning policies should protect and enhance public rights of
way and access. Councils should seek opportunities to provide better facilities for users,
for example by adding links to existing rights of way networks.
9.1.5 The Harborough Open Spaces Strategy, 2016 supports Policy GI1 and aims to
provide a network of greenways which will improve links between settlements, and other
green assets. The Council will work with partners and developers in seeking new/
enhanced access in the form of multi-use greenways enabling improved access to the
countryside for more people. This network of corridors will utilise existing bridleways,
restricted byways, permissive routes and former railway lines. Greenways will improve
access to the countryside and offer quiet through routes which can be used for walking,
cycling, horse riding and other activities, potentially replacing car journeys. Opportunities
will be sought to incorporate them into new development or provide links to them. Potential
routes such as former railway lines will be protected from inappropriate development so
that their potential contribution to the GI network is not jeopardised.

Page 116Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019GI2 Open space, sport and recreation
1.The District's open space, sport and recreation facilities (as shown on the Policies
Map) and any future additional facilities provided as part of new development will be
safeguarded and enhanced through improvements to their quality and use.
2.Development resulting in the loss of or reduction in defined open space, sport and
recreation  facilities will not be permitted unless it can be clearly demonstrated that:
a.a robust assessment clearly demonstrates that the space or recreational facility
is surplus to local requirements and will not be needed in the-long term in
accordance with local standards; or
b.replacement areas will be at least equivalent in terms of quality, quantity and
accessibility, and there will be no overall negative impact on the provision of
open space in accordance with local standards; or
c.the proposal is for alternative recreational provision which meets evidence of
local need in such a way as to outweigh the loss.
3.Developments of more than 10 dwellings which would result in deficiencies in the
quantity, accessibility and/or quality of existing open space, sport and recreation
facilities should contribute towards: 
a.the provision of specific new open space, sport and recreation facilities in
accordance with local standards; and/or
b.the enhancement of identified existing facilities to meet the relevant local
standards. 
4.New open space, sport and recreation facilities should be provided within
residential development sites (unless otherwise agreed by the Council) and should: 
a.be accessible, usable, of high quality and good design, visible and safe and
include facilities for a range of ages;
b.enable links to be created between new development and surrounding
recreational networks and facilities (including Public Rights of Way);
c.provide an appropriate landscaping and landscape maintenance scheme; and
d.specify, prior to the commencement of development, the responsibilities for
management and maintenance in-perpetuity of the open space, sport and
recreation facility.
9.3.1 This policy will provide access to high quality open space, sport and recreation
facilities, in accordance with paragraphs 96 and 97 of the National Planning Policy
Framework (NPPF). 'Open space sport and recreation facilities' refers to all of the
typologies listed in Table B.30 below. This is achieved through the protection of existing
open space, sport and recreation facilities and the provision of new and enhanced facilities
in association with new development.9.3 GI2 Explanation
Page 117Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20199.3.2 Paragraph 97 of the NPPF explains that existing open space, sports and recreational
buildings and land should not be built on unless clearly surplus to requirements, or their
replacement would be at least equal in quantity and quality, or the development is for
alternative sports and recreation provision. Policy GI2 reflects this and applies to all
existing open space, sport and recreation facilities as identified on the Policies Map, as
well as to all forthcoming new facilities. 
9.3.3 A comprehensive audit of open space, sport and recreation facilities was undertaken
in 2016 in partnership with local communities. Having assessed the quantity, quality and
accessibility of existing open space it has been possible to establish up to date provision
standards for open space, sport and recreation sites in accordance with paragraph 96 of
the NPPF. 
9.3.4 The Harborough Open Spaces Strategy (2016 to 2021), 2016 (HOSS) explains how
the Council manages and secures the future of open spaces in its ownership, and how it
will work in partnership with others to enable new open space to come forward in the
future. The Open Spaces Strategy seeks to enhance and protect existing open space and
to enable new open space provision. 
9.3.5 The HOSS (and any subsequent iterations) sets out the local standards for each of
the open space typologies and forms the basis on which provision in accordance with
Policy GI2 will be sought (see Table B.30 below). To ensure that the contribution is fairly
and reasonably related in size and scale to the new development, the amount of open
space (or off site contribution towards improvement of existing open space in specified
exceptional circumstances) is linked to the anticipated final population of the new
development concerned. These provision standards have been set using both qualitative
and quantitative information sources both from the audit and consultation. The document
provides a methodology for the application of these standards to individual planning
applications.

9.3.6 The Council's preference is for provision to be made on-site. However, off-site
provision can be made where a site is constrained or too small to enable appropriate on-
site provision. Any off-site provision must be within a suitable distance from the
development it is intended to serve, as set out in the accessibility standard for the relevant
typology (see table B.30 above). In relation to criterion 4a, the term 'accessible' refers to
the implementation of the accessibility standards for new open space, sport and recreation
facilities that are set out in the HOSS, which also explains the other quality requirements in
this criterion.
9.3.7 The policy ensures that any new open space, sport or recreation facility has an
identified responsible organisation for management and maintenance prior to the
commencement of development. The responsibilities may fall to a private management
company set up by the developer, a community group, the Town or Parish Council or the
District Council. If a Town or Parish Council adopts an open space, sport or recreation
facility, a commuted sum for maintenance will be required to be paid by the developer in
accordance with the HOSS. The District Council, in most circumstances, will not adopt
new open spaces. 
9.3.8 The Harborough District Playing Pitch Strategy, 2018 (HPPS) determines the supply
of and demand for playing pitches, and identifies any shortfalls or oversupply. It also
determines where there are any quality issues concerning pitches and ancillary buildings
such as changing rooms. The HPPS includes the sports of cricket, football, rugby union,
rounders, tennis and outdoor bowls and meets the Sport England requirements for a
strategy of this kind. The aims, objectives and delivery plan of the HPPS (including any
subsequent iterations) form the basis of policy for assessing the requirement for sports
pitch provision.

1.The Council will ensure sufficient burial provision continues to be provided in the
District in the following ways:
a.Extensions to existing burial sites will be permitted where there is a
demonstrable requirement for additional capacity for burials and cremation ashes
and this cannot be met within the curtilage of an existing site;
b.New burial sites will be permitted where there is a need for additional capacity for
burials which cannot be met through extending existing sites, including provision
for the East of Lutterworth and Scraptoft North SDAs; new sites should be
located as close as possible to the assessed need;
c.The need for a new burial site to serve the needs of Market Harborough and
surrounding villages has been identified. A broad location for this new site has
been identified on land to the east of Harborough Road (B6047) to the north-
west of the town, as shown on the Policies Map. In the event that a new burial
site to serve the town is not delivered through b. above beforehand and subject
to further technical work to demonstrate the site is suitable, a new burial site in
this broad location should be provided as a component of the town’s future
expansion as part of a Local Plan Review.
9.5.1 The Harborough Cemetery and Burial Strategy, 2016, identifies the existing capacity
for burials/cremation ashes, along with future requirements. This study has been
completed on a site-by-site basis in order to establish where there is a shortfall in capacity,
and where there is sufficient capacity. 9.5 GI3 Explanation
9.5.2 Where the Cemetery Strategy identifies a shortfall of capacity, it recommends
options to address the shortfall. The three options recommended for consideration are
intensification, extension and provision of a new site. The approach recommended in a
particular circumstance takes into account the level of additional capacity required, the
existing site and its surrounding land use.
9.5.3 A number of areas of the District have been identified where the shortage of burial/
cremation ash capacity cannot be accommodated by the intensification or extension of
existing sites. These areas are:
•Towards the south of the District around Market Harborough. There is a shortage of
capacity within Market Harborough and around Foxton. Lubenham and Great Bowden
are also expected to see shortages of capacity in the period between 2031 and 2039. A
broad location for a new cemetery has been identified to the north of Market
Harborough as part of a future expansion of the town in this area.
•Towards the north of the District around Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby, and Houghton
Page 123Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019on the Hill. This provision will be implemented by provision within Policy SC1 Scraptoft
North Strategic Development Area  in partnership with the local burial authority.
•Associated with the East of Lutterworth Strategic Development Area. This provision will
be implemented by provision within Policy L1 East of Lutterworth Strategic Development
Area in partnership with the local burial authority.
9.5.4 The cemetery provision required in association with the Strategic Development Areas
will be 0.35 hectares per 1000 population in the new development. This will be provided
either within the site boundary, or in close proximity to the site in accordance with the
burial site accessibility standard set out in the Harborough Open Spaces Strategy, 2016.
On other residential developments, the Council will continue to seek either on-site burial
provision or contributions towards an off-site burial provision through Section 106
agreements and obligations (or via the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) if adopted).
These will be required to meet the provision of burial site standards set out in GI2 Open
space, sport and recreation (Table B.30 ), in order to enable communities to intensify,
expand or fund new sites for burials.

1.Local Green Spaces are allocated on the Policies Map and will retain their
openness permanently. Further Local Green Space may be identified in
Neighbourhood Plans providing it meets the relevant criteria in relation to scale,
beauty, historic significance, recreational value, tranquillity, or ecological value and
it does not conflict with the strategic policies of this Local Plan.
2.The construction of new buildings on Local Green Space will not be permitted other
than:
a.buildings providing appropriate facilities for outdoor, sport, recreation,
cemeteries, burial grounds and allotments as long as the facilities preserve the
openness of the Local Green Space; or
b.replacement buildings, provided the new building is in the same use and not
materially larger than the one it replaces; or
c.limited affordable housing for local community needs, 
except in very special circumstances where the potential harm to the Local Green
Space, including to its openness, special character, significance to the local
community, and any other harm, are clearly outweighed by other considerations.
9.7.1 Local Green Space designation provides special protection for green areas of
particular importance to local communities. Local Green Space sites have been identified
in accordance with paragraphs 99 and 100 of the National Planning Policy Framework
(NPPF) because of their beauty, historic significance, recreational value, tranquillity, or
ecological value. 9.7 GI4 Explanation
9.7.2 The Local Green Space sites have been identified following the assessment of sites
submitted to the Council by local communities in 2012, with further sites submitted in 2013.
The assessment included seeking and considering the views of landowners of the
proposed Local Green Space sites. Further views were sought as part of the Harborough
Local Plan Options Consultation, 2015. Since the completion of the original assessment
the Council has encouraged Parish Councils to identify other potential Local Green Space
sites through their Neighbourhood Development Plans to ensure comprehensive coverage
within the District.
9.7.3 The Assessment of Potential Local Green Space Sites background paper includes
the full list of nominated sites and sets out the assessment methodology. The paper
identifies why each site is special and explains why it is designated as Local Green Space.
The full list of Local Green Space sites can be found at Appendix I Local Green Space
designations.
Page 125Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 20199.7.4 The designated Local Green Spaces are consistent with Policy SS1 The spatial
strategy  and meet the criteria set out in paragraph 100 of the NPPF.
9.7.5 Neighbourhood Plans that have been 'made' within the District have successfully
designated a number of Local Green Space sites. These sites can be identified in the
respective neighbourhood plans and it is expected that further sites will be designated
through the neighbourhood plan process in the future. The Council will support this
process by advising on the justification for Local Green Space and on whether a particular
site would conflict with strategic policies in this Local Plan. Where concerns are not
addressed by the qualifying body the Council may raise concerns with the neighbourhood
plan examiner. 
9.7.6 This policy recognises the particular importance of the designated sites and ensures
their long term protection. The second part of the policy allows for the construction of
buildings for specific uses compatible with a Local Green Space designation and for
replacement buildings where specific provisions are met (in accordance with NPPF para
145). Otherwise the construction of new buildings is not permitted except in very special
circumstances where any harm is considered to be clearly outweighed by other
considerations.

2.Development will be permitted where:
a.there is no adverse impact on:
i.the conservation of priority species;
ii.irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and the loss of aged or
veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, unless the need for, and
benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss;
iii.nationally designated sites;

b.there is no loss of any 'best and most versatile agricultural land' unless this is
demonstrably necessary to facilitate the delivery of sustainable development;
c.there is no net loss or sterilisation of natural resources;
d.opportunities for improving habitats and for improving the water quality of local
water courses to improve the aquatic habitat are incorporated;
e.unavoidable loss or damage to habitats, sites or features is addressed through
mitigation, relocation, or as a last resort compensation to ensure there is no net
loss of environmental value.
3.Development should contribute towards protecting and improving biodiversity and
geodiversity through, as relevant:
a.protecting and enhancing habitats and populations of priority species;
b.protecting and enhancing the strategic biodiversity network and wildlife corridors,
particularly river and canal corridors, disused railways and all watercourses;
c.maintaining biodiversity during construction;
d.providing contributions to wider biodiversity improvements in the vicinity of the

Page 127Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019177 identify the requirements to enhance biodiversity and geodiversity. Circular 06/2005:
"Biodiversity and Geological Conservation - Statutory Obligations and Their Impact Within
The Planning System" provides guidance on how nationally designated sites and species
should be treated.
9.9.2 Harborough District is relatively poor in biodiversity terms, due to the predominance
of agriculture. There are 13 SSSIs mainly in the east of the District (see Appendix J  
Biodiversity and geodiversity sites ). Alongside these national designations, there are over
200 Local Wildlife Sites which have been through the formal notification process, one
Local Nature Reserve (North Kilworth) and 4 Regionally Important Geological or
Geomorphological Sites (RIGS). Irreplaceable habitats include ancient woodland and aged
or veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, mature plantation woodland, ancient
species rich hedgerows, and species rich grasslands. However, the potential exists to
create and enhance wildlife corridors and networks and encourage the rebuilding of
fragmented habitats through conservation management. 
9.9.3 Other than one SSSI, there are no statutory geodiversity designations in the District
at present. Railway, canal and road cuttings, disused quarries, river settings and outcrops
could offer potential geodiversity interest. Their potential value in educational, recreational
and landscape terms should be respected and protected where appropriate. 
9.9.4 Development provides an opportunity to improve biodiversity and geodiversity. This
includes ensuring that the site design retains wherever possible the natural assets of the
site, including hedges, trees and woodland and any water bodies and enhances these
assets to increase biodiversity. 
9.9.5 Development can also assist in protecting and enhancing the interconnectivity of
habitats. Measures to provide rainwater drainage, such as ponds, swales and wetlands
can provide and/or enhance 'green' and 'blue' wildlife corridors by linking with existing
habitats either within the site or beyond its boundaries. This is particularly important for
improving the water quality of water bodies as required by the European Water Framework
Directive, 2000. 
9.9.6 Best and most versatile agricultural land is a scarce resource in this district. It should
not therefore be lost without very good reason. In applying this policy the Council will,
however, take into account the economic and other benefits of developing the best and
most versatile agricultural land. 
9.9.7 There is a need to work with partners, including the Leicestershire and Rutland
Wildlife Trust, Environment Agency, the Rivers Trusts, Leicestershire County Council and
developers to progress projects and identify key opportunity areas for the improvement of
biodiversity value and the appreciation of geodiversity as part of the wider green
infrastructure network. Improving interconnectivity between habitats is particularly
important, to allow for migration of species when challenged by changing climate. The
Page 128Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019opportunities for engaging with local communities to encourage more local wildlife sites
are particularly important and neighbourhood planning is a way to encourage improved
biodiversity at a local level.
9.9.8 Priority areas for protection and enhancement are the River Welland corridor, along
with parts of the River Sence and the Grand Union Canal, and the other SSSIs. These
features were identified in the 6Cs Sub-Regional Strategic Framework, 2010 as having
potential to contribute to the improvement of biodiversity and the wider green infrastructure
network. Locally designated sites are those meeting the criteria approved by the local
RIGS Panel or that meet Leicestershire County Council's 'Criteria for the Selection of Local
Wildlife Sites in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, 2011'.

CC1 Mitigating climate change
1.Major development will be permitted where it demonstrates:
a.how carbon emissions would be minimised through passive design measures;
b.the extent to which it meets relevant best practice accreditation schemes to
promote the improvement in environmental and energy efficiency performance;
c.how the development would provide and utilise renewable energy technology;
d.whether the building(s) would require cooling, and if so how this would be
delivered without increasing carbon emissions;
e.how existing buildings to be retained as part of the development are to be made
more energy efficient;
f.how demolition of existing buildings is justified in terms of optimisation of
resources in comparison to their retention and re-use; and
g.how carbon emissions during construction will be minimised.
2.In Strategic Development Areas applicants should demonstrate whether a
decentralised energy network is viable and, if so, the arrangements for its delivery
and future management. 
10.1.1 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (paragraph 149) directs local
plans to include policies that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases in
accordance with the provisions of the Climate Change Act 2008. This commits the UK to
reducing emissions to at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. 10.1 CC1 Explanation
10.1.2 Harborough District Council recognises the risks associated with climate change
and has committed to action through Climate Local. The Harborough District Council
Climate Local Action Plan, 2015 sets out the Council’s initial strategy for addressing
climate change including measures to reduce the carbon footprint of the District from its
relatively high level and to increase the resilience of communities to the impacts. 
10.1.3 New build development should be designed to reduce carbon emissions as close to
zero as practicable. Design and Access Statements accompanying planning applications
for major developments should identify cost effective approaches to low carbon
development, which will be guided by the energy hierarchy. This requires that the design of
any development should consider use of the following energy options in priority order:
•passive design considered first as a means to reduce emissions,
•then the energy efficient design of building services, including decentralised energy
networks,
•and finally, including renewable energy at building or site level. 
Page 130Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201910.1.4 The energy efficiency of a building is covered by Part L of the Building Regulations,
which sets out the minimum requirements. In addition, a number of nationally recognised
accreditation schemes are useful in assessing sites and can help to deliver higher
standards than the minimum required in building regulations. Schemes include BREEAM,
Passivhaus and the new Home Quality Mark. 
10.1.5 Decentralised energy systems generate and supply electricity, heating or cooling
close to where it is used, thereby reducing transmission energy losses and lowering
carbon emissions. The proposed Strategic Development Areas (SDAs), are considered to
be the most feasible opportunities for decentralised energy network systems. They should
consider the feasibility of a local network as part of the development. If a decentralised
system is not included, then the promoters must demonstrate that it is not practical or
feasible. 
10.1.6 In rural communities there may also be opportunities for local micro-networks,
particularly small scale heating networks or community owned energy infrastructure.

Page 131Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019CC2 Renewable energy generation
1.Development for renewable and low carbon energy generation will be permitted
where:
a.it is an appropriate technology for the site;
b.it does not create a significant noise intrusion for existing dwellings;
c.it includes measures to mitigate against any adverse impacts on the built and
natural environment resulting from the construction, operation and
decommissioning of any equipment/infrastructure;
d.it does not contribute towards an unacceptable cumulative visual impact from
renewable energy developments when considered in conjunction with nearby
developments and permitted proposals within the District or adjoining local
authority areas; and
e.adequate conditions are imposed and/or a legal agreement is entered into
ensuring that once the use ceases operating permanently, it is fully
decommissioned and the site appropriately restored. 
2.Wind energy development involving one or more turbines will not be permitted
except as follows:
a.in the High Leicestershire and Laughton Hills Landscape Character Areas, where
the height does not exceed 30 metres and no more than three turbines are
proposed;
b.in the Welland Valley Landscape Character Area, where the height does not
exceed 65 metres and no more than three turbines are proposed; and
c.in the Lutterworth Lowlands and Upper Soar Landscape Character Areas, where
the height does not exceed 125 metres.
 In all cases, proposals will be considered against the above criteria 1.a to e.
10.3.1 The UK has a target, that 15% of energy must be from renewable sources by 2020
(EU Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on Renewable
Energy). 10.3 CC2 Explanation
10.3.2 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (paragraph 151) emphasises that
local plans should have a positive strategy to promote energy from renewable and low
carbon sources, with policies designed to maximise the development of low carbon
energy. The impact of wind generation projects on communities has been recognised by
the Government and the NPPF (paragraph 154, footnote 49) makes it clear that
development involving wind turbines should not be considered acceptable unless it is in an
area suitable for wind energy development as identified in the development plan, any
planning impacts identified by the affected community have been addressed and the
proposal has the support of the local community. 
Page 132Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201910.3.3 The Planning for Climate Change: Renewable Energy Opportunities study, May
2008 found that wind turbines, biomass plants (including combined heat and power), solar
thermal heating, photovoltaic energy, and energy from waste all have a potential to be
utilised and developed within the District. The assessment identified wind energy as a
noteworthy source of potential renewable energy generation for the District. 
10.3.4 The Landscape Sensitivity to Renewable Energy in Harborough District Study, July
2016 has identified the areas of the District with most capacity for accommodating
renewable energy. In general, larger scale renewable energy, including commercial wind
farms, is best accommodated in the Upper Soar and Lutterworth Lowlands Landscape
Character Areas (see Fig. A.4 , Chapter 4), which are characterised by man-made features.
The Welland Valley Landscape Character Area has medium capacity for accommodating
renewable installations. High Leicestershire and the Laughton Hills Landscape Character
Areas have limited capacity for accommodating renewable infrastructure. Small
installations (e.g. single wind turbines below 30m) may be capable of being
accommodated in some locations within these landscape character areas, where it can be
demonstrated that there is no adverse landscape impact and other criteria in the policy are
met. 
10.3.5 Detailed assessment was not undertaken in respect of heritage assets and their
settings in the Landscape Sensitivity to Renewable Energy report and subsequent
definition of areas for small, medium and large scale wind farms. Applications for
renewable energy development proposals will need to take account of heritage assets and
their settings, and be supported by a detailed heritage assessment that takes into account
the criteria of Policy HC1 Built heritage.
10.3.6 Commercial renewable energy developments are expected to provide an
environmental impact assessment and to ensure that important animal and bird species
are properly safeguarded. Bird sensitivity should be especially considered to the east of
the District, close to Rutland Water which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a
Ramsar site and a European Special Protection Area. 
10.3.7 Community owned energy is an important means of engaging communities with
their own energy generation. Community owned energy projects are encouraged within the
District. A local community energy company has been set up as part of the Sustainable
Harborough Challenge, called Harborough Energy, specifically to enable community
owned renewable energy projects. The first two solar projects were commissioned in 2016.
10.3.8 In all cases where planning permission is required for renewable energy projects,
any approval shall include a planning condition requiring the removal of equipment/
associated infrastructure and the reinstatement of building or land to original condition or
appearance within three years of such equipment becoming permanently non-operational.

Page 134Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019CC3 Managing flood risk
1.New development should take place in the areas of lowest risk of flooding, including
the potential future risk due to climate change. The Sequential Test, and, where
necessary, the Exceptions Test should be used to assess the suitability of proposed
development. Site-specific flood risk assessments of all sources of flood risk on the
site and downstream of the site will be required as appropriate.
2.Development should take place within Flood Zone 1, wherever possible. Within
Flood Zone 1 a site-specific flood risk assessment will be required for proposals
relating to:
a.major development;
b.land with critical drainage problems;
c.land at increased flood risk in the future; or
d.a more vulnerable use on land subject to other sources of flooding.
3.All development proposals in Flood Zones 2 or 3 will require a site-specific flood
risk assessment.
4.Development proposals subject to a site-specific flood risk assessment will only be
permitted where:
a.the mitigation, flood management, flood resilience measures, and design
requirements identified are satisfactorily addressed; and
b.the design incorporates flood resilience measures to allow for increased risk due
to climate change.
5.Development in Flood Zone 3, unless meeting the Exceptions Test, will only be
permitted as follows: 
a.Flood Zone 3a: ‘less vulnerable’ uses, including retail and business uses (A and
B Use Classes), agriculture and some non-residential institutions (Use Class D1)
other than for health services, nurseries and education; and water compatible
development;
b.Flood Zone 3b: water compatible development where appropriate; this zone will
be safeguarded to ensure protection of the functional floodplain. 
10.5.1 Specific planning guidance on development and flooding is incorporated in the
NPPF, paragraphs 155 to 165. Local plans are required to take into consideration flood risk
and to direct development away from areas of flood risk. The use of the sequential test to
direct development to low risk sites is indicated in NPPF, paragraphs 157-158. 10.5 CC3 Explanation
10.5.2 There are a range of public bodies with responsibility for flooding. The Environment
Agency (EA) has a leading role, particularly in preparing Catchment Flood Management
Plans for each river basin. In Harborough District the rivers are covered by the following
plans: 
Page 135Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•Welland and tributaries - Anglian River Basin;
•Soar and tributaries - Humber River Basin; and
•Avon and tributaries - Severn River Basin.
10.5.3 Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFA) have responsibility for producing Flood Risk
Management Strategies for local sources of flooding including surface water, groundwater
and ordinary watercourses. Leicestershire County Council are the LLFA for Harborough
District and have published their Local Flood Risk Management Study, 2015.
10.5.4 LLFAs are statutory consultees to any major schemes that may impact on flood risk.
The Environment Agency is also a statutory consultee for any development in Flood Zones
2 and 3. 
10.5.5 The Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, 2009 (SFRA) as updated in 2017,
provides the evidence to determine the likely impact that new development will make to
flood risk. It found that less than 10% of the District falls within Flood Zone 3 (highest risk
of flooding). The majority of the Flood Zone 3 areas are in rural areas and therefore, in
general, the flood risk within the District is not considered to be a significant constraint on
future development. However, a number of watercourses are prone to flooding during
extreme weather conditions. The River Welland, which flows through the centre of Market
Harborough, is particularly vulnerable, the most recent flooding occurring in March 2016. 
10.5.6 The majority of the District has clay soils, which are particularly prone to surface
water flooding. Various settlements across the District are at risk, including: Market
Harborough, Lutterworth, Broughton Astley, Great Glen, Scraptoft and Thurnby and
Bushby, as well as some smaller villages. These settlements are particularly at risk during
extreme flood events and sewers on new developments should be designed to safely
accommodate extreme rain events, beyond the normal design criteria. 
10.5.7 As set out in the NPPF (paragraph 163, footnote 50) applicants for major
development, namely that of 1 hectare or greater in Flood Zone 1 or any development in
Flood Zone 2 or 3, would be expected to submit a site specific Flood Risk Assessments
(FRA) to identify the main flood risks to the site, including whether a development will
increase flood risk downstream, and recommendations for mitigating measures. The
assessment should identify how a development will be designed to cope with flooding and
how the risk will be mitigated without increasing the risk elsewhere. The FRA should also
consider the future risk by including the climate change projections as detailed in ‘Flood
Risk Assessments: Climate Change Allowances’ (Environment Agency, February 2017).
Recommendations for mitigation will be incorporated as conditions to the planning
permission. The FRA should include:
•identification of flood risk;
•assessment of existing run-off rates;
•calculation of greenfield run-off rates;
Page 136Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•identification of measures, in line with the drainage hierarchy, to reduce run-off rates;
and
•calculation of proposed run-off rates; and
•calculation of increased risk as identified in the climate change projections.

Page 137Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019CC4 Sustainable drainage
1.All major development must incorporate sustainable drainage systems (SuDS).
2.Prior to the commencement of development, the responsibilities for management
and maintenance in perpetuity of the SuDS must be agreed.
3.The design and layout of the SuDS, taking account of the hydrology of the site, will:
a.manage surface water close to its source and on the surface where reasonably
practicable to do so;
b.use water as a resource, re-using it where practicable, and ensuring that any
run-off does not negatively impact on the water quality of a nearby water body;
c.use features that enhance the site design and make an active contribution to
making places for people;
d.incorporate surface water management features as multi-functional greenspace
wherever possible;
e.provide for the re-naturalisation of modified water courses where practical;
f.be located away from land affected by contamination that may pose an additional
risk to groundwater or other waterbodies;
g.demonstrate that the peak rate of run-off over the lifetime of the development,
allowing for climate change, is no greater for the developed site than it was for
the undeveloped site and reduced wherever possible; and
h.ensure that flooding would not occur to property in and adjacent to the
development, in the event of an occurrence of a 1 in 100 year rainfall event
(including an allowance for climate change) or in the event of local drainage
system failure. 
10.7.1 Paragraph 165 of the NPPF indicates that major developments should incorporate
sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) unless there is clear evidence that this would be
inappropriate. Leicestershire County Council as Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) is the
statutory consultee for SuDs schemes in Harborough District. SuDS are a vital tool in
ensuring that the water quality of water bodies improves in line with the requirements of
the European Water Framework Directive, 2000 (WFD).10.7 CC4 Explanation
10.7.2 The principle of SuDS is to slow the flow of water from the site, retaining rainfall in
the various SuDS elements across the site and at building scale. The SuDS design should
be designed with the hydrology of the site. In general drains leading to a large retention
pond are not considered to be suitable. 
10.7.3 Minor development of more than one dwelling should address the opportunity for
SuDS in the Design and Access Statement accompanying a planning application. SuDS
can be adapted for minor development of 9 or fewer dwellings as well as major
developments by choosing from a range of measures that suit the site including:
Page 138Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•green roofs;
•rainwater harvesting;
•rainwater gardens;
•permeable surfaces;
•swales and basins;
•tree planting; and
•ponds and wetlands.
10.7.4 Greenfield development should discharge water from the site no more quickly than
the original green field site. The heavy clay soil that is characteristic of Leicestershire can
lead to rapid run-off and in sensitive sites this may lead to the need for further retention
measures. This is best achieved by designing the scheme to take account of the hydrology
of the site, for example by creating wetlands in the lowest areas. Watercourses on the site
should be an intrinsic part of the overall SuDS scheme and if they are modified by weirs
and culverts consideration should be given to re-naturalising the water course. Where
development is on brownfield sites, the opportunity should be taken to reduce the risk of
flooding and improve and protect water quality and habitats. SuDs should not be located
on land affected by contamination, as this may leach into the groundwater, or be carried to
nearby water bodies. Guidance is available from the EA in their groundwater protection
statements. 
10.7.5 In addition development proposals should demonstrate that:
•adequate foul water treatment and disposal already exists or can be provided in time to
serve the development;
•no surface water connections are made to the foul sewerage system, except in
exceptional circumstances where it can be shown where there are no feasible
alternatives;
•suitable access is safeguarded for the maintenance of water resources and drainage
infrastructure.
10.7.6 The SuDS design should also take account of the potential for delivering wider
benefits, especially biodiversity and water quality improvements and the opportunities for
provision of open space. The provision for maintenance and upkeep of SuDS should be an
integral part of the planning application. The Council also requires the use of SuDS during
construction to ensure that run-off from the site does not increase flood risk to nearby
properties as a development is built or impact upon water quality of nearby watercourses.
10.7.7 The design of the SuDS should be informed by the industry best practice as
currently found in the CIRIA SuDS Manual C753, 2007 (or updates). Where rainwater
harvesting is implemented then full regard shall be had to the provisions of the Private
Water Supply Regulations, 2016.

IN1 Infrastructure provision
1.Major development will be permitted where there is, or will be when needed,
sufficient infrastructure capacity to support and meet all the requirements arising
from it, including those away from the site and its immediate vicinity, whether within
Harborough District or outside.
2.Direct provision and/or financial contributions towards meeting all the eligible costs
of infrastructure directly required by a major development (or cumulatively with
other major developments within Harborough District or outside) will be sought from
the scheme promoter whenever this is necessary. Planning obligations under
Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) will be
required taking into account the viability of the development. This will be in addition
to the affordable housing requirement as set out in Policy H2. 
11.1.1 Infrastructure includes physical assets such as:11.1 IN1 Explanation
•roads and footpaths;
•cycleways;
•public transport facilities;
•electronic communications (including broadband);
•gas and electricity supplies;
•water supply;
•foul drainage and sewage treatment facilities;
•flood defence infrastructure; and
•surface water management and power stations; 
and social assets such as:
•health centres and doctors' surgeries;
•schools and colleges;
•community halls and indoor sports facilities; and
•green infrastructure, including playing fields and informal open space (green
infrastructure is dealt with in Chapter 9). 
11.1.2 A consistent theme of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  is the
importance of infrastructure provision in accompanying and enabling the sustainable
growth of communities.
Page 141Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.1.3 Planning for infrastructure is a key part of preparing a local plan. In particular it is
important to ensure that the infrastructure necessary to service new development is
provided in a timely and financially viable way. Establishing the capacity of existing
infrastructure to accommodate the demands arising from the occupiers of new
development is a key starting point. However, in some cases new development can be
sited to enable new infrastructure in locations that will promote longer term sustainable
growth. Infrastructure required as part of the development of specific strategic sites in this
Local Plan is set out in the relevant site allocation policies in Part C.
11.1.4 Providing some forms of infrastructure is largely dependent on a commercial
relationship between developers and infrastructure providers. The public utility providers
are private companies that charge for their services, so their upfront provision costs are
off-set not only by what developers pay in terms of initial charges but also by future
revenues arising from billing new customers. However, the use of other types of
infrastructure, such as new public roads, schools and health facilities, may not be directly
charged to users. Although some government derived funding sources pay for such
provision, there is also a reliance on developer contributions in one form or another,
especially where the extra capacity required directly arises from development generated
demand.Funding infrastructure
11.1.5 Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) enables
local planning authorities to negotiate with prospective developers, so that they either
directly build, or make financial contributions towards, infrastructure. The rules under
which councils can negotiate planning obligations are subject to nationally-set tests
concerning whether they are necessary in order to make the development acceptable in
planning terms, directly related to the development, and fairly and reasonably related in
scale and kind. 
11.1.6 Further guidance on how the Council will implement Policy IN1, having regard to
any changes in regulations introduced by the Government, will be set out in revisions to
the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), 2017.
11.1.7 Where specific items of infrastructure cannot be provided directly within a
development, or it is not appropriate to be located on the development site itself,
developers will be required to pay for or contribute to the cost of necessary infrastructure
through Section 106 agreements, or through CIL if progressed. As highway authority,
Leicestershire County Council 's preferred method for the delivery of highway infrastructure
is through agreements under Sections 38 and 278 of the Highways Act 1980. Where
available, the Council will also seek to use other funding sources to contribute to identified
infrastructure need.
11.1.8 Developers will be required to consider all the infrastructure implications and
requirements of a scheme and not just those on the site or its immediate vicinity. Examples
include improvement to a road junction some distance away from the development if the
Page 142Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019amount of traffic generated by the scheme would exceed the junction's capacity. In some
cases it is possible that improvements will be required to roads in neighbouring districts or
in Leicester City as a result of growth in Harborough District. For instance as a result of
proposed growth along the A5 corridor Highways England has been working with several
local authorities to seek road improvements some of which will be outside the District.
Similarly it is possible that growth in neighbouring areas might require improvements to
roads within Harborough District. Building on evidence prepared to underpin this Local
Plan, the District Council will continue to work closely with the County and City highway
authorities, and with Highways England and neighbouring planning authorities, to ensure a
coordinated approach to identifying and delivering such road improvements. 
11.1.9 In terms of provision for education, libraries and civic amenities, Leicestershire
County Council considers relevant development proposals on a case-by-case basis.
Where the need for improvements to existing primary and secondary education provision,
libraries or existing civic amenity infrastructure are identified the County Council will seek
contributions to fund any necessary improvements in accordance with its Leicestershire
Planning Obligations Policy, 2016 (or subsequent updates) and the CIL Regulations.
11.1.10 In circumstances where infrastructure capacity or its future delivery cannot be
certain, Policy IN1 will be used as a reason to refuse planning permission or restrict
(through a condition or Section 106 agreement) development from being commenced.
11.1.11 The Harborough Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP), has been prepared alongside
this Local Plan and identifies the need for new infrastructure to support new development
proposed in the Local Plan. In particular it:Harborough Infrastructure Delivery Plan
•establishes the capacity of existing infrastructure to meet the needs of existing residents
and businesses;
•identifies where capacity is insufficient or absent to meet the needs of new planned
development; and
•sets out broad costs and responsibilities for providing new infrastructure required to
deliver the key economic and housing development proposed in the plan.
11.1.12 The IDP is available separately on the Local Plan web site and is a live document
which the Council will update regularly recognising that circumstances will change over
time and new information and government guidance on infrastructure delivery, funding
sources, and investment programmes will become available. The Council will continue to
engage with key infrastructure providers to ensure that issues, proposals and aspirations
are captured.
11.1.13 The IDP has also informed the economic viability assessment of the whole plan
(see paragraph 11.1.14 below) and may inform the introduction of a CIL, if progressed.
The IDP will also inform how the Council sets its own capital expenditure priorities,
including those resources secured through developer contributions and potentially CIL. 
Page 143Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.1.14 The preparation of the Local Plan has been informed by a Local Plan Viability
Assessment, 2017. This has considered whether the requirements of each policy including
Policy IN1 would impact on the overall viability of the plan and ensure that appropriate
policies requiring financial contributions or specific provision are generally viable.
11.1.15 When applying Policy IN1 in the determination of planning applications the Council
will be guided by the IDP as updated, together with the advice from infrastructure
providers. The delivery of infrastructure will be enabled through a range of funding
mechanisms and partners so that provision is made in a timely fashion to enable
development and meet users’ needs as they arise. Development may need to be phased
to ensure the provision of infrastructure in a timely manner. Conditions attached to the
planning permission or a planning obligation may be used to secure this phasing
arrangement.

Page 144Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019IN2 Sustainable transport
1.Development proposals should have regard to the transport policies of the Local
Transport Authority (and where appropriate adjoining transport authorities) and
where there are impacts on the national road network be aligned with policies of
Highways England. Proposals should seek to maximise the use and efficiency of
existing transport facilities and where necessary provide mitigating measures to
deal with the impacts of development on the transport network, both within and
outside the District.
2.Residential and commercial development proposals will be permitted, subject to the
provision of: 
a.safe access, servicing and parking arrangements having regard to highways
authority guidance and standards;
b.measures to facilitate and encourage safe access by cycle and on foot;
c.protection of, connection to, and extension where practicable of existing
pedestrian, cycle and equestrian routes;
d.provision for public transport enhancement where justified, including information
and waiting facilities and measures to encourage public transport use;
e.provision for the transport needs of specific groups in the community, such as the
elderly and those with disabilities;
f.provision of electric vehicle recharging facilities where appropriate; and
g.mitigation for any adverse impact on air quality, especially in Air Quality
Management Areas, and residential amenity, including traffic noise.
3.Control of speed and flow of vehicular traffic in settlements and at junctions should
use measures which minimise the need for additional traffic signs and signals.
Proposals to reduce the environmental effect of highway related structures by
reducing unnecessary traffic signs and street lighting should be implemented where
safety allows.
11.3.1 In a rural district such as Harborough, the need to travel for jobs or services, or to
be served by mobile delivery, has always been an important feature of daily life. The
relationship between places and sustainable transport is important, not only in helping to
ensure people can travel easily and sustainably but also in managing the effects on
transport infrastructure in the District. In rural areas maintaining access to services is vital
and this will be pursued by supporting limited rural development in accordance with Policy
H1 Provision of new housing , GD2 Settlement development , GD3 Development in the
countryside  and GD4 New housing in the countryside . This will enable retention of local
services, increase opportunities for home and village delivery of services and will support
the ability for people to work and shop from home using digital connectivity, subject to this
being available at sufficient speeds (see Policy IN3 Electronic connectivity ).11.3 IN2 Explanation
Page 145Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.3.2 Owing to physical constraints within the historic areas of the District, the level of
development proposed and lack of expected public funding sources, the development
strategy does not rely on a significant need for additional transport infrastructure. Policy
SS1 The spatial strategy  directs most development into areas which already have capacity
to offer sustainable transport choice for local journeys to access services and facilities.
11.3.3 Policy IN2 aims to assist in the delivery of the goals and outcomes of the
Leicestershire County Council Local Transport Plan 3 2011-2026 (LTP3). In addition, the
Council will work closely with neighbouring planning and highway authorities (in particular
Leicester City, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire County Councils), Highways England,
Network Rail and local train operating companies in considering proposals for strategic
development in the District. 
11.3.4 Local Transport Plans are developed by the Local Transport Authority following the
Local Transport Act 2000. LTP3 came into effect in March 2011 and sets out the transport
strategy to 2026 for Leicestershire. It is supported by rolling three year Implementation
Plans. The Local Plan aims to assist Leicestershire County Council in the delivery of the
following outcomes: 
•The transport system provides more consistent, predictable and reliable journey times
for the movement of people and goods.
•All residents have efficient, easy and affordable access to key services, such as
employment, education, health care and food shopping, particularly by public transport,
bike and on foot.
•More people walk, cycle and use public transport as part of their daily journeys.
•The negative impact of the transport system on the environment, air quality and
individuals is reduced. 
11.3.5 The Council is anxious to ensure that both the occupiers and users of new
development, and those elsewhere who may be affected by it indirectly, will not be
subjected to below acceptable standards of air quality. Therefore, in controlling the
potential impact of development upon air quality, the Council will require an effective air
pollution mitigation strategy if a development proposal would be likely to either:
•have a moderate adverse, or worse, impact upon air quality within an existing Air
Quality Management Area (AQMA) whether the proposal is inside or outside of that
AQMA; or
•contribute directly or indirectly to the declaration of another AQMA be it in this district or
an adjoining one.
11.3.6 An AQMA is an area identified as one in which the national air quality objectives are
unlikely to be achieved. A moderate adverse impact is defined by Land-Use Planning &
Development Control: Planning For Air Quality May 2015 b(v1.1) EPUK & IAQM (or a
successor document). 
Page 146Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.3.7 The approach to transport set out in this Local Plan acknowledges that additional
transport infrastructure improvements will be largely developer funded, and that public
transport provision, for both new and existing services, will also be developer funded
where necessary. Within and adjacent to Market Harborough, development will be
expected to contribute to transport improvement schemes set out in the Market
Harborough Transport Strategy 2017-2031, with development within and adjacent to
Lutterworth and Magna Park expected to contribute towards transport improvement
schemes set out in the A5 Strategy and Action Plan. Where the impacts of the
development taken cumulatively with other schemes would have a significantly adverse
effect on the transport network, the Council will seek measures, including if necessary a
financial contribution fairly and reasonably related to the development, to mitigate the
impact of the scheme. The Market Harborough Transport Strategy 2016 sets out 18
recommendations for transport mitigation measures within and around Market
Harborough. These include mitigation measures for capacity/congestion improvements,
changes to the network and traffic routing, sustainable transport initiatives, safety
improvements, traffic management improvements, HGV controls and highway
maintenance. A table of mitigation measures is set out below.
Capacity / Congestion Improvements
R1 With the assistance of micro-simulation [1] traffic modelling, undertake option appraisals for
capacity improvements at the following key junctions:
(i) A6 / B6047 (aka McDonalds Roundabout);
(ii) The Square / St Mary’s Road / Coventry Road (town centre);
(iii) Northampton Road / Springfield Street / Welland Park Road;
(iv) A4304 St Mary’s Road / Kettering Road / Clarence Street;
(v) A4304 Rockingham Road / Gores Lane;
(vi) A6 / Harborough Road / Dingley Road / A4304; and
(vii) Sainsbury’s store entrance / Springfield Street.
R2 As part of the refinement of the analysis so far undertaken, the Authority will analyse the
extent of the problem of blocking at local junctions which could be mitigated by the provision
of yellow box markings.
Recommendations that result in changes to the network and traffic routing
R3 With the assistance of micro-simulation traffic modelling consider the upgrading of Welland
Park Road to become the A4304, with a respective downgrading of Coventry Road.
Determine the associated engineering, accommodation and complementary works to
facilitate this work.
R4 Consider the principle of providing a relief road between the A508 and A6 to the south-east
of the town as a long term aspiration.
Sustainable transport infrastructure / behaviour change initiatives
R5 Extend and enhance the walking and cycling network.
R6 Make localised public transport infrastructure improvements.
R7 Identify a suite of tailored behaviour change initiatives to encourage modal shift in travel
choice towards active and sustainable travel.Table B.40 Market Harborough Transport Strategy recommendations
Page 147Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019R8 Investigate walking / cycling routes connecting Market Harborough and Lubenham, in
combination with measures to improve the existing walking and cycling infrastructure.
R9 Undertake further analysis work to determine the suitability of additional pedestrian
crossings within the Town Centre.
R10 Enhancement of the infrastructure supporting transport interchanges in the town including
the nearby rail and bus terminals thereby increasing the attractiveness of such assets for
those on foot or cycle.
Safety Improvements
R11 Continue to monitor Road Traffic Collisions (RTC) within the study area. If an RTC occurs
within, or adjacent to, a proposed improvement scheme proportionate efforts should be
made where appropriate to include complementary measures that could reduce further
RTCs.
Traffic Management Improvements and Emergency Diversion Routes
R12 Devise and implement a new strategy for traffic signing across the study area.
R13 Review parking controls in the vicinity of the town centre and rail station, with particular
regard to the need/benefit of further permit parking zones.
R14 Sites with recorded speeds in excess of the Association of Chief Police Officers enforcement
threshold should be reviewed with a view that, where viable and cost effective, measures will
be developed to improve compliance with the stipulated speed limit.
R15 Identify opportunities to divert Highways England emergency diversion routes away from the
town centre (e.g. at times of a closure on the A14).
HGV controls
R16 Identify undesirable routes for HGVs and impose suitable prohibitions. Whilst the promotion
of a town wide environmental weight restriction would be preferable, two key routes are
particularly vulnerable to exploitation by inappropriate HGV traffic and should be adopted as
a minimum:
(i) Ashley Road / Kettering Road between the A4304 and the A6
(ii) Bath Street / Western Avenue between the A508 and Farndon Road.
R17 Send updated map to ‘sat-nav’ contacts, advising of HGV controls following on from
recommendation R16.
Highway Maintenance
R18 In light of the size and scope of the study, incorporate / consider maintenance activities in
relation to improvement proposals.
(Source: Market Harborough Transport Strategy, updated recommendations)
 [1] Road traffic micro-simulation models model the movements of individual vehicles
travelling around road networks by using car following, lane changing and gap acceptance
rules. They are popular for the development and evaluation of a broad range of road traffic
management and control systems. They are particularly appropriate for examining certain
complex traffic problems (e.g. complex junctions).
Page 148Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.3.8 Short journeys within towns and villages should be able to be undertaken by
walking or cycling instead of taking the car. Journeys by rail or bus from Market
Harborough to Leicester are encouraged, together with rail travel to London where
travellers can benefit from enhanced services and connections to Europe at St Pancras
International. However, use of the private car and goods vehicles for transport will continue
to be important in the District due to its rural nature. Nevertheless, advances in technology
over the lifetime of the Local Plan are likely to increase the use of low carbon vehicles.
Development of recharging facilities will be sought in large-scale housing and commercial
development schemes. 
11.3.9 Leicestershire County Council's Leicestershire Highway Design Guide covers
advice on highway design, including car parking, transport assessments and transport
plans. These documents are the starting point for detailed agreement on development
proposals and include car parking standards to be applied in new developments, and will
inform criteria 2 a., b. and c. of the policy. 
11.3.10 Over-provision of traffic signs and signals, including lights, in towns and villages
can have a detrimental effect on their character and appearance. Future developments
should aim to minimise road signage and lighting where possible subject to compliance
with the Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide, 2018 and updates.

1.Major development will only be permitted where adequate broadband infrastructure
is to be made available to all residents and/or users of the development.
2.Major development should incorporate a bespoke duct network, designed and
implemented in cooperation with a recognised network provider, and where viable,
a fibre to the premises (FTTP) solution.
3.Other forms of infrastructure, such as facilities supporting mobile broadband and
Wi-Fi, should be included in major development and designed in a sympathetic and
appropriate way in order to reflect the character of the surrounding area.
4.Telecommunications development will be permitted where:
a.there is no significant impact on the character or appearance of the building on
which, or space in which, the equipment is located, including not contributing to
street clutter;
b.the significance, appearance, character and setting of heritage assets are
conserved;
c.all options for sharing of existing equipment, and erecting masts on existing tall
buildings or other structures have been fully explored, with the preferred
approach adopted wherever possible;
d.they are appropriately designed, minimising size and scale and camouflaging
appearance wherever possible;
e.all masts and additions to existing masts are self-certified to meet International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standards; and
f.provision is made to ensure that equipment that has become obsolete or that is
no longer in use is removed as soon as practicable and the site restored to its
former condition.
11.5.1 The Council recognises the social and financial benefits to individuals and
businesses of having telecommunications networks for mobile phones and broadband that
are fit for purpose. The NPPF requires local plans to support the expansion of electronic
communications networks, including telecommunications and high speed broadband.11.5 IN3 Explanation
11.5.2 High speed broadband is no longer merely desirable, but is essential in ordinary
daily life and for businesses. This is particularly the case in this District as it features a high
proportion of home working when compared to other districts locally. The Government's
Broadband Delivery (BDUK) is delivering superfast broadband and better mobile
connectivity to the nation. It is the aim of the Council, in line with the BDUK programme, to
provide access to superfast broadband to all residents and businesses in the District. It willBroadband
Page 150Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019seek to ensure that this meets the ambitions of the Government's Digital Communications
Infrastructure Strategy (2015) and is at market prices with a full choice of UK service
providers. 
11.5.3 Through the Local Plan, the Council will support the provision of telecommunication
growth and new technologies whilst ensuring adverse impacts on the character of the built
form or physical environment are minimised.
11.5.4 The Government has given permitted development rights to a variety of minor forms
of telecommunications development. In such cases, although the Council cannot object to
the principle of development, it can exercise control over the siting and appearance with
the aim of protecting amenity. The Council encourages early discussions by operators
when they consider developing their networks and will require that detailed evidence and
justification for any new site accompany any application for planning consent.
11.5.5 Applications for major residential and employment development should be
supported by a communications strategy that delivers future-proofed infrastructure and
supports sustainable communications services. Developers are encouraged to engage
with broadband providers at the earliest opportunity to enable infrastructure to support the
highest possible internet connection speeds to be provided in new developments. They
should also ensure that future occupiers have access to a sustainable communications
infrastructure, giving appropriate consideration to the choice and availability of UK
communications providers that can offer high speed data connections. The provision of the
necessary infrastructure may be funded by the service providers. This applies particularly
on larger urban sites but may be more problematic on smaller developments in rural
locations.
11.5.6 This policy aims to provide a thorough assessment for all telecommunication
proposals, whether they are prior approval applications or developments requiring full
planning permission. It provides guidance for both new and replacement masts, whilst
providing the flexibility to allow for an efficient expansion of the network and to meet the
demands imposed by technological advancements.Telecommunications
11.5.7 Reasonable justification should be provided by the applicant to demonstrate why
the chosen site is the preferred option, including evidence demonstrating that mast sharing
has been investigated and that alternative sites have been explored. The onus is on the
developer to demonstrate that the preferred site is the most suitable for the proposal and
how the needs of the occupiers will be met; the Council may refuse permission on the
grounds that insufficient information has been provided. Appropriate camouflage and
screening may be necessary where the proposed development would cause an intrusive
visual impact on the surroundings. 
11.5.8 The NPPF also requires the applicant to supply information relating to the outcomes
of any consultations with local communities or other organisations which have an interest
Page 151Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019in the proposal. It is especially important to gain these views if the proposed siting is close
to a sensitive location such as a school or hospital. The proposal must be able to
demonstrate that it complies with the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation
Protection (ICNIRP) Guidelines for public exposure, in accordance with the Mobile
Operators Association’s (MOA) Ten Commitments, 2001 (as updated or replaced).
11.5.9 There are links with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP), which harnesses the
efforts of infrastructure providers to aid the delivery of the Local Plan. The IDP will also
ensure links with mobile operators to ensure that their aspirations for future improvements
to the networks are facilitated.

Page 152Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019IN4 Water resources and services
1.Water resources will be protected and water services provided. Development will be
permitted where it would:
a.not adversely affect the quality of any water course into which the surface water
emanating from new development flows;
b.not adversely affect ground water quality by preventing potential sources of water
pollution within Source Protection Zones (as identified on the Policies Map);
c.have access to an adequate water supply to support the development proposed;
d.have ready access to adequate foul water treatment and disposal facilities that
either already exist or can be provided in time to serve the development;
e.ensure the removal of any contamination from the site and that the development
would not result in the migration of any contamination to a location where it could
have an adverse affect upon the water environment; and
f.have no adverse impact on and, wherever possible, contribute to an enhanced
water environment and its associated ecology.
2.Major developments, and high or intense water use developments, should include a
grey water and rainwater harvesting system, unless demonstrated to the Council's
satisfaction that such a system is not viable or practical.
11.7.1 The conservation and management of water resources is a vitally important issue
and an area of increasing concern. The European Water Framework Directive, 2000
(WFD) established a framework for managing the water environment. It requires measures
to be taken to encourage the sustainable use of water and to protect and improve inland
surface waters, groundwater and coastal waters with the aim of achieving good status.
The Environment Agency is the ‘competent authority’ for the WFD which requires a
management plan to be developed for each river basin district. The Humber, Severn and
Anglian River Basin Management Plans, which were updated in 2015, require water
courses within Harborough District to continue to show improvements in overall quality in
line with the quality standards specified in these documents. It is a minimum requirement
that there will be no deterioration in water quality.11.7 IN4 Explanation
11.7.2 The increased quantities of waste water and sewage effluent arising from new
development have to be managed to ensure that there is no deterioration in the quality of
the water courses receiving this effluent. This also includes effluent from industrial sites
and residential properties, as well as pollution run-off from impermeable urban surfaces
such as highways, sediment from land under construction, and pollutants from
contaminated land. In order to prevent unacceptable risks from pollution, the following will
be taken into account in the determination of planning applications: Potential water pollution
Page 153Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•effects (including the cumulative effects) of pollution on health, the natural environment
or general amenity; and
•the potential sensitivity of the area or proposed development to adverse effects from
pollution.
11.7.3 Drinking Water Safeguard Zones are designated areas in which the use of certain
substances must be carefully managed to prevent the pollution of water sources that are
used to provide drinking water. In order to provide water for people to drink, water is
abstracted from reservoirs, rivers and the ground (known as groundwater) in areas
referred to as Drinking Water Protected Areas (DrWPAs). Safeguard Zones, which are a
joint initiative between the Environment Agency and water companies, relate to any water
sources that are at risk of deterioration which would result in the need for additional
treatment. The Environment Agency targets these zones to address pollution so that extra
treatment of the water can be avoided. 
11.7.4 Groundwater supplies a significant proportion of potable water (i.e. drinking water).
To protect these water supplies from pollution, the Environment Agency (EA) designates
Source Protection Zones (SPZs). SPZs are defined for groundwater sources such as
wells, boreholes and springs that are used for public drinking water supply. The principal
reasons for defining SPZs are to influence planning decisions and to promote pollution
prevention through environmental permits. Hence, the EA will be consulted on all planning
applications within the SPZs in the District as identified on the Policies Map. There are two
Groundwater Source Protection Zones in the District, located in the area surrounding
Husbands Bosworth and North Kilworth. Drinking water
11.7.5 Developments must be appropriate to the sensitivity of the site and planning
proposals are required to demonstrate that appropriate mitigation measures have been
incorporated to reduce groundwater pollution to an acceptable minimum. Groundwater
contamination is likely to occur when pollutants such as fertilizers, nutrients, pesticides,
faecal bacteria or chemicals (leaking from a landfill or a storage tank) are flushed through
the rock into the groundwater and reach the aquifer. 
11.7.6 SPZs and vulnerability maps (which identify where a groundwater resource is at risk
from pollution due to the nature of the soil, unsaturated or inherent characteristics of the
aquifer) indicate where the risks to groundwater are higher than others. They are used as
the initial tool in support of the EA’s responses to developers and set restrictions to some
types of development that may not be appropriate due to the risk they pose to the water
environment. Such development types might include, for example, land uses proposed for
power generation, new combustion plants, composting facilities, incineration plants and
intensive pig or poultry operations. 
Page 154Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201911.7.7 The EA gives advice to developers and planners on development proposals falling
within designated groundwater SPZs accordingly. A groundwater risk assessment, for
which site-specific data is essential, may be required as a condition of relevant planning
permissions. 
11.7.8 Surface water drainage is expected to be managed in accordance with the
Government's water strategy for England document entitled 'Future Water' published in
2008. The strategy sets out a vision for more effective management of surface water in the
context of both climate change and the growing pressure for housing. This would entail
new developments not conveying surface water to foul or combined sewage systems and,
where practicable, removing surface water already connected to them.Water infrastructure
11.7.9 Consideration of the current Water Cycle Study, 2015 will be required to ensure that
infrastructure improvements are delivered in a timely manner to minimise impacts on water
quality and the environment. It will also be necessary to link into the water companies’ 5
year Asset Management Plans to ensure appropriate investment is planned, funded and
delivered. 
11.7.10 Land affected by contamination can pose a risk to surface water, groundwater,
human health and the wider environment. It is therefore imperative to ensure that
development contributes positively to the water environment and its ecology where
possible and does not adversely affect surface and/or ground water quality in line with the
requirements of the European Water Framework Directive 2000.Water environment
11.7.11 The efficient use of water is important in reducing carbon emissions. Rainwater
collected from the roofs of buildings can be used as a substitute for mains water, which
has undergone a high level of treatment to ensure it is safe for drinking. Rainwater, stored
in underground tanks, can be used for toilet flushing and clothes washing. Similarly grey
water, that is water already used in the home, perhaps for bathing, can be stored and
reused for toilet flushing. Suitable systems are commercially available and are most easily
included in new developments.Water conservation

satisfactory evidence of an unmet local housing need; or
c.conclusion of a review in response to specific trigger points as set out in the
monitoring framework, including identification of significant and persistent
shortfalls in the delivery or supply of housing against the housing requirement.
3.Any full or partial update of the Local Plan triggered by 2. above will be submitted
for examination within 30 months from the date it commenced.
12.1.1 It is important that this Local Plan is capable of being implemented and that the
delivery and effectiveness of its policies against objectives and timescales are monitored.
It is also important that the Local Plan continues to be relevant in terms of the social,
economic, and environmental conditions and in respect to changing national and regional
planning policies. 12.1 IMR1 Explanation
12.1.2 The supporting information under each policy sets out how it will be delivered. Most
policies will be delivered through the development management process, and the Council
will ensure that it continues to offer a high quality and efficient service to all applicants,
whether they be householders or major developers, to assist in the timely delivery of
sustainable development. Where required supplementary planning documents,
development briefs or master plans may be prepared, potentially in partnership between
the Council and a developer in order to support the development of specific sites or to
provide clarity on the implementation and delivery of policies.
Page 157Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201912.1.3 The preparation of the Local Plan has been informed by the Local Plan Viability
Assessment, 2017 which has considered whether the requirements of each policy
including Policy IN1 Infrastructure provision would impact on the overall viability of the
plan, in order to ensure that policies do not impose unreasonable burdens on
development. 
12.1.4 Following adoption, monitoring the achievement of plan objectives, using targets
and indicators, enables supporting action to be taken, or the need for partial or full Plan
review to be identified and progressed if policies are failing or circumstances have
changed. Monitoring of the Local Plan will be reported through the annual Authority
Monitoring Report (AMR). The AMR is a key element of the Local Plan and will measure
the success of policies against a series of national and local indicators. It will identify:
•how well policies are achieving their objectives,
•whether sustainable development is being delivered,
•whether the assumptions and objectives which informed policies are still relevant, and
•whether the targets in the Local Plan are being met. 
12.1.5 The Council will keep under regular review the evidence base of the Local Plan,
including key documents such as the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing and Economic
Development Need Assessment (HEDNA), 2017 as well as the wider national, regional
and local social, economic and environmental context. Significant changes to the context
of the Plan revealed through updates to key evidence will inform the need to undertake a
formal review. 
12.1.6 A performance monitoring framework is set out in Appendix K Monitoring framework  
(Table D.32) which identifies the key indicators that will be used to monitor the delivery of
the Local Plan Objectives that are set out in Chapter 2 (section 2.3). The framework
measures the performance of related key policies and indicators that cover matters critical
to the overall performance of the Plan and the delivery of sustainable development.
Although all the policies in the Plan will be subject to periodic monitoring as referred to in
the supporting information table for each policy, the key performance measures in the
framework will be monitored each year and the results published in the AMR. 
12.1.7 The Council recognises that to be effective the Local Plan needs to be kept up to
date. Policies in the Local Plan, including the spatial strategy, will be reviewed to assess
whether they need updating at least five years from adoption and, where necessary, they
will be updated. This review process will take account of any significant changes to
national policy and changing circumstances affecting the District. In addition an early Local
Plan update (full or partial) will be initiated in the following circumstances:
a. Adoption of Memorandum of Understanding or Statement of Common Ground
Once there is clarity around the scale of any unmet housing need from Leicester City, the
seven Leicestershire local authorities will be in a position to agree how it will be
Page 158Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019apportioned through the adoption of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or a
Statement of Common Ground (SoCG). Should this agreed distribution result in a
significantly greater amount of housing or employment development for the District than
set out in this Local Plan, this trigger commits the Council to the commencement of a full
or partial update of the Local Plan within six months. 
b. Publication of Local Plan for Leicester City evidencing unmet housing need
Where no MOU or SoCG has been adopted, this trigger commits the Council to a full or
partial review of this Local Plan within 12 months of the date of publication of Leicester
City’s Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation, providing that it is accompanied by robust
evidence of unmet housing need. This is a fall back position to ensure that work on a full or
partial update is commenced as soon as Leicester City has quantified any unmet need
through its publication Local Plan, in the event that the Leicestershire local authorities
have no agreed apportionment of such unmet need at that time. 
c. Monitoring identifies that specific trigger points have been met
Specific trigger points, which could initiate a partial or full review of the Local Plan, are set
out for relevant key policies in Appendix K Monitoring framework . Where monitoring
(including consideration of performance as measured by the Housing Delivery Test)
indicates that the trigger point has been reached, or will be reached in the near future, the
Council will commence a full or partial update of the Local Plan.

13 Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby
13.1 Introduction
13.1.1 Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby are settlements adjoining the built up area of
Leicester, referred to as the Leicester Principal Urban Area (PUA). They are suburbs that
have grown up over time centred on the historic cores of Scraptoft and Thurnby, both of
which have Conservation Area status. The settlements benefit from access to local
services and facilities within the village centres, but also to a wide range of higher order
retail, health, education and cultural services in the wider Leicester area. There is also
access to employment opportunities within the PUA. Some bus services to Leicester are
available for residents. 
13.1.2 The Leicester PUA, including these settlements, is at the top of the District’s
settlement hierarchy reflecting this relative ease of access to a wide range services and
facilities. The Core Strategy 2011 sought to ensure that development within these
settlements safeguarded their identity. Since 2011 just over 300 dwellings have been built
and outstanding residential commitments stand at about 650. When built out this
committed housing will impact on the separation between Scraptoft village and built
development to the south. 
13.1.3 Given its sustainable position on the edge of Leicester and land availability, as
evidenced through the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment, 2016, the Local
Plan allocates a Strategic Development Area (SDA) on land north of Scraptoft (Policy
SC1). As well as meeting local needs, the delivery of 1,200 dwellings on this allocation
could help to meet any potential unmet need arising from other local authorities within the
Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area (HMA). The Scraptoft North SDA will
involve the relocation of the Scraptoft Golf Course to a location south east of Houghton on
the Hill, as well as the potential replacement of the Local Nature Reserve with a Local
Wildlife Site in a slightly different location. No further housing development (beyond
existing commitments) is planned within Bushby or Thurnby.
13.1.4 The Leicester/Scraptoft/Bushby Green Wedge defined in Policy GD7 Green
Wedges  will ensure the continued separation of Scraptoft village from Leicester whilst
protecting the Thurnby Brook valley slopes as urban development extends eastwards and
providing public access along public rights of way and the disused railway line.
Opportunities to improve public access and recreation in the Green Wedge within the SDA
will be taken as part of the master planning process. 
Page 161Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019SC1 Scraptoft North Strategic Development Area

Action Plan priority habitats; and
y.creation of an area of publicly accessible open space immediately to the north of
Scraptoft Brook, the design of which shall enhance the ecological value of this
part of the site, whilst also creating a setting to help maintain the distinct identity
of the existing Scraptoft village. The future management and maintenance of this
open space shall be agreed through a planning application, in accordance with
Policy GI2.
4.Land to the east of Houghton on the Hill, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated
for a replacement golf course subject to the following criteria:
a.the layout does not sever or severely disrupt the public right of way network;
b.a satisfactory access is provided and there is capacity in the local road network
to accommodate traffic generated by the development;
c.the location and design of the buildings and the landscaping of the course
minimise visual impact upon the surrounding open countryside;
d.all built facilities proposed are related to the use of the land for the proposed golf
activities in nature and scale;
e.details of the course construction are submitted with the planning application;
and
f.light spillage from any proposed lighting installations is minimised. 
 
13.2.1 Scraptoft North is located immediately to the north of Scraptoft and on the eastern
edge of the Leicester urban area. Part of the site is currently occupied by the Scraptoft
Golf Course, which would be relocated to a replacement site at Houghton on the Hill in
accordance with the criteria in part 4 of the policy. 13.2 SC1 Explanation
13.2.2 The site provides good access to a range of employment, retail and community
facilities within Scraptoft itself, Hamilton and the wider Leicester urban area and is well
placed to help to meet both housing needs arising from Harborough District and to help
meet potential unmet housing needs from elsewhere within the Leicester and
Leicestershire HMA. 
Page 164Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201913.2.3 The site provides the opportunity to create a sustainable extension to Scraptoft,
providing approximately 1,200 homes and associated community infrastructure and green
infrastructure.
13.2.4 The development will be guided by the preparation of a comprehensive masterplan
prepared by the promoter in advance of and supporting an application, the preparation of
such will include a period of public consultation. The masterplan should be prepared in
such a way to enable it to be easily adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document.
Further guidance on masterplan requirements is set out in Appendix L Masterplanning
requirements . These include phasing which should take account of the 'trigger points' in
Policy SC1 identifying when elements of infrastructure are required. If a different phasing
is sought, then this will need to be justified with reference to viability or other relevant
considerations. 
13.2.5 The SDA will provide a range of house types and sizes to meet housing needs,
including affordable homes and may provide self-build plots and specialised housing. Housing
13.2.6 The development will provide community facilities to help meet the day-to-day
needs of its residents. The location of the primary school will be informed by public
consultation as part of the master-planning process. The community hall could be new or
the enhancement of an existing facility in accordance with the requirements set out in the
Community Facilities Study refresh, 2017. Open space is likely to include provision of a
park containing natural and semi-natural greenspace and a Local Wildlife Site focused
upon the Scraptoft Brook.Community facilities
13.2.7 The development should make the most of the opportunities for high quality walking
and cycling routes and high frequency bus services to nearby facilities and employment
opportunities. The site is well connected to a number of existing bus services passing near
the site. The use of any new and existing bus services will be maximised through a
combination of measures. Highways and Transportation
13.2.8 A number of existing cycle routes run near the site and could be extended and
improved to connect to the development and widen cycling opportunities. Of particular
importance is the provision of a safe and attractive cycle route across Hamilton Lane to
Hamilton College and to connect with the existing cycle route on Keyham Lane West.
13.2.9 Whilst the site design will maximise the opportunities to walk and cycle, there will
still be a need for new roads within the development. The points of access into the site will
be from Hamilton Lane and Beeby Road. A central spine road will run approximately east
and west through the development between these access points, providing a focal point
and ease of access to all parts of the development.
Page 165Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201913.2.10 A Transport Assessment will be submitted to accompany any planning application
for the new development. It is anticipated that this will include an analysis of the existing
highway and transport network including strategic traffic modelling and reflect the
outcomes of the South East Leicester Transport study, 2017 as appropriate in order to
forecast future impacts. This work will also explore opportunities for sustainable travel and
identify green travel initiatives as well as presenting a strategy for public transport
provision and identifying any off-site highway improvements required to mitigate the impact
of traffic originating from the development. A financial contribution towards appropriate off-
site highway improvements identified through the South East Leicester Transport Study-
Stage 2, 2017 may also be required.
13.2.11 The development should maximise the opportunities provided by much of the site's
current use as a golf course by retaining as far as possible the existing vegetation and tree
planting. The masterplan shall include a detailed assessment to identify the most suitable
and important specimens and groups of trees to be retained in order to maintain the
mature landscape setting. The existing strong vegetation and treed boundaries to the north
of the golf course significantly limits views from the wider landscape to the north and north-
east. It will be important to retain and enhance this boundary treatment. Site proposals
should incorporate planting of locally appropriate, native tree, shrub and herb species. Environment
13.2.12 The south eastern part of the site is currently designated as the Scraptoft Local
Nature Reserve. However, the site has not been managed as a nature reserve and is
currently grazed by horses. Evidence shows that the north-eastern parts have declined in
value, but that parts to the south and west have value as a herb-rich grassland-scrub
mosaic. Development of the site would require the de-declaration of the Local Nature
Reserve, but the retention and improved management of the best part of this grassland will
form the basis of a larger area of restored and created species-rich grassland habitat,
which, together with improvements to the wildlife value of the Scraptoft brook corridor and
creation of wetlands and other habitats, will compensate for the loss of part of the existing
species-rich grassland and scrub. The process for de-declaration, including the relevant
consultation, is being undertaken in parallel with the Local Plan and future planning
applications. 
13.2.13 Most of the site was previously designated as the Leicester/Scraptoft Green
Wedge. While most of the Green Wedge is not publicly accessible, part of it it does prevent
the merging of Leicester and Scraptoft. There is now a need to amend the boundaries of
the Green Wedge designation to accommodate the SDA and meet housing needs. The
Green Wedge designation is therefore amended to exclude the majority of the SDA that
does not have public access, but retain the Green Wedge designation on the area south of
new Romney Crescent, west of Hamilton Lane and north of Scraptoft Lane. This will retain
the role of the Green Wedge in preventing the merging of Leicester and Scraptoft, guide
the form of development, provide a green 'lung' into the neighbouring urban areas and
Page 166Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019enhance its recreational role, including the provision of public open space, which could
include formal sports pitches, subject to no adverse impacts on the Green Wedge function.
Compensating Green Wedge designation is also proposed in Policy GD7. 
13.2.14 The site is currently occupied in part by the Scraptoft Golf Course, which would be
relocated prior to development of the site. A site to the east of Houghton on the Hill has
been identified for the relocation of the golf course. This site is intrinsically linked to the
development of the Scraptoft North Strategic Development Area and as such is likely to be
released for development in conjunction with the SDA. Golf Course

14.1 Introduction
14.1.1 Market Harborough is the main settlement in the District, located in the far south on
the border with Northamptonshire. It is an historic market town with a Conservation Area
covering the town centre and providing the backdrop to a wide range of shops, services
and facilities. The town is relatively self-contained with a good range of employment
opportunities and good public transport links. The town is served by a railway station on
the Midland Mainline providing regular services to London and Leicester and beyond, and
there are bus services connecting the town with urban centres and surrounding rural
areas. The opening of a new hospital in the town early in 2017 has enhanced access to
health services for the local population. 
14.1.2 Since 2011 there have been just over 1,000 dwellings completed in Market
Harborough and there are almost  2,000 outstanding housing commitments. This high level
of commitments reflects the fact that the Core Strategy 2011 identified Market Harborough
as the main focus for development within the District and set out the principles for a
strategic development area (SDA) to the north west of the town. With planning permission
in place for 1,500 homes (and associated development) at the SDA, completions are
already coming forward and the site is due to be built out over the next 10 years. A new
road linking the north of the town to the west will be delivered as part of the scheme,
providing an element of relief to the town centre. 
14.1.3 Whilst Market Harborough benefits from a partial bypass, the adverse impacts of
traffic on the town, particularly the centre, are of growing concern to residents and
businesses. Future housing growth and changing employment needs mean that the
pressure on the town’s roads will continue to grow. In recognition of this, the Market
Harborough Transport Strategy, 2016, led by Leicestershire County Council, contains a
number of proposed measures to help deal with traffic around the town, including junction/
traffic signal improvements, enhanced walking/cycling facilities, public transport
improvements, lorry weight restrictions and a possible relief road. 
14.1.4 Traffic is just one of the constraints taken into account in determining the level of
development to be directed to the town in the Local Plan. Others include safeguarding the
landscape setting, preventing coalescence with neighbouring settlements, avoiding areas
of flood risk, safeguarding employment land and the limited availability of potential housing
land (evidenced through the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment, 2016). 
14.1.5 Designated as a Sub-Regional Centre in the settlement hierarchy, Market
Harborough remains a good location for development and the continued prominence of the
town is an important element of the spatial strategy for the District. However, its constraints
and high level of housing commitments have been taken into account in arriving at a
suitable development strategy for the town. As a result the Local Plan sets out a target of
Page 169Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019at least 1,078 dwellings (in addition to completions and commitments) to 2031, to be
delivered on 3 sites (Policies MH1 Overstone Park , MH2 East of Blackberry Grange and
MH3 Burnmill Farm ). 
14.1.6 Alongside housing provision, the Local Plan aims to improve the sustainability of the
town by providing suitable land to support business needs. It allocates 24 hectares of
employment land across 3 sites to support business growth. These comprise land at
Airfield Farm originally identified in the SDA Master Plan 2013 (Policy MH4), an extension
to the existing Airfield Business Park close to the SDA (Policy MH5), and land at Compass
Point Business Park which formed part of a previous allocation (Policy MH6). Several
employment areas around the town are also afforded protection from potential loss to
other uses, particularly housing, through Policy BE3 Existing employment areas . 
14.1.7 Growth in the town’s population and changing spending habits will also impact on
the types of shops and other facilities needed in the town centre. In order to accommodate
changing requirements, sites are allocated in the Plan to support retail and other town
centre uses in Policy RT1 Provision of new retail uses  in Policy RT4 Tourism and leisure .
Development of these sites presents opportunities to enhance the town's heritage assets
and their setting. 
Page 170Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019MH1  Overstone Park
1.Land at Overstone Park, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for the
development of about 600 dwellings. Development that complies with other relevant
policies and meets the following requirements will be permitted:
a.proposals to be guided by a masterplan, to be subject to consultation in advance
of a planning application;
b.two points of vehicular access to the site from Kettering Road, and pedestrian
and cycling access to Braybrooke Road and to the development to the west of
the site;
c.land for a 2 form of entry primary school within the site, or a proportionate
contribution towards education provision;
d.a mixed use local centre to include local retail facilities, healthcare services and
community facilities;
e.necessary highways works and sustainable transport measures to ensure safe
access into the town centre and onto the A6 including by pedestrians and
cyclists;
f.a financial contribution fairly and reasonably related to the development to
mitigate the impact of the scheme, where the impacts of the development taken
cumulatively with other schemes would have a significantly adverse effect on the
transport network;
g.identification and mitigation of any contaminated land;
h.archaeological and ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation,
including protection of trees subject to a tree preservation order throughout the
site;
i.an integrated approach to surface water drainage and multifunctional
greenspace, including sensitive treatment of the run-off to the River Jordan, and
appropriate management of surface water run-off during construction and in
perpetuity;
j.provision of open space and recreational facilities across the site, including along
the southern boundary close to the railway to protect residents' amenity, on the
western boundary to connect to existing open space, and on the eastern
boundary to form a landscaped edge to the countryside;
k.a layout and design that is shaped by a landscape and visual impact
assessment, that enhances the connection with the rest of the town, and that
promotes a sense of place; and
l.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing for each development
parcel to have regard to Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide.
Page 171Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201914.2 MH1 Explanation
14.2.1 Overstone Park is situated to the south east of Market Harborough town centre.
The site is well located to access the existing town centre and work places and was judged
to be suitable and deliverable within 10 years in the Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment (SHLAA), 2016. 
14.2.2 The development will be guided through the preparation of a comprehensive
masterplan prepared by the promoter in advance of and supporting an application. Further
guidance on masterplan requirements is set out in Appendix L Masterplanning
requirements . 
14.2.3 The site relates well to the built up area of Market Harborough and is accessed
from Kettering Road. Two points of access are required to Kettering Road for vehicles,
with further walking and cycling connections to both Braybrooke Road to the south, and
existing residential development to the west of the site required to increase sustainable
transport access into the town. The Landscape Character Assessment, 2009 has identified
the site as having mainly areas of high or medium high capacity for development, whilst a
number of trees on the site are protected through tree preservation orders. The size of
development is large enough to justify delivery of a new primary school as part of the
infrastructure provision.
14.2.4 The key constraints for the site include:
•the treatment of the connectivity to the A6 by-pass and access into Market Harborough
town centre, with suitable mitigation required as outlined in the Market Harborough
Transport Strategy, 2017;
•the treatment of the views and run-off to the River Jordan; and
•the treatment of the boundary with the Midland Mainline railway line to the south of the
site, including relevant noise mitigation. 
14.2.5 The Market Harborough Transport Strategy 2016 sets out 18 recommendations for
transport mitigation measures within and around Market Harborough. These include
mitigation measures for capacity/congestion improvements, changes to the network and
traffic routing, sustainable transport initiatives, safety improvements, traffic management
improvements, HGV controls and highway maintenance. A table of mitigation measures is

1.Land at east of Blackberry Grange off Northampton Road, as shown on the Policies
Map, is allocated for the development of about 350 dwellings. Development that
complies with other relevant policies and meets the following requirements will be
permitted:
a.proposals to be guided by a masterplan covering this site and the adjacent
employment allocation (Policy MH6), to be subject to consultation in advance of
a planning application;
b.two points of access to the site, including a direct access from Northampton
Road via the employment site allocated in Policy MH6;
c.necessary highways works and sustainable transport measures, including
pedestrian and cycle access within the site and to the Brampton Valley Way, the
leisure centre and the town centre;
d.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing for each development
parcel to have regard to Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide;
e.a financial contribution fairly and reasonably related to the development to
mitigate the impact of the scheme, where the impacts of the development taken
cumulatively with other schemes would have a significantly adverse effect on the
transport network;
f.identification and mitigation of any contaminated land;
g.archaeological and ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation,
including enhancement of biodiversity along the watercourse and the Brampton
Valley Way;
h.an integrated approach to surface water drainage and multifunctional
greenspace, with improvements to the small watercourse to the south east of the
site, green links to the Brampton Valley Way, and appropriate management of
surface water run-off into the River Jordan during construction and in perpetuity;
i.provision of open space and recreational facilities across the site, including to the
western boundary close to the existing and proposed employment site to protect
residents' amenity, to the eastern boundary to connect to the existing Brampton
Valley Way, and to the southern boundary to form a landscaped edge to the
countryside; and
j.a layout and design that is shaped by a landscape and visual impact
assessment, that protects views from key points within the site towards the
Brampton Valley Way and that enhances the connection with the rest of the town
and promotes a sense of place.
14.4.1 The land East of Blackberry Grange is situated to the south of Market Harborough
town centre. The site is located within reach of local services and employment. The
SHLAA, 2016 identifies the site as suitable and deliverable over 6-15 years.14.4 MH2 Explanation
Page 174Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201914.4.2 The development will be guided through the preparation of a comprehensive
masterplan prepared by the promoter in advance of and supporting an application. Further
guidance on masterplan requirements is set out in Appendix L Masterplanning
requirements . 
14.4.3 The site is at the edge of Market Harborough accessed from the Northampton
Road, adjacent to both residential and employment uses. There are local services,
including the leisure centre, doctors' surgery and local shops within easy access. The
Market Harborough Landscape Character Assessment for Market Harborough, 2009,
identifies the site as having medium/high capacity for development. The site is also
adjacent to the Brampton Valley Way, which is part of National Cycle Route 6, providing
opportunities for sustainable travel choices to and from the site. 
14.4.4 The key constraints for the site include the need for careful treatment of an
unnamed watercourse that is a tributary of the River Jordan, including a flood risk
assessment, the potential for increasing the congestion that occurs on the Northampton
Road into the town centre, particularly at peak times, and the treatment of the views
towards the Brampton Valley Way.
14.4.5 The Market Harborough Transport Strategy 2016 sets out 18 recommendations for
transport mitigation measures within and around Market Harborough. These include
mitigation measures for capacity/congestion improvements, changes to the network and
traffic routing, sustainable transport initiatives, safety improvements, traffic management
improvements, HGV controls and highway maintenance. A table of mitigation measures is
set out in Policy IN2.

1.Land at Burnmill Farm, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for the
development of up to 128 dwellings. Development that complies with other relevant
policies and meets the following requirements will be permitted:
a.access to the site to be provided from Kingston Way;
b.a financial contribution fairly and reasonably related to the development to
mitigate the impact of the scheme, where the impacts of the development taken
cumulatively with other schemes would have a significantly adverse effect on the
transport network;
c.archaeological and ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation;
d.retention and improvement of existing hedgerows and trees, particularly at the
northern boundary of the site, with any replacement of and additional provision
using native species;
e.an integrated approach to surface water drainage and multifunctional
greenspace, with appropriate management of surface water run-off during
construction and in perpetuity;
f.provision of open space and recreational facilities across the site, including along
the southern boundary to protect residents' amenity and allow access for existing
residents, and on the northern and eastern boundaries to form a landscaped
edge to the countryside;
g.a construction traffic management plan, including the proposed routing of
different sizes of construction vehicles which seeks to maximise use of the
existing farm track for construction traffic, to be submitted to and approved by the
Local Planning Authority;
h.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing to have regard to
Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide; and
i.a layout and design, including the ridge height of dwellings to the northern
boundary, that is shaped by a landscape and visual impact assessment, and that
respects:
i.the openness of the landscape and the scarp slope to the north;
ii.the relationship with the Grand Union Canal; and
iii.the views from the land to the north of Market Harborough and from Great
Bowden into the site.
14.6.1 Burnmill Farm is situated to the north of Market Harborough town centre. It is
identified for an allocation of up to 128 dwellings. The site is on the northern edge of
Market Harborough but within reach of a range of services and facilities. The Strategic14.6 MH3 Explanation
Page 177Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA), 2016 identified the site as deliverable
over 6 to 10 years. The site assessment identified this as a suitable location for delivery of
the homes required in Market Harborough.
14.6.2 The site is accessed from Kingston Way in a residential area adjacent to the north
west edge of Market Harborough. The Market Harborough Landscape Character
Assessment, 2009 identifies that the site has medium to medium high capacity for
development and there are relatively few views into the site from surrounding highway or
public rights of way.
14.6.3 The key constraint for the site are the treatment of the northern boundary, where the
land slopes steeply away to the Grand Union Canal. In particular the Landscape Character
Assessment identifies that roof lines should avoid breaking the skyline from the north.
14.6.4 The Market Harborough Transport Strategy 2016 sets out 18 recommendations for
transport mitigation measures within and around Market Harborough. These include
mitigation measures for capacity/congestion improvements, changes to the network and
traffic routing, sustainable transport initiatives, safety improvements, traffic management
improvements, HGV controls and highway maintenance. A table of mitigation measures is

Page 185Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201914.12  MH6 Explanation
14.12.1 A wider site was previously allocated for employment use in the adopted
Harborough District Local Plan, 2001 under saved Policy MH/5 Land East of Northampton
Road. This allocation relates to a part of the previous allocation, known as Compass Point
Business Park, but excludes the area already developed for employment and residential
use. It has been reduced in size (compared to the potential site detailed in the Options
Consultation Paper, 2015) to also exclude land now forming part of the site allocated in
Policy MH2 East of Blackberry Grange  for housing development. 
14.12.2 The site is located opposite the recreation ground and Leisure Centre to the south
of Market Harborough, in an edge of centre location. It is considered to provide a suitable
extension to the Compass Point Business Park and an opportunity to consolidate this
prestigious commercial gateway development on the southern approach to the town from
the A14. The northern part of the site is close to the Brampton Valley Way, a footpath and
cycleway on the line of the former Market Harborough to Northampton railway line. The
site is split into two parcels of land straddling the existing spine road serving the business
park. 
14.12.3 The site is allocated for a mix of B1a/b and B1c uses appropriate in a residential
area as follows:
•B1a/b - (approximately 3.2ha (11,200sqm floorspace)); and
•B1c - (approximately 1.7ha (7,150sqm floorspace)). 
14.12.4 The Market Harborough Transport Strategy 2016 sets out 18 recommendations for
transport mitigation measures within and around Market Harborough. These include
mitigation measures for capacity/congestion improvements, changes to the network and
traffic routing, sustainable transport initiatives, safety improvements, traffic management
improvements, HGV controls and highway maintenance. A table of mitigation measures is
set out in Policy IN2.

Page 187Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915 Lutterworth
15.1 Introduction
15.1.1 Lutterworth is a market town located in the south west of the District, just off
Junction 20 of the M1. Its position close to the County border means that that it is
influenced as much by Warwickshire and Northamptonshire as it is by Leicester and
Leicestershire. The town has a wide range of services, facilities and shops, most of which
are focused around its historic core, a designated Conservation Area. Employment
opportunities are concentrated to the north of the town centre (to the east of Leicester
Road) and at Magna Park, a large strategic distribution/logistics development located to
the west of the town. The historic village of Bitteswell, a Conservation Area, lies close to
the north western edge of Lutterworth. 
15.1.2 Lutterworth is influenced heavily by transportation, with the M1 and A5 on either
side of the town and the A426 passing through the town centre then linking to the M6 to
the south. The impact of through traffic, particularly HGV movements, is of local concern
and the town centre is an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). There is a long standing
desire within the local community for a by-pass to resolve traffic issues. Lutterworth’s
central location and access to major routes means that it is within the ‘Golden Triangle’ in
terms favourable locations of logistics operations. As a result there are opportunities for
further strategic storage and distribution warehousing in the Lutterworth area. 
15.1.3 Since 2011 the town has seen over 400  dwellings built and there are about 350
dwellings with planning permission. Many of these dwellings are to the north of the town in
accordance with the Core Strategy, 2011. However, more recently a development of 250
dwellings was allowed on appeal in the south east corner of the Area of Separation (as
retained in the Core Strategy). 
15.1.4 Given its location, accessibility and level of services, Lutterworth is identified in the
Local Plan as a Key Centre and an appropriate location for significant housing and
employment development. Whilst few suitable housing sites were identified adjacent to the
existing built up area, land for a Strategic Development Area (SDA) to the east of the M1
was assessed as developable through the Strategic Housing Land Availability
Assessment, 2016 and selected through the process described in Chapter 3. 
15.1.5 The East of Lutterworth SDA (Policy L1) is proposed to deliver 1,260 dwellings to
2031 (and further dwellings to 2036), 10 hectares of general employment land, and 13
hectares for storage and distribution. This new neighbourhood will have its own local
community facilities but will be well connected to the existing town centre and will provide
additional support to Lutterworth in its role as a Key Centre. The SDA will provide a new
spine road linking the A426 to the north of Lutterworth to the A4304 to the east of the M1
Junction 20, via a new bridge over the motorway. This road is predicted to remove some
through traffic from the town centre thus helping to improve air quality. 
Page 188Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915.1.6 In addition to the employment land to be provided as part of the SDA, land to the
South of Lutterworth Road/Coventry Road (Policy L2) is allocated for industrial/commercial
development and several employment areas around the town are afforded protection from
potential loss to other uses, such as housing, through Policy BE3  Existing employment
areas . Magna Park’s role as a leading regional and national distribution hub is maintained
and safeguarded in Policy BE2 Strategic distribution . Whilst additional strategic distribution
development is already committed through two planning permissions, Policy BE2 allocates
land for additional strategic distribution floorspace on a site to the north and west of Magna
Park. 
15.1.7 The Local Plan also redefines the Lutterworth, Bitteswell and Magna Park Area of
Separation (Policy GD6), taking into account completions and commitments. This is
particularly important in safeguarding the setting and character of Bitteswell and in
protecting residential amenity. 
Page 189Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019L1 East of Lutterworth Strategic Development Area
1.Land to the east of Lutterworth, as identified on the Policies Map, is allocated as a
Strategic Development Area (SDA).
2.This new neighbourhood will be developed comprehensively in accordance with a
masterplan, including delivery and phasing arrangements, to be prepared in
accordance with masterplanning requirements set out in Appendix L  and informed
by key design principles, an independent design review and community
consultation. This masterplan will be incorporated into a Supplementary Planning
Document and/or an outline planning application and supporting section 106
agreement.
3.The masterplan will guide the  creation of a high quality sustainable urban extension
to Lutterworth and  an attractive environment for living, working and recreation. It will
address and overcome the issue of community severance resulting from the
presence of the M1, to create a sustainable urban extension which is permeable
and well-connected to Lutterworth via legible walking and cycling routes with good
natural surveillance. It will provide for:
 Housing  
a.about 2,750 dwellings of which about 1,260 dwellings will meet housing
requirements in the plan period and the remaining dwellings will meet
requirements after 2031, all to be located east of the M1 and north of the A4304;
b.affordable and specialist housing in accordance with Policies H2 and H4;
c.a mix of house types, including serviced plots for self-build and custom homes,
as appropriate, and housing standards in accordance with Policy H5;
d.a range of housing densities, with higher densities located near the proposed
local centre and along the spine road and lower densities towards the rural
boundaries to the north, east and south of the site;
Business and employment 
e.13 hectares of storage and distribution (B8) uses on land to the south of the
A4304, subject to:
i.access from the A4304 that is separate from that to the rest of the SDA to the
north; and

approaches to design, scale and layout of development. Green space, such as a
community park, should be provided in the southern part of the site together with
height restrictions on buildings in the southern part of the site, in order to protect

5.Appropriate traffic management and public realm improvements in Lutterworth town
centre to facilitate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists, particularly across
High Street will be agreed and provided for through the planning application and
accompanying agreements.
6.Following completion of the spine road, in partnership with County Highway
Authority and the SDA promoters, the Council will develop traffic management
measures that remove or minimise the passage of heavy goods vehicles through
the centre of Lutterworth, as part of the implementation of an effective air quality
mitigation strategy for the Air Quality Management Area in Lutterworth town centre.
15.2.1 The Strategic Development Area (SDA) on the land to the east of Lutterworth
provides the opportunity to develop a well-planned extension to Lutterworth with its own
sense of place while also being well integrated and connected to Lutterworth and providing
some facilities such as the community park that will also benefit the existing residents of
the town. 15.2 L1 Explanation
15.2.2 In order that the SDA is developed in a way that complements and enhances the
town and does not become an unwelcome accretion, it should be in accordance with a
masterplan that is produced with the full engagement of the existing community of
Lutterworth and which has the support of the population through a consultation process as
part of either a Supplementary Planning Document, a Neighbourhood Plan or a planning
application. 
15.2.3 The masterplan will be the basis for creating a sustainable, high quality extension to
Lutterworth and an attractive built and green environment in which people will be happy to
live, work and socialise. It will bring with it important new infrastructure, including transport,
green infrastructure, primary schools and community facilities, as well as providing
sustainable access and additional patronage to the town of Lutterworth, thus maintaining
its role as a Key Centre. Further guidance on masterplan requirements is set out in
Appendix L Masterplanning requirements. These include phasing which should take
account of the 'trigger points' in Policy L1 identifying when elements of infrastructure are
required, in accordance with a phasing plan agreed with the Local Planning Authority. 
Page 193Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915.2.4 The SDA will create a sustainable urban extension to Lutterworth, essentially
mirroring the existing town to the west of the M1, with new development to the east of the
M1. The SDA is expected to be sustainable at the neighbourhood level and to provide for
the day-to-day needs of its residents, including provision of primary schools, a local centre
and employment within the site. However, its residents will need to access facilities within
the existing part of Lutterworth for secondary schools, leisure and health facilities as well
as for wider employment opportunities. Whilst the distances from the new development to
the town centre and other facilities are suitable for walking and cycling, the presence of the
M1 running north and south between the existing town and the new development creates a
form of severance between the two parts of the community. The masterplan must address
and overcome this; ensuring the new development is well-connected and integrated with
the existing town. 
15.2.5 Ensuring integration and connection with Lutterworth will be achieved, in part
through the creation or substantial upgrading of existing routes across the M1, resulting in
a minimum of 5 connections, 4 of which are expected to be bridges, and 1 is expected to
be a route under the M1. All of which will provide dedicated, lit, legible, safe and direct
walking and cycling routes. These connections across the M1 will be part of a wider
network of legible routes, both within the SDA site itself and continuing through into the
existing town and providing routes to key facilities within Lutterworth.
15.2.6 The SDA will also provide a new road, linking the A426 to the north of Lutterworth to
the A4304 to the east of M1 junction 20 via a new bridge over the M1. This new ‘spine
road’ is predicted to remove some of the through traffic currently travelling through the
centre of Lutterworth, helping to improve air quality. The southern part of this spine road,
and not Gilmorton Road, should be used as the main means of accessing the site, both for
residents and construction traffic, until such time as the link across the motorway from the
north is in place. 
15.2.7 Development at Lutterworth also locates housing growth where employment
opportunities will occur, namely the South West Leicestershire Growth Area (as identified
in the Leicester and Leicestershire Economic Partnership's Strategic Economic Plan,
2015) and the M1 and A5 corridors. 
15.2.8 The proposed site lies to the east of Lutterworth and the M1 motorway route. The
hamlet of Misterton lies directly to the south of the site. The western boundary is
predominantly defined by the eastern M1 motorway embankment with the majority of the
site located north of the A4304, Lutterworth Road. However, an area to the south of the
A4304 is proposed for storage and distribution, while land is included to the east of the M1
in order to enable an attractive pedestrian route through open space into Lutterworth town
centre and potentially (subject to technical assessment) provide for a new cemetery.
Further land is allocated to the west of the M1 to accommodate the likely route of the road
linking the A426 to the proposed motorway bridge, with a rather larger area safeguarded
for this purpose in order to ensure that enough land is available to accommodate potential
changes in design of this route. 
Page 194Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915.2.9 The justification for selecting a strategic spatial option involving the SDA on land to
the east of Lutterworth has been described in Chapter 3 under Policy SS1 The spatial
strategy . The promoters have prepared a Vision Statement setting out their proposals. The
vision's objectives are to:
• deliver a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable urban extension that is effectively
integrated into its locale, and which accommodates a balanced mix of homes, employment
generating development, as well as the new facilities and services required to support a
new neighbourhood;
• support economic growth and local employment in order to maintain Lutterworth’s
competitive edge. The East of Lutterworth SDA will provide land for a variety of high quality
employment uses, with excellent access to the M1 and associated local road network;
• maximise accessibility for all in the widest sense, ranging from walking and cycling at a
local level, to the delivery of an enhanced, high frequency bus service between the site
and Lutterworth;
• deliver a spine road to alleviate pressure upon Lutterworth High Street and the Air Quality
Management Area (AQMA);
• create a coherent set of proposals which protect and enhance the site’s landscape
character and visual amenity, improve connectivity and enhance and protect the
biodiversity and ecological resources of the site with new integrated multi-functional Green
Infrastructure;
• deliver an exemplar scheme which demonstrates the highest standards of urban design,
and incorporates best practice in sustainable construction and the use of renewable
energy technologies; and
• protect and enhance the existing network of mature hedgerows, hedgerow trees and
woodland associated with the River Swift and its tributaries as a framework for Green
Infrastructure which will successfully assimilate distinctive neighbourhoods of new
development.
15.2.10 The Vision Statement includes an indicative plan setting out a broad distribution of
uses and the layout of roads and open spaces, including a Swift Valley Community Park.
However this will be subject to further refinement as part of partnership working with the
site promoters on the development framework and masterplan, and may change in detail. 
15.2.11 The SDA will provide for a range of housing needs, providing affordable homes,
self-build plots, specialised care homes and a range of housing types and sizes. While
there is a capacity plan submitted as part of the Vision Statement, the location and
capacity of each 'plot' (development parcel) may change as the development framework is
prepared. This framework will include consideration of the under-grounding or diversion ofHousing 
Page 195Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019the high voltage power line where it currently cuts through proposed housing areas. It will
also include consideration of appropriate net densities in different parts of the site in
pursuance of criterion 3(d) of this policy, within the overall proposed net density of 38
dwellings per hectare and taking account of key design principles, an independent design
review and community consultation. Higher densities will be expected to the west of the
site, maximising opportunities for connectivity with Lutterworth and reducing reliance on
the private car. Housing will not be permitted to the south of the A4304 or to the west of the
M1 as part of the SDA. 
15.2.12 The proposed 23 hectares of employment land will create about 2,500 new jobs
and provide substantial local employment opportunities. While the location of 10 hectares
of employment development within the main area of the SDA to the north of the A4304 is
still to be finalised through work on the development framework/masterplan, it is currently
shown between the M1 and the northern end of the spine road. The remaining 13 hectares
will be to the south of the A4304 near to Junction 20 of the M1. Employment
15.2.13 The site to the south of the A4304 is for business uses within Use Class Order B8.
The masterplan is encouraged to focus the development of this area towards provision for
warehousing in units of less than 9,000sq.m. to cater for the non-strategic element of the
sector, not otherwise catered for on employment allocations at Lutterworth. Larger units
may be acceptable in exceptional circumstances, but strategic distribution (logistics) uses
are more appropriately catered for on sites forming an extension to or adjoining Magna
Park that meet the criteria in Policy BE2 Strategic Distribution and this site is likely to be
too small to accommodate such uses. Although the HEDNA, 2017 does not identify a need
for this quantity of B8 uses, its figures are not maxima and the development will provide
the cash flow needed to fund the road junctions to serve the SDA. This is considered
sufficient to justify its allocation. The site would be accessed directly from a new junction
with Walcote Road (A4304) and would be subject to a comprehensive scheme of advance
landscaping. 
15.2.14 The land to the north provides 10 hectares within Use Class Orders B1 and B2.
This location will be closer to residential development and therefore B1 is appropriate.
Both B1 and B2 uses generate higher employment per square metre of floorspace than B8
and so locating these uses here will maximise the opportunities for sustainable travel. On
the other hand B8 uses have significantly fewer employees per square metre and often
have 24 hour working, which is incompatible with residential amenity. 
15.2.15 The SDA offers the opportunity to provide a range of community facilities and
benefits, supplementing the existing provision in the wider area. These would be delivered
through an agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or
other legal agreement as appropriate. Overall the development of the site will include a
two primary schools and a neighbourhood centre containing shops and communityCommunity facilities 
Page 196Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019facilities. The Education Authority require that the first new primary school to serve the
SDA is opened by the September before completion of the 300th dwelling, or at a later
date, as agreed, should predicted pupil numbers suggest this is appropriate. 
15.2.16 A comprehensive network of green infrastructure is proposed including the
proposed Swift Valley Community Park (containing sports pitches), existing woodland, the
Misterton Marshes SSSI, a greenway through the site (but also extending beyond the site
boundaries by connecting into the wider Green Infrastructure network), allotments and a
new cemetery. Within each housing development parcel there would be equipped play
space and a multi use games area. 
15.2.17 The existing leisure centre in Lutterworth will reach the end of its life during the
plan period and would in any event be unlikely to be adequate to serve the expanded
population. A contribution will therefore be sought towards a new leisure centre, which
could be, in full or in part, in the form of land within the community park or elsewhere. 
15.2.18 The primary access will connect the A426 north of Lutterworth with the A4304 east
of Junction 20, in the form of a clearly legible spine road. This spine road will be a single
two lane district distributor road designed to serve the new development while also
facilitating some relief to through traffic within Lutterworth town centre. It is currently
proposed as a 7.3 carriageway width with a 30/40 mph speed limit. The spine road will be
constructed in its entirety, including the bridge over the motorway before the completion of
1,250 dwellings, projected to be in 2030/31, unless otherwise agreed by the Council in
response to currently unforeseen circumstances. Highways and Transportation 
15.2.19 Further access points off Gilmorton Road to serve the residential development to
the north east of the site are also proposed. The transport assessment work has
highlighted the potential for increases in traffic through Gilmorton village to the north east
of the SDA. If traffic monitoring shows flow increases that result in queuing within the
village, measures such as traffic calming would need to be implemented in Gilmorton
village to discourage through movements. 
15.2.20 New or upgraded junctions will be provided at: 
•A4304 Lutterworth Road/'spine road' - signalised junction;
•A4304 Lutterworth Road/access to B8 employment site - signalised junction;
•A426 Leicester Road/'spine road' - roundabout or signalised junction;
•M1 Junction 20 - signalisation of all approach arms and widening of circulating lanes;
•A4303/A426 Rugby Road ('Frank Whittle roundabout') - necessary improvements; and
•A426 Leicester Road/Bill Crane Way - signalised junction plus pedestrian crossing. 
15.2.21 The SDA will result in initial increases in traffic in Lutterworth town centre of
10-17% in the peak hours. However, once the spine road is complete traffic flows through
Page 197Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019the town centre are forecast to reduce by between 24% and 34% (depending on direction)
on the A426 south of the Gilmorton Road junction. This reduction could be increased by
the introduction of traffic management measures in the town centre. 
15.2.22 A comprehensive footway and cycleway network will incorporate existing paths,
and include new links both within the development and the surrounding settlement. This
network will provide clear, direct links along traffic-free routes that will encourage
sustainable modes of transport. In addition a primary pedestrian and cycle route will be
provided by enhancing the existing right of way that crosses the M1 from the western
boundary directly to Lutterworth town centre.
15.2.23 The SDA will be accessed via new bus routes and services, eventually using the
Gilmorton Road bridge over the M1 to connect with the town centre. Bus stops will need to
be provided along the spine road and along estate roads. A frequent bus service, in the
order of one every 20 minutes should be provided. Further details on how best to do this
will need to be investigated as work on the SDA progresses.
15.2.24 Lutterworth town centre is one of just two Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA)
in the District. This is primarily as a consequence of the volume of traffic including HGVs
using the A426. Development of the site provides the potential to deliver a spine road
which can deliver significant environmental benefits to the town centre, as well as
improving the health and well being of residents. The policy requires noise and air quality
mitigation measures for proposed dwellings adjoining the M1, and no moderate or worse
adverse impact upon air quality within the Lutterworth Air Quality Management Area. A
moderate adverse impact is defined by Land-Use Planning & Development Control:
Planning For Air Quality May 2015 b(v1.1) EPUK & IAQM (or a successor document).
Following completion of the spine road, traffic management measures and public realm
improvements will be developed to remove or minimize the passage of HGVs through the
centre of Lutterworth and to facilitate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists between
the SDA, town centre and key facilities within Lutterworth.
15.2.25 The development will maximise the opportunities provided by the existing natural
environment and footpath network and provide a comprehensive network of green
infrastructure, integrating with existing provision within and around the site and
assimilating the site into its landscape setting. Environment 
15.2.26 Misterton Marshes Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a 6.9 hectare area of
wetland located on the site. The SSSI supports notable hedges and wild flowers, and
providing a breeding habitat for birds and other species. Developed on the alluvial deposits
of the River Swift, the marshland will be sensitive to changes in hydrology. In addition to
Misterton Marshes and the River Swift, the site has a good network of hedgerows and
mature trees. Thornborough Spinney provides a key feature within the site and should be
retained as an integral part of the development. 
Page 198Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915.2.27 A detailed assessment will be considered as part of the development framework
and masterplan and will identify the most suitable and important specimens and groups of
trees to be retained in order to maintain ecological value together with the mature
landscape of the area and assimilate the SDA sympathetically into the surrounding
countryside. The SDA will incorporate sensitive management of these areas in accordance
with the requirements of Natural England, the Environment Agency and Leicestershire
County Council as Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) to ensure that measures for
protection and enhancement are effective. 
15.2.28 The River Swift flows in a westerly direction through the site. There are also two
unnamed watercourses and two minor brooks, which are all tributaries to the River Swift.
The majority of the site is located in Flood Zone 1 and is at a low risk to flooding. Areas
adjacent to the River Swift and its tributaries are located in Flood Zones 2 and 3.
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDs) should be provided to ensure that there is no
increase in flood risk arising from the development. Surface run off and attenuation ponds
will also be required to respond to topography and sub-catchments. The water course
network, ponds and SuDs have the potential to integrate with a comprehensive green
infrastructure network, thus creating an attractive green environment for the future
community. This will also protect views of St Leonards Church (Misterton, Grade II*) and
Misterton Bowl Barrow (Scheduled Monument) within their settings and provide an
opportunity to enhance access to and public enjoyment of such views.
15.2.29 To ensure that all these benefits are delivered, it will be important to ensure that
the development is delivered in its entirety and in a comprehensive manner, albeit over an
extended time period. Various trigger points for the delivery of infrastructure are given in
the policy but may be agreed otherwise in response to currently unanticipated changes in
circumstances. Implementation 
15.2.30 Development should take place comprehensively in accordance with a
masterplan, including delivery and phasing arrangements. The Council will work
proactively in partnership with the site promoters and the local community to formulate the
masterplan which could form the basis for a Supplementary Planning Document or a
Neighbourhood Plan policy and/or a planning application. The Council is committed to
ensuring consultation with the communities of Lutterworth, Misterton, Walcote, and
Gilmorton in the preparation of these documents. 
15.2.31 In allocating the east of Lutterworth SDA, the Council is promoting the use of a
Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) to secure the delivery of essential infrastructure. The
CPO may be required to secure land for the motorway bridge and associated link road and
junction on the A426 as part of the spine road. The landowners' refusal to sell this land has
the potential to delay the later phases of development coming forward, although most of
the development within the plan period could be delivered without the link and motorway
Page 199Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019bridge. The Council is therefore promoting appropriate CPO powers to ensure that delivery
of the site is timely and associated risks are minimised. The promoters are entering into an
indemnity agreement to cover the costs of the CPO and of acquisition itself. 
15.2.32 In response to concerns raised about the development 'stalling' before completion
of the spine road, the promoters point to the indemnity agreement and comment that they
are committed to delivering a development that achieves the key economic, social and
environmental benefits that are dependent on the entire highway infrastructure including
the motorway bridge and completion of the spine road. They will commit through a Section
106 agreement to meeting the full cost of off-site infrastructure through a Section 278
agreement. The Council, in partnership with the promoter, will explore the potential for
seeking funding through the new Housing Infrastructure Fund to accelerate essential
infrastructure and housing delivery. The promoters also point out that at the trigger point
for delivery of the completed spine road and motorway bridge there will still be over 50% of
the dwellings to be delivered and that the building of these will be necessary to recoup the
upfront infrastructure costs associated with major road junctions and other matters, such
as utilities, drainage and education.

15.4.1 This site will provide new employment land for Lutterworth prior to the provision to
be made as part of the East of Lutterworth SDA (Policy L1). 15.4 L2 Explanation
15.4.2 The site is located to the south of Lutterworth beyond the  limits of built
development, and is in the ownership of Leicestershire County Council. The site is
greenfield arable land bounded by the A4303 (Coventry Road) to the north, the established
Fairacres Travelling Showpeople site to the south, the River Swift and open countryside to
the west and open countryside to the east. Close by to the west and north of the A4303 is
situated the Magna Park strategic distribution site.  
Page 202Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201915.4.3 As noted in the Strategic Employment Land Availability Assessment, 2017, the site
lies within a Mineral Consultation Area and contains a small area of historic landfill at the
eastern edge of the site, both considerations in developing an appropriate site layout and
design. The site lies close to, but outside of, the area of  separation between Magna Park,
Bitteswell and Lutterworth, within an area considered to have a high  to medium capacity
for development in terms of landscape character. The main urban edge of Lutterworth is
situated to the north of the site across the A4303. 
15.4.4 An outline planning application (16/01288/OUT) has been approved for
development on the allocated site to include up to 10,000sq.m employment floorspace,
split between:
•B1a office use (2.2ha, or 7,700sqm);
•B1c light industrial employment uses (0.6ha, or 2,300sqm);
•70 full size allotments with associated parking. 
15.4.5 The allotments would replace the current provision at De Verdon Road which is
expected to cease in 2019 and will be accessed from the Coventry Road roundabout. The
proposal is considered by the Highways Authority to require junction, access and signalling
improvement works to mitigate traffic impacts, which should take into account the
proposed Strategic Development Area East of Lutterworth (Policy L1).

16.1 Introduction
16.1.1 Fleckney is a large village close to the edge of the District’s northern border, located
9 miles south of Leicester and 9 miles from Market Harborough. Its village centre offers a
good range of shops and services to meet everyday needs and there are bus services to
Leicester and Market Harborough. Businesses on the Churchill Way Industrial Estate
provide employment opportunities. The Grand Union Canal runs to the west of village and
Fleckney Brook through the centre.
16.1.2 Based on its level of services and facilities, Fleckney was first identified as a Rural
Centre in the Core Strategy, 2011 and it remains so in the Local Plan. Compared to the
other larger Rural Centres (The Kibworths and Great Glen), very few housing completions
have taken place since 2011. However, there are housing commitments for almost 450
dwellings. 
16.1.3 Fleckney is considered a sustainable settlement and the Strategic Housing Land
Availability Assessment, 2016,  identified several deliverable sites, some of which now
have planning permission. The Local Plan identifies a minimum target of 130 dwellings (in
addition to completions and commitments) for the village to 2031 and this is expected to
be met through Policy F1 Land off Arnesby Road . 
16.1.4 To enable employment opportunities to grow alongside new housing and to
reinforce the role of the existing industrial area, the Local Plan allocates Land off
Marlborough Drive (Policy F2) for industrial and commercial development. Furthermore
Policy BE3 Existing employment  areas seeks to protect Churchill Way Industrial Estate
and nearby Victoria Works from loss to other uses such as housing.
Page 205Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019F1 Land off Arnesby Road
1.Land off Arnesby Road, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for the
development of about 130 dwellings. Development that complies with other relevant
policies and meets the following requirements will be permitted:
a.access to the site to be provided from Arnesby Road;
b.necessary highways works and sustainable transport measures in accordance
with an approved transport assessment and travel plan, including integrating
public footpaths crossing the site into the design and layout of the site linking to
Sustrans Cycle Network Route 6;
c.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing for each development
parcel to have regard to Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide;
d.identification and mitigation of any contaminated land;
e.archaeological and ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation;
f.an integrated approach to surface water drainage and multifunctional
greenspace, incorporating the Fleckney Brook, the various ponds and smaller
watercourses, with appropriate management of surface water run-off during
construction and in perpetuity;
g.enhancement of biodiversity and water quality along the Fleckney Brook and at
field ponds;
h.retention and improvement of existing hedgerows and trees, particularly at the
boundary of the site and around the existing pond, with replacement and
additional provision using native species;
i.additional landscaping to the western and northern boundaries of the site and
retention and enhancement of the existing public right of way to the eastern edge
of the site; and
j.provision of open space and recreational facilities across the site, including on
the eastern boundary close to the public right of way and to protect residents'
amenity, and on the western and southern boundaries to form a landscaped
edge to the countryside.
16.2.1 The site is situated to the west of Fleckney, accessed from the Arnesby Road. It is
identified for approximately 130 dwellings. The site is well located for local services and
facilities in Fleckney village centre and was judged to be deliverable over 0 to 5 years in
the SHLAA, 2016. The SHLAA identified the location as suitable to contribute to the
housing requirement in Fleckney.16.2 F1 Explanation
16.2.2 The site relates well to the village centre of Fleckney and is close to local services.
The Harborough Rural Centres Landscape Character Assessment and Landscape
Capacity Study, 2014 has identified the site as having medium capacity for development.
Page 206Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201916.2.3 The key constraint relative to this site is the treatment of the land close to the
stream, which is identified as having medium low capacity for development according to
the Landscape Character Assessment, 2014 and also has issues relating to flooding. This
area is identified as most suitable for the provision of local multifunctional green space and
the sustainable drainage (SuDs) design should integrate with the watercourses and ponds
to ensure the best practice approach to surface water and flood treatment.

1.Land off Marlborough Drive, Fleckney, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated
for Use Classes B1c, B2 and non-strategic B8 (industrial and commercial
development). Development that complies with other relevant policies and meets
the following requirements will be permitted:
a.access, including by sustainable modes, to be taken through the existing
industrial estate at Marlborough Drive;
b.necessary highway works and sustainable transport measures, as identified by a
transport assessment and travel plan, in order to ensure highway, cyclist and
pedestrian safety;
c.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing for each development
parcel to have regard to Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide;
d.identification and mitigation of any contaminated land;
e.archaeological and ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation;
f.adequate and appropriate landscaping to screen the development from the
residential area to the north west, including noise attenuation measures to
protect the amenities of houses at Cobwells Close;
g.layout and design to be in keeping with the scale, character and appearance of
the existing industrial estate, to be sympathetic to the rural character of the
surroundings and to incorporate adequate amenity space;
h.provision of any required flood mitigation measures as identified by a flood risk
assessment, together with a sustainable drainage system (SuDs) and the
appropriate management of surface water run-off during construction and in
perpetuity; and
i.provision of a suitable lighting scheme to minimise light pollution.
16.4.1 The site is allocated for industrial and commercial development to help meet Policy
BE1 Provision of new business development . It comprises a field approximately 3.0
hectares in size to the east of the existing industrial estate which has been categorized as
a Key Employment Area in the Council’s Existing Employment Areas Review, 2012. It is a
flat open arable field with hedges and mature trees around its perimeter.16.4 F2 Explanation
16.4.2 The site is located approximately 0.5 miles from the centre of Fleckney. The existing
Churchill Way Industrial estate is adjacent and is occupied by a mix of B1, B2 and B8
uses. To the north and east of the site is open countryside. To the west is a residential area
whose amenities should be protected. The development of the site would form a logical
extension to the existing industrial estate and would represent a new defensible edge to
the built up area of Fleckney. 
Page 208Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201916.4.3 The site would contribute towards meeting the need for economic development land
as identified in the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing and Economic Development
Need Assessment (HEDNA), 2017. It would also help to widen employment opportunities
in the District's rural areas outside the key settlements and has the ability to contribute to
sustainable economic growth and respond to market trends. 
16.4.4 The site was reviewed in the Strategic Employment Land Availability Assessment,
2017 and no physical or environmental site constraints were identified. It was assessed as
being suitable, available and developable within the plan period, being accessible by
sustainable modes of transport and adjacent to an existing Key Employment Area. 
16.4.5 The site is allocated for a mix of additional employment floorspace totalling
12,000sqm as follows:
•B1c/B2 uses - (approximately 1.5ha (6,000sqm floorspace));
•non-strategic B8 (in units 9,000sqm gross floorspace or below) uses - (1.5ha (6,000sqm
floorspace)).

Page 209Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201917 The Kibworths
17.1 Introduction
17.1.1 The Kibworths straddle the A6 lying some 7 miles north west of Market Harborough
and 9 miles south east of Leicester city centre. The village comprises 2 parishes, Kibworth
Beauchamp and Kibworth Harcourt. The cores of both parishes have Conservation Area
status. The village has a good range of shops, services and facilities, including a
secondary school, along with some employment opportunities. There are bus services to
Leicester and Market Harborough, but its railway station closed in 1968. The village of
Smeeton Westerby lies close to the southern edge of the village. The A6 is a barrier to
movement across the settlement and has a detrimental impact on local air quality leading
to the declaration of an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in 2017. 
17.1.2 Based on their level of services, The Kibworths was first identified as a Rural
Centre in the Core Strategy 2011 and it remains so in the Local Plan. It is the largest Rural
Centre and has seen significant housing development since 2011, primarily as a result of
the build-out of a large allocation dating from the 2001 Local Plan. There have been
almost 450 dwellings completed since 2011 and there are planning commitments for
approximately 450 further homes. 
17.1.3 Given the level of completions and the high number of residential commitments
already in place, there is no minimum target set for The Kibworths in the Local Plan.
However, in order to improve the village’s sustainability by ensuring that land for business
growth is available to accompany housing development, land south and west of Priory
Business Park (Policy K1) is allocated for business, light industrial and retail development,
reflecting the site’s extant planning consent. 
Page 210Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019K1 Land south and west of Priory Business Park
1.The area of land south and west of Priory Business Park, Kibworth Harcourt, as
shown on the Policies Map, is allocated for a mix of business, light industrial and
retail development (Use Classes B1a, B1b, B1c, B2 and A1). Development that
complies with other relevant policies and meets the following requirements will be
permitted:
a.access, including by sustainable modes, to be through two access points off
Wistow Road and Warwick Road;
b.necessary highway improvements and sustainable transport measures as
identified by a transport assessment and travel plan;
c.provision of a new cycleway to create convenient access to the development and
the extension of the footway on the south side of Wistow Road to the Wistow
Road/Warwick Road roundabout in order to connect the development to
Kibworth Beauchamp village centre and to ensure highway, cyclist and
pedestrian safety;
d.parking provision, including cycle parking, and servicing for each development
parcel to have regard to Leicestershire County Council Highway Design Guide;
e.identification and mitigation of any contaminated land;
f.respect for and integration with features of archaeological interest as identified
by an archaeological assessment of the site and a heritage impact assessment;
g.ecological assessment of the site and required mitigation, including the retention
of important hedgerows/trees and an attenuation pond, to create opportunities
for biodiversity enhancement;
h.provision of formal and informal public open space, and green infrastructure
linkages;
i.the inclusion of adequate and appropriate landscaping including noise
attenuation measures: along the railway corridor, to the south and west of the
site to minimise adverse landscape impact, and to screen and protect the
residential amenity of existing properties on 'Kibworth Meadows';
j.layout and design that sympathetically integrates into the rural character of the
surroundings and has buildings no higher than two storeys at a maximum height
appropriate in relation to adjoining properties and the wider surroundings;
k.provision of any required flood mitigation measures as identified by a flood risk
assessment, together with a sustainable drainage system (SuDs) and the
appropriate management of surface water run-off during construction and in
perpetuity; and
l.provision of a suitable lighting scheme to minimise light pollution.
Page 211Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 201917.2 K1 Explanation
17.2.1 The site is allocated for business and light industrial development to help meet
Policy BE1 Provision of new business development and retail development to help meet
the needs of the growing population. It comprises agricultural land approximately 9.0
hectares in size to the south and west of the existing Priory Business Park, which was not
assessed in the Council’s Existing Employment Areas Review, 2012. The majority of the
site comprises arable fields with some areas of plantation woodland existing hedgerows
and an attenuation pond. 
17.2.2 The site is located on the north eastern side of The Kibworths approximately 1km
by road from the centre of Kibworth Beauchamp. The existing Priory Business Park is
adjacent and is occupied by a mix of B1, B2 uses. To the north the site is bordered by
Wistow Road, to the west of the site is open countryside and to the south and west is the
Midland Mainline. Recent housing development lies to the east; the amenities relating to
which should be protected. The development of the site would form a logical extension to
the existing business park and would represent a new defensible edge to the built up area
of The Kibworths contained by existing rail and highway infrastructure. 
17.2.3 The site would contribute towards meeting the need for economic development land
as identified in the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing and Economic Development
Need Assessment (HEDNA), 2017. Along with the retail development element, it would
also help to widen employment opportunities in the District's rural areas outside the key
settlements and has the ability to contribute to sustainable economic growth and respond
to market trends. 
17.2.4 The site was reviewed in the Strategic Employment Land Availability Assessment,
2017 and no physical or environmental site constraints other than being adjacent to a
contaminated land consultation zone as identified through criterion 1.e of the policy. It was
assessed as being suitable, available and deliverable within 0-5 years, being accessible by
sustainable modes of transport and adjacent to a Rural Centre. 
17.2.5 The site is allocated for a mix of B1a, B1b, B1c, B2 and A1 uses with B1c/B2 uses
expected to predominate. There is an extant outline planning permission for development
on the site for: 
•B1b/B1c/B2 commercial/industrial uses (up to 11,368sq.m);
•B1a office use (up to 882sq.m); and
•A1 retail use (up to 294sq.m). 
17.2.6 Provision is expected to be in accordance with the approved site phasing plan and
indicative master plan within a developable area of approximately 5.7 hectares and is
envisaged to meet market demand. Ideally units will be flexible in size with the potential for
neighbouring units to be joined together to cater for the needs of starter and expanding
businesses.

Location
Harborough District is a largely rural area situated in the East Midlands region and lies
within the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area (HMA). It covers an area of
238 square miles of rural south and east Leicestershire. The District borders Warwickshire
(and the West Midlands) to the west, Northamptonshire to the south and Rutland to the
east. Harborough also adjoins five other Leicestershire planning authorities, namely
Charnwood, Melton, Oadby and Wigston, Blaby, and Leicester City.
Fig. A.1  in Chapter 1 provides some geographical context of Harborough District's location
within the Leicester and Leicestershire Housing Market Area.
Harborough District has a growing population, increasing by 11.5 % between 2001 and
2011 to 85,382. This is slightly above the total Leicester and Leicestershire Housing
Market Area (HMA) resident population increase, which rose by 10.2% to 980,328 over the
same period. Harborough District experienced the second highest percentage increase in
resident population across the HMA. Please see Fig. D.1  below.Population
 
Fig. D.1 Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland HMA Residential Population  Variation between Census 2001 and
Census 2011 data
Page 226Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019The District’s population is most concentrated in the larger settlements of:
•Market Harborough, Lutterworth and Broughton Astley (47%);
•Billesdon, Great Glen, Houghton on the Hill, Husbands Bosworth, The Kibworths,
Fleckney and Ullesthorpe (22%); and
•Scraptoft, Thurnby and Bushby (6%)
The remaining 25% of residents are dispersed across approximately 80 smaller rural
villages, as shown in Fig. D.2 .
 
Fig. D.2 Population Distribution by Settlement  (%)
The 2011 Census highlights small but significant changes to the population structure in the
District since 2001:
•the population of school age children and students increased by almost 11%;
•strong evidence of an ageing population with 17.8% of the population aged 65 and over
compared to 15.7% in England with some rural settlements having even higher
populations of older people; and
•the mean age of the District’s population increased from 40 in 2001 to 42 in 2011.
The 2014 sub-national population projections from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
estimate a population of 88,008 in 2014 and forecast an increase to 99,814 in 2031, which
Page 227Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019equates to an 8.2% increase. The bulk of this increase is expected to come from in-
migration to the District from within the UK. There is also expected to be an increase in the
number of people aged 65 and over, with an increase to almost a quarter (24.3%) of the
population of the District being within this group by 2024. 
The District has a very low ethnic mix, with 92.8% of the population giving white-British as
their ethnic group in the 2011 Census. The next largest group is identified as Asian/British
Asian (Indian) at 2.2%. The Census data indicates that 62.5% consider themselves to be
Christian. The next highest category is no religion at 24.6%.
Over 50% of the District's 16 and over population are married and just over a quarter are
single (never been married or never registered a civil partnership).
The 2011 Census identified 34,898 households in the District. This is an increase of 18%
since 2001. Households
Household tenure statistics for the District captured by the 2011 Census reveal a number
of key changes when compared with the 2001 Census:
•‘Social rented other' increased significantly from 522 to 2,442 households (following
transfer of Council stock to Seven Locks Housing Association in December 2007);
•‘Owned: with mortgage or loan’ dropped by 8% to 13,849;
•‘Private rented: private landlord or letting agency’ increased by 132% from 1,524 in
2001 to 3,540 in 2011; and
•‘Shared ownership’ tenures almost doubled from 226 in 2001 to 414 in 2011. 
However, there has also been a 25% increase in property that is owned outright,
demonstrating some resilience to the challenging economic climate and the above
average proportion of residents aged 65 and over in the District.
Accommodation types across the District reflect the area’s rural and low density
characteristics and the relative affluence of residents compared with UK averages, please
see Fig. D.3  below: 
•48% occupy detached houses, compared with 23% nationally;
•7% occupy purpose-built flats, compared with 16% nationally; and
•15% occupy terraced houses, compared with 25% nationally.
Page 228Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019 
Fig. D.3 Harborough Accommodation Types compared to UK Average
Families with dependent children make up 23.7% of households, significantly higher than
the England average of 19.3%. Households of one or more adults all aged 65 and over are
also more common with 23.3% of households falling into this category, compared to the
England average of 20.5%. There is, however, a lower percentage of single person, under
65, households in the District (13.3%) compared to the England average (17.9%). There
are 29% of households with no adults in work including unemployed and retired
households.
Market Harborough and the key centres of Lutterworth and Broughton Astley provide the
most services and facilities for the District.Services and facilities
Market Harborough has a wide range of services that make the town attractive for
residents and visitors. The services available in Market Harborough support its continued
status as the principal town within the District and its designation as a sub-regional centre.
Basic services include primary schools, GP surgeries, library, public houses, food shops
and post offices. Other services set Market Harborough apart as the biggest provider in
the District. These include two secondary schools, one of which offers A-levels, Brooke
House independent school and college, several dentists and a wide range of other medical
services including physiotherapists and osteopaths. The town centre benefits from a large
Page 229Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019market hall, refurbished library and museum, a theatre, and a wide retail offer including
national chain stores and a large number of independent retailers, for which the town is
well known locally. In addition, there is a leisure centre with pool, a range of sports
facilities, a variety of parks, a cemetery, various churches and day nurseries/pre-schools.
Lutterworth is a smaller town than Market Harborough, with less than half the population,
but it benefits from a good range of services, although on smaller scale than Market
Harborough. These include secondary schools, a leisure centre, which includes a
swimming pool, and a good range of shops. Lutterworth’s extensive range of services and
facilities supports its continued designation as a key centre.
Broughton Astley is a large village with all key services and many other amenities,
including a secondary school, which lead to it being designated a key centre. However, it is
recognised as not enjoying the range of shops and services expected for the size of its
population. The Broughton Astley Neighbourhood Development Plan (made 2014) aims to
improve services and facilities for the community. In 2014 the Council granted outline
planning permission for a mixed use development comprising:
•up to 310 residential units;
•a food store and petrol station;
•a community leisure and sports building;
•a medical centre;
•employment units; and
•a variety of areas for formal and informal sport and recreation.
The Principal Urban Area (PUA) is a term used to describe the continuous built up area of
Leicester, including the Leicester City Council area and adjoining settlements in
neighbouring districts. In Harborough District it consists of the settlements of Thurnby,
Bushby and Scraptoft that are within easy reach of Leicester’s services and facilities.
Rural centres across the District (The Kibworths, Fleckney, Great Glen, Billesdon,
Ullesthorpe, Husbands Bosworth and Houghton on the Hill) all have at least four of the six
key services (general practitioner, library, public house, primary school, food shop, post
office).
Selected rural villages  are served by a minimum of two of the six key services. They are
Bitteswell, Church and East Langton, the Claybrookes, Dunton Bassett, Foxton, Gilmorton,
Great Bowden, Great Easton (with Bringhurst), Hallaton, Lubenham, Medbourne, North
Kilworth, South Kilworth, Swinford, Tilton on the Hill and Tugby. With the exception of
Medbourne and Tilton on the Hill, these villages all have a primary school.
Page 230Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Health
The health of Harborough residents is generally good. The life expectancy for men is 80.8
years and 84.5 years for females, this is higher than the England average of 79.5 and 83.2
respectively. Many of the indicators of health measured by Public Health England show
Harborough performing better than the England average.
According to the 2011 Census, a total of 8,983 (10.5%) of Harborough residents provided
unpaid care, which is in line with the national average. Of these, 2,420 (2.8%) provide 20
or more hours of unpaid care per week. This is slightly below the national average of 3.7%.
The District has no major hospitals, but has a number of smaller cottage hospitals offering
outreach services from the main hospitals in Leicester. In 2017 the old cottage hospital in
Market Harborough closed and was replaced by a new, purpose built facility to the north of
the town. The new hospital is on the site of the previous St Luke's hospital and provides an
integrated health hub including primary care, general practice, outpatient and diagnostic
facilities. Lutterworth has the Fielding Palmer hospital. These hospitals offer clinics and
some forms of palliative care. Residents use larger hospitals in Leicester, Kettering, Rugby
and Coventry for A&E and more serious illnesses.
There are GP surgeries in Market Harborough, Lutterworth, Broughton Astley, Bushby,
Billesdon, Fleckney, Great Glen, Husbands Bosworth, The Kibworths and Ullesthorpe. 
Harborough District is made up of a variety of settlements. The vernacular style varies
across the District, with stone houses in many villages close to the Northamptonshire
boundary, but red brick in other parts of the District. Many of the villages have
Conservation Areas defined around their historic core. There are 62 Conservation Areas in
total.Built environment
The District has a rich and varied heritage with 1,250 listed buildings, 60 scheduled
monuments and 6 registered parks and gardens. There are important sites related to the
civil war in the area around Market Harborough. The District also enjoys a varied industrial
heritage, with links to corsetry and food, as well as the Grand Union Canal. In addition
Lutterworth has close links to Sir Frank Whittle, the designer of the jet engine, who worked
in Lutterworth during the 1930s and 1940s. Market Harborough and Lutterworth are
important market towns with each having an historic core and character.
The District's central location provides access to regional and national transport links. Transport and communications
Road connections:  The motorway network is accessible via the M1 which passes
through the west of the District , while the M6/A14 junction is located in the south west of
the District. Other main routes in the District include the A6, A5, A47, A426, A5199, A4304,
and A508 which between them provide links to Leicester, Northampton, Kettering, Corby,
Rugby and Peterborough.
Page 231Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Car ownership: 88% of the District's households have access to at least one car.
Travelling by car is the predominant method of getting to work for Harborough residents.
Rail connections:  Market Harborough is located on the  East Midlands Trains rail route,
with frequent links to London, Leicester and other stations north and south. It also provides
connections at St.Pancras International for forward services to continental Europe via
Eurostar, the north Kent coast and the south coast via the Thameslink service. Between
2017 and 2019 the station and railway line through it will be subject to major upgrading.
Airports: East Midlands Airport and Birmingham Airport are within 50 miles of much of the
District. There is a rail link to Luton Airport from Market Harborough, which is about 60
miles away.
Bus services:  There are bus services connecting various villages to larger settlements
that are provided by Hinckley Bus, Arriva and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT). For
more details of bus services throughout Harborough District please see the website www.
choosehowyoumove.co.uk at the following link www.choosehowyoumove.co.uk . Public
transport provision in rural parts of the District is limited, with a number of the smaller
villages and hamlets having no bus service.
Access to reliable super-fast broadband: Most rural areas still receive below the
Government target of 25mbps (megabytes per second). Several settlements throughout
the District have benefited from the implementation of ‘Superfast Leicestershire’ and other
locally-driven projects. These projects aim to bring superfast fibre broadband (above 24
mbps) to as many premises in Leicestershire as possible. See the link  www.
superfastleicestershire.org.uk  for updated information.
Estimates from Nomis (official labour market statistics) for 2015 indicate that there were
around 89,300 residents in Harborough District of which some 54,200 are of working age
(16 – 64 years). Of those that are of working age:Employment and economic activity
•47,400 residents aged 16 - 64 years are economically active (in work or looking for
work);
•45,800 residents aged 16 - 64 years are in work;
•1,100 are unemployed individuals aged 16 – 64 years; and
•3,400 residents of working age are retired.
The District consistently has low levels of unemployment and over 50% of the working
residents are employed in professional occupations as managers, professionals and
associate professionals. 
•11.7% of the workforce are process plant and machine operatives or in ‘elementary
occupations’;
•11.1% are working as ‘managers, directors and senior officials’;
Page 232Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019•10.7% are ‘skilled trade persons’;
•22.6% are in 'professional occupations'; and
•17.4% are in ‘associate professional and technical occupations’.
The number of people with qualifications is generally higher than the UK average for all
levels of qualification. However, these statistics mask the variation between residents who
work outside of the District and those who work within the District. The most prevalent
occupation amongst Harborough’s workplace population is ‘elementary occupations’, at
20%. Please see Fig. D.4  below.

The difference between the resident and workplace skill base is also clearly illustrated
when income levels between the two groups are compared. The resident population earns
above the national average weekly income, whilst the District’s workplace population earns
below the national average weekly income. Please see Table D.16  below.

Full-time workers £552.50 £498.00 £520.80Table D.16 Census 2011 Gross Weekly Earnings
Compared with the national average, the District has higher levels of employment in the
following key sectors:
•agriculture/forestry/fishing and textile manufacturing;
•wholesale and retail trade;
•vehicle sale and repair;
•transport and storage;
•mining and quarrying;
•chemical manufacturing; and
•administrative and support services.
Census data indicates that industries under-represented, compared with national
averages, are:
•financial and insurance activities;
•information and communication;
•electricity and gas;
•steam and air conditioning supply; and
•arts, entertainment and recreation activities.
The average distance travelled to work by Harborough residents is 17.5km, compared with
a national average of 14.5km. Almost two thirds of the Harborough workforce travels to
work by car or van and use of public transport is low at 3%. Working from home accounts
for 8% of the workforce (compared to 5% nationally), this is a marked increase since 2001
and the roll-out of high speed broadband to rural localities, which is currently under way,
may lead to a further increase in home-based working over coming years. The majority of
workers travel to Leicester, however, the west of the District sees inflows of workers
commuting from Hinckley and Bosworth and Nuneaton. Please see Fig. D.5  below.

Harborough District is predominately a rural area and will remain so. While there are no
national landscape designations, the District is made up of five broad landscape character
areas as defined by the Harborough District Landscape Character Assessment 2007.
These are listed below (see also Fig. D.6 below): Landscape and natural environment
•Laughton Hills with its distinct ridge line of rolling hills and steep slopes;
•Lutterworth Lowlands characterised by an open and relatively flat to gently rolling
landscape;
•Welland Valley which follows the gently meandering course of the river and its wide, flat
valley;
•High Leicestershire with its distinctive steep valleys, broad ridges, woodland areas and
network of small villages; and
•Upper Soar with its wide, open landscape with lack of substantial woodland.

The Rivers Welland and Avon form much of the District’s southern boundary and other
main rivers are the Soar, Swift, Sence and Eyebrook. The Leicester Line of the Grand
Union Canal is a particularly important landscape and cultural heritage asset. A prominent
feature of the canal in the District is the Grade II* listed Foxton Locks, which allowed boats
to travel up a 23 metre hill using a series of locks. It is at this point that a branch of the
canal splits off to Market Harborough. There are also a number of other important water
bodies, including the Eyebrook reservoir, Saddington reservoir and Stanford reservoir. The
water quality in the watercourses across the District is in need of improvement in order to
meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive, 2000. Many
watercourses are impacted by run-off from agricultural fields, with the attendant impact of
phosphates.
A number of watercourses in the District are prone to flooding during extreme weather
conditions. The River Welland, which flows through the centre of Market Harborough, is
particularly vulnerable. The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), 2009 found that less
than 10% of the District falls within Flood Zone 3, the highest risk of flooding. The majority
of the flood zones are in rural areas, so in general flood risk is not considered to be a
significant constraint on future development. However, the effects of climate change may
exacerbate flooding problems. There are areas in the District where changes in drainage
Page 236Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019could impact on the urban areas downstream. Leicester and Rugby are particularly
vulnerable and the District has a role to play in holding up rainfall from the watercourses
upstream of these places.
Like much of the East Midlands and Leicestershire, Harborough is relatively poor in
biodiversity and geodiversity terms. 1.21% of the District’s area is covered by Sites of
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) while a further 0.42% is covered by Local Wildlife Site
(LWS) designations. There are several SSSIs in the east of the District protecting the
remains of ancient woodland which are of high nature conservation, landscape and
historical importance. The District has one geological SSSI, the Tilton Railway Cutting. 
Harborough District’s carbon emissions in 2014 were 7.7 tonnes per person. This is a
decrease from 2013, when the figure was 8.1 tonnes per person. However, it is above the
average 7.0 tonnes per person for Leicestershire and the UK average of 6.3 tonnes per
person. Harborough District has the second highest emissions in Leicestershire. Please
see Fig. D.7  below.Environment
 
Fig. D.7 Harborough District Carbon Emissions Per Person  2005 to 2014
Page 237Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Transport is responsible for the highest proportion of the emissions, with 48.2% of the
total. Domestic energy use accounts for 24.5% and industrial and commercial uses for
26.6%. Approximately 0.6% of emissions are due to agricultural land use. Please see Fig.
D.8 below.
 
Fig. D.8 Harborough District Carbon Emissions by Sector  2014
Much of the District does not suffer from air quality problems. However, in the centre of
Lutterworth and on the A6 in The Kibworths traffic exhaust contributes to poor air quality.
This situation is being actively managed through the designation of Air Quality Monitoring
Areas (AQMAs) with the associated establishment of action plans to seek improvements to
the current levels.
In terms of waste reduction and recycling, the District is approaching the target to ‘recycle/
compost 58% of household waste by 2017’, as set out in the adopted Core Strategy 2011.
The overall recycling rate for Harborough in April 2014 to Mar 2015 was 57.5%.
There are several sites in the District producing significant renewable energy in 2016, and
several with planning permission to do so. There are two commercial scale wind farms,
Low Spinney at 8MW and Swinford at 22MW, in addition there is a further 1.2MW of wind
capacity in smaller scale developments. There are three field-based solar installations with
planning permission and a number of roof mounted schemes, including the photovoltaics
Page 238Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019on the Market Hall in Market Harborough. The total capacity is 6.4MW, of which 5.1MW is
at domestic installations. This equates to almost half of the homes in the District being
powered by renewables.

Page 247Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Appendix F  The settlement hierarchy
As background work to the identification of the hierarchy, settlement profiles for each of the
towns and larger villages within the District have been prepared. These profiles bring
together information relating to each settlement in order to understand how it functions, its
key characteristics, its level of services and facilities along with any specific local issues
and priorities that the community may have. Parish Councils were given the opportunity to
comment on the draft profiles and their comments were incorporated where appropriate.
Alongside this work an audit of the services and facilities available to all villages was
carried out. 
The settlement profiles and services/facilities audit work has been used to classify each
settlement in a hierarchy according to its relative sustainability. Settlements at the top of
the hierarchy are considered to be the most sustainable in terms of accessibility to
services, facilities, shops, employment opportunities and public transport provision. These
settlements are therefore the most capable of supporting further development whilst
meeting the everyday needs of their residents and thus minimising the need to travel.
Settlements towards the bottom of the hierarchy tend to be smaller, more rural and with
very few, if any, services and facilities. These settlements are considered relatively
unsustainable and therefore less suitable to accommodate future development, particularly
housing.
In order to identify the most sustainable rural settlements, the number of key services
accessible to the local population has been assessed. Those key services taken into
account are the presence of at least two of the following: food shop, GP surgery, library,
post office, primary school and public house. The existing size of the village and its
relationship with other settlements has also been taken into account. In particular adjoining
settlements that share a primary school within acceptable, safe walking distance have
been treated as composite Selected Rural Villages (Church and East Langton, the
Claybrookes, and Great Easton with Bringhurst), reflecting the guidance in paragraph 78
of the NPPF. 
As the categorisation of settlements has been based on existing service provision, the
level of services/facilities available to settlements will be continuously monitored. It is
possible that new services, such as a local shop, could be established in a village. Any
change in the level of services, which impact on the sustainability of a settlement, will form
part of the considerations taken into account in a future Monitoring and review of the Local
Plan and in the determination of planning applications. 
The tables D.18 to D.23 below provide a summary of the settlement hierarchy. Each layer
includes a definition, a list of settlements and a brief description of the approach to
development.

Definition Rural Centres are identified on the basis of the presence of least four of the six key
services (food shop, GP surgery, library, post office, primary school and pub) and a
minimum of 400 households. A village's relationship with larger settlements higher up
in the hierarchy has also been taken into account. Rural Centres are a sustainable
location for rural housing and additional employment, retail and community uses to
serve the settlement and the surrounding area.

Page 249Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Selected Rural Villages
Definition Selected Rural Villages are identified on the basis of presence of at least 2 of the 6
key services and a minimum of 100 households. Where neighbouring villages share a
primary school which is within acceptable and safe walking distance, they have been
grouped as joint Selected Rural Villages.

Approach
to
developmentSettlements suitable for rural development on a smaller scale than Rural Centres
reflecting their limited services and facilities. Development should be primarily in the
form of small-scale infill developments or limited extensions to help address
economic, social or community objectives. This could include schemes to enable
more social housing, small-scale market housing and development aimed at meeting
the needs of local people.Table D.22 Selected Rural Villages

growth and are covered by housing in the countryside policy. New housing will be
limited to housing to meet an identified need (either through a housing needs survey
or neighbourhood plan), housing to meet the needs of a rural worker, rural exception
sites, isolated homes in the countryside in accordance with NPPF paragraph 79, and
replacement dwellings. Table D.23 Other Villages and Rural Settlements

The National Planning Policy Framework defines a heritage asset as “A building,
monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance
meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest. Heritage
asset includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local planning
authority (including local listing).”
This list therefore features:-
1.Listed Buildings;
2.Conservation Areas;
3.Buildings at Risk;
4.Scheduled Monuments;
5.Registered Parks and Gardens; and
6.Locally-listed archaeological sites.
If a building is considered by the Secretary of State (for Culture, Media and Sport) to be of
special architectural or historic interest it will be included in a list of such buildings. Listed
buildings are classified into 3 grades: 1. Listed Buildings
•Grade I buildings are of exceptional interest.
•Grade II* buildings are particularly important buildings of more than special interest.
•Grade II buildings are of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them.
The District’s listed buildings are not set out here because the 1,342 entries listed by
Historic England may change during the period of the plan as properties are either lost or
new ones added to the list. It is possible to identify whether a building is listed, and hence
the description of the building and why it is listed, at the Historic England website by either:
•searching the map at https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/map-search?
clearresults=true  or
•searching by name, type, address, entry number or category at
https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/advanced-search?searchType=
nhleadvancedsearch  .
Councils may list other buildings as ‘locally listed buildings’. Inclusion on such a list may
result in additional guidance and control over development being available. At present
there are no locally listed buildings in Harborough District.

Historic England identifies, and places on its Heritage at Risk Register, those sites that are
most at risk of being lost as a result of neglect, decay or inappropriate development. The
Register is updated annually such that the current (2017) list of 6 sites in the district
(below – together with links to their descriptions) may well change during the plan period.

Page 264 Appendix J Biodiversity and geodiversity sitesAppendix K  Monitoring framework
Monitoring Framework
The purpose of this monitoring framework is to identify the key indicators that will be used
to monitor the delivery of the Local Plan Objectives (in Section 2.3) through measuring the
performance of related key policies. Although policies in the Plan will be subject to periodic
monitoring where this is practicable, as referred to in the Supporting Information table for
each policy, the key performance measures in the Framework will be monitored each year
and the results published in the annual Authority’s Monitoring Report. This is because the
key indicators cited cover matters critical to the overall performance of the Plan and the
delivery of sustainable development. 
For each objective, except for those which refer to neighbourhood planning, an indicator
with a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-Bound) target has
been specified with a performance trigger level set in relation to the target. No indicator
has been set for the Neighbourhood Planning Objective because the Local Plan has
already fulfilled the aim to set out a clear strategic policy framework for the preparation of
neighbourhood plans through the provisions of Policies SS1 The spatial strategy  and H1
New housing provision
For each indicator, if the policy delivery performance against the target is at the trigger
level, or worse, then a series of possible actions to remedy the poor performance will be
invoked and decisions taken as to which course of action to take. However, it may be that
the performance in a single monitoring year (most triggers apply annually) is atypical of a
longer term trend. 
Some of the trigger levels are expressly set to apply over several years or up to a
particular date in the plan period. However, in any event the first consideration in
assessing below target performance will be to try and identify the causes. It may be that
this will reveal one-off factors that are unlikely to be repeated in future; if so no further
action will be appropriate. If the recorded performance is indicative of more fundamental,
ongoing problems then consideration will be given to taking the other remedial actions
relevant to the indicator. The cited remedial actions are not intended to be exhaustive lists;
the opportunity may arise to pursue other actions, that cannot be presently foreseen.
The selected indicators directly relate to the intended outcomes arising from the Council's
use of the specified key policies, typically these outcomes will be developments granted
planning permission. However it should be appreciated that the instigation of these
development proposals and their subsequent implementation will, in most cases, depend
on decisions taken by private developers. 
Conditions in the wider national economy may, over the plan period, be such as to reduce
developer profitability and/or customer demand in ways which may make the delivery of
key policies particularly challenging. Nevertheless the implementation of the Local Plan is
Page 265Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019intended to be flexible with policies robust enough to be effective over changing economic
conditions. The selection of remedial actions to be used will be influenced by the prevailing
circumstance in the economy as a whole.
Use of the Monitoring Framework over a number of years will contribute to considerations
concerning a future review of the plan as referred to in Policy IMR1 Monitoring and review
of the Local Plan . Prior to then it may appropriate to produce guidance (such as
Supplementary Planning Documents) on the operation of the policies. The remedial
actions are listed alongside each indicator in the approximate chronological order of them
being considered for use (see table D.32, starting on the next page, for more details).

Page 280  Monitoring Framework Key IndicatorsAppendix L  Masterplanning requirements
Development of housing and employment sites identified in the Local Plan will be planned
through a comprehensive masterplanning process proportionate to the scale of
development. Preparation of masterplans will involve the active participation and input of
all relevant stakeholders, including the Council, landowners, developers, the local
community, service providers and other interested parties. Masterplans will be developed
in consultation with the Council prior to the submission of a planning application. Where
appropriate they may be adopted as Supplementary Planning Documents. 
Masterplans will be expected (proportionate to the scale of development) to:
1.create a strong sense of place, ensuring the proposed development makes a positive
contribution to local character and distinctiveness;
2.include an indicative housing layout and design code that reflect local distinctiveness
and create a distinctive environment, incorporating landmark features or points of focus,
such as public squares, pocket parks, prominent buildings, street trees and public art;
3.require high standards of urban design and architecture that respect the character of the
landscape and heritage of adjacent and nearby settlements and built development;
4.plan for integrated development, providing for a mix of housing that addresses the
range of local housing needs, and encourages community cohesion;
5.make effective use of the site through the application of appropriate densities in terms of
scale, height and massing, and its relationship to adjoining buildings and landscape;
6.propose appropriate boundary treatment that reflects the urban to rural transition;
7.reduce the need for car use and encourage sustainable modes of travel, including
provision for public transport, cycle routes, footpaths and bridleways;
8.create a network of permeable and interconnected streets and public spaces;
9.include measures to mitigate the traffic impacts of the proposed development on the
strategic and local road networks;
10.provide for timely delivery of physical infrastructure, including sewage connections and
fibre optic broadband;
11.ensure appropriate and timely provision of community facilities to serve the new
development (e.g. local shops, community halls, schools and health facilities); and
12.include a phasing and implementation plan.

Page 283Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Term Description
Development Plan
Document (DPD)Part of the Local Development Framework. Development Plan Documents
are prepared by local planning authorities and outline the key development
goals of the local development framework.
Development Plan Documents include the Core Strategy, Site-Specific
Allocations of land and, where needed, Area Action Plans. There will also
be an adopted proposals map which illustrates the spatial extent of policies
that must be prepared and maintained to accompany all DPDs.
All DPDs must be subject to rigorous procedures of community
involvement, consultation and independent examination, and adopted after
receipt of the inspector's binding report. Once adopted, development
control decisions must be made in accordance with them unless material
considerations indicate otherwise.

housing land availability. To maintain a five year supply there must be
enough land to meet the housing needs as laid out by the OAN figure.
Page 284Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Term Description
Flood Plain Land adjacent to a watercourse over which water flows, or would flow in
times of flood, but for the defences in place.
Flood Risk
Assessment (FRA)Flood Risk Assessment identifies all the sources of flood risk on a site and
the impact it has beyond, and identifies appropriate mitigations.
Flood Zone 1 Low probability: Land having a less than 1 in 1,000 annual probability of
river or sea flooding. Development sites in Flood Zone 1 that are over 1
hectare in size still require a flood risk assessment to assess potential
impact on other areas downstream.
Flood Zone 2 Medium probability: Land having between a 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 annual
probability of river flooding; or land having between a 1 in 200 and 1 in
1,000 annual probability of sea flooding. 
Flood Zone 3a High probability: Land having a 1 in 100 or greater annual probability of
river flooding; or land having a 1 in 200 or greater annual probability of sea
flooding.
Flood Zone 3b The functional floodplain: This zone comprises land where water has to flow
or be stored in times of flood. Local planning authorities should identify in
their Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRAs) areas of functional
floodplain and its boundaries accordingly, in agreement with the
Environment Agency.
General
Employment Area
(GEA)An existing office park, industrial estate, or larger individual employment
site sites generally fit for purpose for business use but may benefit from
upgrade or renewal.

and the processes which have formed these features throughout geological
time.
Green Corridor /
Wildlife Corridor/
GreenwayGreen corridors can link housing areas to the national cycle network, town
and city centres, places of employment and community facilities. They help
to promote environmentally sustainable forms of transport such as walking
and cycling within urban areas and can also act as vital linkages for wildlife
dispersal between wetlands and the countryside.
Green
Infrastructure (GI)The open environment within urban areas, the urban fringe and the
countryside which comprises of a network of connected, high quality, multi-
functional open spaces, corridors and the links in between that provide
multiple benefits for people and wildlife.
Green Wedge Green Wedges comprise the open areas around and between parts of
settlements, which maintain the distinction between the countryside and
built up areas, prevent the coalescence (merging) of adjacent places and
can also provide recreational opportunities.
Greenfield  Land  
and SitesSites which have not been previously developed (e.g. agricultural land,
parks, recreation grounds and allotments).

communities.
Major
DevelopmentThe NPPF defines major development as follows: For housing,
development where 10 or more homes will be provided, or the site has an
area of 0.5 hectares of more. For non-residential development it means
additional floorspace of 1,000m 2 or more, or a site of 1 hectare or more, or

Neighbourhood
Development
Plans (NDP)Neighbourhood Development Plans, introduced in the Localism Act 2011,
become part of the Local Plan and the policies contained within them are

local community.
Non-strategic
Storage and
DistributionCommercial buildings in B8 Class Storage and Distribution use (often
referred to as warehouses) as defined by the Town and Country (Use
Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) where the individual unit size is
9,000sq.m. gross floorspace or below. 
Objectively
Assessed Need
(OAN)Objectively Assessed Need (OAN), is an assessment of housing and
economic development need during a plan period based on evidence,
which is not constrained by policy considerations. It is derived from a range
of evidence, including population, household and economic growth
projections. 
Open Space All space of public value, including public landscaped areas, playing fields,
parks and play areas, and also including not just land, but also areas of
water such as rivers, canals, lakes and reservoirs, which can offer
opportunities for sport and recreation or can also act as a visual amenity
and a haven for wildlife.
Out-commuting The act of residents of Harborough District travelling out of the district for
work.
Outline Planning
Permissionhis type of planning application allows fewer details about the proposal to
be submitted. These details may be agreed following a "reserved matters"
application at a later stage. 
Passive design Passive design relies on using natural light and warmth from the sun to
warm and light a building. In general the building would not require a
heating or cooling system.
Passivhaus The heating requirement in a Passivhaus is reduced to the point where a
traditional heating system is no longer considered essential. Cooling is also
minimised by the same principles and through the use of shading and in
some cases via the pre-cooling of the supply air.
Permitted
Development
Rights (PDR)Where the need for planning permission is removed, subject to Local
Authority conditions and the terms set out in the Town and Country
Planning Act, 1990.
Pitch Area of land on a Gypsy and Traveller caravan site developed for a single
family (a group of related people who live and/or travel together - assumed
to be the basic unit when assessing accommodation requirements). A single
pitch will often need to contain more than one caravan.
Planning
ConditionConditions can enhance the quality of development and enable
development proposals to proceed where it would otherwise have been
necessary to refuse planning permission.

Site of Special
Scientific Interest
(SSSI)A site identified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended

interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physio graphical
features (basically, plants, animals, and natural features relating to the
Earth's structure).
Socially rented
housingSocially rented housing is a form of ‘affordable housing'. It is owned by local
authorities and private registered providers for which guideline target rents
are determined through the national rent regime. It may also be owned by
other persons and provided under equivalent rental arrangements to the
above, as agreed with the local authority or with Homes England.
Spatial Planning Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together
and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other
policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they
function.
This will include policies which can impact on land use by influencing the
demands on, or needs for, development, but which are not capable of being
delivered solely or mainly through the granting or refusal of planning
permission and which may be implemented by other means.
Starter Homes In the March 2016 Technical Consultation, the Government's statutory
definition of a Starter Home:
'a new dwelling only available for purchase by qualifying first-time buyers
and which is made available at price which is at least 20% less than its
market value but which is below the price cap. A price cap of £250,000
outside Greater London and £450,000 in Greater London is specified in the
Bill.
The clause also sets out the criteria which a person must fulfil to be eligible
to purchase a starter home. These include that the purchaser is a first-time
buyer (falling within the statutory definition) and that he or she is under the
age of 40.'
Strategic

for delivering growth. Acts as a strategic planning framework for an area,
meaning local authorities take the plan into account when developing their
Local Plans.
Strategic Storage
and DistributionCommercial buildings in B8 Class Storage and Distribution use (often
referred to as warehouses) as defined by the Town and Country (Use
Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) where the individual unit size is over
9,000sq.m. (or approximately 100,000sq.ft.), this being a standard
recognised definition within the commercial property sector. 
Statement of
Community
involvement (SCI)Document setting out when, with whom and how consultation will be
undertaken on Local Development Documents.

Supplementary
Planning
Document (SPD)A Supplementary Planning Document is a Local Development Document
that may cover a range of issues, thematic or site specific, and provides
further detail of policies and proposals in a 'parent' Development Plan
Document.
Sustainability
Appraisal (SA)A process by which the economic, social and environmental impacts of a
project, strategy or plan are assessed. The aim of the appraisal process is
to minimise adverse impacts and resolve as far as possible conflicting or
contradictory outcomes of the plan or strategy.
Sustainable
DevelopmentA widely used definition drawn up by the World Commission on
Environment and Development in 1987: "Development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations
to meet their own needs."
The government has set out four aims for sustainable development in its
strategy A Better Quality of Life, a Strategy for Sustainable Development in
the UK.
The four aims, to be achieved simultaneously, are:
•social progress which recognises the needs of everyone;
•effective protection of the environment;
•prudent use of natural resources; and
•maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and
employment. 
Page 291Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 - Adopted April 2019Term Description
Sustainable
Drainage Systems
(SuDS)Sustainable drainage systems are designed to control surface water run off
close to where it falls and mimic natural drainage as closely as possible.
They provide opportunities to:
•reduce the causes and impacts of flooding;
•remove pollutants from urban run-off at source;
•combine water management with green space with benefits for amenity,
recreation and wildlife.
Town Centre Usually the 2nd level of centres after city centres and, in many cases, they
will be the principal centre in a Local Authority's area. In rural areas they are
likely to be market towns and other centres of similar size and role which
function as important service centres, providing a range of facilities and
service for extensive rural catchment areas.
Travel Plan A travel plan aims to promote sustainable travel choices (for example,
cycling) as an alternative to single occupancy car journeys that may impact
negatively on the environment, congestion and road safety. Travel plans
can be required when granting planning permission for new developments.
Sometimes called 'Green Travel Plans'. 
Urban Fringe The urban fringe is the transitional area between urban areas and the
countryside. It can provide a valuable resource for the provision of sport
and recreation, particularly in situations where there is an absence of land
within urban areas to meet provision.
Use Class Order The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order),1987, as amended,
specifies various classes of use for buildings or land. Within each class the
use for another purpose of the same class does not require planning
permission.
Village Design
StatementsVillage Design Statements are a form of planning guidance that informs the
visual character of new development in a village to maintain the character
of the village. They are developed by the village community.
Water Framework
Directive (WFD)The Water Framework Directive directs that development and agriculture
should not impact upon water quality in rivers, steams and lakes. Where
possible quality should be improved by controlling run-off.
Water Stress Water stress occurs when demand for drinking water is high, or projected to
grow significantly, and the amount of rainfall is insufficient to meet demand.
Windfall
Development SitesSites not specifically identified in the development plan.
