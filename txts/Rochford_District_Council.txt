Introduction  
What is the Spatial Options document?  
The Spatial Options document  is a consultation paper that forms the latest stage in the 
production  of Rochford District Council’s new Local Plan.  Once adopted, the new Local Plan will 
set a new planning strategy for the District  to 2040 , helping to co -ordinate the del ivery of much 
needed housing, employment and infrastructure, whilst ensuring that our natural, historic and 
built environments are protected and enhanced for future generations to enjoy.  
 
The Spatial Options document  sets out a range of challenges and opportunities relating to how 
Rochford  District can change and grow over the next 20 years. These challenges and 
opportunities relate to a number of important, interconnected themes that together will 
contribute to achiev ing a sustainable  vision  for the District . This consultation is an important 
step in exploring  the advantages and disadvantages of different strateg y options, alongside  the 
contribution t hese options  can make to  fulfilling the objectives of the District an d its diverse 
settlements.  
 
This consultation builds on past consultations (set out later in this section) , however i t is not 
intended to revisit many of the is sues explored in past  consultations.  The Spatial Options 
document will be exploring a more speci fic set o f challenges and opportunities relating to key 
spatial issues (those relating to the use of  specific areas of land and buildings ). It will also 
provide an opportunity for us  to consider specific issues that may have emerged since past 
consultation s, either because they have been identified by new evidence, or a new requirement 
has been introduced by national policy.  
 
It is important to recognise that the Spatial Options document  is only a consultation paper and 
is not recommending a particular course of action . Instead , the document presents  a range of 
different  options that feedback is sought on . Options presented within this document are 
unlikely to be equally sustainable and f urther work, and consultation, will be required on the 
new Local Plan to ensure the options that are ultimately selected are the right ones  for Rochford  
and its communities.

How have we got here?  
This document is the second of an expected four stages  in preparing the new Local Plan.  
 
The Council has been working on its new Local Plan since 2015. Once adopted, it will replace the 
current suite of documents that make up our local development plan. These include the Core 
Strategy (adopted in 2011) , the Development Management Plan (adopted in 2014) , the 
Allocations Plan (adopted in 2014)  and our four Area Action Plans (adopted in 2014 and 2015).  
 
In 2016, the Council undertook a programme of local community engagement which was co -
ordinated with loc al parish and town councils. This engagement provided useful local insight 
into the challenges and opportunities that exist within our towns and villages, alongside 
feedback on how current plans are or are  not working for communities at a local level. The 
outcomes of this engagement programme can be viewed here . 
 
In late 2017/early 2018, the Council formally consulted on the first stage of its new  Local Plan: 
the Issues and Options document. This document set out a comprehensive range of issues and 
options relating to the future of the District, and how the planning system could help deliver 
new  opportunities. A range of issues were raised through the consultation which have 
influenced the direction of the new Local Plan since, and which will continue to be explored, 
alongside further consultation  feedback , through the plan -making process.  A fee dback report 
was published on the Council’s website and can be viewed here , with  a short summary of 
relevant  feedback included in this and  each of the  thematic cha pters within this document.  
 
This will not be the last opportunity you have to influence the new Local Plan , with two further 
stages of consultation planned . However, it is important to make your views known on the plan 
at the earliest opportunity.  Once th e Council feels the Local Plan is ready, it will submit it for 
examination by a Government Inspector, which, if successful, will allow it to be adopted. It is 
recognised that the Government is currently proposing substantial changes to the planning 
system,  including to the  role of  Local Plans  and the way they must be  prepared. Should these be 
changes be introduced, the timetable shown alongside this text  may need to be revised . 
    
What is a Local Plan, in simple terms?  
Each District Council in the country must prepare a document for their area called 
a ‘Local Plan’. The Local Plan sets policies, or rules, that state what different pieces 
of land can be used for (or what can be built on them).  
 
Local Plans must meet certain rules to be approved. This includes nee ding to 
follow rules set by Government, needing to be justified by evidence and needing 
to provide for enough new development to meet local needs (including for 
housing).

What did you tell us when last consulted?  
Between December 2017 and March 2018, we consulted on our New Local Plan: Issues and 
Options document.  
 
The Issues and Options Document (and accompanying Sustainability Appraisal) set  
out the key challenges and opportunities that had been  identified in relation to the future  
evolution, prosperity and vitality of the District. This included identifying and  
considering challenges and opportunitie s relating to  a range of “themes” including  housing, 
infrastructure, jobs and  the environment , alongside more specific consideration of the policies 
used to determine planning applications.  
 
In total, 554 responses were received to the Issues and Options c onsultation. A breakdown of 
the number of responses received by type of respondent is provided below:  
• 473 from members of the general public (including residents, local businesses and 
Councillors acting in a personal capacity);  
• 48 from landowners, develope rs or planning agents;  
• 7 from Parish and Town Councils;  
• 7 from neighbouring local authorities, including Essex County Council;  
• 10 from government agencies and other public bodies;  
• 6 from interest groups and trusts; and  
• 3 from community associations and local action groups (where they are responding as an 
organisation on behalf of their members)  
 
Many of these responses raised relatively more minor issues or showed preferences towards 
specific policy choices, however it was possible to id entify a number of key themes raised by a 
significant number of respondents. Thes e have been summarised in Figure 2.  
•There were mixed views on how best to meet our development needs with some 
support for proportionate growth of towns, some support for brand new 
settlements and some feeling that we should not meet our development needs 
even if it resulted in an unsound pl an 
 
•There was a widely held view that maximising brownfield land should be 
prioritised before any Green Belt land is released for development  
 
•An infrastructure -first approach to planning is required as there are existing 
issues with infrastructure capacit y including in relation to roads, public 
transport, schools and healthcare facilities  
 
•One of Rochford’s strengths is its rich historic and natural environment, and any 
future development strategy needs to protect and enhance these as far as 
possible  
 
•Any future strategy should deliver meaningful infrastructure improvements as 
the amount of money being secured from recent developments towards 
infrastructure improvements has been insufficient to keep up with demand  
 
•Many settlements have an identity and character that could be damaged by 
unmanaged development without appropriate infrastructure  
 
•Rochford should consider every opportunity to meet its own housing needs 
within its own authority area, with a focus on genuinely affordable housing that 
meets gen uinely local needs  
 
•Rochford should work alongside other bodies through the Duty to Co -operate 
to make sure that the key strategic issues and opportunities affecting South 
Essex, Essex and the wider South East are addressed through the plan

REFORM OF USE CLASS ORDER  
On 1 S eptember 2020, the Government reformed the Use Class Order , the primary way that 
the use of land and buildings are categorised for planning purposes . These changes  are likely 
to provide greater flexibility to owners of land and buildings  by meaning that so me changes to 
the use of land and buildings that would have previously  required planning permission, no 
longer d o so . The most obvious example of this is with traditional ‘town centre uses’, such as 
retail, professional services, cafes, offices and light i ndustry, which will now  be able to  change 
use freely to any other use in that list without requiring planning permission. This creates  
challenges in planning for appropriate uses by restricting the influence of policies in places  like 
town centres and empl oyment areas, which may see landowners and building operators 
pursuing the most profitable use as opposed to the most socia lly beneficial.  
 
IMPACTS OF COVID -19 PANDEMIC  
The COVID -19 pandemic has had and continues to have a profound impact on the lives of local 
communities and businesses, and the associated restrictions have deeply affect ed the vitality of 
our local businesses and economy . These impacts are likely to result in permanent changes to 
the way we need to plan for the futur e, both positively and negatively, which were not foreseen 
at the time of the previous consultation.  What has changed since we last consulted?  
There have been a number of significant changes to national planning policy and planning 
legislation since the last stage  of consultation on the new Local Plan.  
 
In particular, changes made to the NPPF in 2018, and further changes in 2019, introduced a 
range of new requirements relating to the role and content of Local Plans. Whilst many of these 
changes simpl y reinforce d or restate d existing provisions of the 2012 NPPF, or are unlikely to be 
material to spatial policy decisions, t here are n umber of more significant changes that will affect 
the form and focus of the new Local Plan moving forward.  These changes have been factored 
into the options presented in this consultation paper  and are summarised below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  CHANGES TO NATIONAL POLICY  
• Strategic and non -strategic policies:  
The NPPF now includes a requirement for Local Plans to make clear which policies 
are ‘strategic’ and which are ‘non -strategic’. Strategic policies in particular must 
cover a 15 year time period and set out a strategy for pattern, scale and quality of 
development, making sufficient provision for housing, jobs, infrastruct ure, 
community facilities and conservation.  
• Introduction of standard method for assessing housing need:  
Changes to the NPPF, and PPG, in 2018 and 2019 introduced a new national 
standard method for assessing local housing need, moving away from the previous  
system of assessing housing need locally through studies such as Strategic Housing 
Market Assessments (SHMAs). The standard method does not set a binding target 
and is only the starting point for considering how many homes need to be built in 
an area, how ever it is clear that exceptional justification is required to deviate from 
it.  
• Introduction of the Housing Delivery Test:  
A new test which assesses whether enough homes have been built in a local 
authority area in the previous three years to meet require ments. Where this has not 
happened, a series of measures are put into place including a requirement to 
publish an action plan, or an additional 20% added to th e number of homes that 
need to be built in the following five years.  
• Small and medium sites:  
A ne w requirement for at least 10% of an authority’s housing requirement to be 
met from sites smaller than 1 hectare  
• Affordable housing:  
A new expectation that all sites larger than 10 dwellings will provide at least 10% 
will be provided as affordable home own ership products  
• Biodiversity net gain:  
A new requirement for plans to deliver  measurable net gains for biodiversity

 Who will be engaged through the Spatial Options paper?  
Stakeholder engagement is a core part of the plan -making process. It provides a vital 
opportunity to help ensure that the  decisions being made meet the needs of those that will be 
most affected by them, whilst also ensuring that the plans and  strategies  of different public 
bodies and infrastructure providers  are co -ordinated for maximum benefit.  
 
A wide range of stakeholders will be engaged through the Spatial Options paper, including:  
• Local residents  
• Local business owners and workers  
• Parish and town councils  
• Neighbouring local authorities, including Essex County Council  
• Landowners, agents and developers  
• Infrastructure and service providers  
• Statutory consultees and interest groups  
 
The Co uncil has a published Statement of Community Involvement  which sets out how it will 
engage various stakeholders in the preparation of its planning documents. An update to the 
Statement of Community Involvement has also been published for consultation alongside the 
Spatial Options Paper.  
 
The Statement of Commun ity Involvement  has been supplemented by a specific Consultation 
Strategy  published alongside this consultation, which sets out how the Council will ensure it 
engages with the right interests in a way that is transparent and proportionate.

How does this relate to other plans and strategies?  
Whilst the new Local Plan will be limited to the authority area of Rochford, it is important to 
recognise that the lives and livelihoods of local residents and businesses do not cease at our 
boundary. Our communit ies have strong economic ties to  areas such as Southend , Castle Point, 
Chelmsford  and Basildon, and further afield to London, whilst many residents of those areas 
enjoy visiting Rochford for its unique historic , coastal and  natural spaces.   
 
In Summer 2017 , the Leaders and Chief Executives of South Essex councils ( Basildon, Brentwood, 
Castle Point, Rochford, Southend -on-Sea, Thurrock and Essex County Council ) embarked on a 
process to develop a long -term growth ambition that would underpin strategic spatial, 
infrastructure and economic priorities across the regio n. This 
included establishing the Association of South Essex Local 
Authorities (ASELA)  and agreeing a Memorandum of 
Understanding setting out a positive forward vision for 
South Essex.  
 
ASELA has since published a Growth and Recovery 
Prospectus  which establishes a number of projects that will 
help to deliver economic growth and better standards of 
living across the entirety of South Essex.  
 
One such project includes the creation of a South Essex Plan, 
a framework  covering the six authority areas, including 
Rochford. The scope of the South Essex Plan is evolving over 
time, but i t is likely to set  a high -level framework  for how 
South Essex will grow over the next 20 years, whilst 
addressing  key cross -boundary issues  and opportunities  that 
cannot be effectively addressed by local authorities working 
alone. This project is supplemented by an emerging housing 
delivery partnership which seeks to unlock stalled sites.  The District also falls within the South Essex Foreshore area of the Gov ernment -backed Thames 
Estuary  2050  Growth Board , which recognises over the past few decades the Thames Estuary has 
been unable to deliver the same levels of economic  growth as other parts of the UK.  The 
Commission’s vision for South Essex is that : 
“The ric h patchwork of places which form the South Essex Foreshore will be celebrated. 
Empowered by a statutory Joint Spatial Plan the area will go beyond ‘business as usual’. 
Locally driven town centre transformation will help create lively places that people cho ose to 
work, live, learn and play in. These policies and local initiatives will see development 
unlocked, post -industrial landscapes restored, and the filling of empty business spaces to 
create a thriving and creative economy. “

The new Local P lan will only form one part of the development plan for Rochford. Figure 6 
shows the relationship between  the different documents that will together form the Rochford 
development plan.  In order for the plan to be effective and co -ordinated, it is important  that the 
Council  continue s to work constructive ly with both Government and  neighbouring authorities, 
both in South Essex and beyond, to ensure  that the plan can help to deliver transformational 
opportunities for Rochford and its residents.  
Beyond plan -mak ing, there are  a number of important plans and strategies that the Council’s 
plan  will need to respond to  under the Duty to Co -operate . These include : 
• Working alongside Essex County Council , as the upper -tier authority for the District, to 
ensure that  its strategies and investment priorities (including those relating to highways, 
sustainable travel, schools, early years and childcare, public health, flooding, minerals and 
waste planning and s ocial care ) are effectively co-ordinated with  the Council’s planning 
strategy  and priorities  
• Working alongside neighbouring local authorities to ensure that regional housing issues, 
including level and distribution of housing  and the need for specialist ac commodation , is 
addressed effectively  
• Working alongside any neighbourhood planning groups established and supporting the 
delivery of sustainable, locally -led strategies through neighbourhood plans  
• Working alongside the Marine Management Organisation to ens ure the new Local Plan 
aligns and responds to the South East Inshore Marine Plan  
• Working alongside neighbouring local authorities to ensure t hat the regional needs of 
traveller and travelling showpeople groups are effectively met, including exploring the 
potential for a transit site within Essex  
• Working alongside neighbouring local authorities  and SELEP  to ensure that regional 
economic opportunities , including major inward investment and key assets like London 
Southend Airport , are supported through the planning system  and elsewhere  
• Working with Highways England to ensure th at the potential  connectivity and  economic 
benefits of the Lower Thames Crossing for local residents and businesses are reali sed 
• Working with Bradwell B to ensure that challenges and opportunities relating any long -
term  nuclear power proposals a re resolved to the benefit of the District’s residents, 
businesses and natural environment  
• Working with i nfrastructure and service providers to ensure plans and inv estment  are co-
ordinated  both locally and regionally  to deliver transformational improvements wherever 
possible (including to the highway and sustainable transport network)   
  
What is the Duty to Co -operate , in simple ter ms?  
The Localism Act legally requires certain public bodies to co -operate with each other 
to deal with important cross -boundary issues. If these issues are not dealt with 
effectively, a council’s Local Plan might be rejected by the Government.  
 
These cross -boundary issues are not set in stone but might include the need to 
provide enough houses and jobs in an area, or the need to address issues affecting 
infrastructure that is regionally -important  (such as key roads) or nationally -
important (such as po wer stations or airports).  National Policy and Guidance

What is the role of evidence  and the Integrated Impact 
Assessment ? 
The new Local  Plan will need to set a strategy for how Rochford  District should grow and 
develop into the future. To ensure we make the right decisions , a wide range of evidence 
documents have been p repared , or will be p repared  in the future .  
 
The Spatial Options document has been informed by a range of evidence , including:  
• Economic Development Needs Assessment (EDNA)  (to be updated ) 
• Green Belt Study  
• Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation Assessment (GTAA)  
• Housing and Economic Land Availab ility Assessment (HELAA)  
• Initial Heritage Assessment ( to be updated ) 
• Initial Transport Assessment ( to be updated ) 
• Joint Strategic Needs Assessment  
• Landscape Character, Sensitivity and Capacity Study  
• Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA)  
• Local Wildlife Sites Review  
• Open Space Study ( emerging ) 
• Playing Pitch and Built Facility Studies  
• Settlement Role and Hierarchy Study  
• Site Appraisal Note  
• South Essex Green and Blue Infrastructure Study  
• South Essex Infrastructure Position Statement  
• Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) ( to be updated ) 
• Urban Capacity Study  
 
A range of evidence is also planned to be commissioned in the near future, to help support 
future stages of the new Local Plan. These include:  
• Whole Plan Viability Study  
• Infra structure Delivery and Funding Plan  
• Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  
• Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan  
• Design Guides / Masterplans  
• Green Belt / Biodiversity Net Gain Assessments   
 
The role of this evidence is not to make decisions for the new Local Plan, but rather to analyse 
the planning  issues that the District faces relating to a particular theme or topic, and to consider 
the relative impacts  of different solutions. These documen ts are often of a technical nature, and 
the Council has published a series of topic papers to help summarise their key findings. These 
topic papers can be found at https://rochford.oc2.uk  
 
The Spatial Options paper h as also been informed by an Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA) . 
The IIA will satisfy the regulatory assessment aspects of Sustainability Appraisal (SA)  and 
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) , whilst also including an assessment of the health 
and equa lities impacts of the new Local Pl an. A draft IIA has been published for consultation 
alongside the Spatial Options paper and includes an assessment of how the options set out 
within the paper perform in sustainability and other terms.  Information on how t o provide 
comments on the IIA are set out in the next section.  
 
SA is an iterative process which is closely integrated with the overall process of preparing a Local 
Plan. The Council has previously published an SA Scoping Report  and an SA of its Issues and 
Options document . The role of the SA is to achieve sustainable development by assessing the 
likely significant effects of the plan and the extent to which the plan, when judged against 
reasonable alternatives, will contribute or otherwise to the  achievement of environmental, 
economic and social objectives.  
 
As plan -making progresses, the Council will also be required to prepare a Habitat Regulations 
Assessment (HRA) which will assess the new Local Plan’s impact on internationally designated 
sites for nature conservation.  
 
 
 
Q1. Are there any  other technical evidence studies that you feel the Council 
needs to prepare to inform its new Local Plan, other than those listed in this 
section?  
 
 
10 
 
Why is preparing a new Local Plan important?  
The Government has set an expectation in law, through the Neighbourhood Planning Act 2017, 
that every area must be covered by a (local ) plan. More recently, the Government made clear its 
expectation that all areas should have a local plan in place by the end of 2023.  
 
The Government provides a broad framework for national planning through the National 
Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) . 
 
The NPPF states that the planning system should be genuinely plan -led. It requires  that 
succinct and up -to-date (local) plans to provide a positive vision for the future of each area; a 
framework for addressing housing needs and other economic, social and environmental 
priorit ies; and a platform for local people to shape their surroundings.  
 
In addition to a range of development  management  policies, the NPPF makes clear that local 
plans should set a strategy for managing the pattern, scale and quality of new development and 
mak e sufficient provision for housing, employment, retail, leisure, infrastructure and community 
facilities, alongside conserving and enhancing the natural, built and historic environments.  
 
In order to be found sound, the NPPF requires local plans to be deliverable, consistent with 
national policy, positively prepared (meeting identified needs for housing and other 
development)  and justified by evidence . 
 
The Government has made it clear that it will intervene in local authorities wh ich do not make 
satisfact ory progress with plan -making. At the very least, it is expected that local authorities that 
fail to have a (new) local plan in place by the end of 2023 may face intervention, potentially 
losing local control over planning decisions. It is therefore im port ant that the Council makes 
suitable progress with its new Local Plan to ensure that local discretion on planning issues can 
be maintained.  
 
 In addition to the potential for  Government  intervention, there are a number of other reasons 
why preparing a new L ocal Plan is important. These are:  
• To ensure that policies are up -to-date and  take account of local priorities  at the time of 
decision -making  (as opposed to the time the last plan was adopted)  
• To ensure that there is a sufficient supply of development (including housing) to avoid the 
presumption in favour of sustainable development applying (whereby the council may be 
obliged to approve developments it would ordinarily refuse)  
• To ensure  there is a sufficient supply of local commercial premis es to support economic 
growth and avoid established businesses leaving the District  
• To ensure  that new community facilities and infrastructure is co-ordinated with 
development t hrough a  robust  and costed  strateg y, to avoid making  ad hoc decisions 
based on out-of-date policies  
 
In 2020, the Government  consulted on Planning for the Future , commonly referred to as the 
“Planning White Paper ”. This consultation include d a wide range of proposed reforms to the 
planning system, including to the role of local plans and the process for preparing them. At the 
current time, it is not known how many of these reforms will ultimately be introduced, therefore 
it is considered prud ent to continue preparing the new Local Plan within the confines of the 
existing system. However, there are a number of proposed reforms that are compatible with the 
process being followed, or which follow the same broad logic. As a result, wherever possib le, the 
options within this paper have taken account of potential areas of compatibility under any new 
system to ensure the Council’s plan -making process is as resilient to change as possible.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is the NPPF , in simple terms?  
The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is a document produced by the 
Government which sets out its priorities and policies for planning in England. These 
include requirements relating to how local plans must be prepared, alongside general 
rules for how the Gover nment wants local councils to take certain issues into account 
when making decisions.

Rochford  in 202 1 
District Profile  
Our Social Characteristics  
 
Rochford is a district that is home to around 87,000 people across a mix of urban and rural 
settlements . Our population has grown around 4% over the last 10 years and is projected to 
grow by a further 12% over the next 2 0 years. This would make our population around 98,000 
people by 2040.  
 
Over the same period, the age structure in Rochford is expected to shift notably towards an 
older population. By 2040, we expect there to be a 46% increase in over 70s, with the number of 
people living into their 90s expected to almost double compared to current levels.  There are 
also likely to be slightly more children than currently however the number of economically active 
individuals is likely to decrease with fewer residents of Roc hford being between the ages of 18 
and 70 than currently.  This could create challenges relating to dependency, with the number of 
over 65s per 1,000 working people likely to increase to around 450 by 2040, far above both the 
projected national average of 350 and the current Rochford rate of 390. Whilst general 
standards of health within older populations is consistently improving, a large dependent 
population relative to economically active people does present challenges locally in generating 
economic grow th and will mean a likely a shift in demand for certain local facilities and services.  
 
Rochford is currently one of the least deprived areas in the country, with only five out of 53 local 
neighbourhoods falling into the top 40% most deprived in the UK and  28 falling into the top 
20% least deprived. There remain however small pockets of deprivation where income, 
education and healthcare outcomes are notably worse than the rest of the District, including 
small areas within and to the east of Rochford town.  
 
Our general standards of health are one of our strengths  with 96% of residents rating their 
health as very good, good or fair. Life expectancy is better than both local and national averages, 
whilst r ates of excess winter deaths, cardiovascular disease deaths and cancer deaths are lower 
than national averages .   
 
 
The standards of  education  locally  are generally good with the majority of local schools rated 
‘Good’ by Ofsted, with four rated ‘Outstanding’ and four rated ‘Requires Improvement.’  
However the percentage of economically active adults with no qualific ations (24%) is slightly 
higher than the national average (23%) whilst the percentage of economically active adults with 
a degree (20%) is lower than the national average (27%). Rochford also has a noted skills 
mismatch with a large number of the jobs avai lable locally not matching the average skillset of 
our residents . 
 
The vast majority of homes in Rochford are owner -occupied  (83%) with a relatively modest 
rental sector . The dominant house types in the area are detached (33%)  and semi -detached 
(46%) with a relatively modest proportion of flats and terraced housing.  The affordability of  all 
housing is an issue constraining the ability for residents to afford homes in the area. The average 
house costs around ten times to average annual income of a Rochford r esident, w hich  has 
increased significantly from around five times 20 years ago  and is significantly above the 
national average.

Our Cultural Characteristics  
 
Rochford has a number of settlements that date back hundreds of years, including our two 
largest: Rayleigh, which was recorded in the Domesday book, and Rochford, a historic market 
town with building dating back to the medieval era.  Other  important settlements include key 
centres of population in Hockley, Hawkwell and Ashingdon, large villages in Great Wakering and 
Hullbridge, and smaller villages and hamlets of Canewdon, Paglesham, Rawreth and Great 
Stambridge.  
 
Rochford has a rich and diverse built heritage with over 300 listed buildings, including a number 
of centuries -old churches, halls and houses , and ten conservation areas  protected for their 
architectural and historic importance . We are home to a number of unique  and iconic building s 
including  the Dutch Cottage, a n octagonal thatched cottage, the Old House, a medieval house 
dating back to the 13th century, and the Rayleigh Windmill, a one of a kind windmill turned 
wedding venue. The Grade I listed Rochford Hall is located to the west  of Rochford town and has 
ties to the Boleyn Family . We also have a number of important archaeological site s, including 
350 separate records on the Essex Historic Environment Record and a number of sites  
designated as scheduled monuments, including:  
• Rayleigh Mount - the former site of a motte -and-bailey castle in central Rayleigh, now an 
open space managed by the National Trust  
• Heavy Anti -Aircraft Gun Site, Sutton – the site of a heavy anti -aircraft gun built during 
World War II   
• Mud Berth , Paglesham – the final resting place of the HMS Beagle, upon which Charles 
Darwin undertook his famous  round the world  voyage  
 
In addition to our extensive heritage,  we have a  growing tourism sector that is supported by the 
unique cultural sights we can of fer. With London Southend Airport being closeby and increased 
demand for nature -led staycations, our rural villages and sights such as RSPB Wallasea Island, 
are becoming increasingly attractive to da te and short -stay vacationers.  
 The annual Wild Woods Day  provides annual family activities celebrating one of the country’s 
best protected ancient woodlands at Hockley Woods. The Discover 2020 festival is also a 
celebration in 2020/21 of some of the District’s historic events, including the 200th anniversary of  
the HMS Beagle’s voyage to South America.

Our Environmental Characteristics  
 
Rochford is situated on a peninsula between the North Sea and the Rivers Thames and Crouch. 
The majority of the population live on the mainland, however Rochford is home to  a number of 
estuarine islands, including Wallasea Island, an RSPB reserve, and Foul ness Island, an active 
Ministry of Defence site.  It is a generally rural district with over 12,400 hectares of land covered 
by the eastern extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt, in addition to the generally undeveloped 
area of Foulness Island which does no t fall within the Metropolitan Green Belt but is 
nevertheless rural in nature.  
 
Rochford is  also  home to around 12,000 hectares of in -
land and marine habitats of international impo rtance, 
mostly along the coast and  eastern  estuaries , with over 
15% of our landmass covered by o ne or more biodiversity 
designations. These designations  include the Crouch and 
Roach Special Protection Area, the Foulness Special 
Protection Area and the Hockley Woods Site of Special 
Scientific Interest. In addition, Rochford contains  39 sites 
of local wildlife importance , four local nature reserves, at 
Kendall Park, Marylands, Hockley Woods and Magnolia 
Park  and a large network of public open spaces scatt ered 
throughout the district.   
 
As a coastal area, with two main rivers running through it, 
Rochford is  an area that faces threats from flooding from 
a variety of sources, including tidal (sea) and fluvial 
(rivers). Over 40 % of Rochford’s land area is at a greater 
than 1 in 100 0 probability of flood risk in any given year, 
whilst t he sea level rises that climate change is predicted 
to cause  threaten our coastline, particularly to the east of 
the District.   
 
Some areas have also been identified in the Essex  and Suffolk Shoreline Management Plan as 
being appropriate for managed shoreline realignment, including at Wallasea Island  and 
Paglesham.  
 
Rochford also has some more localised  environmental issues, including an air quality 
management area on Rayleigh High Street  that was designated in 2015 . An Air Quality Action 
Plan is now in place for this area , making targe ted interventions to return air quality to a safe 
standard.

Our Economic Characteristics  
 
We have a small but productive  local employment offer, with over 3, 500 businesses of which 
90% employ fewer than ten people . Our job density of around 0.5 9 jobs to every working age 
resident is  relatively  low compared to a national average of 0.8 7, reflecting our strong reliance 
on out -commuting to other areas including Chelmsford, Basildon, Southend -on-Sea and 
London. However, the average weekly earnings of  our residents (£ 649) is favourable compared 
to the annual average of £569 , reflecting again our relatively good access to high -paid skilled 
jobs in London and elsewhere.  (Statistics from NOMIS 2019)  
 
There are currently around 2 2,000 jobs located in Rochford. Our key 
sectors  by number of employees  include  retail  (around 1 6% of 
workforce) , education  (11%) , manufacturing (10%) and construction  
(9%), with a notable cl ustering of specialist businesses in the aviation 
and specialist manufacturing  sectors.  
 
We are connected to the rest of South Essex and beyond by two main 
road connections: the A127, travelling east to Southend and west to 
Basildon and London, and the A13 0, travelling north to Chelmsford 
and south to Canvey Island and Thurrock . These roads connect further 
afield to important onwards networks including the A12, A13 and 
M25. In addition, our three main towns of Rayleigh, Rochford and 
Hockley, along with our growing regional airport, London S outhend 
Airport, benefit from a regular rail services to London and Southend 
with further connections to the Elizabeth Line and Great Eastern 
Mainline from an interchange at Shenfield.  Our local economy is 
supported by two notable economic assets , the passenger and 
commercial ports of  London Southend Airport and Baltic Wharf. We 
are also strategically well -located to take advantage of the proposed 
Lower Thames Crossing and the creation of a new nuclear power 
station at Bradwell B.

Rochford District is home to 
around 87,000  people living in 
36,00 homes, an average of 2.4 
people per home  
Over 15% of Rochford’s land area is 
covered by biodiversity designations, 
including around 12,000  hectares of  
in-land and  marine  habitats that are 
internationally important for birds  
Rochford has a strong 
entrepreneurial spirit with one of 
the best survival rates  in the UK  
for small start ups  Rochford is home to London Southend 
Airport which is consistently ranked 
amongst the best airports in the UK for 
passenger experience  
Rochford is one of the least 
deprived areas of the UK, with life 
expectancy and standards of health  
better than regional and national 
averages  Rochford has a rich and diverse 
history with settlements dating back 
to the pre -medieval period, and is 
home to over 300 listed buildings 
and ten conservation areas  
Did you know?  
 
 
17 
 
 
  
A growing population, including a 
larger elderly populatio n, is likely to  
place significant pressure on the 
demand for different types of housing 
and services over the next 20 years  
Over 40% of our land area is at 
increased risk of coastal or fluvial 
flooding, creating a threat to our coastal 
communities with the potential need for 
shoreline realignment as a result of 
climate change  
Our peninsula location creates issues 
for connectivity with relatively limited 
sustainable travel options available, 
particularly north -south, leading to 
notable congestion along key roads  
Over 70% of our land area is protected 
under the Metropolitan Green Belt with 
over 15% protected for its biodiversity 
value, leading to a limited amount of 
unconstrained land available for 
development  
The ratio of local house prices t o earnings 
is far in excess of historic levels and above 
the national average, creating real 
difficulties for local people to afford a 
local home, particularly for first time 
buyers  
The percentage of jobs available per 
resident is much lower than the national 
average, leading to a greater reliance on 
out-commuting for our r esidents and 
leakage of spending and investment  
Our Spatial Challenges  
 
 
18 
 
  Our Spatial Opportunities  
Our proximity to London and the Lower 
Thames Crossing, and our key ports at 
London Southend Airport and Baltic Wharf 
makes us an ec onomically competitive 
area attractive to inward investment  
Our cultural sights and relative greenness 
make us an attractive destination for new 
residents, alongside green and heritage 
tourism, creating opportunities for local 
employment and investment  
We fall within the Thames Estuary 
Growth Board area, the Government’s 
‘Number One Growth Opportunity’, 
which hopes to deliver transformational 
economic projects across the area  The scale of housing growth required in 
Rochford presents opportunities to do 
things very differently and harness 
much greater investment in 
infrastructure than has been possible 
before  
Our rural and coastal environment makes us 
a great place to deliver new green and blue 
infrastructure for our communities close to 
where they live, including the eastern extent 
of a South Es sex Estuary Park  
Our entrepreneurial, small -business 
culture and rural -urban mix makes us a 
resilient and attractive place to do 
business, which if appropriately 
supported, can deliver local economic 
growth including to our rural communities

Rochford in 20 50 
 
It is a legal requirement for local authorities to identify the strategic priorities for their area in 
their development plan documents.  
 
We feel it is important to take a longer -term vision -led approach to our new plan, helping to 
identify along the way how different strategy and policy choices can help us to achieve our 
vision. This vision is supported by a number of priorities and objectives that translate the vision 
into the key actions that we want to achieve in relation to different themes.  
 
Previous ly we consulted on a draft vision as part of our Issues and Options consultation. We feel 
that this vision remains broadly appropriate for the plan as it is progressing, however we have 
made a small number of minor changes to our priorities and objectives to reflect feedback and 
to give appropriate weight to new and different factors that have gained in importance since we 
started preparing our plan.  
 
This draft vision and objectives relate back to a number of important issues, including the 
Council’s Busin ess Plan 2020 -2023, an excerpt of which is included overleaf. This Business Plan 
includes a number of planning -related priorities, including maintaining, protecting and 
enhancing green spaces, increasing the standard and availability of affordable housing,  
achieving and investing in sustainable town centres and high streets.  
 
Figure 13 and the following tables show the Council’s vision, strategic priorities and objectives 
for the plan.  
  
Figure 12: Rochford District Council Business Plan, 2020 -23  
 
20 
 
Draft Vision  
At the heart of our new Local Plan needs to be a vision, setting out  the place we want Rochford  
to be in the future  time.  Whilst the new Local Plan will only set a strategy to 2040, we want to set 
a longer -term vision to 2050 to provide consistency and ambition in our future policy.  We are 
also considering adopting  a range of settlement -based visions to help appl y the district -wide 
vision and objectives into a more localised setting , allowing the different needs and priorities of 
our different communities to be drawn out. We have prepared draft settlement visions as part of 
this consultation  and have included a qu estion in each of the settlement profiles asking you 
what you feel needs to be included in the vision for that settlement.  
Our Draft Vision  for Rochford in 2050  
“Rochford District will be a  green and pleasant place with a focus on business and high quality 
homes supported by accessible and responsive services and facilities, creating healthy and 
sustainable communities.”  
 
Our Society  
We have an extensive social, health, physical and green infrastructure network across our 
district which has been enhanced to support our changing population, and delivers 
health, well being and quality of life benefits for our residents. We have made effi cient 
and effective use of suitable and available land to deliver new homes and jobs, focussing 
on delivering previously developed land first as a priority, including making appropriate 
use of our own public assets. We have ensured the delivery of a wide s ize and tenure of 
new homes which meets the needs of residents, and is supported by a range of 
infrastructure necessary to mitigate potential impacts on communities. We have worked 
with Essex County Council and other infrastructure and service providers to  ensure that 
appropriate facilities and digital networks are delivered to support strong and 
sustainable communities, and provide residents and visitors with choice about how they          
live, work and travel.  
 
Our Economy  
We have made the most of our easy access to London, close proximity to neighbouring 
commercial hubs and the connectivity provided by London Southend Airport to become a 
key destination to do business. We have also supported the delivery of a leading regional 
centre in the science, med ical and technology sectors at the Airport Business Park. We have 
worked with Essex County Council and other infrastructure and service providers to deliver 
meaningful improvements to areas of concern to businesses. We will be recognised as an 
entrepreneur ial and enterprising area, continuing to build on our existing strengths to 
nurture and support our start -up, small and medium sized businesses and strengthening 
our rural economy through enabling diversification of activities to provide a viable green 
tourism offer. We have vibrant and distinctive town and villages centres that continue to 
meet the shopping and leisure needs of our residents. We have invested in our local 
education facilities and skills development to enable residents to work locally and r educe 
the pressure on our transport infrastructure.  
Our E nvironment  
We continue to be recognised as a largely rural area, with many accessible and high 
quality open spaces and significant stretches of coastline providing attractive and 
accessible leisure  opportunities throughout our district along the rivers Crouch and 
Roach for our residents and visitors to enjoy. We have supported the development of the 
RSPB’s Wallasea Island Wild Coast Project as the largest and most significant wetland 
project in Euro pe. We have protected and, where possible, enhanced our built, historic 
and natural environment, providing a network of locally, nationally and internationally 
important assets that are valued. We have retained our open character and extensive 
Metropolitan  Green Belt designation, whilst providing for the needs of future 
communities, as far as possible. We have ensured that new homes and commercial 
premises respect local character and distinctiveness, are built to lifetime carbon neutral 
and high -quality des ign standards, and incorporate measures to adapt to the impacts of 
climate change.

Draft Strategic Priorities and Objectives  
A total of 2 3 strategic plan objectives have been identified across five main strategic pr iorities. 
These priorities and objectives will help to direct decisions through the plan, by distilling our 
vision into a range of thematic ‘tests’.  National policy is clear that strategic priorities should be 
used to direct the formulation of strategic policies within the plan, with priorities that are non -
strategic being reserved for non -strategic policies.  
 
Strategic Priority 1: Meeting the need for  homes and jobs in the area

well designed and safe environments by balancing the principles of Essex design 
guidance with designing out crime and designing in community safety.  
• Strategic Objective 18:  To support the timely delivery of suitable primary, secondary, 
higher and further education facilities, and early years and childcare facilities, working in 
partnership with Essex County Council and other education providers.  
• Strategic Objective 19:  To support the vitality of our rural and village communities by 
harness ing the complete neighbourhoods model to improve the availability, accessibility 
and diversity of important local services, working to safeguard existing community 
assets and promoting strategies that would introduce new facilities and services into 
these areas

Strategy Options  
Hierarchy of Settlements  
In developing options for the strategy of the plan , it is considered  helpful to categorise 
settlements in a hierarchy in a way t hat reflects their relative  role and  contribution  to Rochford 
as a district . Our settlement hierarchy needs to  reflect a range  of different factors, including 
population, geographical size, availability and range of services and transport accessibility.  
 
We commissioned a Settlement Role and  Hierarchy Study (2021) to consider  the individual roles 
of different settlements in Rochford and h ow best to categorise these for the purposes of 
planning.  Our recommended settlement hierarchy is presented at Figure 14. 
 
• Tier 1  comprises our largest tow n of Rayleigh. Rayleigh has a significantly larger population 
(34,000 people) than any other settlement in Rochford, and contains by far the widest range of 
local and regional services, including two secondary schools, a large town centre, and a 
generous range of retail , employment and community facilities . 
 
• Tier 2  comprises our larger settlements of Hockley (including Hawkwell) and Rochford 
(including Ashingdon). These settle ments have populations in the range of 10,000 – 25,000 
people  and contain a good  range of local services , including a secondary school, modest -sized  
town centres, and a  good range of retail , employment and community facilities.  
 
• Tier 3  comprises our larger villages of Canewdon, Great Wakering (including Little Wakering 
and Barling) and Hullbridge. These settlements a ll have populations in the range of 1,000 – 
10,000 people and contain a modest range of local services , including single primary schools, 
small village centres and a modest range of retail, employment and community facilities . Whilst 
Canewdon is somewhat smaller than either Great Wakering or Hullbridge, it has a good range of 
facilities for a settlement of its size and benefits from a good degree of self -containment.  
 
• Tier 4  comprises our remaining villages , including Great Stambridge, Paglesham, Rawreth, 
Sutton, Stonebridge and South Fambridge. These settlements all have populations smaller than 
1,000 people , often considerably smaller,  and typically lack most  day-to-day facilities   
Beyond our borders, our residents and businesses  have an important  relationship with 
Southend, Basildon , Chelmsford  and London , particularly for employing and accessing  regional 
facilities  (such as hospitals, major attractions and comparison retail) . These settlement s are all 
larger than any town in Rochford and contain a much greater range of facilities. In a wider 
context, these settlements are likely to be equivalent  to a ‘Tier 0 ’. Other nearby towns which 
provide  some services  to Rochford residents  include  Wickford , which is similar in size and role to 
Rayleigh , and South Woodham Ferrers and Thundersley /Hadleigh , which  are similar in size and 
role to Hockley or Rochford. Whilst these settlements are not within Rochford, and have their 
own growth needs, understanding  the role and function of  these  settlements  across boundaries  
is use ful for considering the impacts of our strategy on a wider geography  and vice versa.  
  
Tier 1: Rayleigh
Tier 2: Hockley and 
Rochford
Tier 3: Canewdon, Great Wakering 
and Hullbridge

Growth Scenarios  
By 2040 , Rochford needs  to grow to ensure that the needs of existing and future communities 
can be met within our area. Failing to grow is likely to mean younger residents being forced to 
leave the District to find an affordable home  and the District becoming less economically 
competitive as central government and businesses choose to invest elsewhere . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Planning for Housing  Growth  
 
The Government has made it clear that it wants to significantly increase the supply of new 
housing across the country. It has set a target of 300,000 homes to be built each year by the 
mid-2020s. National policy is clear that plans should meet local housing need s, unless the 
adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and  demonstrably outweigh the benefits . When 
determining how many homes need to be built in Rochford,  national policy is clear that the 
standard method set out in Government guidance should be used as a starting point, unless 
exceptional circumstances justify otherwise.  The current standard method suggests that we  
would  need to build around 360 homes per year  over the next 20 years  to meet our housing 
needs , which equates to 7,200 homes.  
 
National policy also requires Local Plans to provide strategies that accommodate  unmet need 
from neighbouring areas where it is practical to do so and is consistent with achieving  
sustainable development . Whilst the scale of unmet housing need from others’ plans, includin g 
those from elsewhere in South Essex and London, is not fully known, it is possible that building 
more than 360 homes per year, if sustainable to do so, could help to accommodate some of this 
need.  
 
Our Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (H ELAA) 2020 identifies a supply of 
over 4,300 homes that are already planned for. This includes existing allocations, sites with 
planning permission and an allowance for windfall development of around 45 homes a year. 
Windfall development is development  which happens on sites which come forward 
unexpectedly and are not directly planned for in the Local Plan.  
To meet our growth needs over the next 20 years, we are likely to 
need to plan for…  
•7,200 – 10,800 new homes of different types, sizes and tenures  
•7 – 40 hectares of new employ ment space of different types  
•Up to 20,000 square metres of new retail space  
•Transformational improvements to local road and sustainable transport 
networks, including long -term solutions for the A130 and A127, and 
working with partners to deliver an inter -urban rapid transit solution for 
South Essex and significant capacity improvements to existing bus and rail  
•A masterplan for our town centres that encourages a more sustainable use 
class mix and supports their vitality in the long -term  
•New local centres wi th accessible services  
•A long -term strategy to reduce carbon usage to net zero and source 
energy from new renewable and low -carbon sources  
•Significant new community infrastructure, including several new primary 
schools, at least one new secondary school an d significant increases in 
primary care capacity  
•Large areas of new open space and green infrastructure alongside strategic 
development sites  
 
Whilst a range of growth scenarios have been presented  
in this section, the Council is not suggesting that these are equally sustainable and/or  
desirable. There remains significant work through the plan -making process to develop  
a strategy that successfully balances our need to grow with the need to safeguar d our  
natural and built environments.

Planning for Economic  and Retail  Growth  
 
The Council is part of the South Essex Economic Development Needs Assessment (EDNA) and 
South Essex Retail Study (SERS), both prepared in 201 7. These assessment s presented a range of 
scenarios relating to the future need for employment and retail space , respectively,  over the next 
20 years. It is recognised that since th ese assessment s were  prepared, the local and regional 
economies have been affected by the COVID -19 pandemic which is likely to have disrupted and 
accelerated different economic trends. Whils t updates to these assessments are planned, they 
are considered to remain useful for provided  broad bookends for the likely need for economic 
uses through the new plan  based on long -term trends.  
 
The EDNA identified a potential need for up to 7 hectares of employment land by 2036, which 
rises to 16 hectares when making an allowance for churn and windfall.  Compared against the 
District’s potential supply of new employment land, including the delivery of allocated sites at 
Michelin Farm, Airport Business Park and Star Lane, it is possible that no additional  land will 
need to be allocated to meet Rochford’s future employment needs , and it ma y be that 
consolidation of  employment land for housing can be justified  in some locations . However, to 
ensure our growth strategy makes sustainable and well -rounded communities, there may 
remain a need  to allocate land for specific or niche employment uses  not being met by the 
existing market , such as grow -on space or flexible workhubs, which are considered in  more 
detail in  the Employment section of  this paper.  
 
The South Essex Retail Study 2017 identifies a need for around 13,000m2 of new retail 
floorspac e by 2037, if Rochford was to build 360 homes a year over that period . This is made 
up of around 11,500m2 of comparison floorspace and 1,500m2 of convenience floorspace. Whilst 
the Retail Study does not consider the retail floorspace needs of planning for an even higher 
housing figure, extending this figure proportiona tely results in a possible need for around 
20,000m2 of new retail floorspace if housing growth was around 590 homes a year.  
  
 
  
 
  Scenario  Explanation  
Current Trajectory  
 Approx imately  4,500  new homes by 2040 can be delivered by  
maximising urban and brownfield capacity and windfalls . It may 
be possible for the remainder of Rochford’s growth needs to be 
met elsewhere , such as outside the Green Belt or in areas of less 
valuable Green Belt . However, it is a minimum expectation of 
national policy that local authorities plan to meet their identified 
needs which means this option may be unlikely to result in a 
sound plan  if those needs cannot be met elsewhere.  
 
This scenario may also require a round 7 hectares of employment 
land (based on EDNA combined scenario)  and n o new retail 
floorspace other than windfalls  
Standard Methodology  
 7,200 new homes by 2040 would meet the Council’s housing 
needs based on the current standard method  
 
This scenario may also require around 1 6 hectares of employment 
land (based on EDNA combined scenario with allowance for churn 
and windfall)  and around  13,000 m2 of new retail floorspace 
(based on South Essex Retail Study)  
Standard Methodology 
+ 50% Buffer  10,800 new homes by 2040 would meet the Council’s housing 
needs based on the current standard method, with an additional 
50% buffer which could help to drive local economic growth or 
address unmet need from elsewhere  
 
This scenario may also require around 40 hectares of employment 
land (based on maintaining existing employment allocations)  and 
around  20,000 m2 of new retail floorspace (based on Retail Study 
adjusted for housing growth)

Every 10 homes built in an area, on average, generates:  
3 homes available in 
an affordable tenure  
£250,000 in local 
spend per year from 
new residents  
9 local jobs (created 
or sustained)  Why is it important to plan for the right amount of growth?  
Planning for the right amount of growth is  at the heart of a sustainable Plan.  
 
Rochford District is an area with known housing challenges, many of which have been 
exacerbated by the Coronavirus pandemic. Our housing register has grown by  20% in the last 
year up to around 1,000 households  and the ratio between house prices and local earnings is 
amongst the least affordable in the country. When new homes are built, around a third of these 
homes are built as affordable, typically discounted by at least 20%. By taking a positive approach 
to gr owth locally, we can help to create a more inclusive housing market, avoid ing the 
emergence of housing -related issues including homelessness and concealed households, such 
as where younger people are forced to remain or return to their family home far long er than 
they would desire.  
 
Planning for growth can also have enormous economic advantages, in terms of the local jobs 
created through  the construction  phase, the local spend created through population growth 
and new loca l premises which allow both local f irms to grow and for other firms to locate in the 
area.   
 
We recognise that planning for the right amount of growth is a balance, taking into account the 
capacity of both infrastructure and the environment. There is a clear  and important  relationship 
betwe en the strateg y within a Local Plan  and the infrastructure  that we can deliver , particularly 
as key ‘big ticket’ infrastructure  such as transit systems, new roads or country parks  would likely 
require funding from developments.  Similarly, there is increase d emphasis on development 
provid ing net gains for the environment and the planning for the right amount of growth in the 
right places can deliver environmental measures that secure improvements  for flood risk,  
habitats, air quality and open spaces.  
 
Figure  16 sets out some general assumptions about the level of growth that would be required 
to deliver different types of infrastructure, however the exact numbers will depend on a site -
level assessment of infrastructure needs, taking into account existing infr astructure capacity.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, there are advantages to concentrating growth in fewer but larger areas as doing so 
can provide the “critical mass” needed to secure transformational new infrastructure, such as 
secondary schools, link roads or new transport systems.. The Government have also been cl ear 
in their funding decisions that they will help fund infrastructure where it is supporting their 
growth ambitions.  It is also possible for this infrastructure to be funded by a number of smaller 
developments ‘pooling together’ towards common infrastruc ture. However, a strategy that 
relies on smaller sites, or sites spread more evenly through the District, may also be challenging 
to fund new infrastructure because developments smaller than 50 homes will typically not pay 
towards new infrastructure and th e funds that are collected may be spread across too wide an 
area to be impactful.

Spatial Strategy Options  
 
At the heart of our new Local Plan needs to be a strategy that binds together our policies in a 
way that delivers the  vision and objectives of our District and its  individual settlements . A 
number of strategy options have been identified that could form the basis of the plan’s 
approach to growth over the next 20 years  and beyond.  
 
The options identified are:  
• Strategy Option 1: Urban Intensification   
• Strategy Option 2: Urban Extensions  
» Option 2a: Focused on main town s 
» Option 2b: Dispersed to all settlements based  on Settlement H ierarchy  
• Strategy Option 3: Concentrated growth  
» Option 3a: Focused  west of Rayleigh  
» Option 3b: Focused  north of Southend  
» Option 3c: Focused  east of Rochford  
• Strategy Option 4: Balanced Combination   
 
A Strategy Option Topic Paper has been prepared to summarise how these options were 
identified. This Topic Paper can be found at https://rochford.oc2.uk  
 
Figure 17 identifies how these strategy options relate to the sites that have been promoted for 
development as part of the new Local Plan, alongside other key spatial opportunities. It should 
be recognised that many of the sites sh own will not be suitable for development and it is 
likely only a small percentage of the sites shown would be needed to meet local development 
needs.

The map below illustrates some of the key spatial opportunities facing the District. The purpose of this map is to display th e location of all of the  
areas of land that are being promoted for development, identify which strategic options they could contribute to and illustra te they how relate spatially to other 
opportunities. It should be recognised that many of the sites shown will not be suitable for development and it is likely that only a fraction of the sites shown 
would be needed to meet local development needs . A more detailed map of the sites being promoted in each settlement is provided in the settlement profiles set out 
later in this consultati on paper with an opportunity for you to comment on the individual sites that you feel should be taken forward in the plan for  different purposes.

29 
 
STRATEGY OPTION 1: URBAN INTENSIFICATION  
Option 1 is the minimum expectation of national policy and is likely to be required within every 
strategy option. This option would be to make best possible use of our existing planned 
developments , previously developed  (brownfield)  land  and other under -utilised la nd, such as 
vacant buildings and contaminated land . A strategy based on urban intensification  could also 
include  taking a more permissive approach to higher densities in suitable locations (such as 
town centres and near stations ). We expect that at least 4 ,200  homes will be built over the next 
10 years  under this option and o ur Urban Capacity Study suggests up to a  further 1,500 homes 
could be built through a mixture of maximising the capacity of planned housing developments  
and taking a more permissive approach to higher densities in urban area s. 
PROS  
• This strategy requires the least use of greenfield land and , by definition, would involve no 
further release of land from the Metropolitan Green Belt  
• This strategy makes best use of where existing services  are located , including sustainable 
transport links a nd is the least dependent on the provision of new infrastructure  to achieve 
sustainable development  
• This strategy can support existing businesses and  the changing role of  town centres by 
increasing their catchment population  and supporting living neighbourhoods  
• This strategy can support regeneration and revival of existing areas by directing 
development and investment into urban areas  and infrastructure , rather than the relatively 
more viable sites on greenfield land  on the edge of settlements  
CONS  
• This strategy will not be able to meet our growth needs in full, which is unlikely to result in a 
sound plan  and risks local people being unable to find or afford the home they need  
• This strategy has the least scope for delivering  brand new infrastructure and risks 
overloading existing services  in urban areas  
• Higher densit y buildings, such as flats,  are relatively rare in our urban areas, particularly our 
historic centres, and may  be damaging to local character  in some pl aces  
• Urban and brownfield sites are generally less viable than greenfield sites, and therefore may 
be less  reliable and less  able to contribute towards  funding  infrastructure improvements   
 
 
  
Figure 18: Indicative Illustration of Strategy Option 1 - Urban Int ensification  
A127 
A130 
This strategy could deliver…  
 
Existing planned housing developments, including sites with planning permission, 
sites allocated in our current plan  and other  urban developments, involving around 
4,200 new homes of which at least 800 will be affordable  
 
Existing planned employment develo pments, including sites with planning permission 
and existing allocated sites, and new high quality space at Airport Business Park and 
Michelin Farm  
 
Potentially a further 1,500 homes by allowing higher density developments in urban 
areas and on existing planned housing sites  
 
Capacity improvements to existing schools and healthcare centres, new on -site open 
spaces and sports facilities  
 
Limited opportunities to deliver transformational new infrastructure as many of the 
developments would fall below the 50 -home threshold to contribute to new 
infrastructure  
 
 
 
 
30 
 
STRATEGY OPTION 2: URBAN EXTENSIONS  
Option 2 would be to spread development across a number of development  sites of between 10 
and 1,500 homes  adjoining existing towns or villages .  Option 2 has two sub -options which are,  
• Option 2a: Urban extensions  focused in the  main towns  
• Option 2b: Urban extensions  dispersed to settlements based on hierarchy  
This option would result in a variety of site size  and location.  La rger  development sites could 
need to  deliver their  own services such as open spaces, shops and basic medical facilities.  
Smaller sites may need to pool together to deliver new infrastructure.   
PROS  
• Through larger sites and effective co -ordination of smaller sites, thi s strategy would have 
a reasonable ‘critical mass ’ to be able to deliver new infrastructure in the form of primary 
schools, basic healthcare facilities, open spaces, shops and other community facilities  
• This strategy provides an opportunity for smaller local developers to contribute to 
meeting local housi ng need s, spreading the risk of housing supply across a number of 
builders and containing  more of the economic benefits of growth locally  
• By involving a greater number of developers  and site , this strategy may  deliver  more 
quickly and generate more diversity  both in terms of design and uses  
• This strategy is relatively more likely to be able to attract external investment into new 
infrastructure and community facilities  than Strategy Option 1  
CONS  
• This strategy may be relatively less able to deliver transformational new infrastructure, 
such as link roads, new bus routes or secondary schools, as th ere may be insufficient 
growth in one area to co-ordinate the necessary funding  
• This strategy may create a cumulative population increase that it is more challenging to 
support with  new infrastructure  given the population growth would be spread across a 
wider area and relying on a greater number of sites, adding  complexity and risk  
• This strategy would involve significantly growing  some  existing settlements to a scale that 
may change their character and function  in a way that existing residents do not agree with  
• This strategy would require release of Green Belt land across  a number of locations which 
may be more noticeable  and harder to mitigate

This strategy could delive r… 
 
An additional 3,000 – 5,000 homes relative to Option 1 of which at least 1,000 -2,000 
would be affordable  
 
Up to 3 new primary schools, new medical facilities, open spaces, employment areas 
and transport connections  
 
Opportunities to support rural services by directing some growth to villages with rural 
shops, schools or community facilities  
 
 
 
31 
 
STRATEGY OPTION 3: CONCENTRATED GROWTH  
Option 3 would be to concentrate growth in one or more locations of 1,500+ dwellings .  Option 
3 has t hree  sub-options based on locations where there is likely to be sufficient land being 
promoted to deliver this scale of growth  in a co -ordinated way:   
• Option 3a: Concentrated growth west of Rayleigh  
• Option 3b: Concentrated growth north of Southend  
• Option 3c: Concentrated growth eas t of Rochford  
This option could result in a new neighbourhood the size of a large village or small town . This 
neighbourhood would require major new  infrastructure, including a t least one primary school , a 
range of healthcare facilities, open spaces , employ ment spaces and potentially its own 
neighbourhood  centre . It may also be possible to deliver a secondary school above 4,500 
dwellings.  
PROS  
• This strategy would provide the ‘critical mass’ needed to fund  transformative new 
infrastructure , including new sustainable transport routes,  link roads,  schools, employment 
spaces and strategic green spaces, placing the least strain on existing infrastructure and 
services  out of each of the options  
• Development at this scale is mo re likely to attract  external investment from the likes of 
Government to deliver strategic infrastructure improvements  
• Development at this scale could deliver a series of unique neighbourhoods w hich  are 
individual ly distinctive and which offer a diverse range of housing, jobs and character s 
• There may be opportunities to deliver cross -boundary growth  around Wickford (for Option 
3a) and Southend (Option 3b) which could deliver  even greater levels of infrastructure  
CONS  
• This strategy  would be more complex  than Options 1 or 2  and require  significant work over a 
period of time to co-ordinate  delivery across multiple landownerships and phases of 
development  
• This strategy would place “all of our eggs in one basket ” meaning if the option does not 
come forward as expected it could undermine the delivery of the plan as a whole  
• The benefits of growth  for existing communities and businesses will not  be spread across the 
District, and this strategy could deliver relatively little in the way of infrastructure 
improvements within existing settlements  including villages  
• This strategy would require  a significant redrawing of our Green Belt boundary

This strategy could delive r… 
 
An additional 3,000 – 5,000 homes relative to Option 1 of which at least 1,000 -2,000 
would be affordable  
 
Up to 1 new secondary school, 3 new primary  schools, new medical facilities, open 
spaces, employment areas and new link roads  
 
Greater opportunities to attract Government investment into existing and new 
infrastructure as part of the Thames Estuary Growth Area  
 
Greater opportunities to work with Ba sildon, Castle Point, Essex and Southend Councils 
to co -ordinate funding towards transformational transport infrastructure projects such 
as a new inter -urban rapid transit system or new link roads  
 
Opportunities to deliver the eastern extent of the South E ssex Estuary Park forming a 
new coastal country park in the east of the District  
 
 
 
32 
 
STRATEGY OPTION 4: BALANCED COMBINATION  
This strategy would see a mix of the previous 3 options based on the most appropr iate balance 
to meet development needs. This could mean making best use of urban capacity (Option 1), 
building one or two large growth areas (Option 3) and a number of smaller urban extensions 
(Option 2).   
Depending on the exact combination of strategies, this option could deliver a range of major 
new infrastructure, including link roads, secondary school, multiple primary schools, a range of 
healthcare facilities, open spaces and employment spaces . 
PROS  
• This strategy could deliver many of the infrastructure advantages of both Option 2 and 3 
by using Option 3 sites to deliver transformational new infrastructure, and directing 
Option 2 sites to the locations where infrastructure capacity c an be most easily increa sed 
to support growth  
• This strategy may spread some of the risk of maintaining a supply of housing by 
continuing to deliver housing prior to concentrated growth areas becoming available  
later in the plan period  
• This strategy spreads the risk of under -deliv ery in Option 3  by having a  more  diverse  mix 
of sites and locations  
• This strategy spreads the benefits of growth across the District, including to where growth 
is needed to su stain existing services (such as rural shops and primary schools) or provide 
new services (such as new  public transport )  
CONS  
• This strategy would remain complex and require significant co -ordination to deliver, 
particularly in relation to new infrastructure in locations where multiple sites are expected 
to contribute to funding this  
• This strategy retains some of the risk of Option 3 should larger growth areas still be relied 
upon to deliver a significant proporti on of development needs  
• This strategy would require release of land from the Metropolitan Green Belt that would 
be noticeable and may require significant  mitigation  
• Urban extensions to existing settlements may still grow existing settlements in a way that 
changes their character or which places stress on existing services   
  
This strategy could delive r… 
 
An additional 3,000 – 5,000 homes relative to Option 1 of which at least 1,000 -2,000 
would be affordable  
 
Up to 1 new secondary school, 3 new primary schools, new medical facilities, open 
spaces, employment areas and new link roads  
 
Greater opportunities to attract Government investment into existing and new 
infrastructure as part of the Thames Estuary Growth Area  
 
Greater opportunities to work with Basildon, Castle Point Essex and Southend Councils 
to co -ordinate funding towards transformational transport infrastructure projects such 
as a new inter -urban rapid transit system or new link roads  
 
Opportunities to support rural services by directing some growth to villages with rural 
shops, schools or community facilities  
 
Opp ortunities to deliver the eastern extent of the South Essex Estuary Park forming a 
new country park in the east of the District

In this section, each strateg y option  has been presented equally but with commentary relating 
to the overall ‘pros ’ (opportunities) and ‘cons ’ (challenges) that a strategy of the nature 
suggested is likely to face. It is recognised that each  strateg y perform s differently against our 
vision and objectives  and a balanced judgement of the consequences of each strategy in terms 
of meeting our needs for housing, jobs and infrastructure, growing and diversifying our local 
economy and protec ting and enhancing  our natural and built environments  will be required 
when selecting a strategy.   
 
Figure 2 3 sets out how the identified strategy options perform in  sustainability terms as set out 
in the draft Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA). A full appraisal of each option is set out in the 
draft IIA available at https://rochford.oc2.uk  
 
Overall, Option 4 is noted by the II A or its potential to perform better against other options in 
relation to the socio -economic IIA themes.  This predominantly relates to the flexibility provided 
in a tailored approach, essentially combining the best performing aspects of each individual 
approach (urban intensification, urban extensions and concentrated growth).  The potential for 
significant negative effects has been identified under all options except for Option 1, this is due 
to likely loss of high -quality soil resources and encroachment o n the countryside as well as 
potential landscape impacts.  Significant positive effects are considered likely for all options 
except for Option 1, this relates to significant delivery of new homes and supporting 
infrastructure, including new open spaces, to  support a growing population, meeting housing 
needs in full (whilst risks are associated with concentrated growth options) and delivering new 
employment areas.  Uncertain effects have also been identified across the IIA themes, relating to 
the uncertainty of housing supply under some options and the potential accessibility of some 
locations and reflecting the need to understand more precise locations of development  as the 
new Local Plan develops.

Spatial Themes  
 
We recognise that there is far more to good planning  than simpl y housing and jobs. This section  
of the consultation paper  considers a range of themes that together  lead to sustainable 
development. These themes include important issues relating to our society, our economy and 
our environment. Each theme within this sect ion sets out a range of facts, challenges and 
opportunities relating to planning for that theme, alongside a number of questions that seek 
your feedback on how you feel we should be planning for that theme.  
 
A series of topic papers have been produced in o rder to set out useful background  
information relating to these spatial themes. These topic papers can be found at:  
https://rochford.oc2.uk  
 
Throughout this section you are encouraged to consider how the theme could  
be supported by your preferred Strategy Option  from the previous section.

Climate Change and Resilient Environments  
Our local plan is one of the most important tools we have to support our transition to a more 
sustainable and resilient District, including in relation to flooding, coastal change and protecting 
landscapes.  
 
The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires plans to include policies designed to 
ensure that  the development and use of land in the local planning authority’s area contribute to 
the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. National policy makes it clear that p lans 
should take a proactive approach to mitigating and adapting to climate  change, taking into 
account the long -term implications for flood risk, coastal  change, water supply, biodiversity and 
landscapes, and the risk of overheating from  rising temperatures .  
 
There are a number of ways in which the planning system can contribute to  creating a more 
resilient natural environment, including in relation to climate change. Examples are:  
• Ensuring that the distribution of new development is safe for its 
lifetime and encourages use of sustainable modes of transport, 
including walking and cycling, and reduces reliance on private car  
• Increasing the supply of renewable and low carbon energy and 
heat, by identifying suitable areas for energy creation and 
ensuring new development is sustainably built  
• Promoting low carbon and energy efficient development, 
including ensuring buildings are energy efficient for their lifetime  
• Encouraging responsible use of land in areas at risk of flooding 
and coastal change, and consider ways that development can 
help to deliver net gains for flood risk  alleviation  
 
Flooding is a relevant issue for Rochford, with much of the land along 
our coast and rivers being at more than 1 -in-1000 year risk of flooding. 
National pol icy requires a sequential approach to be taken to 
development, prioritising areas at least risk of flooding. Where 
appropriate, development will need to deliver sustainable drainage 
systems, such as ponds, swales and soakaways. A Level 1 Strategic Flood 
Risk Assessment has been prepared which will need to inform the plan’s 
strategy in relation to the use of land in areas at risk of flooding. Once a 
strategy has been selected , a Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk  
  
 
Assessment will be required to consider the specific flood risk and mitigation of potential 
development sites.  
 
In addition to flood risk from tidal, fluvial and other sources, Rochford is a district that is likely to 
be subject to a coastal change as a r esult of climate change. The Essex and South Suffolk 
Shoreline Management Plan identifies parts of Rochford’s coast which are subject to no active 
intervention or managed realignment, including around Wallasea Island and Paglesham. The 
plan will need to co nsider the implications of coastal change over a long period of time and 
ensure that current and future communities are. Plans are able to identify Coastal Change 
Management Area  where rates of coastal change are likely to be significant over the next 100 
years and restrict development which takes place in these areas.

There are a number of ways in which the planning system can encourage buildings to be built to low 
carbon and energy efficient standards. The Planning and Energy Act 2008 allows plans to set 
minimum standards for new housing that exceed the basic Building Regulations up to equivalency 
with Level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes, and up to no limit for commercial development . Our 
current plan requires commercial buildings to be built to the BREEAM ‘ Very Good’ standard, subject 
to viability. The same Act also allows plans to require a proportion of energy used in a development 
to be sourced from renewable or low -energy sources. The Government is considering introducing a 
Future Homes Standard which ai ms to mandate net -zero carbon homes by 2050, with ‘zero carbon 
ready’ homes expected to be standard by 2025.  
 
National policy also requires plans to facilitate the sustainable use of minerals. Whilst minerals 
planning is undertaken by Essex County Council, the Council’s new Local Plan will need to 
complement minerals planning policies, including the application of Minerals Safeguarding Areas 
and Minerals Consultation Areas within the District.  
 
More broadly, a resilient natural environment will also  require protection and enhancement of 
important local landscapes over the course of the plan period and beyond. National policy is clear 
that plans should recognise the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside, and that plans 
should provide for t he conservation and enhancement of landscapes. Where landscapes have a 
particular local value, it is important that plans identify their special characteristics and be supported 
by proportionate evidence. Policies may set out criteria against which proposa ls for development 
affecting these areas will be assessed. Rochford is not home to any Areas of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB) or National Parks, but nonetheless has areas of locally special landscape character. 
These include the Coastal Protection Belt  and Upper Roach Valley. We have prepared a Landscape 
Character, Sensitivity and Capacity Study  to consider the landscape character and sensitivities of 
different areas. The Study suggests that the Coa stal Protection Belt should continue to be protected 
for its special coastal landscape value, subject to a modest redrawing. The Study also identifies the 
Upper Roach Valley area as the most sensitive non -coastal landscape in the District. This Study will 
be an important source of evidence in considering the particular sensitivities of different landscapes 
and how landscape should be managed through the plan, including when determining where 
development should be located.  
 
 
 
 
  
Non -exclusive  options for addres sing climate change and resilient environments through the plan, 
include:  
1.Ensuring that the Plan strategy  takes a  sequential approach to flood risk including to locate 
vulnerable development away from areas at greater risk of flooding where possible  
2.Supporting the delivery of on -site sustainable drainage systems to ensure that new 
developments do not worsen flood risk elsewhere and, where possible, lessen the risk  
 
OPTIONS  
3.Requiring certain new developments to source a proportion of their energy from renewable 
and low -carbon sources  
4.Designating appropriate locations within the District for low-carbon and renewable energy 
generation projects  
5.Identifying areas with special landscape character, such as the Coastal Protection Belt and 
Upper Roach Valley, and protecting them from inappropriate development through the plan  
6.Ensuring the plan suppor ts the principles of the Essex and South Suffolk Shoreline 
Management Plan, including to consider designating coastal change management areas and 
ensuring the distribution of new development is compatible with planned coastal change  
7.Requiring new developme nt to be carbon neutral wherever possible, including as a first step 
requiring new houses to be built to an energy efficiency standard equivalent to Level 4 of the 
Code for Sustainable Homes and new commercial developments to be built to BREEAM 
Excellent s tandard, and moving towards any net -zero standards introduced by Government 
at the earliest opportunity  
 
Q9. Do you agree we should take a  sequential approach to flood risk and coastal change in our

Place -making and Design  
Rochford is a visually diverse area  with a unique mix of historic, natural and urban environments 
that help to create a distinctive local vernacular  and character.  
 
The creation of high -quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the  
planning and development process should achieve  (NPPF, Para 124) . National policy is clear that 
good  design is a key aspect of  sustainable development  which helps to create  better places in 
which to live and work . National policy  further  requires plans to be  clear about design  
expectations, and how these  will be tested , with effective engagement between applicants, 
communities, local planning authorities  and other interests throughout the process . 
 
However it is important that the plan considers  the issues that make a successful place beyond 
just the design of buildings and spaces. Successful p lace-making within both our existing and 
future  communities will need to be at the heart of our vision for the District, alongside the vision 
for our  individual towns and villages.  
 
Success ful place -making relies on a range of different factors coming together to create places  
that are attractive, vibrant  and safe .  
 
To help direct these different factors, t he Plan could include a place -making charter, setting out 
a number of key principles  for how development is expected to come forward in a way that 
contributes positively to its setting and wider environment. This place -making charter could 
form the basis for  specific design policies, alongside  one or more design guides  (or codes ) that 
set rules for how different parts of the District are expected to develop . These policies, guides 
and codes could set strict rules for some types of development  in more sensitive  locations,  
whilst allowing greater innovation and freedom for other forms of development  in other 
locations . The scale  and geography  of these design guides and codes will be  important  to their 
success ; a single guide  could be prepared to cover the entire District, or we could prepare 
individual design guides and codes for specific settlements or areas . 
  
 
 
  
 A PLACE -MAKING CHARTER FOR ROCHFORD  
 
New development will be required to…  
 
✓Deliver high -quality design and architecture in all buildings, streets and spaces;  
 
✓Achieve carbon -neutrality and, where possible, carbon negativity by promoting the use 
of renewables, providing for future methods of transport and minimising energy  and 
water use throughout the lifetime of buildings;  
 
✓Provide opportunities and activities for all groups in the community;  
 
✓Improve health and wellbeing by encouraging active travel and securing access to  multi -
functional, accessible and connected green and blue spaces, including parks and 
coastal areas;  
 
✓Encourage low -levels of car reliance, w ith a focus on prioritising sustainable forms of 
movement including walking and cycling;  
 
✓Conserve and enhance heritage  features  and local character;  
 
✓Support the creation of walkable and complete communities through the co -location of 
community facilities  and delivering appropriate and accessible social infrastructure, 
including for education, healthcare and energy provision;  
 
✓Design developments so they are inclusive and safe for all users at all times;  
 
✓Improve affordability and choice by providing for a  mix of typologies and tenures in 
housing supply;  
 
✓Enable inclusive and sustainable economic growth for different types  and size of 
business, including by enabling ultra -fast connectivity to homes and premises;  
 
✓Avoid worsening air quality and to improve local air quality wherever possible ; 
 
✓Ensure all buildings are resilient to the potential future impacts of climate change 
throughout their expected lifetim e; 
 
✓Encourage social innovation and opportunities for community -led projects;  
 
✓Facilitate the responsible long -term management and stewardship of places.  Relevant Plan Objectives:  ALL

The Council has not prepared any specific evidence on design or place -making  to inform its new 
Local Plan  but may need to do so as plan -making progress. However, given the wide range of 
issues that contribute to successful place -making, it is likely that the evidence base will need to 
come together as a whole to  inform our place -making and design policies, including eviden ce 
on housing need, green and blue infrastructure, viability and climate change.  
 
Through the Issues  and Options consultation, a number of options were presented including to 
retain existing District -wide policies and guidance, revise existing District -wide policies and 
guidance or to develop new area -specific policies and guidance. There was no consensus on a 
preferred way forward, but a number of common themes were identified  including a widely held 
agreement that good design  was central  to successful  place-making and the need to  make best 
use of industry best practice  on design , such as  the UK Police Service’s  Secured by Design, Sport 
England’s Active Design Principles and the Essex Design Guide . 
Possible changes to the planning system  being considered by  Government include placing a 
much greater emphasis on design in the planning process, with each area having design guides  
or codes, alongside specific masterplans for large growth areas. Regardless of whether these 
changes are formally introduced, there are a number of existing and emerging guides that can 
help to inform the Council’s approach to place -making and design , including those listed above, 
and those below:  
• National Design Guide  
• National Model Design Code  (emerging)  
• Manual for Streets  
 
Non -exclusive spatial options  for addressing place -making  and design  through the plan include:  
1. Identifying a number of general place -making principles  and policies through the plan , 
including a potential overarching ‘charter’,  that: 
a. relate to the District as a whole , 
b. relate to individual settlements, or 
c. relate to individual areas identified for grow th 
2. Preparing detailed design guides , codes  or masterplans  alongside the plan  that: 
a. relate to the District as a whole,  
b. relate to individual settlements,  or 
c. relate to  individual areas identified for growth

Housing for All  
Rochford is home to around  87,000 people living in around  35,000 homes. Rochford faces a 
number of housing challenges,  both in terms of affordability and availability.  Partly due to low 
housing completions  over the last 15 years , the average local house price has increased b y over 
70%  across this period , with growth in local earnings unable to keep up . This has created a 
housing market where many local people are priced out of the home they need and younger 
people in particular are likely to be living at the family home for l onger, unable to move on.  This 
is a problem that will continue to be significant i f not addressed, as a round 25% of our homes 
contain dependent children, which is above the average for Essex (23%) and England (22%).  We 
also face  challenges in delivering the right type of housing : The percentage of over 65s is 
expected to increase from around 23% to 28% by 2040,  which is li kely to create a  particular 
demand for different types of housing , both for those in good health and those who may 
require an element of care.  
 
Above all else, t he demand for more housing in Rochford is locally -driven, with existing 
residents living longe r and a large number of concealed households living in others’ homes 
unable to find or afford their own  home. Household projections suggest natural growth of 
around 5,000 households by 2040, with the Government’s method suggesting around an 
additional 50% should be planned for to address affordability issues. Through the plan, we must 
ensure that current  and future generations are able to find suitable, affordable and accessible 
homes that respond to their needs over their lifetime. Failure to do so will le ad to younger 
people leaving the District to find a home they can afford, and other people living in homes that 
do not respond to their needs.  
 
National planning policy  states that local plans should  positively seek opportunities to meet the 
development n eeds of their ar ea and that planning policies should ensure that a local authority ’s 
housing needs  is met locally  unless there is a strong reason for restricting the overall scale of 
development in an area, or if the adverse impacts of development would si gnificantly and 
demonstrably outweigh the benefits . Within this context, the size, type and tenure of different 
housing needed for different groups  in the community needs to be  assessed and reflected in 
planning policies .  
 
  
 
(including,  but not limited to, those who require affordable housing, families with children, older  
people, students, people with disabilities, service families, travellers,  people who  rent their 
homes and people wishing to commission or build their own homes).  As set out in previous 
sections, our current housing need calculated using the standard method is around 360 homes 
per year . This overall housing  need  does not, however, take into accou nt the need for different 
types, size and tenures of housing, which are considered further  in this section.  
Commentary in this section is largely based on housing market analysis undertaken across 
South Essex, including t he South Essex Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  and its 
Addendum . Due to changes in national policy, we will be commissioning an update to the  SHMA 
to gain an up -to-date understand ing of the  specific housing needs of different groups in the 
community.  However, the figures contained within the SHMA and  its Addendum are considered 
to remain useful for drawing broad conclusion s on the likely need for housing of different types , 
sizes and tenures over the  next 20 years.

Relevant Plan Objectives:  1, 2, 6, 9, 19

Figure 27: Summary of Housing Need for Rochford District

The South Essex SHMA  assesses the need for  different  types  and sizes  of dwellings  over the 
following 20 years .  Figure 28 below  highlights that the District has a fairly balanced need for 
housing of all types and sizes, with the greatest n eed for small and mid -sized semi -detached 
housing, and smaller detached housing. There is also a not insignificant need for one -bed flats 
and larger detached and semi -detached housing. Whilst it is recognised that the types and sizes 
of housing delivered i n often market -driven, it is nevertheless important that the plan puts 
measures in place to ensure the mix of housing delivered in the future actually provides the 
types and sizes of housing that current and future residents want to live in.  
 
Figure 28 - Need for Housing by Type and Tenure  
 
Rochford has high levels of owner occupation compared to other parts of the country and our 
private rented sector is relatively small. A private rented sector review was undertaken by the 
South Essex Housing Group in 2018 and established that  growth in  private rent als had overtaken 
owner occupation ( +6.1% compared to -5.1%) due to an undersupply of otherwise affordable 
housing. A number of households in Rochford  have been meeting their affordable needs 
through the private rented sector , whilst it has al so become the tenure for frustrated “would be” 
homeowners, including families with children who cannot afford to buy and  are not eligible for 
social housing.  The increased demand for private renting has significantly inflated rents across 
all South Essex local authority areas including in Rochfor d.  People who are reliant on housing 
benefit struggle to find accommodation that is within the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates.  To date the private rented sector in South Essex has not contributed in any sign ificant way to 
new housing supply but been reliant for growth on the conversion of existing owner -occupied 
stock.   Evidence demonstrates that the District is generally unaffordable for first time buyers and 
those on low er incomes, highlighting the need for  additional affordable housing in a range of 
tenures that meet the needs of income groups including aspirant homeowners.  The private 
rented sector is smaller than the national average and there is a n opportunity through the plan  
to support investors to bo ost supply where there is interest.  
 
The Need for Affordable Housing      
 
Affordable housing is a particular form of housing available to eligible households whose needs 
are not met by the market. It is typically available at a discount of around 20% or s ometimes 
more. National policy encourages local authorities to plan for those who require affordable 
housing , however e ffective provision is about the right type as well as quantity.  There are 
several different types of affordable housing tenure,  the most  common being social rented, 
affordable rented , shared ownership and the new First Homes model. Rochford has a  relatively 
active market of registered social landlords, with  9 present  in the District.  
 
The District has a significant need for more affordable housing across all tenures, with the 2017 
SHMA Addendum identifying a need for 296 new affordable homes every year, falling to 238 
affordable homes after five years. This is a large proportion of our overall housing need, around 
two-thirds based on the current standard method. As with all housing, we face different levels of 
demand for different sizes of affordable housing, with around 52% of new affordable home 
demand being for one -bed homes, with 27%  two-bed and 19% three -bed.  
 
The vast majority of our affordable housing is delivered through planning obligations on 
developments larger than 15 homes, with a relatively modest supply coming from dedicated 
affordable housing schemes. Our current policy r equires 35% of all homes on developments 
larger to be 15 homes to be affordable. Because of this, it is important to recognise the role of 
market housing in allowing affordable housing to be delivered. Whilst it may be possible to 
increase the supply of af fordable housing by incentivising the delivery of dedicated schemes, 
the most effective way of increasing affordable housing delivery is by increasing the delivery of 
housing overall.  
 House Type / Size  Percentage of Overall Need  
Detached  30%  
3 bed or less  20%  
4 bed  9% 
5 bed or more  1% 
Semi -detached  50%  
2 bed or less  23%  
3 bed  23%  
4 bed or more  4% 
Terraced  6% 
2 bed or less  3% 
3 bed or more  3% 
Flat 15%  
1 bed  10%  
2 bed or more  5%  
 
42 
 
The revised  NPPF sets out that planning policies should expect at least  10% of homes on sites 
larger than ten homes to be available for affordable home ownership.  This requirement would 
form part of the overall affordable housing contribution from a development site having 
implications on delivery of affordable rented homes.   
 
There are a number of changes on the horizon in relation to planning for affordable housing.  
• In May 2020 , the Government made a Written Ministerial Statement  setting out a 
framework for a new form of Affordable Housing, known as First Homes .  This is i ntended 
to deliver discounted (at least 30%) market homes for local people who live or work in the 
community, struggling to purchase a home at market prices. Eligibility will include  first-
time buyers and key workers. Moving forward, First Homes will need to make up 25% of 
all of the affordable tenures captured through planning obligations with traditional 
tenures such as affordable rent or shared ownership reducing proportionately.  
• The Government has also consulted on longer -term proposals to change the w ay in which 
developer contributions are collected. A National Infrastructure Levy is proposed  with 
rates potentially decided by the Government. If introduced, a ffordable housing would be 
provided via this Infrastructure Levy, where currently it is provided through Section 106 
agreements.  Whilst the Levy rate will be set by Government, the prioritising of spending 
will be decided locally.  These proposals may aff ect affordable housing delivery, 
depending on how these priorities are set.  
 
The Need for Specialist and Supported Housing   
 
In addition to affordable housing, we also have demand for s pecialist forms of housing which  
includes : 
• Housing for those with disa bilities, e.g., wheelchair friendly and adaptable 
accommodation  
• Housing for young people leaving care  
• Housing for people fleeing domestic violence  
• Housing for those with drug and alcohol  dependencies , or 
• Housing for those  at risk of becoming homeless  
 
These forms of housing are again  often  provided by registered providers  or other non -profit 
organisations within supported shared or communal housing schemes.  Other forms of specialist housing are those for  older persons who may require health care 
support due to physical and mental health issues such as dementia, but who are not in need of 
residential care. Types of older persons accommodation will include sheltered and extra care 
sheltered housing . Such forms of accommodation  are unique from each other and  will in every 
case  need to meet the needs and aspirations of residents,  with good design, choice of tenure 
and be in sustainable locations, i.e. near to community facilities and services. Focusing on 
inde pendence and social inclusion, specialist housing can contribute to the delivery of local 
health and social care services but will rely on effective joint working between multiple agencies, 
e.g. housing, health, and voluntary sector, as well as strategic p lanning .   
 
Our evidence  estimates that the additional demand for different types of specialist 
accommodation for older age groups is around 50 units per year , with the majority being from 
sheltered accommodation .  In addition, the SHMA  estimates a require d provision of an average 
of 11 additional bed spaces per year within communal establishments (e.g. care or nursing 
homes) . Whilst an update to the SHMA is planned , it is considered unlikely that the demand for 
older persons’ specialist accommodation will have changed markedly  but it will nevertheless be 
important that the plan provides a strategy to accommodate these needs.  
 
The Need for Rural and Community -Led Housing  
 
People living in rural areas can face housing challenges, particularly with supply and  
affordability.  The NPPF sets out that ‘planning policies and decisions should be responsive to 
local circumstances and support housing developments that reflect local needs ‘and that 
opportunities should be identified ‘for villages to grow and thrive [to ] support local services.’  
 
 Community -led housing projects are one way that rural communities can bring housing 
forward to suit their community needs, e.g. size, type, and tenure of housing , however the 
District’s tightly drawn Green Belt boundaries restr ict the supply of housing in these locations.   
Options for addressing the specific needs of rural communities is set out later in this section.  
 
 
The Need for Self -Build and Custom Build Housing  
Self-build housing is where a person is directly involved in organizing and constructing their  
own  home . Custom -build housing is where a person commissions a specialist developer to help 
to deliver their home  to a request specification .  These processes enable people to be  more  
 
43 
 
directly involved in meeti ng their own housing needs, and in so doing, reduce the reliance on 
the private market . The  Self-build and  Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 requires local authorities 
to maintain local registers of builders wishing to acquire suitable land to build their own home , 
and to permission sufficient suitable plots to meet demand.  
 
This data can be analysed to establish the extent of local demand for this form of housing .  
There are currently  83 individuals on the Council’s register which is evidence of significant 
latent demand.  
 
The Need for Suitably -Sized  and Accessible  Housing  
 
The Council’s current plan previously  required all homes to be built to the Lifetime Homes 
standard and a minimum size. However the Government has legislated that th ese standard s can 
no longer be enforced  and that compliance must instead be sought through Building 
Regulations, and use of t he Nationally Described Space Standards  (NDSS), where justified. 
Authorities may only require adherence to a higher standard than the minimum  where they 
have strong evidence that it is required to respond to an identified need, so the Council would 
need to ju stify continuing to use the NDSS in its new plan. The  Council currently requires 3% of 
homes on d evelopments larger than 30 dwellings to be fully wheelchair accessible. This is 
governed through Part M 4 of the Building Regulations . If justified, the Council  could seek a 
higher  standard of accessibility for dwellings through mandating that new homes meet the 
standards set out in  Part s M4(2) or M4(3)  of the Building Regulations.  
 
 
 
 
Non -exclusive options for addressing our housing needs through the plan include:  
1. Meeting our need for different types, sizes and tenures of housing (including affordable 
housing and specialist housing) by requiring a s tandard  non-negotiable mix of housing to 
be provided on all housing developments  
 2. Meeting our need for different types, sizes and tenures of housing (including affordable 
housing and specialist housing) by requiring a suitable or negotiable mix of housing that 
is responsive to the type or location of the development  
3. Meeting our need for different types, sizes and tenures of housing by allocating specific 
areas of land for specific  types, sizes and tenures of housing, including to:  
a. Allocate  entry -level ‘exceptions’ sites for first -time buyers  
b. Allocate  specific areas of land for affordable housing  
c. Allocate specific areas of land for specialist housing  
d. Allocate specific areas of land for self -build or custom -build housing  
4. Taking a market -led a pproach to housing mix and not specifying the types, tenures and

The Need for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople  
Accommodation  
National policy also requires plans to make suitable provision for travelling households  who 
have specialist housing needs. The Government has published its Planning Policy for Travelling 
Sites (PPTS) making it clear how the planning system is expected to provide for the housing 
needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
 
The PPTS  requires local plans to:  
a. identify and update annually, a supply of specific deliverable sites  sufficient to provide 5 
years’ worth of sites against their locally set targets  
b. identify a supply of specific, developable  sites,  or broad locations for growth, for years 6 
to 10  of the plan and,  where possible, for years 11 -15 of the plan  
c. consider production of joint development plans that set targets on a cross -authority 
basis, to provide more flexibility in identifying sites, particularly if a local planning 
authority has special or strict planning constraints across its area (local planning 
authorities have a duty to cooperate on planning issues that  cross administrative 
boundaries)  
d. relate the number of pitches or  plots to the circumstances of the specific size  and location 
of the site and the surrounding population’s size and density  
e. protect local amenity and environment  
 
The PPTS is also clear that c riteria should be set to guide land supply allocations where there is 
identified need  and to provide a basis for decisions in case applications nevertheless come 
forward.  
 
The Council has prepared evidence to assess its future needs for traveller accommodation, 
including the South Essex Gy psy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Assessment (SEGTAA ). This assessment identifies a need  in Rochford  for 18 additional pitches 
for travellers  known to meet the planning definition of a traveller , 1 additional pitch for unknown 
travellers and up to 11 additional pitches for those that fall outside the planning definition but nevertheless have identified  specialist  housing needs. The SEGTAA ident ified that there was no 
requirement for  additional  travelling showpeople plots in Rochford.  
Figure 29  shows how these needs are distributed over the next 20 years, with it being clear that 
most of these needs are immediate.

The Council’s current policy position on traveller needs is to prioritise the delivery of a new 
permanent traveller site at Michelin Farm, which has capacity for 15 or more pitches, which 
would be sufficient to meet most of Rochford’s needs. Feedback from the  Issues & Options 
consultation was generally supportive of delivering a permanent site at Michelin Farm  in 
preference to authorising or allocating alternative sites . However, this s ite is not being delivered 
as expected and the current landowner has stated  that the site is no longer available for this use.   
 
It is important that the plan makes sufficient provision for the permanent accommodation  needs 
of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople, and sets suitable criteria for the assessment of 
any traveller sites that c ould be allocated through the plan or which come forward  unexpectedly 
during the plan period.  Failure to provide sufficient land or permanent pitches for the needs of 
travelling households would be incompatible with national policy an d risk s unauthorised sites 
emerging, often in the Green Belt, where there is no suitable alternative for  travelling  
households. The vast majority of Rochford’s identified need arises from unauthorised pitches 
already present in the District , including a la rge site at Cherry Hill Farm, Rawreth siting over 10 
pitches.   
 
45 
 
In addition to traveller sites for permanent accommodation, there may also a need for sites for 
temporary accommodation for households travelling through the area.  The provision of suitable 
temp orary sites can help to reduce the number of seasonal unauthorised encampments  by 
providing an authorised place for households to stop either overnight or for a short period.  
Different types of temporary site  can include:  
• Transit sites - full facilities wh ere Travellers can live temporarily (usually for up to a 
maximum of three months) – for example, to work locally, for holidays or to visit family 
and friends.  
• Emergency stopping places - more limited facilities.  
• Temporary sites and stopping places - only temporary facilities to cater for an event.  
• Negotiated stopping places - agreements which allow caravans to be sited on suitable 
specific pieces of ground for an agreed and limited period of time.  
 
The previous  Essex Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (EGTAA)  identified a 
potential need for  transit sites in Essex to address temporary accommodation needs  of around 
45 pitches at peak in a year . A Gypsy and Traveller Transit Site Assessment  is now under 
preparation across Essex which  may  identif y specific locations in the county where one or more 
transit sites could be located.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Non -exclusive options for addressing permanent accommodation needs of Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople include:  
1. Retaining the current policy position of delivering a permanent site at Michelin Farm, if it 
can be established that this site is deliverable within the plan period  
2. Prioritising the regularisation of existing unauthorised sites where  any environmental, 
transport and amenity impacts of doing so are outweighed by the benefits  
3. Prioritising the regularisation  and expansion of existing unauthorised sites where any 
environmental, transport and amenity impacts of doing so are outweighed by the benefits  
4. Allocating new areas of land for permanent traveller sites, i nformed by a specific Call for 
Sites and site assessment process for potential location s for new traveller sites  
5. Requiring new strategic housing allocation to set aside areas for permanent traveller sites 
within the general boundary of any allocation  
6. Working with neighbouring authorities to meet permanent traveller accommodation 
needs in other local authority areas if it is established that needs could be better met by 
permanent sites located elsewhere

Employment and Jobs  
 
Rochford District is home to a small but productive local economy, characterised by an 
entrepreneurial culture and strong start -up business survival rates. There is a high proportion of 
micro, small and medium -sized enterprises, from home -based lifestyle b usinesses to highly -
specialised advanced manufacturing firms. A lower -than -average job density indicates that the 
number of local jobs available to  working age residents is relatively low  resulting in a strong 
reliance on out -commut ing to destinations such  as Chelmsford, Basildon, London and 
Southend. . The Council’s Economic Growth Strategy  identifies opportunities to grow the 
economy by supporting small business productivity and encouraging inward investment, as well 
as harnessing the growth potential of London Southend Airport.  
The new Local Plan needs to ensure that enough employment land  is available to accommodate 
the growth ambitions of businesses  of all sizes  in the District  over the next 20 years , as well as to 
attract new inward investment. In this way, the right planning policies will help provide more 
local job opportunities for re sidents  and support greater prosperity for Rochford District.  
National planning policy emphasises building a strong, competitive and productive national 
economy by creating the conditions to allow businesses to invest, expand and adapt. The NPPF 
champions a n approach where  areas focus on their innate strengths, support innovation and 
counter weaknesses, whilst policies and decisions must address the locational requirements of 
different sectors of the economy. Paragraph 81 requires planning policie s to:  
• set out a clear economic vision and strategy which positively and proactively encourages 
sustainable economic growth, having regard to Local Industrial Strategies and other local 
policies for economic development and regeneration;  
• set criteria, or i dentify strategic sites, for local and inward investment to match the 
strategy and to meet anticipated needs over the plan period;  
• seek to address potential barriers to investment, such as inadequate infrastructure, 
services or housing, or a poor environme nt; and  
• be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, allow for new and 
flexible working practices (such as live -work accommodation), and to enable a rapid 
response to changes in economic circumstances .   
  
 
Paragraph 83 of the NPPF  also  emphasis es the importance of a prosperous rural economy, 
requiring policies and decisions to accommodate local business needs in a way which is sensitive 
to the surroundings and prioritises the reuse of existing sites and buildings.  
Existing Evidence Base Position  
To plan for the spatial requirements of businesses  both  now and in the future, the Council needs 
to carefully consider how demand for different types of employment land is projected to 
change, based on detailed evidence. Two key studies supporting these con siderations are 
summarised below:   
• The South Essex Economic Development Needs Assessment 2017  (EDNA ) provides a  
comprehensive , evidenced ana lysis of the economic and employment land opportunities 
and challenges for South Essex , including employment land requirements to 2036 based 
on economic modelling of scenarios including growth of London Southend Airport and 
the relocation of businesses from Greater  London to South Essex. Given recent national 
and global trends, most notably the COVID -19 pandemic but also the impending 
construction of capacity -building  infrastructure projects (e.g. the Lower Thames Crossing), 
it is anticipated that the EDNA will be r efreshed soon to take into account how demand 
for different types of business space across South Essex may be changing. Nevertheless, 
the EDNA is considered to remain reliable for drawing general conclusions on the need 
for different types of employment sp ace.  
 
• The South Essex Grow -On Space  Feasibility  Study 2020  assesses the availability and 
status of ‘grow -on space’ (i.e. office/industrial units of 150 -500m2) across South Essex. 
Grow -on space is considered a crucial component in growing the local economy,  enabling 
start -up businesses to increase their output, employment and productivity, and 
consequently commercial provision is closely monitored, to determine  whether the 
market adequately provides this product, or whether public sector intervention (through 
planning or economic development policy) is required to facilitate  small business growth 
opportunities.  
 
 
Relevant Plan Objectives : 3, 4, 5, 9, 16   
 
47 
 
Key findings for the future of employment space in Rochford District are as follows:  
• Modelling suggests that over the next 15 -20 years, the most likely scenario for 
employment land demand, given the re -location of industries from London and the 
growth of London Southend Airport, an addi tional 7ha of employment land would be 
required, with the potential to support over 1,200 additional local jobs. This requirement 
rises to 16ha, when allowing for churn and windfall of existing employment sites (i.e. non -
B-class uses having some presence o n employment sites).  
• Rochford has considerable potential to support business growth and attract inward 
investment, with strong transport links to London, strategic transport infrastructure at 
London Southend Airport and the region’s ports, a skilled workfo rce and entrepreneurial 
culture contributing to this.  
• Rochford District has the highest demand/lowest supply of office space across South 
Essex, with property spending less time on the market than in  other areas . Demand for 
industrial space was similarly high.  
• Vacancy rates across both office and industrial space were above 
average whilst rents were below average, implying overall quality 
of stock in Rochford District is of secondary/poo r quality.  In 
recent years, the supply of vacant industrial and office floorspace 
has fallen drastically across South Essex, due to rising business 
occupier demand, but also due to pressure to redevelop 
employment land for housing.  
• Availability of grow -on space within the District is constrained . For 
workshops in this category, the level of demand is moderate, but 
quantum of existing stock quite low, and quality of the current 
supply very low. For offices, demand levels are moderate but again 
quantum is q uite low and quality of available stock very low. If this 
supply issue is not addressed both in terms of quantity and 
quality, there is a risk that small business growth will be 
constrained, and that successful start -ups will relocate elsewhere.  
 
Existing  Employment Land Provision  
The Core Strategy 2011  set out a number of policies relating to 
supporting economic growth by allocating employment land, both on 
existing and new sites. A large number of local jobs are concentred in long -established employment estates such as Purdeys and Brook Road Industrial  Estates. The 
Core Strategy also identified a number of new sites for high -quality employment growth, 
including the Airport Business Park and Arterial Park proposals, both of which are under 
construction.   
The EDNA places Rochford District’s existing and f uture sites allocated for employment use into 
a number of clusters  around namely London Southend Airport; Purdeys; Great Wakering; 
Wallasea Island; Southend Arterial Road; and Rayleigh, Hockley & Ashingdon. These total 112ha 
of employment land. However thi s does not include all sites  currently  in employment use within 
the District, as some sites were de -allocated for employment use but remain significant 
employment centres (i.e. Star Lane Industrial Estate, Rawreth Lane Industrial Estate and Eldon 
Way Busin ess Park), whilst employment activities are prevalent on a number of other, informal 
sites, such as a number of farms and former agricultural sites.

Foundations for E conomic  Growth  
Adoption of the latest digital technologies is vital to ensuring local businesses and residents can 
access high -speed broadband, mobile and wireless networks, which in turn supports business 
productivity, economic growth, job creation and social inclusion. The COVID -19 pandemic has 
accelerated the move to remote and hyb rid working models and underlined the importance of 
robust digital infrastructure. Supporting such infrastructure across Rochford has the potential to 
help existing and new businesses work more effectively and grow their markets, whilst improved 
connectivi ty in remote rural areas creates new possibilities for running businesses and rural 
diversification. It brings opportunities  such as the ‘internet of things’ (the networking of a wide 
range of devices, buildings and other items) and ‘smart cities’ (integra ting technology to 
manage assets and provide data), enhancing possibilities for residents and businesses.  It also 
benefits the local population, who may be able to access a wider range of employment 
opportunities that require less commuting and pressure o n transport systems. Improving 
remote and home -working capabilities and reducing out -commuting in turn has the potential to 
benefit local high streets and retail by keeping more spending within the District.   
  
Ultra -fast broadband coverage in Rochford is presently limited, with only 8% of homes and 
business premises benefiting from fibre to the premises (FTTP) and download speeds of 1Gbit/s, 
the lowest coverage in South Essex.  It is vitally important that the new Local Plan lays the 
foundations for ultra -fast connectivity across the area if economic growth is to be delivered.  
 
As part of the Association of South Essex Local Authorities (ASELA), the Council has been 
successful in securing a share of £6.9m central Government funding to deploy a Local Full Fibre 
Network (LFFN) network to deploy gigabit -capability fibre broadband to  the District’s main 
towns and subsequently to villages and rural areas. With advances in mobile digital technology, 
it is recognised that securing full coverage of 4G and 5G (along with the required infrastructure) 
will be increasingly important in suppor ting a full range of future technologies in every part of 
the District.   
 
Barriers to Economic Growth  
 
Rochford District had a low unemployment rate of 3.6% in 2020, in comparison to the Great 
Britain average of 4.6%. However, the skills level of the worki ng age population is below the 
national average, with the proportions of those having attained NVQ3 Level 3 and above and 
NVQ Level 4 and above being 57.9% and 33.1% respectively. This is in comparison with national averages of 46.1% and 43.1% respectively . Full -time workers in the District earned an average 
weekly salary of £534.10, considerably below the East of England and Great Britain averages of 
£574.90 and £586.10 respectively. To help Rochford District’s population have the opportunity 
to access hig h-quality local employment opportunities, and in turn to have a skilled workforce to 
attract inward investment, it is important to improve skills levels and access to educational 
opportunities. Such measures could help address known skills shortages in key  local sectors, 
e.g., construction, engineering and advanced manufacturing. This could be achieved indirectly 
(e.g. supporting high quality broadband infrastructure and transport links to enable residents to 
learn remotely and access education facilities i n neighbouring areas), but also by considering 
whether sites should be identified for the provision of new further/higher education or training 
facilities. This is likely to be a longer -term aspiration, and could either be delivered locally or by 
working i n partnership with neighbouring South Essex local authorities to support a more 
strategic education institution.   
 
It is also important to acknowledge the implications of a  number of events that are likely to have 
a constraining impact on  how employment n eeds can be planned for:   
 
• Changes to the Use Classes Order  mean that traditional employment uses in B1 (office and 
light industrial), along with retail uses in classes A1/ A2/A3 and community uses in D1/ D2,  
now form a new “Class E ”, with  planning permission not required to move between such uses. 
This has implications for employment sites, with it being far more difficult to protect sites 
solely for employment use  as buildings may be converted to retail or leisure uses without 
local authority overs ight. This increased flexibility could  generate some economic benefits 
but equally could make it harder to influence the quality and quantity of employment space 
through planning policies and decisions  
 
• The COVID -19 Pandemic  has the potential to impact dem and for employment sites in a 
range of ways, with businesses in some sectors (e.g. hospitality and aviation supply chains) 
being vulnerable to the economic impact of the virus and restrictions, whilst in other sectors 
(e.g. logistics) there is potential th at additional space will be required as a result. The 
acceleration of remote working practices as a consequence could reduce requirements for 
traditional office space, but also has the potential to see increased demand for flexible 
workspace outside major cities such as London, as businesses seek a professional 
environment closer to home.   
 
49 
 
In planning for future employment growth in Rochford District, it should be considered whether 
existing employment site allocations are sufficient to support the needs of businesses now and 
in the future,  taking into account the need to accommodate whether this provides the right sites 
both to attract new business occupiers to invest, and to enable local businesses, particularly 
small enterprises and start -ups, to find the right workspace for them in terms  of quality and 
affordability. Providing the right mix of sites will help support wider business growth and 
investment, and increase employment opportunities in the District.  
  8. Requiring new developments of employment space to set aside a certain proportion 
for‘start -up’ (under  150m2) or ‘grow -on’ space, to meet identified needs for 
these types of smaller space  
9. Re-allocating and promoting further development on former employment sites still in 
employment use (e.g. Rawreth Industrial Estate, Eldon Way or Star Lane), to provide 
extra capacity, potentially in place of allocating new land .  
10. Working with partners to secure the delivery of ultra -fast connectivity across the 
District, including fibre -to-the-premises and mobile networks  
11. Working with neighbouring authorities to identify land for higher - or further -
education facilities where thi s would address current and future skills shortages  
Non -exclusive options for addressing our employment and skills needs through the plan 
include:  
1.Meeting future needs by a llocating existing and new employment sites for specific 
employment uses (e.g. offices or light industrial)  
2.Meeting future needs by allocating existing and new employment sites for more 
general employment uses allowing emp loyment sites to flexibly accommodate both 
employment and other uses  
3.Meeting future needs by prioritising the delivery of existing  employment land  
allocations  at Saxon Business Park, Michelin Farm (West of A1245) and Star Lane which 
may be sufficient to me et macro needs based on current evidence  
4.Meeting future needs by prioritising the delivery of new e mployment space alongside  
any new strategic  housing  developments (e.g. start -up business centres/co -working 
spaces or planning for live -work units).  
5.Meeting future needs by prioritising the expansion of existing employment sites, 
where adjacent plots can be easily developed to provide more workspace on 
established sites.  
6.Meeting future needs by prioritising the regularisation of informal e mployment  sites , 
such as those shown on Figure 30  
7.Promoting the intensification of employment uses on existing sites (e.g. encouraging 
the replacement of open storage yards with business units)

Future of London Southend Airport  
 
Rochford is home to London Southend Airport, which is a regionally important  airport that 
operates passenger services to  destinations primarily in Europe. The Airport also supports an 
element of freight and cargo movements.  
 
National policy recognises the importance of maintaining a national network of airfields and 
requires local planning authorities to plan for any large -scale transport facility needs in their 
areas (including airports). The Aviation Policy Framework (2013) and Beyond the Horizon Report 
(2018) sets out the Government’s ambitions regarding aviation, including:  
• To make best use of existing runway capacity  
• To ensure the aviation sector makes a significant contribution towards reducing global 
emissions  
• To ensure communities surrounding airports share in the economic benefits and adverse 
impacts such as noise are mitigated wherever possible  
• To limit and where possible reduce the number of people significantly affected by noise  
• That Government, local authorities and airports sh ould work together to improve air quality.  
 
It is recognised that a new Government Aviation Strategy is expected in Summer 2021, and 
future drafts of the new Local Plan will need to reflect its implications for local plan -making.  
 
The Council, jointly with  Southend -on-Sea Borough Council, recognise d the importance of 
managing the airport’s growth through pl anning in the preparation of the Southend Airport and 
Environs Jo int Area Action Plan (JAAP), adopted in 2014. The JAAP was a joint development plan 
docu ment, given that the Airport sits upon the administrative boundary of both Rochford and 
Southend -on-Sea. The JAAP itself sets out how the airport is expected to grow by 2031, 
including how development within the curtilage of the Airport itself  will be mana ged, and  how  
an associated business park , to be located to its west , is expected to come forward.  The Airport 
Business Park will accommodate over 100,000m2 of new employment floorspace, alongside 
supporting uses, and is expected to support around 5,000 add itional jobs.  
 In 2019/20 , the Airport served  approximately 2.1 million passenger s which was an increase of 
around 43% from 2019.  The Airport has l ong-term plans to increase passenger numbers  to 5 
million  and beyond , which we recognise will need careful management through the planning 
system. Whilst the Airport’s patronage and short -term growth has been  deeply  affected by 
economic circumstances both before and during the COVID -19 pandemic, including the loss of 
Flybe  and the withdrawal of Easyjet from its hub base , the Airport remains  well-placed to grow in 
the future , albeit it is recognised that this growth  may  now  take place over a longer period than 
previously envisaged.  
 
 
 
 
 
51 
 
The Airport currently benefits from a p lanning permission which limits the number of air traffic 
movements to 53,300 per year with around 37,000 movements taking place in the 2019 -20 
financial year. Whilst th e use of larger aircraft could allow passenger movements to increase to 
around 6 -8m per  year,  any longer -term growth aspirations  beyond 53,300 movements a year  
would require a new planning framework and agreement. This framework would  need to weigh 
up the various benefits and challenges presented by the Airport’s growth , including the strong  
economic benefits alongside air quality, traffic and noise considerations.  
 
In light of the Airport’s growth ambitions, it  is important that a proper planning framework is in 
place to update and /or replace the JAAP as appropriate. The Airport has stated i ts intention to 
prepare a masterplan to consider its future ambitions and land requirements. The development 
of a new planning framework  could include preparation of a new JAAP, jointly with Southend -
on-Sea Borough Council and in consultation with the Airp ort, Essex County and other 
stakeholders . 
 
The Airport’s growth to date has helped to deliver over 2,000 jobs alongside new infrastructure 
including a railway station and bus routes, as well as supporting successful funding bids for 
capacity improvements to the local road network. Further growth of  the Airport would be likely 
to deliver several thousand more jobs and potentially transformational improvements to the 
local transport network. The current Surface Access strategy identifies that around 35% of 
patrons arrive using sustainable transport an d it is clear any further growth at the Airport would 
need to be supported by even more ambitious volumes of sustainable transport usage.  
 
The Airport’s growth ambitions are likely to have a number of implications for the District which 
require careful con sideration, including:  
• The potential for significant  job creation  alongsi de improving the  economic attractiveness of 
business space in the District ( particularly  spaces that are  close to the Airport)  
• The potential to make the District more attractive to inward investment that may have wider 
benefits for existing residents  
• The p otential to improve  the access local residents  would have to a wider pool of domestic 
and overseas destinations  by air, for both business and leisure  • The potential impact that increased passeng er numbers would have on vehicle traffic 
movements  and congestion in the area and  the extent to which this can be mitigated by 
investment in rail and bus linkages  
• The potential need for a greater built footprint for the Airport, for both  core  operations and 
ancillary activities (such as car parking) , and the impact this would have on land availability 
and amenity in the area  
• The potential impact of increased aircraft movements on  both noise and air quality and the 
extent to which any negative implications can be effectively mitigated  
 
  
Given the ongoing u ncertainty surrounding the impact of Covid -19 on the aviation industry, 
it is not currently possible to identify precise land use requirements for the airport’s growth. 
Nevertheless, there are considered to be a number of options available relating to plan ning 
for the future of London Southend Airport. These are:  
1.To work alongside Southend -on-Sea Borough Council to prepare a new joint Area 
Action Plan, or masterplan, alongside each authority’s respective new Local Plan, that 
contains a consistent policy app roach to managing the Airport’s long -term growth 
ambitions  
2.To work alongside Southend -on-Sea Borough Council to ensure that policies 
contained within both authority’s respective Local Plans maintain a consistent policy 
approach, as far as is practicable, t o managing the Airport’s long -term growth 
ambitions  
3.To prepare a new Area Action Plan, or masterplan, to manage the Airport’s long -term 
growth ambitions, with suitable partner engagement but without the status of a 
statutory document  
4.To continue to make decisions based on the existing JAAP for the time being, but to 
consider developing a new Area Action Plan, or masterplan, after the new Local Plan is 
adopted or when the need arises

Biodiversity  
To protect and enhance biodiversity and geodiversity, national policy requires plans to:  
identify, map and safeguard components of local wildlife -rich habitats and wider  
ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international, national and locally  
designated sites of importance for biodiversity , and promote the conservation, restoration and 
enhancement of priority habitats,  ecological networks and the protection and recovery of 
priority species; and  identify and pursue opportunities for securing measu rable net gains for  
biodiversity.  
 
It is important that the plan protects and 
enhances areas within the District that are of 
importance for wildlife and biodiversity. Similarly, 
the plan will need to deliver cle ar net gains for 
biodiversity through its strategy, helping to 
mitigate the impacts of growth on the natural 
environment and promoting the conservation of 
important species.  
 
Biodiversity designations exist at a variety of 
levels, including:  
• International, including Special Protection 
Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of Conservation 
(SACs) and Ramsar sites  
• National, including ancient woodlands, 
national nature reserves and Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)  
• Local, including local wildlife  and 
geological sites and local nature reserves  
 
  
 
The District is home to a variety of these designations, including many international sites along 
its coast, an in -land SSSI at Hockley Woods, 14 areas of ancient woodland, 39 local wildlife sites 
and four local nature reserves. With the exception of local wildlife and geological sites, the 
designation of these areas is outside of the remit of the plan, but nevertheless their protection 
through the planning system is mandated by law and in national policy.

The Council is part of the Essex Coast Recreational disturbance Avoidance and Mitigation 
Strategy (RAMS) partnership which is a partnership of 11 local authorities in Essex aimed at 
appropriately avoiding and mitigating the impacts of new housing development on coastal 
habitats (through increased recreational disturbance). This partnership has already delivered a 
strategy and Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) which together aim to deliver a defined 
mitigation package financed through planning obligations. Over time, it will be important to 
update this strategy and mitigation package to ensure it takes account of the most up -to-date 
projections of housing growth across Essex. It is proposed that the plan supports the 
implementation of the Essex Coast RAMS strategy, and its updates, through an appropriate 
policy.  
 
We have also prepared a Local Wildlife Sites review to survey our existing local wildlife sites to 
assess their condition, whilst also considerin g whether other areas of land are worthy of 
protection as either a new local wildlife site or local geological site. This review followed a set of 
criteria as set out in national planning guidance and concluded that 8 new local wildlife sites 
should be des ignated, at:  
• Cherry Orchard Country Park  
• Marylands Nature Reserve  
• Buller’s Grove  
• Bartonhall Grove  
• Stannetts Creek  
• Barton Hall Creek Seawall  
• Ashingdon Pastures, and  
• Roundhill Pastures  
 
The review also highlighted that one existing site (Doggetts  Pond) had deteriorated in quality 
and no longer meets the standard for designation. In addition to local wildlife sites, the review 
also concluded that two areas of land were worthy of designation as local geological sites, at:  
• Hullbridge Foreshore  
• Star L ane Pits  
 
Other amendments to the boundaries of existing local wildlife sites were also recommended 
through the review reflecting up -to-date site conditions.  
 
It is recognised that an Environment Bill is expected later in 2021 which will mandate a new 
appr oach to securing net gains for the environment, including biodiversity. In anticipation of this requirement, n ational policy now requires plans to actively pursue opportunities for biodiversity 
net gain meaning t hat over the course of the plan, th e natural environment i s in a measurably 
better state than it was beforehand .  National guidance suggests that biodiversity net gain from 
development could be delivered on -site, off -site or a mixture of the two, and could involve 
measures such as new habitat  creation or incorporating wildlife -compatible measures into new 
developments such as ‘swift bricks’ or bat boxes. There is therefore now a clearer requirement 
for plans to set a baseline for biodiversity quality, and make sure that new developments and th e 
plan as a whole delivers net gain in a transparent way, such as using the Biodiversity Metric.  It 
will be important that the new Local Plan demonstrably delivers a net gain, including through 
the appropriate combination of options below.

or mitigates any gene rated impacts from the plan’s strategy (including through the 
Habitat Regulations Assessment and Essex Coast RAMS)  
2.Designating for protection areas of land of locally important wildlife or geological value 
as a local wildlife site or local geological site respectively where they meet the criteria for 
inclusion, having regard to the Local Wildlife Sites review  
3.Ensuring that the plan delivers net gains for biodiversity alongside new development, 
including to:  
a.Require new developments to secure biodiversity ne t gain on -site, such as 
through new habitat creation or incorporation of wildlife -compatible measures

Green and Blue Infrastructure  
Green and blue infrastructure relates to our network of natural and coastal environments. These 
are spaces that can contribute to the health and well -being of our communities in a number of 
ways, including through providing opportunities for leisure and recreation, providing attractive 
environments for tourism and investment and encouraging more active, sustainable lifestyles by 
creating connections for both people and wildlife.  
 
National policy is clear that plans should take a strategic approach to green  (and blue)  
infrastructure to help promote active and healthy lifestyles, combat climate change and alleviate 
air quality issues.  
 
Through the plan , it is important to consider where and what 
opportunities exist to grow and enhance our strategic green and blue 
infrastructure networks alongside future growth. By maximising 
opportunities for green and blue infrastructure we can help to achieve 
multiple benefits for our existing and future communities, including to:  
• Provi de a realistic and sustainable alternative to car use through a 
connected network of public rights of way and greenways  
• Help  to mitigate the impacts of future development  by securing 
net gains for nature and air  quality  
• Improv e the health and well -being of our residents by providing 
environments conducive to  leading  active lifestyles  
• Grow our rural and coastal economies by providing new 
opportunities for tourism and commer ce 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Our green and blue infrastructure network comprises a wide variety of different types of space, 
including formal parks of different  sizes, informal green areas, the open countryside and coastal 
environments. This section is focussed on strategic green and blue infrastructure, including how 
all of these spaces are connected and function as a  wider  network. More specific commentary on 
local green spaces and spaces for biodiversity is set out in later sections.

55 
 
Feedback from the Issues and Options consultatio n was generally supportive of improving 
green and blue infrastructure through the plan, with common concerns raised including:  
• Severance and lack of connectivity between public rights of way means the existing 
network does not function as a  reliable or  coherent option for active travel  
• Locational deficiencies in accessibility and provision have a  direct  negative impact on the 
health and well -being of residents  
• A lack of facilities in spaces outside of the main settlements restricts their attractiveness as 
leisure and tourism destinations  
 
The Council’s existing development plan supports two key strategic green infrastructure 
projects, the RSPB Wallasea Wild Coast Project  and Cherry Orchard Country Park . The 
establishment of these projects has been supported through the planning system  and dedicated 
policies could be included in the plan to enable these projects to continue to be supported.   
 
The South Essex Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy (SEGBIS ) identifies a number of 
additional  projects across South Essex that can together help to address green and blue 
infrastructure in a strategic sense. This includes working towards a  continuous  South Essex  
Estuary  Park, comprised of a number of regional par klands  and proposed primary and 
secondary ‘greenways’ . These regional parklands include two main areas in Rochford, including:  
• The Central Woodlands Arc  – a swathe of land from the south of Rochford to the west of 
Hullbridge  building from the existing, partially -connected green areas  of Cherry Orchard 
Country Park, Hockley Woods and Grove Wood  
• The Island Wetlands  – a swathe of land from the north of Shoeburyness to the north of 
Canewdon  building from a range of existing green  and blue areas including Wallasea 
Island and the shorelines of the Rivers Roach and Crouch  
Regional parkland does not necessarily mean that such areas would be entirely  given  over to 
public access but could be supported through the plan by  restricting the  influence of  urbanising 
development and improv ing access through more  connected an d permeable rights of way.  
Rochford is also home to part of the Government’s coastal path project which aims to deliver a 
continuous coastal path around the country. Once co mpleted, the coastal path project will open 
up parts of our coastal environments helping to support coastal communities and creating new 
opportunities for leisure and recreation for both existing  residents and visitors from elsewhere.   
Non -exclusive options for addressing green and blue infrastructure through the plan , includ e: 
1. Allocating specific areas of land for strategic green and blue infrastructure  through the plan , 
including the RSPB Wallasea Wild Coast Project, Cherry Orchard Cou ntry Park and those 
areas  identified  as priorities  in the  SEGBIS, and providing for the specific enhancement and 
protection  of this infrastructure  through  one or more specific policies  
2. Identifying general objectives for strategic green and blue infrastruct ure through the plan, 
and providing for the general enhancement and protection of this infrastructure through one 
or more general policies  
3. Setting a strategy for the delivery of new and enhanced green and blue infrastructure, by:  
a. Requiring certain n ew deve lopments to  provide local green and blue infrastructure on -
site, including to mitigate the specific local impacts of the development and 
contributing to the achievement of environmental net gains  
b. Requiring certain new developments to  contribute to  off-site strategic  green and blue 
infrastructure projects, including enhancing the wider strategic green and blue 
infrastructure network  to mitigate the impacts of new development and contribut ing 
to the achievement of environmental net gains  
4. Working with  neighbouring authorities to explore opportunities to address green and blue 
infrastructure across administrative boundaries

QUESTIONS

Community Infrastructure  
National policy requires plans to make sufficient provision, through strategic policies, for 
community facilities (including health, education, and cultural infrastructure). The delivery of 
new community infrastructure to meet the needs of the local community is crucial to the 
development of Rochford District as an attractive and healthy place to live and visit, and to meet 
the needs of future generations.  Community infrastructure will need to be delivered in locations 
that are acc essible to both existing  communities and future communities, and the Council will 
need to work closely with the providers of these facilities to ensure there is sufficient capacity.  
 
We recognise from previous engagement with communities, including through the Issues and 
Options  consultation, that many residents feel that the capacity of community infrastructure has 
not been able to keep up with population growth. It is therefore important that the Plan takes an 
infrastructure -first approach to planning, ensuring that any project ed deficits in provision are 
addressed.  The Council has prepared a joint Infrastructure Position Statement  to identify the 
capacity of current provision.  
 
Education  
 
National policy requires that  a sufficient choice of school places is available to meet the needs of 
existing and new communities.  New housing  and population increase will 
inevitably  bring an increased demand for school places. The planning and 
provision of school education is the responsibility of Essex County Council (ECC). 
However, since the introduction of academies and free schools in 2010,  the 
provision and operation of schools has shifted towards greater levels of 
institutional autonomy.  Academy schools are independent of local authority 
control, and are instead funded directly by central Government, and sponsors.  
Free schools have simil ar levels of autonomy, however, can be set up by a range of 
groups, including charities, universities, parents, teachers, businesses, and faith 
groups.  Although some schools have extra capacity, there may be need for more 
places to be made available or fo r completely new education facilities to be built. 
ECC publishes school capacity projections as part of its 10 Year Plan for School 
Places , which identifies some settlements with projected shortages in school 
places by 2030 , including Rochford, Gt. Wakering and Hullbridge.  
 
Beyond primary and secondary education, it is also important that the plan mak es 
adequate provision for other forms of education including facilities  
  
 
for early years and childcare, Post -16 and further education, special educational needs and 
disabilities, and adult community learning. E ach of these services may require effective planning 
to ensure that adequate land and capacity is available to address existing and future demand, 
either within the District or as part of a wider education network.  
 
Strategic growth locations are likely to  require new education facilities (particularly primary 
education), so the lack of current spare capacity does not restrict areas being considered for 
growth. However, it may have an impact on the type of growth which is possible – for instance, 
urban inte nsification may not allow for sufficient sized sites required for additional education 
facilities.  The Essex County Council Develope rs’ Guide to  Infrastructure  Contributions  highlights 
that developments with an individual or cumulative size of 1,400 homes are likely to be required 
to deliver a new two -form entry  primary  school, whilst developments with an individual or 
cumulative size of 4,500 homes or more  will need to provide a new two -form entry secondary 
school. One of the most effective ways of addressing educational capacity issues is through the 
provision of new s ervices funded by development. It is therefore important that new growth is 
not simply seen as creating additional demand for community infrastructure but also as one of 
the most effective tools at creating additional supply.  
Relevant Plan Objectives: 9, 14, 18, 19

Healthcare Facilities  
With a growing and ageing population, provision of health and community facilities and services 
in the District is going to become even more important. There is a need to provide health care 
facilities that meet existing and future needs, including those arising from the population 
growth across the plan period .  At this time, Castle Point and Rochfo rd Clinical Commissioning 
Group (CCG) hosts 28 practices, of which around half are in the District, which have an average 
practice list of around 8,000 residents , which, whilst lower than the national average, masks 
difficulties on some communities to acce ss healthcare services as quickly as needed.  A growing 
and ageing population is expected to exacerbate these issues and  new models of care are being 
considered to mitigate these issues.   
Future models of healthcare are likely to be less reliant on physica lly visiting a surgery, although 
that will remain an option, and a greater move towards online and digital consultations.  Physical 
healthcare centres may also be consolidated into hubs which contain a greater breadth and 
depth of services. It is therefore important that we create additional capacity for healthcare 
services through the plan, which may mean the creation of new physical healthcare hubs but 
also by enabling healthcare services to become more digital by improving the availability of fast 
connect ions.   
 
Shifting demographics and models of provision may have implications for the Local Plan, both in 
terms of ensuring that adequate land is available for healthcare services and in ensuring that the 
plan as a whole creates healthier outcomes across the  population to reduce  the need to access 
healthcare services as far as possible.  
Community and Other  Facilities  
The pl anning system can also play an important role in ensuring there are sufficient community 
and youth facilities to serve residents. These spaces are important for public health, networking 
and nurturing active communities. The plan can play an important role  in identifying where 
there is insufficient access or capacity in existing community and youth facilities and helping to 
deliver new facilities. This will be particularly important in any large -scale developments which 
will effectively create new communiti es and increased demand for hall and facility space.  
These other facilities can include:  
• Community Centres and Halls  
• Libraries  
• Allotments  
• Play Spaces  
• Waste and Recycling Centres   
The Plan will need to ensure that local communities have adequate access to these facilities, 
ideally by sustainable modes of transport, and will consider co -locating these facilities where 
possible. Where new growth is planned, developments that are not well -served by existing 
facilities will need to make adequate provi sion for new on -site facilities or make contributions to 
improving the capacity or accessibility of existing facilities, such as those set out in the Essex 
Developers’ Guide to Infrastructure contributions.  
 
 
 
  
Non -exclusive options for meeting community in frastructure needs through the plan include:  
1.Meeting future demand for community infrastructure by protecting existing school 
and healthcare sites through a specific allocation in the plan that allows for their 
managed expansion to meet changing demand for  services  
2.Meeting future demand for community infrastructure by identifying sites for the 
creation of new community infrastructure, where demand exists or will exist, which 
could include co -located and integrated community buildings funded by planning 
obligations from new development  
3.Meeting future demand for community infrastructure by requiring new developments 
to deliver new community infrastructure on -site where it creates sufficient demand to 
sustain them  
4.Helping to address existing shortfalls in commu nity infrastructure access or capacity by 
improving the availability of existing community facilities to a larger group in the 
community, such as making school facilities available for public hire subject to 
reasonable conditions

Open Spaces and Recreation  
Access to a network of high -quality open spaces and facilities for  sport and  
physical activity is important for the health and well -being of communities.  National policy 
requires plans to  be based on robust and up -to-date assessments of the need for  
open space, sport and recreation facilities (including quantitative or qualitative  
deficits or surpluses) and opportunities for new provision.  
 
Open  and green  space s can take many forms, from formal sports pitches to open areas within a 
development, linear corridors and country parks . The District is currently home to around over 
140 identified open spaces that exist in a mixture of public and private ownership. A div erse 
range of  formal and informal recreation take s place on  local  
playing pitches and in built facilities  (such as leisure centres).  
 
Through the preparation of the plan, it is possible to safeguard 
locally -important green  spaces from urbanisation through the 
‘local green space ’ designation. In order to qualify as local green 
space , an area needs to be:  
a) in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves;  
b) demonstrably special to a local community and holds a 
particular local significance, for example because of its 
beauty, historic significance, recreational value (including as 
a playing field), tranquility  or richness of its wildlife; and  
c) local in character and is not an extensive tract of land.  
Spaces proposed for local green space status are identif ied in the 
settlement profiles later in this Paper.  
 
In addition to local green spaces, there may also be other areas 
of land that do not hold unique local significance but 
nevertheless make a strong positive contribution to local well -
being worthy of prot ection and enhancement, such as country 
parks and woodlands.   
 
Feedback from the Issues & Options consultation was clear about  the importance of residents 
having access to well -maintained and accessible open and green spaces. Feedback also 
highlighted the need for a qualitative and quantitative audit of both open spaces and 
recreational facilities to consider ways to  enhance quality and access. Building from this 
feedback, t he Council has since sought to undertake  a number of studies to identify the current 
and future issues and opportunities relating to our open spaces and recreational facilities.   
The emerging  Open Space study  for the District  has assess ed the quality and accessibility of 
existing open spaces , including whether these open spaces may qualify as local green spaces. 
Through th is evidence base it has been possible to identify areas of in the District that do not 
Relevant Plan Objectives:  9, 15  
Figure 34: Map of Key Open Space and Leisure Assets   
 
59 
 
have suitable  walking  access to  any areas of  open space , including  parts of  central and eastern 
Rayleigh, northern Rochford, central Hullbridge and  many of the  outlying villages and hamlets. 
These comm unities  are those that may benefit most directly from the provision of new spaces.   
Playing Pitch and Built Facilities Studies  have been prepared to assess the  quality and 
adequacy of facilities for formal and informal sports and recreation.  These studies suggest that 
facilities  across the District are generally of good quality b ut that some local facilities  could 
benefit fr om enhancement . Existing and projected o verplay of pitches  is a particular  issue 
affecting the growth of local sports  clubs . Assuming around 7,200 homes are built by 2040, 
Sport England’s Playing Pitch Calculator identif ies an additional peak weekly demand  for up to 
18 match sessions for football at all levels , 1.8 match sessions for rugby union, 1.6 match  
sessions for hockey and 55 match sessions per season for cricket . However it is important to 
recognise that some of this  additional  demand ca n be met from improved utilisation of existing 
under -used pitches, whilst  an overarching recommendation from th ese studies is to explore the 
potential for  up to six new 3G pitches , which are generally able to sustain higher levels of use 
than grass pitches . A 3G Pitch Feasibility Study has now been prepared exploring opportunities 
at: 
• Burroughs Park (Great Wakering)  
• Clements Hall Leisure Centre  
• Greensward Academy  • Hullbridge FC  
• King Edmund School  
• Rayleigh Leisure Centre  
The Studies  both advocate a hierarchy approach to planning for re creational facilities, tiering 
facilities as hub -sites and key centres  with all other facilities being of local importance. Such an 
approach could be em bedded into the plan in order to prioritise and direct investment and 
renewal to th ose facilities of greatest importance.

Heritage  
Rochford is an area with a rich and diverse history that is reflected in the large number of historic 
buildings and public spaces scattered throughout it. A settlement was recorded at Rayleigh as 
far back as the Domesday book whilst the Old House in Rochfo rd can be dated back to 1270.  
 
National policy sets a clear requirement for plans to set a positive strategy for the conservation 
and enjoyment of the historic environment. It also makes it clear how historic assets should be 
conserved and enhanced through  the planning process.  
 
Local authorities are able to designate certain areas to 
protect their historic character. This includes designating 
formal conservation areas where stricter rules on 
development will typical ly apply. The District currently 
contains 10 conservation areas at:  
1. Battlesbridge  
2. Canewdon (church)  
3. Canewdon (high street)  
4. Foulness Churchend  
5. Great Wakering (high street)  
6. Paglesham Churchend  
7. Paglesham Eastend  
8. Rayleigh (centre)  
9. Rochford (centre)  
10. Shopland Churchyard  
 
Local authorities are able to designate new conservation 
areas where an area clearly holds special architectural or 
historic character.   
 
  
 
Each of the  District’s  conservation areas is covered by its own appraisal and management plan 
produced  in 2007 . These document s should be regularly reviewed and it is likely that a review 
will be required as part of the process for informing the new Local Plan.  This review can help to 
inform the specific c ontent of policies within the new Local Plan. The Council is not currently 
proposing to designate any new conservation areas, however if potential areas are suggested 
through this consultation, the merits of designating new areas can be considered.  
  Relevant Plan Objectives:  21 
Figure 35: Map of Key Heritage Assets   
 
61 
 
In addition to conservation areas, there are a number of other designated and non -designated 
heritage assets that must be protected and enhanced through the planning system. This 
includes scheduled monuments, nationally important archaeological sites, and list ed buildings, 
buildings designated by the Government for their special architectural or historic value.  
 
Assets that are of important architectural or historic value, but that are not of significant  enough  
value to be listed, can also be considered a non -designated heritage asset.  Non -designated 
heritage assets are buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified as having 
a degree of heritage significance meriting consideration in planni ng decisions but which do not 
meet the criteria for designated heritage assets . The Council currently has a Local List  SPD that 
identifies a number of non -designated heritage assets  throughout the District . Through the 
plan -making process, the Council could update this Local List to review the case for including 
existing non -designated heritage assets and considering the case for including new assets.  
 
Feedback from the Council’s Issues and Options consultation, including from Historic England, 
made clear that existing policies on heritage  assets and the historic environment  require 
updating to reflect changes  to national policy. Furthermore, reflecting feedback, the Council is 
committed to preparing a  Historic Impact Assessment (HIA) of the new Local Plan as it develops 
to ensure the impac ts of strategy and polic y decisions  on designated and non -designated 
heritage assets are given appropriate weight. T o support this, t he Council has commissioned  an 
initial site assessment of potential  development sites, considering their impacts on built a ssets 
and archaeology, having regard to the Essex Historic Environment Record.  
 
Non -exclusive options for  addressing heritage  through the plan, includ e: 
1. Reviewing the list of existing designated heritage assets , including updating conservation 
area appraisals and management plans and considering the case for new conservation areas, 
providing for the  protection and enhancement of these assets through one or more  policies  
2. Reviewing  the list of  existing non -designat ed heritage assets, including updating the local 
list, and providing for the protection and enhancement of these assets through policies

QUESTIONS

Town Centres and Retail  
The District ’s town centres of Rayleigh, Rochford and Hockley, along with local and village 
centres, are fundamental to everyday life for most residents and businesses, and are important 
contributors to local economy, community and identity. They provide a wide range o f both 
everyday (convenience) and specialist (comparison) retailers, in addition to food & drink, leisure, 
entertainment and service business, office accommodation; and key public facilities (e.g. 
healthcare, libraries and council services).  
 
The NPPF sta tes in Chapter 7 that planning policies should support the role that town centres 
play at the heart of local communities, by taking a positive approach to their growth, 
management and adaptation. Planning policies should:   
• define a network and hierarchy of town centres and promote their long -term vitality and 
viability – by allowing them to grow and diversify in a way that can respond to rapid 
changes in the retail and leisure industries, allows a suitable mix of uses (inclu ding 
housing) and reflects their distinctive characters;  
• define the extent of town centres and primary shopping areas, and make clear the range of 
uses permitted in such locations, as part of a positive strategy for the future of each centre;  
• retain and en hance existing markets and, where appropriate, re -introduce or create new 
ones;  
• allocate a range of suitable sites in town centres to meet the scale and type of 
development likely to be needed, looking at least ten years ahead. Meeting anticipated 
needs for retail, leisure, office and other main town centre uses over this period should not 
be compromised by limited site availability, so town centre boundaries should be kept 
under review where necessary;  
• where suitable and viable town cen tre sites are not available for main town centre uses, 
allocate appropriate edge of centre sites that are well connected to the town centre. If 
sufficient edge of centre sites cannot be identified, policies should explain how identified 
needs can be met in  other accessible locations that are well connected to the town centre;  
• recognise that residential development often plays an important role in ensuring the 
vitality of centres and encourage residential development on appropriate sites.  
 
 
  
 
Town centres and local centres  play an important 
role in  supporting vibrant and prosperous local 
communities. Town centres need to be multi -
functional offering the right balance of 
comparison and convenience shopping, 
hospitality and leisure, community and civic 
facilities and residential. It must be recognised 
that retail -dominant town centres are struggling 
in light of ong oing structural changes happening 
in high streets and town centres across the 
country . As a result, a  key determinant of ‘
success ful planning for our local town centres  
will be the ir ability to adapt to new trends, 
technologies and practices , ma intaining vibrancy 
in the face of change.  
 
The Coronavirus pandemic has had a 
catastrophic effect on the UK retail and leisure 
industries, with a series of restrictions  resulting in  enforced closures for most retail and leisure 
businesses, along with addit ional costs and capacity restrictions as and when businesses have 
been permitted to operate. At the same time  and as a consequence , demand for online retail has 
jumped considerably . The impact on retail and leisure has been severe, with the first half of 2 020 
seeing a net loss of 7,834 retail units, the highest on record , with national chains particularly hit . 
The pandemic i s expected to accelerate ongoing trends of certain traditional town centre uses 
moving to online services, including banks and comparison retail. The re is , however,  some 
evidence that local town centres  such as those in the District  have seen less of an impact in 
terms of footfall and vacancies than larger cities and shopping centres, reflecting both a 
preference to shop locally a nd the trend away from commuting towards home -working.  
It is important , however, to recognise that town centres were und er considerable pressure  prior 
to the pandemic,  due to both growth in online retail and competition from out of town retail 
parks, shop ping centres and supermarkets, with retail parks in particular having experienced 
lower vacancy rates in recent years . Town centres across the country are  therefore  being re -
Relevant Pla n Objectives:  7, 8 
 
 
63 
 
imagined away from retail -led approaches  towards more mixed -use approaches that se e a 
greater proportion of food & drink, leisure , residential  and community uses . These ‘
experiential ’ uses,  along with services such as hairdressing and beauty, are more resilient to 
online shopping trends and can help drive wider footfall.  
It is also im portant to recognise that the planning tools available to local authorities to influence 
the use of town centres are evolving with  changes to planning legislation. The introduction of a 
new Use Class E  has seen the consolidation of traditional town centre  use classes  A1, A2 and A 3 
(retail, professional/financial services and restaurants/cafes  respectively ), B1 (office and light 
industrial) and aspects of D1/2 (community uses) into a new single Use Class E, with planning 
permission not required to change the use of a building between any of those uses . Whilst  the 
flexibility provided by the new  Class E may help town centres become more resilient and 
adaptable, with entrepreneurs able to readily convert vacant units for new purposes and thus 
reduce vacancy rate s, it introduces a challenge for Local Plan policies to promote or restrict 
particular uses  in town centre  or to prevent a clustering of certain types of undesired uses . This 
change, combined with the introduction of expanded permitted development  rights which will 
allow Class E buildings  to become homes  without the need for planning permission , further 
restrict the scope of town centre policies to promote and restrict particular uses with town 
centres. This presents both opportunities and challenges  for town centre planning , with 
increased levels of housing potentially increasing  footfall for town centre  businesses and making 
such places more vibrant and sustainable,  but a lack of res trictions also risks the loss of 
important town centre businesses where residential development is likely to provide greater 
returns for the landowner.  
The South Essex Retail Study 2018  (SERS)  is a key piece of evidence that assesses  current retail 
and leisure provision across the District, and calculates, based on expenditure and housing 
growth projections, how much additional space may need to be developed to provide the local 
population with a full range of shops and services  they require. Over the next 20 years, Rochford 
District is estimated to need an additional 5,179 m2 of comparison retail space , and 1,077 m2 of 
convenience retail space  as population and annual retail expenditure in the District grows. In 
addition, there is poten tial for an additional £40m of food and drink expenditure to be provided 
for, meaning a sizeable potential requirement for further food & drink space.  
The figures above indicate a longstanding trend within the District in which development of 
retail and l eisure space has not kept up with population growth which has led to only more basic 
needs being accommodated locally, whilst the need for more complex uses (e.g. larger 
supermarkets, premium restaurants or cinemas) has been met by residents travelling els ewhere. This is reflected in the study, which indicates the potential for a niche cinema offer and further 
food & beverage provision alongside future housing growth.  
As set out in the Study,  Rochford District has one of the highest ‘leakage’ rates for residents 
travelling elsewhere for retail needs across South Essex, with 68% of residents going elsewhere 
for comparison shopping and 57% for convenience. Similarly, for food and drink leisure, the 
leakage figure is 33%. This is unsurprising, given the proximity of major centres such as  Basildon 
and Southend, but does indicate additional potential for retail and leisure space within the 
District  and a retention of a greater amount of retail and l eisure spend.  
As indicated above, Rochford is not self -sufficient in terms of retail, and sits within the context of 
wider South Essex  retail area , with residents travelling to other local and regional centres for 
shopping and services, whilst the District ’s centres in turn attracts residents from other areas to 
visit and shop. The SERS categorises South Essex centres by importance, from Regional ( e.g. 
Lakeside Shopping Centre), through to ‘Major’ (e.g. Basildon and Southend), ‘Town’ and 
‘Local’ centres, wi th the map below plotting these. Rochford, Rayleigh and Hockley are all 
identified as ‘town centres’, however the absence of major or regional centres  underlines 
Rochford ’s relatively minor role in relation to retail provision across the wider South Essex  sub-
region.  
 
National policy encourages plans to identify town centre hierarchies, with those centres at the 
top of the hierarchy those that are the most important for retail and leisure provision. Figure 36  
below illustrates a local hierarchy for Rochford . 
 
Hierarchy  Centres  
Town Centres (Protected)  There are 3 town centres in Rayleigh, 
Rochford and Hockley which house over 30 
businesses  
Local Centres (Unprotected)  There are a small number of local centres, 
including Hullbridge, Great Wakering and 
Golden Cross which serve local populations  
Local Parades (Unprotected)  There are large number of local parades 
throughout the District, generally located in 
suburban areas

Figure 37 – Hierarchy of Centres in South Essex (S outh Essex Retail Study, 2017)  
The Core Strategy, through policies RTC1 -6, follows prevailing national policy in encouraging 
retail and leisure uses to concentrate in the District ’s established town, village and 
neighbourhood centres, adopting a sequential test to restrict out of town development. 
Dedicated Area Action Plans (AAPs)  were adopted in 2014 for Rayleigh, Rochford and Hockley, 
with these seeking to protect and enhance eac h town ’s role as a retail centre, whilst promoting 
other uses and interventions to support their general vitality. In considering the District ’s future 
retail and leisure needs, it is useful to consider each of the District ’s main centres in turn, 
includin g their role in the context of the District and wider area, and whether the current AAPs 
have delivered the anticipated change.  
Rayleigh  
Rayleigh is a  market town and the District ’s principal shopping destination. The SERS noted its 
wide comparison and c onvenience offer, which serves the town and the surrounding villages. It 
is ranked 716th nationally, according to the Javelin Research VENUESCORE  system of ranking 
retail centres in terms of their offer. Rayleigh ’s AAP sought to strengthen the town ’s role as the 
District’s primary retail centre, promoting the consolidation of retail along the High Street, 
along with promotion of town centre -appropriate uses (i.e. A2 -5, leisure and  
cultural/community) in the surrounding streets. It also prioritised inte nsification of key sites for mixed -use development and a series of public realm, highways and cycle/pedestrian 
improvements, to ease access around the town and tackle longstanding congestion issues.  
In 202 1, Rayleigh continues to be the District ’s main retail hub, with a February 2020 assessment 
of ground floor uses along Government -approved ‘health check ’ principles indicating the 
town centre continues to be well -occupied, with a good proportion of A1 retail uses (both 
comparison and convenience), strong mix of supporting A2 -5 uses and low vacancy rate (see 
map below). It is recognised that the Coronavirus pandemic has lead to a small increase in 
vacancies since this mapping was prepared , including the prominent former Dorothy Perkins 
store.  
Figure 38 – Rayleigh Town Centre Use  Class  Mapping ( 2020)  
Rochford  
Rochford is a small market town with relatively high proportion of convenience floorspace 
reflecting its position in the retail hierarchy, Rochford has a localised catchment that includes 
the surrounding rural villages. Its national VENUESCORE ranking of 2,577 reflect s it is 
considerably smaller than Rayleigh. The Rochford AAP prioritises the concentration of retail and 
supporting uses around the historic market square, West Street and North Street, whilst 
 
 
65 
 
proposing a range of public realm, highways and connectivity en hancements to support the 
historic core and attract visitors, including pedestrianisation of the market square. It also 
supports a stronger evening economy through encouraging appropriate uses, and intervention 
on key underused/unattractive sites to improv e the overall built environment and support town 
centre vitality. Since the AAP ’s publication, there has progress in some areas , including 
proposals to develop the former police station and underused space behind the Freight House, 
a historically -sensitive residential scheme on East Street proposals to redevelop the key arrival 
point on the junction of West Street and Union Lane. There has be en more limited progress in 
other areas,  with a 2019 Health Check carried out by Lichfields finding high vacancy rates of 
14.5%, higher than previous surveys undertaken in 2008 and 2014, and above the national 
average of 11.8% .  
Although work has commenced since the health check on some prominent vacant buildings 
(e.g. the conversion of the former Barclays Bank at 15 West Street into a pharmacy, and the 
former NatWest Bank at 32 West Street int o office suites), the issue of vacant units remains 
considerable, typified by a longstanding empty former supermarket unit. In addition, the closure 
of 2 public houses since 2017 suggests that efforts to enhance the town ’s retail and leisure role 
have not advanced either. The map below indicates the prevalence of vacant units in Rochford 
Town Centre in 2019. Similarly, proposals to enhance the public realm of the market square and 
introduce connectivity improvements are yet to proceed. As with Rayleigh, the  impending redevelopment of a number of Council assets may enable regeneration objectives to be met, 
but may necessitate a revisiting of policies  to create a  more sustainable long -term mix of uses in 
light of the structural issues covered in this section.  
Hockley  
 
Hockley provides a smaller centre, described by the SERS as serving a largely localised 
catchment area, and as such does not have a VENUESCORE rank. Hockley hosts a number of 
important convenience retail, service and food & drink/leisure uses, and Hockley AAP identifies 
its adjacent Eldon Way Industrial Estate as being an opportunity site, due to its potential for 
mixed -use development. Combined with a location close to a railway station, Hockley Town 
Centre has considerable potential to support new residential, business, re tail and leisure uses. 
The AAP envisages a Hockley combining enhanced retail for the local community, the mixed -use 
redevelopment of Eldon Way to deliver housing, town centre uses and public realm on 
previously developed land, and the retention of some emp loyment uses. Some progress has 
been made through the opening of an additional convenience retail store (Sainsburys) to 
complement the existing Co -Op and Costcutter supermarkets, and vacancy rates are healthy. 
However, the key component of Hockley ’s transf ormation remains unachieved, with Eldon Way 
remaining as an industrial estate with a high proportion of leisure uses, and poor connectivity 
with the wider town centre persisting.

66 
 
Outside the three  main town centres, it is important to acknowledge the District ’s other retail 
centres , each of which will require careful planning to ensure they support a long -term 
sustainable and balanced mix of uses.  
• Southend Airport Retail Park  – the District ’s main out of town retail centre, with a range 
of comparison retailers, e.g. homeware, furniture, pet supplies. It has a VENUESCORE rank 
of 1,709, and is a significant draw, despite only being accessible from Southend Borough.  
• Village centres  and neighbourhood shopping parades , such as Great Wakering; 
Hullbridge; Golden Cross; Eastwood Road; Southend Road; Grove Road; London Road; and 
Hullbridge Road. These centres fulfil important  local  roles, primarily for convenience retail, 
services (e.g. hairdressing) and food & drink. new housing development has the potential 
to benefit businesses in such centres . 
• Industrial estates, garden centres and farm sites: although not formally allocated, the 
District ’s industrial estates host a number of retail and leisure uses, whilst garden centres 
and former nurseries within the Green Belt house others. Such sites fulfil a demand, but 
require careful planning to avoid exacerbating existing issues around traffic cong estion, 
parking and environmental impact.  
A number of non -exclusive options for addressing town centre and retail needs through the 
plan include:  
1.Producing new dedicated masterplans or area action plans f or Rayleigh, Rochford and 
Hockley, updating these to reflect local and national  changes and providing a new 
positive vision for uses within these centres    
2.Incorporating specific town centre policies for Rayleigh, Rochford and Hockley within 
the new Local Plan, reflecting local and national changes and providing a new positive 
vision for uses within these centres  
3.Continuing to define  boundaries, primary  and secondary retail frontages for each centre 
and developing a policy approach that restrict appropriate  uses within each type of 
frontage  
 
OPTIONS  4. Continuing to define  primary and secondary retail frontages for each centre but allow 
the market to determine the most appropriate uses for those frontages within Class E  
5. Encouraging a greater quantity of housing within centres in support of Strategy Option 
1: Urban Intensifi cation (including using the brownfield register to define sites in town 
centres that are considered generally appropriate for residential development)  
6. Ensuring any large -scale new housing or employment developments c reate new 
neighbourhood centres to serve  them, or alternatively provide for sustainable 
connections to existing centres   
7. Allocating land with town centres or other appropriate locations for new retail and 
leisure developments  
8. Restricting out -of-town retail and leisure development unless it can b e demonstrated 
by that the development cannot be accommodated in town centres or other sites 
allocated for such uses

QUESTIONS

Transport and Connectivity  
Due to its peninsula location, Rochford is an area that has a relatively  constrained and varied  
transport network  for walking, cycling, public transport and private vehicles.  
 
Whilst many residents are dependent on use of 
private car s, it is important that we plan for a 
District that makes best use of more sustainable 
and active forms of movement. This is important  
for a number of reasons, including:  
• To promote active and healthy lifestyles 
where private vehicles are not the favoured 
mode of travel for short trips  
• To reduce congestion on roads and the emergence of consequential issues such as poor 
air quality  and cl imate change  
• To encourage a more positive relationship between public transport patronage, 
investment and reliability  
 
National planning policy states that t ransport issues should be considered 
from the earliest stages of plan -making , so tha t: 
• the potential impacts of development on transport networks can be 
addressed  
• opportunities from existing or proposed transport infrastructure, 
and changin g transport technology and usage, are realised  
• opportunities t o promote walking, cycling and public transport use 
are identified  and pursued;  
• the environmental impacts of traffic and transport infrastructure 
can be  identified, assessed and taken into account – including 
appropriate  opportunities for avoiding and miti gating any adverse 
effects; and  
• patterns of movement, streets, parking and other transport 
considerations are integral to the design of schemes, and 
contribute to making high quality places.  
 
Sustainable Travel  
The District has a relatively expansive public rights of way network both 
within settlements and in the open countryside. However our   
 
footpaths and bridleways are of varying quality and often do not reach the place s walkers, cyclist 
and equestrian users want to go. We also recognise that our cycling network is particularly 
limited and requires expansion to better reflect the ‘desire lines’ of our residents and to become 
a realistic alternative to the private car for  more people. The Rochford Cycling Action Plan  
identifies a number of potential costed routes, primarily to link Rochford, Raylei gh and Hockley. 
One way we help to deliver these, and other, routes is by preparing a Local Walking and Cycling 
Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) alongside the plan to identify and deliver specific improvements to 
these networks.  
•  
The District is connected to Lo ndon and Southend by the Southend Victoria branch of the Great 
Eastern Mainline, with stations in Rayleigh, Hockley, Rochford and at Southend Airport. This rail 
connection forms an important commuting route for local residents and key asset for the local 
economy, however it struggles with capacity at key times. It is important through the plan that 
we consider ways of improving capacity both on trains and at stations, taking on board the

findings of the Great Eastern Mainline Study. However we recognise it is also important that this 
is considered against any longer -term economic trend towards home working, which may have 
been accelerated as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
Bus connectivity is relatively more varied with a number of routes serving the mai n towns of 
Rochford, Rayleigh and Hockley, with relatively more infrequent services in Hullbridge and Great 
Wakering. These bus services primarily provide inter -urban services to other towns and villages 
in the District, as well as to towns in neighbouring  areas such as Basildon, Chelmsford, Castle 
Point, Wickford and Southend -on-Sea. There is a role for the plan in improving the frequency 
and reliability of existing bus routes, by locating development in areas which could benefit from 
these improvements, a s well as ensuring developments have good access to viable existing and 
proposed routes to make sure these are a realistic choice for residents.  
 
Road Connectivity  
The District benefits from two main strategic routes , the A127 and the A130, which both act as 
economic corridors and provide connectivity beyond our borders to  Southend, Basildon, 
London and Chelmsford  via the A12, A13 and M25 . These are supported by a network of 
important inter -urban routes , including the  A129 , A1015, A1245 , B1013,  Rawreth Lane, 
Ashingdon Road and Lower Road , which together connect our towns and villages to one 
another.  Rochford’s road network is known to have congestion issues primarily focussed along 
the main routes detailed above and at  key junctions along those routes. Many of the District’s 
congestion issues arise from the relatively few alternatives that residents have, particularly to 
make north -south journeys. In some cases, towns and villages are only connected by one viable 
route which often becomes congested at key times.  
 
It is recognised from feedback from the Issues and Options consultation that many residents 
experience major congestion on our road network  and feel that the road network has not kept 
up with increased demand i n recent years . Whilst new developments can only mitigate their own 
impact, and not e xisting congestion, it is clear that a more ambitious approach is required to 
connectivity  if we are to keep growing . We must  work with Government, Highways England, 
Essex  County Council and neighbouring local authorities to make sure we can attract investment 
to deliver real change, including  a potential South Essex Rapid Transit system,  new link roads 
and junction improvements.  Plans already exist for improvements to the Fairglen interchange to 
improve journey time reliability when interchanging between the A127, A1245 and A130 , whilst 
an A127 taskforce has been established to explore long -term options for improving journey time reliability on this key  corridor.  Whilst roa d and junction improvements will be an important 
part of the plan, a strategy based  solely around the private car  is likely to simply reinforce 
current trends,  and we  must  put in place complementary measures that deliver a modal shift in 
both existing and new communities towards more sustainable options  wherever possible.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Non -exclusive options for addressing transport and connectivity through the plan are to:

of transport are prioritised in favour of private vehicles  
2.Prepare an Infrastructure Delivery Plan alongside the plan to ensure new development 
delivers meaningful improvement s to transport networks, including to cycling, 
walking, public transport and road  
3.Prepare a Local Walking and Cycling Infrastructure Plan or Cycling Delivery Plan 
alongside the plan to identify and deliver specific improvements to our walking and 
cycling n etworks, including costed schemes highlighted in the Rochford Cycling 
Action Plan  
4.Work with Government, Highways England, Essex County Council and neighbouring 
local authorities to deliver meaningful new transport options, such as rapid transit 
solutions a nd a long -term solution to the A127

Green Belt and Rural Issues  
Whilst the majority of Rochford’s residents live in urban areas, the vast majority of Rochford’s 
land area is rural in nature . We have an important agricultural heritage and a strong and 
growing rural economy.  
 
Our rural areas have unique  planning challenges  compared to urban areas. O ur rural 
communities generally have the poore st access to facilities, as the catchment population is not 
sufficient to sustain many services , whilst land uses in rural areas are often very different to those 
in the urban areas, with far more agricultural, horticultural and informal economic activity.  
Addressing these challenges is made complicated by the fact that the majority of our rural land 
is designated as part of the Metropolitan Green Belt meaning that new development is generally 
restricted, save for some exceptions  for agricultural and forestry development.  
 
Over 12,000 hectares of our land area is covered by the eastern extent of the Metropolitan 
Green Belt. The Metropolitan Green Belt is a 
planning designation that restricts development in 
areas around cities to prevent urban sprawl and 
prevent neighbouring t owns merging into one 
another. Green Belt areas of the District which are 
sensitive for this reason include between Rayleigh 
and Eastwood, Rayleigh and Hockley, and Hawkwell 
and Rochford. National policy makes it clear that 
Green Belt boundaries should onl y be changed in 
exceptional circumstances. Before concluding that 
exceptional circumstances exist to justify changes to 
Green  Belt boundaries, a local authority will need to 
demonstrate that it has examined fully all other 
reasonable options for meeting its  
identified need for development , including to  
  
 
 
make as much use as possible of suitable brownfield sites and underutilised  
land;  encourage higher densities in existing urban areas and check with neighbouring 
authorities whether they can accommodate our need for development in their area. Whilst no 
detailed changes to our Green Belt boundary are being proposed in this consultation paper, it is 
recognised elsewhere in this document that we are unlikely to have su fficient urban and 
brownfield sites to meet our need for housing , employment or community facilities , and 
neighbouring authorities have advised they are unlikely to be able to accommodate any of 
Rochford’s needs themselves.  We have therefore completed a Gr een Belt study to consider the 
contribution that different parts of our District make to Green Belt policy  to inform an 
assessment of whether exceptional circumstances are likely to exist.

National policy makes it clear that i n rural areas, planning polic ies and decisions should be 
responsive to local  circumstances and support housing developments that reflect local needs.  
To promote sustainable development in rural areas, national policy encourages housing to be 
located  where it will enhance or maintain the vitality of rural communities. However this needs 
to be balanced against the  likelihood of the housing introducing or sustaining services . It is 
unlikely , for example,  that building a small amount  housing in a hamlet  will improve the vitality 
of these communities. However, w here there are clusters of  smaller settlements  in one area , 
such as to the east of Rochford , it is recognised that managed development in one village may 
benefit rural communities in a wider area.  
 
Rural exception sites are small sites located in rural areas that are excepted from usual rules in 
order to  allow affordable housing to be built. These are different from usual housing  or 
employment  sites in that they seek to address the needs  of the local community by 
accommodating hous eholds or businesses who are either current residents or  have an existing 
family or employment connection . It may be possible to introduce rural exception sites in some 
of rural villages . Villages we believe could support rural exception sites are:  
• Canewdo n 
• Paglesham  
• Rawreth  
• Stambridge  
 
Rural exception sites are likely to be small and therefore are u nlikely to be of a sufficient size to 
introduce new on -site services and facilities but they nevertheless can provide a source of new 
housing  and employment  that directly helps existing residents (such as local first -time buyers)  
alongside  increas ing the catchment population for rural facilities  which may help to sustain  less-
profitable  services (such as rural schools, shops and bus routes) or help those services to expand 
(such as a bus route becoming more frequent)  
 
 
 
   
Non -exclusive options for addressing rural issues through the plan, include:  
1.Designating rural exception sites on the edge of rural villages to provide affordable 
housing only  
2.Designating rural exception sites on the edge of rural villages and allowing a mix of 
both market and affordable housing on these to improve deliverability and viability  
3.Designating rural except ion sites on the edge of rural villages and working with the 
community to deliver a community -led housing scheme potentially with self - or 
custom -build plots made available to local residents  
4.Delivering exception sites in rural locations where these would benefit local businesses 
unable to find other suitable premises  
5.Not designating any rural exception sites and instead considering whether to locate 
development in rural villages as part of a wider strategy  
OPTIONS  
Q54. Do you feel that the plan should identify rural exception sites? If so, where 
should these be located and what forms of housing or employment do you feel 
need to be provided? [Please note you may wish to comment on the use of 
specific areas of land in the  next section]  
 
Q55. Are there any other ways that you feel the plan should be planning for the 
needs of rural communities?  [Please stare reasoning]  
 
QUESTIONS

Planning for Complete Communities  
 
 
We recognise that Rochford’s urban -rural mix is a key part of its character . Unlike more 
urbanised areas, Rochford is home to a number of distinct neighbourhoods each of which has its 
own strengths, challenges, character and sense of community.  
 
Above el se, we believe our new Local Plan should  support the achievement of a wider vision for 
the District by understanding and achieving  individual visions for our individual communities . 
We recognise that each community  has its own  natural, built and cultural h eritage that should 
be understood both individually and as part of the wider District and region.  
 
We hope to complement this community vision approach with adopting the core principles of 
creating complete communities . By complete communities, we mean  create places that possess 
the necessary services for  citizens to lead  healthy and happy daily lives which are located close -
by so that most of the community can access them  on foot, cycle or by public transport.  The 
more services a place has, and the easier to access those services are, the more complete that 
place can be considered to be.  We have considered how complete our existing communities  are 
using heatmapping, which is shown at Figure 43. 
 
Whilst it may be possible to make communities more complete th rough supportive planning 
policies, it may be in some locations that new development can be tied to new facilities more 
directly and intelligently than before to make sure the benefits of development genuinely reach 
those already resident in a community. H owever, we recognise that some communities, 
particularly small villages, will never become ‘complete’ . Whilst residents of these communities 
are likely to be benefit from having more facilities  close at hand, there is not a sufficient 
population in these p laces to make service provision viable even with a small amount of new 
development. It is therefore important to consider our communities as a network and explore 
how improving the completeness of one community might help serve residents elsewhere.  The com plete communities model we are looking at prioritises access to facilities by sustainable 
means. This means primarily through walking, but also through cycling and using public 
transport. We recognise that  private vehicles are an important part of daily li fe and that the 
provision of new and improved roads will be an important part of the plan. Nevertheless, in 
thinking about how to make  our communities  more ‘complete’, we believe that relating the 
location of services with walkability and public transport nodes  can help  us achieve wider 
benefits for communities in terms of  their  health and wellbeing, reducing pollution  within towns  
and nurturing more active communities.  
 
In each of the following settlement profiles, we consider what the vision for that settlement 
should be and ways in which the completeness  of the settlement  could be improved. We also 
include a  diagram displaying the existing level of completeness  defined by the percentage of 
the settlement that has walking access to facilities. The diagram shows walkability to six types of 
facility: education, health, civic, sport and leisure, green and town centre, with each additional 
segment illustrating 25% walking cov erage up to 4 segments demonstrating 100% of that 
settlement is within walking distance of at least one facility. See our Complete Communities 
Topic Paper at https://rochford.oc2.uk  for more information.  
 
Lastly, each profile includes a map showing the location of key assets and constraints, alongside 
land being promoted through the plan,  to allow you to consider how the  vision  for your 
settlement can be supported by providing new housing, jobs and infrastr ucture on  land in and 
around the settlement.

Draft Vi sion statement for Rayleigh  
In 2050 , Rayleigh should be a thriving town with a wide range of shops and services, vibrant 
town centre, functional and reliable transport system with all residents living within walking 
distance of a local green s pace. It shou ld provide for a diverse range of housing and job  
opportunities meeting the needs of  all in the community, whilst retaining its strong historic and 
cultural character.  Rayleigh  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rayleigh  is proposed to be our only Tier 1 settlement reflecting it s status as the District’s  main 
town, being home to the largest population and providing the greatest number and variety of 
services.  Rayleigh is the principal centre of services  for over half the District’s  residents and 
businesses , including large communities beyond its own boundaries in Rawreth and Hullbridge  
parishes . It is the District’s largest retail centre and has the largest supply of business premises. 
Rayleigh has a dem ographic split that sits roughly at the District average, but has a particularly  
large commuting population, benefitting from its status as a hub for local rail and bus services, 
and its easy access to the A127, A1245, A129 and A130.  
 
As can be seen from t he completeness mapping , Rayleigh benefits from a  good  standard  of 
walking access to most day -to-day services. The areas of Rayleigh with the best walking access 
to services are around its town centre, with other strong areas to the west along London Road.  
Overall, even those parts of Rayleigh outside of the walking catchment of services benefit from 
good levels of access overall, particularly along the spines of Rawreth Lane, Hockley Road  and 
Eastwood Road. Despite the good range of services provided, the capacity of infrastructure in 
Rayleigh is known to be a challenge, and opportunities to improve completeness through the 
plan are likely to be best targeted at improving the capacity and coverage of services, 
particularly within its suburbs.

Vision statement for R ochford and Ashingdon  
In 2050 , Rochford and Ashingdon  should remain the gateway to our rural countrysi de and grow 
its service base and sustainable connectivity to ensure all residents within its catchment are 
provided for and that localised deprivation can be reduced to near zero. Its town centre should 
be reimagined to become a more sustainable and vibran t space whilst retaining its historic 
character. It should make the most of its proximity to key employment sites and London 
Southend Airport to significantly grow its economic potential and the range of jobs it provides 
for. Rochford and Ashingdon  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rochford and Ashingdon  together form a functionally -connected settlement  home to around 
18,000 residents. Between Rochford town centre and a number of neighbourhood centres 
located throughout the wider settlement, the settlement provides for a reasonably wide range 
of services and business space s, including  a number of specialist employment areas  supporting 
nearby London Southend Airport. Beyond its immediate boundaries, Rochford and  Ashingdon 
forms a particularly important service base for residents in the villages of Great Stambridge, 
Canewdon and Paglesham, including for both education and healthcare.  Rochford and 
Ashingdon has a slightly younger population tha n the District averag e and has localised areas of 
deprivation where health outcomes fall be low the District average.  
 
As can be seen from the completeness mapping, residents of Rochford and Ashingdon benefit 
from  good walking access to most services, with the most complete parts of the settlement 
falling around and to the north of Rochford town centre. Walking access to services remains 
relatively good along the length of Ashingdon Road but dissipates into the res idential area. The 
only parts of Rochford with particularly poor access to services are around Purdeys industrial 
estate and the residential neighbourhoods of Ashingdon village.  Opportunities to improve 
completeness include in the provision of leisure serv ices, addressing capacity issues and 
improving the reliability and frequency of public transport connections to nearby villages.

Vision statement for Hock ley and Hawkwell  
In 2050 , Hockley and Hawkwell should be the District’s gateway to the green lung of the Upper 
Roach Valley, making the most of its access to ancient woodland and a network of nature 
reserves. Its town and neighbourhood centres should be vibrant places with an emphasis on 
independent businesses and providing for a diverse range of jobs. Deprivation should continue 
to be largely absent from Hockley and Hawkwell however housing affordability should have 
been addressed to ensure that local fi rst-time buyers can greater afford to live locally.  Hockley and Hawkwell  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hockley and Hawkwel l are two distinct places that form a functionally connected settlement in 
the heart of the District. Home to around 16,000 people, the settlement provides for a 
reasonable range  of services t hat serve both its own residents and a small number of villages  
beyond its boundary.  These services include a small but busy town centr e, a range of 
community facilities  and a significant hectarage of natural space, including the  largest remaining 
area of wildwood in the country, Hockley Woods. Hockley and Hawkwell are  amongst the least 
deprived neighbourhoods in the entire District with housing availability and affordability a key 
issue in this part of the District. They are  home to a slightly older population than the  local 
average , but their  overall demographic profile is similar to the District as a whole.  
 
As can be seen from the completeness mapping, Hockley and Hawkwell residents benefit from 
generally good walking access to most day -to-day services, with the best levels of access around 
the town centre a nd along Southend Road. The completeness of Hockley and Hawkwell does 
notably drop off along its periphery , however these areas are relatively less densely populated.  
Opportunities to improve completeness include improving the range of services provided wi thin 
the settlement, addressing capacity issues and improving public transport connectivity to rural 
villages in its catchment.

Draf t Vision statement for the Wakerings and Barling  
In 2050 , the Wakerings and Barling should have retained their rural village character and sense 
of relative tranquillity. More services should have developed locally to reduce its reliance on 
neighbouring to wns, whilst any new services introduced should be located so that those located 
on the edges of the settlement are able to access them sustainably. The villages should have 
become more self -sufficient when it comes to homes, jobs and community facilities, including 
education. Development that takes place should be locally -responsive and aimed at meeting the 
ongoing housing and employment needs of local residents.   The Wakerings and Barling  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Wakerings and Barling  consist of a cluster of villages in the far eastern extent of the District. 
The village s stretch  out along two main roads, Little Wakering Road and High Street, with a 
cluster of shops , a primary school and a medical  centre concentrated on Great Wakering high 
street. Outside its centre, the settlement is largely rural in nature and benefits from its tranquil 
setting near the coast with the North Sea. Whilst the settlement  has a good range of  core 
facilities , these onl y serve local residents and most town -scale facilities,  such as a secondary 
school and large -scale job opportunities, are absent. For this reason, the Wakerings and Barling 
are heavily  reliant on nearby Shoeburyness and Rochford town  for some day -to-day services . 
The population of the Wakerings and Barling skew s slightly younger than the District average  
which may generate additional demand for housing and jobs in coming years.  
 
As can be seen from the completeness mapping, the majority of Great Wakering has reasonable 
walking access to day -to-day services. However, walking access  dissipates rapidly towards the 
edges of the wider settlement, particularly within Little Wakering and Barling. Opportunities to 
address completeness in this settlement are both in improving the ra nge of facilities available, 
including making secondary school provision more accessible, and improving sustainable 
connectivity to nearby towns.

Vision statement for Hullbridge  
In 2050 , Hullbridge should have grown its service base to become relatively more self -sufficient 
and accessible by sustainable means, including walking, cycling, river -based and public 
transport. It should have made the most of its location including opening up its coastline as a 
more attractive and usable space for both residents and visitors. Any development that takes 
place should be locally -responsive and aimed at meeting the ongoing housing and employment 
needs o f local residents, including the housing needs of the local older population.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hullbridge  is a large village of around 6,000 residents located to the north -west of the District. It 
sits upon the course of the River Crouch and is home to a range of river -based enterprises and 
activities . The village provides for a range of basic services, including multiple shops, a primary 
school and medi cal centre. It has a relatively tight catchment but provides a  base of services for 
local residents and some outlying villages, including Battlesbridge, and a number of rural 
caravan parks. Hullbridge is itself reliant on towns such as Rayleigh and Hockley  for some 
services, including secondary schools and leisure. Hullbridge has a larger older population than 
the District average that is anticipated to continue to grow over coming years which may place 
demand on particular types of service close at hand.  
 
The completeness mapping shows Hullbrige residents to have reasonably good walking access 
to most services, particularly  to its north where a cluster of services li e, including a  healthcare 
centre and primary school . Walking access  remains relatively good along most of the central 
spine formed by Ferry Road but notably dissipates in to residential areas and along its southern 
edge.  Opportunities to improve completeness are improvin g the  range and  capacity of local 
services, including providing for more job opportunities locally.

Draft Vi sion statement for Canewdon  
In 2050 , Canewdon should have retained its character as a relatively compact and self -sustaining 
village. It should have retained its existing services, including its primary school, and  its 
residents’ access to other s ervices, including healthcare and jobs, should have been improved 
through a combination of improved transport connectivity and service provision. Development 
that has taken place in Canewdon should have been locally -responsive to meet the ongoing 
needs of local residents, including first -time buyers.  Canewdon  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Canewdon  is a relatively isolated village located in the rural north -east of the District. It is a 
relatively compact and self -sustaining village with reasonably good service provision for a 
population of its size, including a village shop and primary school clust ered around its high 
street. These services primary serve residents of the village, but also provide for rural residents in 
surrounding hamlets. Whilst its remoteness is one of its characterising strengths, it does also 
pose challenges in terms of generall y poor connectivity both in terms of transport and digital 
services. Its demographic split largely reflects the District averages.  
 
The walking completeness of Canewdon is reasonably good  with the few services within the 
village being within reasonable wal king distance of most of the village’s residents. However, the 
village is relatively reliant on nearby towns, including Rochford, for a good number of day -to-
day services, including healthcare, secondary education and employment.  Opportunities to 
improve c ompleteness include improving the range of services available locally, restoring lost 
services, particularly healthcare services, and improving sustainable connectivity to nearby 
towns, including Rochford, such as through a more regular bus service.

Draft V ision statement for Great Stambridge  
In 2050 , Great Stambridge should remain an independent village with its own character and 
sense of community. It should benefit from improved accessibility between its homes and 
services and its residents should be able to access the wider services in Rochford town with less 
dependence on the private car. Any development that takes place should be strictly in keeping 
with the character of the village and be of a form and type that responds to the individual needs 
of the village.  Great Stambridge  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Great Stambridge  is a relatively small village located to the east of Rochford town. It is home to 
around 400 residents, although its identifying population is significantly more when including 
rural populations  and residents living on the eastern edge of Rochford tow n. The village 
possesses a good number of facilities for a settlement of its size, including a primary school, 
church and village  hall, however  the layout of the village means that these facilities are outside 
of the walking catchment of most of the village’s residents. Due to its location, less than a mile 
from the eastern edge of Rochford town,  the residents of the village benefit from a combination 
of relative tranquillity  created by th eir detachment from the main urban area and easy access to 
all the services located in the town, including its job opportunities, retail outlets and railway 
station.  
 
As can be seen from the completeness mapping, the centre of population in Great Stambrid ge is 
relatively detached from the services along Stambridge Road and walking to these services is 
likely to be a relatively unattractive proposition to many residents. Opportunities to improve the 
completeness of Great Stambridge are less likely to be foc ussed on the provision of new services 
but on the enhancement of existing services , both in the village and in Rochford town,  and 
improving their accessibility through sustainable means.

Draft Vision statement for Rawreth  
In 2050 , Rawreth should remain a functionally separate village with its own identity and sense of 
community. It should have retained and enhanced its core services and its resident should 
benefit from improved access to thes e by public and sustainable transport. Any development 
that takes place in the village, or nearby, should ensure it takes opportunities to improve the 
access of the village’s residents to wider services, including to address relatively poor sustainable 
access to health, education and public transport services.  Rawreth  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rawreth  is a village located to the west of the District, home to approximately 600 residents. It is 
located approximately halfway between the larger towns of Rayleigh and Wickford (located in 
Basildon Borough). Rawreth has a relatively good supply of services fo r a village of its 
population, including open space, a nursery and village hall, whilst it has reasonably good access 
to services in those towns . The village is well -located for accessing the strategic road network, 
with the main village envelope being loc ated between the routes of the A130 and A1245, with 
nearby access to the A129 and A127. However, sustainable transport provision is relatively more 
limited, with residents of the village much more reliant on nearby towns for train and bus 
services.  
Rawreth has a reasonable degree of completeness for its population however there may be 
opportunities to improve connectivity to nearby towns through sustainable methods, such as 
more regular bus ser vices and new cycling and walking routes . A significant amount of land is 
being promoted near Rawreth, b oth adjacent to and beyond the existing  village. An area to the 
south of the village is also  identified as being a strategic growth option earlier in this paper. 
Whilst it is unlikely that this growth area, if taken forward, would a djoin  Rawreth village itself, it 
may be able to help to improve the completeness of the village by providing new services 
nearby, includin g retail services, job opportunities and new public transport connections.

Draft V ision statement for Paglesham  
In 2050 , Paglesha m should remain a tranquil and rural cluster of hamlets with the historic areas 
of Churchend and Eastend having been immaculately conserved. It should have retained its core 
services, including its public house and open space, whilst its resident should be nefit from 
improved sustainable access to the services in nearby towns and villages. It should also have 
become a focal point for managed public access to the rural coast. Any development that takes 
place should be very small scale and in -keeping with the historic, rural character of the hamlets.  Paglesham  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paglesham  is a cluster of hamlets located in the eastern extent of the District. Home to a 
combined 250 residents, Paglesham Churchend and Eastend are historic settlements , both 
covered by a conservation area. They  are relatively remote from any of our key service towns 
and villages  and do not benefit from any services but save for a public house and a small area of 
open space. Paglesham also benefits from its close access to picturesque areas of the coast.  
 
As can seen  from the completeness mapping, Paglesham has relatively poor walki ng access to 
most day -to-day services, both due to the absence of those facilities and the distribution of 
homes  being relatively dispersed over a wide area.  Due to its low population, it i s relatively 
unlikely that its completeness could be improved without a significant amount of new 
development, which itself is unlikely to be appropriate given its relatively remote location and 
large areas at risk of flooding. Nevertheless, there may be o pportunities through the plan to 
improve the completeness of Paglesham through rural service models and improved 
sustainable access to nearby villages and towns, such as a more frequent bus service.

Draft V ision statement for Stonebridge and Sutton  
In 2050, Stonebridge and Sutton should still be recognisable places of their own right, however 
residents of these places should have greater access to services close at hand, including by 
sustainable means. Any development that takes place in the areas aroun d Stonebridge and 
Sutton should respect and take inspiration from the individual rural and low -density character of 
these settlements.  Stonebridge  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stonebridge and Sutton  are some of a number of sparsely populat ed hamlets located  within a 
large and relatively open tranche of land  to the east of Rochford town and north of the 
Southend urban area. There are very few services provided in this area and a majority of the land 
in this area is given over to agriculture. The largest area of continuous settlement in the area is 
Stonebridge, which extends over the administrative boundary into Southend Borough.  
 
Due to the absence of any services, Stonebridge and Sutton has a very low level of 
completeness, with the only parts of t he area with any walking access to services being those 
parts of Stonebridge nearest to the urban area of Southend. There is a significant amount of 
land being promoted in the area of Stonebridge and Sutton, both adjacent to existing areas of 
settlement  and into the open countryside. This land is identified as a strategic growth option 
earlier in this report. Whilst it is recognised that the vast majority of the land being promoted  in 
this area  is not adjacent to existing communities, the development of areas of  this land would 
provide opportunities to improve the completeness of existing communities  in Stonebridge and 
Sutton  by creating new services, including education, healthcare , retail and jobs, and providing 
an opportunity to improve sustainable connec tivity.

Draft V ision statement for Rural Communities  
In 2050 , our rural communities should have remained rural and the contribution these 
communities make to the character of the District should be safeguarded. The service needs of 
our rural communities should have been supported by an improved network of sustainable 
transport linkages, including in the development of new public transport, walking, cycling and 
equestrian routes. The needs of these communities should also have been taken into account 
when decisions are made about the provision of services in major towns an d villages which rural 
communities are likely to depend on.  Rural Communities  
As recognised elsewhere in this document, Rochford has a unique mix of urban and rural 
environments which is reflected in the fact that over 5,000 of our residents live outside of the 
settlements identified earlier in this section.  
 
These residents mostly live in rural housing beyond the boundary of recognise d settlements. 
This includes small pockets of concentrated housing, including in plotland areas between our 
main towns, and more isolated housing spread out along inter -urban roads. More concentrated 
areas of population exist at Battlesbridge, South Fambri dge, and Foulness Churchend. As these 
settlements have very modest populations, a general absence of services and do not have land 
being promoted nearby, it is generally considered unlikely that opportunities for significant 
change exist in these settlemen ts. The more populated areas of Battlesbridge, in particular, fall 
within the administrative area of Chelmsford City.  
 
As a result, we have chosen not to prepare individual vision statements for these settlements at 
this time. Nevertheless, we think it is important to consider a vision for all of our rural 
communities which can help to guide decisions through the plan that can benefit those not 
living within a recognised Tier 1 -4 settlement.  
 
Our vision statement for Rural Communities is set out below:

Next Steps  
 
The Rochford new Local Plan is still at an early stage and we are grateful to those who give 
feedback at this stage to shape future considerations and decisions.  
 
The feedback provided to this consultation will be reviewed and taken into account when the 
Council makes decisions about the direction and strategy of its new Local Plan. However this w ill 
not be the last opportunity you have to shape the direction of the new Local Plan and further 
consultations are planned.  
 
Once the consultation window has closed, the Council will prepare a feedback report providing a 
summary of the main issues raised and setting out an initial response to these issues. The 
Council will publish this feedback report on its website as soon as possible after the 
consultation.  
 
Interested persons are strongly encouraged to sign up to the Council’s mailing list should  they 
wish to be kept informed of progress on the new Local Plan. The easiest way to be kept up to 
date is by signing up to the Council’s planning alerts at www.rochford.gov.uk/tellmemore
